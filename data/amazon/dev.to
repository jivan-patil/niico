It should. They are the same size and the charging port is in the same place.
Yes, I can but need sound bar mount.
200mm x200mm. Yes Fully extended from wall to TV support is 19 inches From wall to the front of my tv is 24 inches.
Yes, definitely. I bought me a Vizio 42 inch and install it without the extended brackets. Make sure the wall bracket is installed with the stud.
We have our 42" Vizio mounted on it with no problem. Can't say about your specific TV though.
yep
yes. but in my case ..it did pretty good job for 2 week and after that i dont know what happen, the cord socket got loose and now if not fitting in my mac vga port.
Got this answer on the web (See: http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Can_you_download_amazon_books_to_the_nook) The nook will not read Amazon's special AZW format on it's own. There is a great, free program which allows you to organize and convert your ebook library from any format, to any other format. Download Calibre onto your computer and use it to convert Amazon books to the nook friendly EPUB format. http://calibre-ebook.com/
yes, as long as you can download them, meaning their original source allows another download, then you can. Free epubs and epub books from other sellers work fine. You can download epub library books as well. Same same!
Yes, you can load books with the usb cable if they are in pdf or epub format. I do this all the time. Many libraries offer epub format book checkout and there are a ton of free books available at online sites like gutenberg project and the like.
Nook HD is definitely better than the nook color, the processing speed and download speeds are more responsive and images of course are better due to the nature of a HD screen. If you want to upgrade there's always the nook HD+ which i fond is far better and it has SD memory slots for additional storage capacity.
Its 179 on the Barnes and Noble web site as well as Best Buy.
Word and OneNote have Android versions, however they are designed for mobile phone use so the screen might adjust weird. There are a ton of plugin's available to view MS files and edit if you just use the free Google Office products. For OneNote this is the blurb from the Microsoft website: Note There is no Mobile Viewer for OneNote. Instead, install the OneNote app for your iPhone or your Android phone. OneNote Mobile is included on Windows Phone 7 and later versions
If it does I don't know of one.
No, only the one cord for charging in the wall or on a computer. There is no case included. You have to purchase that separately. Amazon has better deals on cases than B&N.
1.5GHz processing speed 1GB RAM I LOVE THIS THING!!!
No
This thing is garbage I'd just return it I had the same problem with mine
No, this particular model is not HD but I use it for reading only and love it!!
If the TV you buy says it is a Google TV, that would indicate that the TV has the apps installed and is internet ready. BTW, the NSZ-GT1 is long discontinued, but newer models are available. You could consider a non Google TV and add a Chromecast fob for $35.00. I have both the Chromecast and the NSZ-GT1 and find myself using the Chromecast almost exclusively.
It doesn't have a dvr. But it has blueray/dvd player. You will need HDMI cables
It worked in my ipod video. Unfortunately it was used (came with someone else's music on it) and later broke.
Looked new. Came in anti-static bag with yellow Static warning sticker as seal. No problems since install. Could not swear it's not refurbished item, but I'm satisfied.
Is your Galaxy Tablet powered by Android software? The Android systems have no drivers to run a CD/DVD player. I hooked this portable player up to a USB adapter and managed to power the player into my tablet but there is no recognition of the device by the tablet. It does not know what the unit is. Perhaps in the future someone will write drivers for this device. Someone else explained to me that the software was written for a phone. Phones do not need CD players. John
Really? Mine came with no disc and I bought a 64 gig. Check out the manual.
I understand that it will work in it fine.
No a psp uses another type of memory card it's a slight thicker and a little bit longer then this one
I use it with my Samsung Galaxy S4 thus I assume its compatible with all androids.
Yes sir.
Not sure about your type of camera but if it has the mini hdmi input then it should work.
Dianne needs to describe what it is she bought,,the photo image is too small to identify,,and What is shared asking Type D,,What,??? It appears to be Hdmi mini,???,,She needs to Contact the Camera Manufacturer and identify what it is she needs to download the camera to computer files,,Cannon have excellent Web Sites that list everyy need,,for interface for example,,Type D,,Type D What,????
Yes, it goes all the way in. It does not stick out. No adapter.
I doubt it, it is not shielded and nor is it specifically fire rated. But it's also not carrying any current so personally I think it's a grey area but if you are concerned about potential fire then get something CL3 Rated for In-wall Installation.
Hello. If everything works without the cassette, its possible the Maxell CD-330 is defective. Look at the heads on the cassete deck, and make sure they are clean. If this continues, contact Amazon for a refund or exchange. They have an excellent return policy! Sorry to hear about your problem. I hope this helps! -G.
You need a new CD player with a line in aux or blue tooth otherwise your phone can communicate with the device. Ive seen something like tuning into a like a radio station with a certain program and getting things transmitted from phone to a stereo that way. At this point you can do away with your cassette input unless you have a cassette player. That cassette player would serve as your auxillary but without it you need the other two things i mentioned.
My husband just tried using it on his BB and it worked. It is not as pointy as the one that comes with the BB but that did not pose any problems.
I had mixed results with this product, but you should only have to run it once in order to clean the the cd eye. Good luck
This disc cleaner works in any home or car stereo that plays cd's, if it is just dust on the lens affecting the playability of your music, this product will help you out
If your electric water urn can be plugged into a 120V outlet, you can use this power cord.
Yes it would
According to the box, it's a yes. This is what it requires. Apple iMac or power MacIntosh computer with built-in USB connection. MAC OS 8.5.1 thru 9.0. Must meet RAM requirements for your operating system. 30 MB HARD DRIVE SPACE RECOMMENDED. 2x CD-ROM drive or higher for software installation.
Yes, there is an on/off switch - actually a button in the center circle.
I have this. Works flawlessly. http://www.amazon.com/EBL%C2%AE-Version-Charger-Rechargeable-Batteries/dp/B00EB7812C/
No. sorry, this camera uses a lithium battery. LP-E8 standard. (Per manual )
It will work with any keyboard that has a headphone socket
yes. As long as it has the same size jack. If not, there are always adapters you can buy at any radio shack or music store to make it work.
If you need a cat five cable for intranet yes
Yes
Yes
It's working fine for me under Windows7; plug and play.
I don't see why not. If your PC recognizes the external drive, you should be ok. The only problem will be format. Your text from the word processor will have to be able to be translated into something your PC can read. If you have a problem, I suggest you give the Geek Squad a call. Tell them you just bought an external 3.5 floppy and you need to know how to download onto your PC. They may have a suggestion.
Hi Daniel M., this Sony Handycam doesn't support file transfer to a computer. It doesn't have any input jack to connect a USB or a Firewire. Only available jacks are A/V output for viewing videos to a TV or VCR. Ely
The unit only has provisions for a external head set. I couldn't find anywhere on the unit or in the manual mentioning external speaker. You maybe able to use a speaker using the head set output. You would need an amp. to boost the power to speaker.
does not work on tinted windows
The original came with two keys. If you have lost both of them did you register them when you bought the lock? If you registered just login to the Kensington website and reorder your replacement keys. If you did not register like you were suppose to than you might want to call them and explain your situation. The problem might not be able to be solved if you did not register you keys as they have a special number just for your lock. Good luck!
If your laptop has a Kensington lock slot (as most do), you should be able to use this product. The lock slot is typically found on either the side or back edge of your laptop. It should be marked with a symbol that resembles a padlock with the letter "K" in it.
It is Volume control only.
Make sure the headband is at its shortest length, then bend the earpieces in.
I haven't really sweat a lot in them. The foam is pretty thin, so I'm a bit worried about how long they'll last in general, but they're replaceable, so probably not a big deal. Sound is good, unless you require monster bass.
It's corded
No there is not.
no
Not sure... I had been trying to get some data off of the exact hard drive from a Seagate External HD and as a last resort for the girl, I had bought this to swap out boards. I wasn't successful but the drive I bought has been a good one. I stuck it in another build. Sorry I couldn't answer your question.
Yes. Plug your existing drop into the WAN port. This will give you 4 connections.( 3 more than what you had)
It's a universal electrical part. Should fit any type of standard installation. Or it can be installed in a J box away from the device.
Relays work through electromechanical coils and you can certainly hear them actuate. Motion sensors work on changes in perceived temperature changes. The signal is then sent to a transducer which changes this energy to an impulse which signals the light to be switched on.
Sounds to me that you may have either a faulty tape or machine. Try switching to a different tape and see if it changes. If not, I'd call dymo directly.
120v only
Yes, I would assume that "protection" is given to all devices plugged into the strip reguardless of whether the strip is on or off (given that the MP AV800 itself is plugged in). Also an audible signal/tone is emitted when the unit has detected an interuption of power and/or surge in current. For further info, I'd contact Monster Cable @ monstercable.com or 1-877-800-8989 (customer service/warranty hotline). Hope this helps.....j711bird
The 1st generation etrex can't. It has an old serial port. However the current models of etrex use a USB. So if you have a USB charger in your car then YES you can!
No, but you can download and upload storage from your P.C. (only 50 points - No maps). Very basic GPS
Honestly, I never even opened the package. It was going to be a gift for my son and he couldn't use it. You can have it if you want it. What city do you live in?
Karen, I'm pretty sure it has a 6 month warranty.
The Landel company, which makes the Mailbug, could answer that. Their customer support number is 1-800-855-MAILbUG. Even though I didn't purchase the Mailbug directly through them, they have always been helpful when I've called.
Yes it is 100% compatible with the K1000
this camera IS NOT adjustable for anything other than selecting modes and the flash, I found this dissapointing with this. The one and only manual adjustment is to override the autofocus otherwise a very good camera
Yes
07/2013. Develop by July, 2013
It isn't leakage if it's part of the design. Open headphones sound better, but they are not designed for privacy. They are designed to let some sound out.
Very nice and light weight. Husband and I both bought them and we love how easy they are to use.
Yes, they would work very well for concerts. However, you must remember that they are full sized and therefore would not fit in your pocket or a standard size purse. They come with their own case.
I was curious myself, so this is what I found on "Wikipedia" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EF_75-300mm_lens It looks as though there's not much difference. The "II" minimum aperture is f/45. The "III" minimum aperture is f/32 to f/45. Neither model have "IS" (Image Stabilizer) nor "USM" (Ultra Sonic Motor) which is fine for me, because I almost always use a tripod with any telephoto lens
3.2 x 6 x 7.6, and 41.6 oz. Like I said, they're pretty useless without some form of support.
Accepts 58mm Filters & Lens Hoods
This is a CB radio. CB radios do not use frequencies like that. They literally just use channels #1-40
I bought an adapter to be able to use it with a cb antenna on my UTV. It definitely helps with reception and transmit distance.
The flash comes with a sync cord with the standard flash sync connection on one end which would connect to the "Flash" terminal on the Pocket Wizard Plus II when being used as a receiver to activate the Vivitar 285HV.
It will be okay, they are very good film, still have some of mine that I bought a while ago from Amazon.
No, only a headphone jack.
You should have no problem playing standard CDs. CD-Rs or bootleg discs may not play. Contact Sony for more information.
You can play a tape or you can record to a blank tape. Does that answer your question?
Yes, this set has a new back that screws into the GPS (just like the normal one), and the handlebar mount that the new back clips/snaps into.
No, you have to get your own. I made sure to get a really good one, and this radio has been excellent because of the good antenna.
The CB has two wires built in so all you would need is a cigarette lighter socket adapter and wire it up. The wires are about 4' long so you should have no problems where you mount it. The wiring is very easy - that's the set up I have so I can unplug and remove the CB when I'm just driving around locally.
Not even a little bit.
I was bale to enclose one power cable cord and a LAN/ethernet cable. You can say two ethernet cords or two power cable cords can fit in snugly. That should be it. You may find it difficult snapping on the cover for any more cables. They should make it wider to receive more than two cables.
Yes, the inner parts are fine and you can add or remove padded velcor separators. I wouldnt check it as baggage though.
It does rotate. It rotates all the way around.
yes, i use it with that lens. you will need a 67mm adapter ring to attach flash to lens.
yes, it did
Why yes it will. It is a great remote!
I'm not sure about the T5i, but I have a T2i and it works like a charm. I'd find it hard to believe that the two camera bodies are so different that this remote won't work with the T5i.
No, it can only be used as an "On Camera" flash, or "Off Camera" using a remote cord. It does NOT have remote "Slave" capability.
In case you haven't yet found your answer, the 430EX (nor the 430EX II) cannot trigger other speedlights (it can't be a master, only a slave). The 580EX II can trigger another 580EX, 430EX, etc.
Call Canon Support Line at: (800) 652-2666. They can give you accurate answers and advice.
It's to wrap around your waist to use like a fany pack. I don't ever use it, but it could come in handy.
I would say yes! There's a strap that's adjustable that could be over the shoulder or cross body. Plus on the back of the bag you could undo 2 snaps which would then allow you to slide a belt through it and maybe use like a fanny pack. The shoulder strap is removable and then there's always the handle on the top of the bag. Lots of options. As I've said, love the bag, just wish it were slightly bigger. Enjoy Disneyland!
This lens is for close up pictures at relatively short distances. The other is a telephoto lens for taking close ups of larger items at longer distances.
Yes - all canon lenses - EF and EF-S - will fit this camera
Yes, it will fit EOS 300 SLR camera. I have one up for sale if you interest in this lens. Please feel free to ask if you have any questions. Thank you JAL for stop by Tomas_H.
Yes it will.
No. This lens does not have IS
Yes, as long as the T1i acepts the EF canon lens and I believe it should. Excellent lens!
It certainly will. Great speaker selector for the price.
it should no problem, it's not a powered device itself. all this does a split the power you currently have coming from your receiver
All the switch will do is split your left and right stereo channels. You usually would hook it up to main speaker out puts B or zone 2 of a stereo as it needs to have a "stereo signal" not a surround sound signal.
No. And it's minimum focusing distance is not get good. If you want a good and sharp macro lens your going to have to go with a single focal length. Like the tamron 90mm macro lens. Super sharp and can focus on thing only inches from the lens.
Yes I have that model and it is a great lens!!
This would work with one at a time - as in, you'd have to buy two of the 1/4" cables for both auxiliary and microphone. The included splitter only splits for two outputs, not one output and one input. Sorry yo!
The earthing products are more expensive because they will get you more in tune with the cosmic vibrations and facilitate the proper chi energy flow. Just kidding, it's the same thing.
Yes, In any dry climate, static electricity is there and you should take all procautions to protect your equipment. Even worst if you have carpet in your room where your equipment is located.
Hi Nasser. This device doesn't have any compatibility list so as long as you need to open up a computer's hard drive or magnetic media, you can use it. It is demagnetized to reduce the likelihood of damage and allows you to tackle minor electronic maintenance jobs with ease.
Yes, they are.
Takeit easy and pull gently fro the top. They will then Peel off. Opposite to replace them.
No, there is no volume control on these phones.
If you have the right connections on your cable it should work fine. I used my first one on an Avaya phone for several years.
Of course. yes.
Of course. yes.
Yes, no problem, 52mm will fit nicely.
Yes you can...
Let me quote Tiffen (go to their website's FAQ section): "The Tiffen Circular Polarizer is not multicoated at all. We used to carry TMC (Tiffen multicoated) filters but found no significant difference in their light transmission and also that the coating could be easily damaged, resulting in poorer performance. In any case, multicoating is a proprietary process, and we seriously doubt that any lens or filter manufacturer will tell you the exact nature and composition of their coating layers."
For Nikon 17-55 you need 77 mm filter. You can use the same filter for 28-300 as well.
Metal &#128077;
I am a professional photographer and I use the Tiffen polarizer and it works great. My advice to you is while you are learning get the Tiffen polarizer because at the end of the day either one cant promise a great shot thats on you. But I have used the product and it is a big difference when I don't use one.
In general a color conversion (warm or cooling) filter is just that regardless of camera or lens it is placed in front of. I sometimes use it when taking shots of sunsets/sunrises with my D7000. If you want a lens strictly for protection then get the best quality crystal clear lens possible-no distortion or color shift at all. If you are relatively careful a protection lens will not be necessary. Remember you will need one for each size diameter lens you own unless you buy step up/down rings. Most actual lenses are recessed (not all) so scratching it rare.
The two holes spaced 7-1/4" apart.
Hello Judy, I know nothing about your camera but in this case camera is irrelevant. What you will need to know is 1. What size your lens that the filter will mount to is-in this case 58mm? Does your lens allow the filter to even screw on or have a way to attach itself. Cheers.
It depends on the diameter of the lens where the threads are for attaching filters. I'd guess that a zoom of that size has a larger diameter than the 58mm filter. You could measure the diameter, but the most foolproof way is to take it to a store and find a filter that fits.

Not sure what the real question is. A 55-300 is 58mm and the filter in question is 58mm-yes those can go together. The camera is immaterial.
Yes you can...
According to Tiffen's product brochure their manufacturing "...process entails permanently laminating the filter material in between two pieces of optical glass ..."
No, the 24-105 will take a 77mm filter. I actually have a tiffen filter on my 24-105, it works fine, but you will get ghosting, or lens flare from time to time, just watch how closely you shoot to any lights and you will be fine.
Yes sir. http://www.tiffen.com/canon_lens_to_filter_chart.html
I could not find the size in mm that I needed for my Nikon 3200 so I looked in the instruction book and found what size each lens needed. Try to look it up because these protection filters are a must. I dropped my Nikon D90 and the only thing that shattered was the protection filter. The expensive lens was saved with not a scratch on it.
The answer to this is yes it does screw onto the front of your lens. I apology for lacking that detail.
I have never owned an Olympus camera, but if you buy a filter with the correct diameter I can't see why it shouldn't mount on the lens
Either Google it or look in the manual that came with your lens. Sorry, that's all I got.
Sorry do not know how it would work with a digital camcorder. I only use a DSLR and rarely use movie mode. The ND works very well with decreased shutter speeds on my DSLR for effects such as blurring the running water on streams and to cut down the glare on sunny days. I also use a CP (circular polarizer) filter for glare control.

Yes.
These filters are threaded Male by female, so one end has 52mm male threads (camera lens side), and the other end is 52mm female threads ( so you can stack another filter in front for special effects)
No
Yes, it is. Good quality, too.
don't buy this uncoated filter. ghosts. I bought it, never used it, never bother to return to amazon.

More than likely not (depending upon the color). But try the color filter out and determine if you need the other one.
The Canon camera I am using with this lens is the Canon EOS Rebel XTI and lens works fine. You should be able to google the use of this lens with the Canon body and see the reviews. I have enjoyed the lens.
Yes it is, it screws right on the front of lens. Just don't tighten too much because it will be hard to remove
More than likely it will. If you locate this lens on Amazon, it will show you which camers's will work with this lens.
It should work but you may lose imaging around the frame.
Yes. It has an input for both a mic and headphones
Ntsc
I don't have a remote with my camera.
I'm not familiar with your camera... I'm using it on video camera with a 72mm diameter lens, so I had to get a 72mm to 58mm step-down ring to attach it. This could cause some vignetting on wide shots, but for my application this was not a problem.
This piece screws onto a 58mm lens so if the lens fits your rebel you are all set. I personally used the 52mm lens which I screwed onto my 50mm prime lens
I don't think you would. My point-and-shoot Canon takes great close-up photos in macro mode. I need one of these, however, for my DSLR camera, where you would attach a macro lens for close-up pics.
No
Check to see if holes line up than yea you can use it
Cord and connectors are Rated at 10 Amps at 120 Volts so Max Watts is 1200. So you should be fine.
Yes. it should provide clean enough power.
It can with ease, but I would advise not doing so, since this power strip has no surge protection.
No it does not, it's just a strip with a on/off switch and a circuit breaker. I run mine off a APC smart ups unit and SurgeX noise/surge suppressor connected to the mains
I agree with the previous responder. The 1110 watt load is marginal for the unit. I would use the 1800 watt unit.
You'll need to contact Trip Lite and get the device that is rated for your voltage requirements
The thread on the back is 28mm so it would only fit a Nikon V1 with a step ring from the diameter of the lens on the Nikon V1 down to 28mm. As an example if the lens on the V1 had a cap/filter thread size of 43mm, then it would require a step-down ring of 43mm-28mm. Then chances are the smaller diameter on the back of this lens would cause a vignette, and the corners of your image would be dark.
either the 200 2.8L or 70-200 2.8L are excellent for that purpose. They are significantly better than the lenses you own. In that focal length they are top of the line.
It really depends on how steady your hands are. Is it needed? No. Is it desirable if you follow the rule to tripod any lens and camera combination (without IS) where the shutter speed is lower than the focal length of the lens? Then the answer is yes. (125th / sec shutter speed is "lower" than the 200mm focal length = use with a tripod vs. 250th / sec shutter speed is "higher" than the 200mm focal length = no tripod is necessary)
I also bought them at Target years ago for the same amount you did. I just checked amazon one day and they had the radio for 30.00 keep trying
Yes, it will work. I have a Duxtop induction cooktop and it works just fine. This is an extremely little pan, however. Great for a meal for one or two, but not a family. Pan is probably only 8 inches across at the bottom.
This GPSr came with a serial, not usb, cord, so I had to purchase a serial to usb converter (Keyspan by Tripp Lite USA-19HS High-Speed USB Serial Adapter). I had to purchase a 12 volt car converter( Garmin Vehicle DC Power Adapter for eTrex and Geko 010-10203-00) . After all these years this (now discontinued by Garmin) GPSr still works well. I use it as my backup unit. Good luck! See ya'
I haven't but the winder itself is a great tool. Keeps things nice and tidy. Very easy to transport and is a snap to real the extension cord back in!
I am using for learning spanish with Rosetta Stone, where it grades your ability to speak the language correctly. It works much better that the unit that came with the software.
Hi, its 49mm filter thread and it rotates when zooming. It is manual focus but has contacts for aperture control in camera ("A" in the name) , it is lightweight and more thin than modern lenses. Nice glass for its price.
yes
You can set it up manually depending on the settings from your Internet Service Provider (ISP). You may also secure or leave the network open for public usage. Here's an article that may help: http://kb.linksys.com/Linksys/ukp.aspx?vw=1&docid=83217d7598ad44d68d9cc60f1cea9887_Different_ways_in_setting_up_your_Linksys_wireless_router.xml&pid=80&respid=0&snid=3&dispid=0&cpage=search

Both sides lie flat when opened in the middle.
I was never able to do that. I got locked out of it when it wouldn't respond to my password so I sent it back.
I cannot help. I was never able to get it sinced with my government computer so had to send it back. I have a very old Palm and it is able to set reminders, so I would think that the PalmOne m500 should have the same ability. Sorry, that's the best I can do.
Yes, a nice leather case. However, it is not hard shell.
Neck strap and padded case also with cleaning cloth
Yes, they work well for any type of viewing in that they are self-adjusting. No need to fiddle with a focusing dial. For people who wear glasses, they can be a little awkward, since they adjust to the viewer's corrected vision, and the rubber cups on mine that supposed to peel back for use with glasses won't stay back. For people who don't wear glasses they should work great.
Does not come with tripod adaptor but will adapt to one
Yes, you can use an AV cable to connect it to the TV
it was nice the only thing missing was a body cap and the cover for the remote connector but the condition was very nice no major defects scratches or otherwise
I don't know all the specifics about Nikon vs Canon, but I would doubt it. Nikon does have a "nifty fifty" for a few more dollars, though. Here is the link:
Yes.

Hi Indychick, Sony CCD-TR818 Camcorder original package contents comes with an AC Adapter, Rechargeable battery, A/V Cable, Shoulder Strap, and Lens Cap. -Vincent
Not if you want Auto-focus. Metering will work.
Yes there is a switch to switch from auto to manual
i know it works with the d7100. the lens' web site says it does work with the d5100. you can check this yourself by going to the lens and picking your camera on the page. also, i remember when i bought these 2 af lenses, i called nikon to make sure.
1. Yes it both works AND fits. The D90 has a motor drive to actuate the older Nikon auto-focus system. And as far as fitting goes: Almost all Nikon lenses fit current Nikon cameras. Nikon does a great job of keeping their system backward compatible.
I do not speak English, I hope to express. I had a camera nikon D80 and now have a nikonD7000 not know if that works with your camera lens.
I recieved the pouch but i do not believe the filter was included
Since the D40 doesn't have in-body focusing motor, you would only be able to use it as a manual focus lens. Also, the effective focal length on your D40 is 122. I have a D300s and a D700. The focus is fast on the D700, slightly slower on the D300s. It is a superb lens, but overkill for a D40. Buy the DX 85 mm f/3.5 or the 85 mm f/1.8 for well less than half the price.
Will perfectly work with D750
yes this lens will work on a d700 and a d300s both those cameras have a motor that will work the AF system. It will not work properly on the lesser models like d5100 or d3200. Just remember there is cropping with those two camera for any lens you use so the effective range is 42-105 2.8. I bought this lens a few month ago and it is way awesome and better in my opinion than the 24-70 2.8
Assuming you are referring to the equivalent when used on a DX body, and that you want to use this lens on a DX body, such as the D7000, the crop factor is actually 1.5. So that means 14x1.5= 21. Thus when compared to a 35mm (FX) sensor this lens works similarly to a 21mm lens.
Please refer the manufactures page for the spec. I can ship to us.
No it does not but don't let that discourage you it's a terrific lens in this price range I use a tripod the best VR you can have
No, not directly any ways as it has a different mount than that of nikon. Try to find if there is a mount adapter.
I would assume so.
Yes, this lens is an FX lens and will work with full frame or cropped frame sensors.
Yes! Works fine!
It will "fit", for sure. I am not sure if this lens has a focus motor. The D5100 does not have a built in focus motor. The lens works perfectly mith my D7000, which does have a built in focus motor. Sorry if I confuse you. BTW, the D5100 is every bit as good as the D7000, minus the bells and whistles.
Of course it does.
No
I have a D90 and it worked fine -----
Yes. I used it on my D90. It is slow in low light and does a lot of searching, but it does fine in good light.
See http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/80400vr.htm and http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/80-400mm.htm They describe respectively the older one which won't autofocus on your d5100 and the new, more expensive one, which will --- diff abt 1k
Yes it will. Here is a link from the kenrockwell.com site. http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d7000.htm Just get it, trust me you won't be sorry. I love mine.
I tested the Amazon compatibility apps for your model of camera and my D90 and it's telling me it doesn't work for both of them. I check on the Nikon website for the spec for your camera and the lens format, it's says they are compatible. FYI - it is a heavy lens. Have a good shopping!
Yes. Fully compatible, both metering and AF.
I do not think there is a time limit. Keiko
I use this player to listen to audio book CD's only. It stops at the end of the CD and does not start automatically again.
I do not why not.
you can not use it with out cutting it you can buy 127film at bhphotovideo on line
It is 18 inches tall. I didn't measure length of coax but it was sufficient to run from the left rear corner of the roof, through the tail gate, under seats, to the CB under the dash in my 2015 Dodge Durango, with a little to spare.
The handset plugs into a pigtail which comes from a small box (2x2x4) The box accepts the 12v power and antenna . If you have limited mounting area , this is a perfect unit. I have a Corvette and I am able to connect the mic radio when I need it and nothing shows otherwise. I belong to a Corvette club and several members have enjoyed this CB over the larger case . The radio works as good as the larger unit.
All c b radio's have the same connection so yes and it is a very good antenna
Yes
I haven't. Target used to carry an equivalent for about $10.00 but no longer available
I just bought mine and I think it sounds great
Yes. It is very easy to use. Good for BASIC documentation and storage. Don't know if it will hold up to today's school work.
These miniature audio CD's. They only hold abut 350megs of data. If you have a video camera you need to burn them on DVD+R or DVD-R to be compatible in today's DVD players. If your video file is .mp4, .flv or something like that that is less than 350megs you will be OK. If you try to copy a movie such as the kind you see in video store they are too small. These CD's are about 3" wide, very small compared to the regular CD. Hope this helps.
Some Amazon sellers use computer programs to compare other sellers' prices. Most of the time it allows sellers to undercut their competitors' prices by a few cents, but it sometimes leads to bizarre "robot price wars." This item is still a bargain, though, when you consider the CNN story about a textbook that was listed for $23 MILLION after some pricing programs got out of control. http://www.cnn.com/2011/TECH/web/04/25/amazon.price.algorithm/
My trackball is perfect
Yes. It will work just fine.
yes, works fine in my camera
It will work with either type of film.
Mine came with a manual. But you might not get one, I'm not %100 on that though.
No, not really. The unit that I have is stable, but if you try to stack another unit on top of it, it will probably make it very unstable. If you need more room, you might want to invest in another model Maxsteel Multimedia Rack that has a CD Capacity 864. That is the next model up from this one.
Unlikely. I wouldn't trust it personally
Yea it is a loud lens unfortunately.
Yes, ours has auto reverse and we don't have problems. Apparently some people do. Here is a link to fix it if you have problems. http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-cure-car-cassette-adapter-quotauto-revers/?ALLSTEPS . We went ahead and bought this since we had a cure if there was a problem but we never had one.
Nope! Just slip it into your tape deck, plug in your music player/iPod/smart phone, and you are good to go!
I used them as rear only I'm sure you could use them as front but normaly you want the front speakers facing you. With that being said I'm sure they would work ok
Hi Brandes, Sony NPFM50 Battery is compatible on the Sony DCRTRV280 Camcorder. -Vincent
I have not seen a NP-QM70 battery so I'm not certain, but looking at the photo of the NP-FM70/QM71 battery I would say that they are not equal. I see that there is a charger that will charge both of them, which means the bases are similar, but the NP-QM70 looks like it is twice as high. I don't think the power output is the same. The NP-FM70/QM71 has 2600 mAh output and the NP-FM50 has a 1300 mAh output.
There are no mounting holes etc. You would have to attach a small shelf to the wall and place the speaker on that.
You need a receiver.
Have I used it with that keyboard? No. But really there should be no issues at all as long as you're using latest drivers. I would say that if you like a wireless keyboard why not go with a wireless mouse?
No...it's like 4.5 inches. Where did you see it was 9.5"?
The VL-a110u is a Sharp 8mm video recorder. I have a Sony TRV37 8mm video recorder and I use the Sony V8-25CLH Head Cleaning Cassette with satisfaction. As the 8mm is a standard format I do not see why this head cleaner should not work on the Sharp 8mm video recorder.
This model plugs in. The other model, which looks cylindrical, runs on a flat round 2030 (I think... trying to remember) battery. When I had this model, it came with a plug in adapter.
Sorry I am not sure
It will work but there is a possibility the auto focus don't.
I have a t3i, and it fits perfectly
I have a Canon T4i and this lens works fine on it...You will be pleased I'm sure!
yes
It does not. The manufacturer of Palm m515 stopped supporting even with windows 7.
As long as the auto focus on your D7000 is still working, it will auto focus using the camera body's focus motor instead of the AF-S lenses that have their own focus motor built in.
I do not think it will. The remote was for older equipment and I could not use it on my DVD player. Had to but one from the store to get what I needed and to be sure it was the correct one.
It's NOT a 2.5 mm stereo plug - these speakers connect to your computer (or whatever) by a standard 3.5 mm stereo plug that's on a cable about 4 feet long built into the right speaker. Trust me, I have three sets of these speakers and I just measured it.
yes as far as I know it is capable but have not had a chance to use... yes rca
I believe it is
There is only one master switch for this power strip. Contrary to other reviews I had no problem hooking up the cables, and found that the horizontal orientation for the plugs and the flat power cord plugf made it ideal for fitting under cabinet and close to the wall. The rather bright PowerLite gives a nice faint ground effects light under a cabinet after all the other lights are turned off in the room. Great price on a really good power strip that was just right for my needs.
You can use either as long as you connect the same on both sides. I use copper colored positive and silver color new always. This way there is no confusion.
Not if you have anything higher than windows xp for an operating system.
It comes with "feet" that I mounted to a piece of plywood so it wouldn't tip. It's in my trunk and I am an aggressive driver! It hasn't tipped or slid at all. It could be a lot prettier but it's not for show! BTW this is a ton nicer than the amplified Bazooka tube I had before. The bass is outstanding and fully adjustable.
1. Set the red POWER SWITCH (on the right side rear) to the PLAYER mode. 2.Press the MENU On/Off button. MENU List will appear. The MENU on/off switch is on the lower left side just above a thumb roll selector wheel. 3.Turn roller up or down to select SPEAKER. Press ENTER. 4. Press MENU switch to OFF. The ROLL switch will control volume. To start the playback press the button on the TOP of the camera that has a "pause/play" symbol on it. It is adjacent to the word "light".. Connecting to a TV set should be intuitive.
It came with software at the time, but this camera came out in 2007. The only way to get one was used and there are better cameras available for cheap.
I've never had any that didn't involve me having spilled drinks into the keyboard. You might want to disassemble it and clean, or if it started when new, it could be a quirk of typing style. I've owned three of these with no issues with key function.
Since my husband is the person who uses the headphones and I am in the same room with him, I can answer that question. There is NO sound leakage that I hear, and I believe that you could feel safe using them anywhere you want, and know that the sound is not being heard by others.
Hi Matt; According to the description, it looks like these phones come with the small end (for computers, iPods, etc), and the adapter is used for connection to a larger plug (for stereo receivers, etc). Thanks, Larry
Yeah they do. When my coworkers talk to me I have to take them off.
Of course, it's a standard 3.5mm jack.
Stephanie, the Rino 120 have a very good radio range. We use ours all the time while hiking in Utah. I would never leave my vehicle without one in the desert.
No, its does not.
no
Please do not order this item, as I had received a JVC camcorder battery for my order. I got my refund as it was their fault, but a waste of time! I think there is some kind of error in the item details on the website.
No it's horrible
It depends on the speed setting on you hand held recorder. If it is set on 2.4, you will get 30 minutes on a side. If it is set on 1.2, you will get 60 minutes on a side. I hope this helps.
30 min per side
Hi Robert! It can reach up to 100 feet.
Hi Geeta, I'm sorry I didn't see this email before. Other than the obvious cosmetic differences, the silver 210 is slightly smaller (the 200 is a little taller and is thicker than the 210). The 200 has a backlit display and a clock, the 210 does not. The 200 has 19 station presets and the 210 has 25 (10 AM and 15 FM). The other features are identical in both units. The only other difference is that the 210 uses AAA batteries and the 200 uses AA. Hope this helps. Rich
it takes panoramic film. the one were you put the film in it and it will rewind it self. you can buy the film in a store that sell's it or you can buy it here on amazon.
No.
Yes, they will. They come with sticky tabs you place on the outside of your monitor to hold them in place. I bought 2 and I use one of my monitors in portrait and one in landscape mode. They even work wether you use the matte finish or shiny side.
The filter comes with two methods to use your filter: 1) adhesive tape to adhere the filter to your screen; 2) tabs that adhere to the frame around the screen. I use the tabs. They allow me to slide the filter behind the tabs to install, then remove it when it is not needed. When the filter is installed with the tabs, it remains secured, even with opening and closing.
Yes. Carrying case & lens covers are included. The lens covers are not attached.
Hi Tasheka. You may use the cable to connect a PS4 to the Sony sound bar. With regard to the projector, we'd like to know the brand and model number so we'll know if it will work. You can send us an email at BelkinCares@belkin.com with the link to this post.
You may need to verify it with your computer manufacturer on how to setup dual monitor. It usually require two graphics cards and a motherboard that supports dual monitor.
I think you just have to try it -- every device is different. If I had your exact O/S and hardware I could check -- but I don't. In general, I have used it in three places and it has always worked. And I have always been sceptical ...
If you are looking to connect your camera to computer, and have this connections sure works for you, just be sure about it!!! Have a great day!
Yes they Do. A card or booklet of 4.75" square fits perfectly with no more than 1/16" thickness.
It worked fine on my laptop which, when I bought the cables, was almost 4 years old.
NO, you can only use it with 2 head phones or 2 speakers or a head phone and a speaker. I never tryed it with a mic but a mic and head phone jack are one in and one out so i dought if you can use it that way.
Is it trying to output 1080p HD? This adapter won't work with 1080p. I had to find this out the hard way. Plus, going through many adapters is not a good idea. I'd recommend buying just an HDMI to VGA adapter.
No admin password is required for setup. This is more like plugging something into an external port like USB and VGA - more convenient though.
It lays flat.
I don't know...I use an Insignia NS-P4112 portable CD player with it, and it works great. Whenever you get an adapter, make sure to check its polarity to plug the adapter into your personal player correctly. Directions for doing so should be included with your personal player. Doing this wrong, could make things not play on your player.
The 'description' of the product gives info regarding that.
I do not own RCA5008. I use this in my BOSS-BR532 digital recorder and it works perfectly.
Yes
Yes
I had no problem hooking mine up
yes, it does.
Sorry, I did use it on a Tamron 18 - 270 mm. It worked perfectly including the AF.
I'm guessing yes. It worked when my 3 yr old nephew touched my lcd tv with his peanut butter and jellied fingers.
I found the work great for me, app. one to one and half apart. There may be a lot on the channel in the area you will be working in which could cut down on the distance.
Not for me, I get about 3 miles in good conditions.
Was available through Amazon.com
I would not buy this thing. Cheap. And it does not work at all.
These speakers require an AMPLIFIER or RECEIVER to operate.
Standard wire
I m not sure, but i think so, it is ok with any type of binoculars
This model is not a new product. It's been around for a decade or more. However, the mouse I received was brand new. It has been a couple of years since I received it, so I don't recall the packaging.
Yes, it does. It is really loud. My parents really like it.
No, just connected to your phone lines
NO, it is dependent on regular phone line jack which of course a cell phone does not have.
I don't know. But it plugs fine in XBOX 360 controller. I don't have a PS4 controller to test, sorry.
I'm not sure. I am using it on my washer and it does great
No it doesn't
it usually does but need to check notes on who purchase from
My Plantronics phone is a T20 and the headset works perfectly. The only issue I can see is the place where it plugs into the phone. My phone has a [female] plugin for the headset that is like a standard phone cord has (male RJ11 moduler plug).
Vivek, the ULTRABLOK's three diagnostic LEDs (line ok, line fault, and protection present) show power and protection status at a glance. The "Line OK" LED verifies that the ULTRABLOK is connected to a properly grounded outlet. The "protection present" LED indicates that surge protection is available. The degree of protection can decline with time depending on the energy it has absorbed; however, if the green "protection present" LED ever goes out, simply return the ULTRABLOK to Tripp Lite for a free replacement.
You may have to scab in the connector from the old fan (solder or wire nuts will work)
No it doesn't come with audio cables. If you're interested, I'm selling mine, as I had to move up to a bigger unit for more computers. It's as good as new, just let me know if you're interested.
Difficult to say as I have only the Star Tech filter. I have been satisfied with its performance. Easy to clean.
From the enclosed installation instructions: Connectors: 6 x 4-pin-LP4-female 2 x small-internal-power 1 x 20-pin-ATX-motherboard-adapter 1 x 4-pin extended ATX power 12V plug and Aux plug for Pentium 4
there is a UL sticker. Near the sticker is a little tag with 1301 on it. It's in a place I can't easily access so I can't get a light on it and read what is molded into the plastic. It's too small to read too.
I am certainly no IT expert, but I think this unit will read any floppy and your computer software does the processing. It is just a floppy drive to be attached to a computer.
no
In order to use this headset, you will need an amplifier for use with headsets and corded telephones for WAH jobs. Depending on the company that you work for, they will supply you with this, or require you purchase one of your own. Jabra also makes an amplifier that you can use with this headset, as well as a few other companies.
This headset should work well with any corded phone with the headset compatible with a 2.5mm jack. In addition, you need to purchase an adapter, model: Jabra 1005143 Netcom Qd to 2.5mm stereo plug. I hope this will help you.
This has three pins with ground and a surge suppressor for a telephone line if anyone still has one of those. It can take 6 regular plugs with leads, but the sockets are too close for transformer/power supply type plugs.
The product dimensions are 9 x 3 x 8 inches and the power prong is in the middle of the unit. You will probably have a challenge using the switch on your wall outlet.
Yes
I shoot live theater which can be very dark and have never had a problem.
I dunno.
my AT PL-50 is in perfect condition after playing it all day for 4 days. No problems whatsoever.
To start, big difference between adapters, voltage & pin size/polarity for starters. I've done a fairly exhaustive search on-line over the years and Sony never actually provided an adapter for this radio. However, they did for the previous model (which I own and use the adapter for this radio) Sony ICF-M350V. Universal has a description of the AC adapter as 4.5 VDC, but nothing else. I'm not near the adapter at the moment, but when I am, I'll post as much info as I can glean from the wall wart I use.
Not good enough for shooting video and wanting it to be perfect...it is a cheap tripod...good for the price but do not try to get the performance of a pro-quality tripod out of this one. It all works. It is a great tripod for the price.
Yes. When you turn it ON you hold the POWER button in UNTIL the 90 minutes shuts off. Now the Radio will stay on until the batteries die.
Yes, there is a switch on the left side of the radio that you can select to use the built-in speaker. If you don't have earphones connected to the radio, an antenna is provided with the radio that you plug into the earphone jack. When you plug your earphones into the radio, the earphone wire serves as an antenna. If you don't have earphones plugged in, you need to use the antenna provided so you can pick-up radio stations.
Sorry I don't have the answer. I use my on an Olympus voice recorder, works excellent!
i wouldn't use it unprotected outside. Has no GFCI or covers for the outlets not in use.
It is 15 amps. I do not know about the 14/3 portion of your question.
No you need a VGA to HDMI converter http://www.amazon.com/SANOXY%C2%AE-Black-Adapter-Converter-Laptop/dp/B007KFVQXI
It's two labels together, so you could peel out the inner part if you wish, or use the whole thing. Up to you.
The center slip is big enough to hold a power strip cord. The 2 outter slips however are not.
the msg from amazon says you are asking about the 24 port ethernet switch, which is 22 x 9 x 4 inches and 4.1 pounds by the product description...i own the 5 port ethernet switch which is 3.9 x 3 x 1.2 inches and 4.5 ounces. hope this helps. A.J.
In no way do I claim to know Pavilion models inside out, but mine has a chip set that max's out at 1gb. If you can't find your manual (and who can?), Google the exact model's specs. That's how I found out my limit.
1 stick
Dimensions (WxL): 2.5 x 6.6 inch / 6.4 x 16.5 cm
Yes, they are compatible with banana plugs. Mine are connected with them.
No. They are wired. But worth the hassle of running the wire!
They resist all kinds of weather, mine have made it though rain, snow and wind and still sound great
It won't fit on the 72mm without a $25 adapter. With the adapter, it works great.
Answer: 1) Yes, you need to multiply the focal length by 1.6 to get the right focal length on a crop. So a 50mm lens would be an 80mm lens on a crop camera and a 50mm on a full frame. 2) The EF-S will work only on crop bodies so if you upgrade to a full frame, you cannot use them.
Yes you can fit EF & EF-S Lenses on your camera
Yes, it is! No problem at all using it.
I don't know but it did NOT work with any of my 20 lenses. I would not buy it unless you find a manual or review that says it works.
To confirm the "fit" of the lens cap to the lens simply look at your filter or thread size for your filter located on the front outer edge of the lens, then simply look at the lens cap number. Such as the LC-52 will fit any lens with a filter or thread size of 52mm. The Nikon lens caps do fit rather well. Much better than other brands of lens caps.
I'm not familiar with the Minolta Maxxum 70, but if your Minolta has an A-Mount, it should work with no problem. Bear in mind that this lens is not designed for full-frame sensors.
Yes. Factory Tech. told me to turn the radio on. Turn down the volume. Then rotate tuning knob from stop to stop for about 3 to 5 minutes. If that doesn't work. The radio needed to be sent into the factory for repair.
Use the 3.5mm jack from pod to back of model one
Superior audio reproduction for mp3 devices especially when compared to "dedicated" external speakers in same price range. I have not had much success with getting a strong radio signal so listen to radio online via mp3 device, its a convoluted way to do it but it works for me as the sound quality is so good.
Yes, holes in back for wall mounting.
You need a modem to feed into the router. Then your computer and game systems are wired to the router.
I don't know why not. I would. I don't have a 35mm camera any more but I use them to wipe our binoculars. You might want to ask your local camera shop but I don't see why not. As far as I know there's nothing abrasive about it or I wouldn't us it on my plastic sunglass lenses.
I cannot post links to websites here amazon will censor it . But if you go to the sony website and look for manuals , type in the model number and it should take you to a free download . good luck ! Just in case amazon doesn't censor the link here it is. http://esupport.sony.com/US/p/model-home.pl?mdl=ICFSW7600GR&LOC=3#/manualsTab
I did not receive any remote. It may be available in newer model.
Hello David, I am not a seller. I do not sell batteries.
The batteries that came in that package are #53615, 650mAh NiCad. It will work in the MR350R, but I don't even see a model MU350R listed. Go to Motorola batteries at: http://wwww.factoryoutletstore.com/details/53048/motorola-53615-search-map-single-pack.html?category_id=31423. The #53615 Recargeable set is a very good buy with the 2 Motorola batteries and charger. Regrards, Steve
NiMH is what I've received each time, and I've bought 30 of these
I cannot answer you this question because i bought this product for my son, sorry.
Yes, it's granddaughters and she is happy with it I got it for her for Christmas a couple years ago-sorry it took a while to answer, I had to get ahold of her
No, this camera does not record video.
For Explorer (All Models) 1995-2004, that is what is fits. So, Yes it will fit your Explorer.. :)
My experience is that the distances are stated very conservatively and you probably will not need a booster, but if you still needed more signal a booster would work.
There is more to it than just joining the two antenna using a splitter in reverse.They are indeed canceling each other out. You would need to research the frequency the stations you are trying to receive and install appropriate notch filters for each in theory. Your A/B switch is probably more cost effective and simple solution.
I dont know, but in Russia radio working well. Attention, this radio does not have FM!!! Only AM!!!

No
No
Hard wired.
Hi Susan, yes this CB does have the typical jack for an external speaker. output only. that is, you can add an external speaker. I hope this answers your question.
sorry the 25 ltd does not have weather channels
No it doesn't. Sony has labelled this "Walkman", but the name is a general term for Sony consumer product that are portable. This SRF59 is an earbuds/headphone only AM/FM stereo receiver.
I do not put mine in my pocket. I clip it on to what I am wearing. Love this radio. Great item for the price. It has always stayed on the station I put it on.
Hi Franklin, my listing clearly indicate that there is 30 days warranty with it, I can extend the warranty to six month for $120.00 extra. Let me know and I will email you how we can do that. Take care, Norman. 310-968 0555 east coast
Yes
Yes, it fits the Bose cubes. And if you have the white ones like I do, they are easily painted to blend in with the speakers.
According to the energy website, the rc micro satellite speakers have 1/4"-20 holes. Omnimount 5.0 W/C (5 lb) has a screw that accomodates thread size 4mm or 5mm. The Omnimount 10.0 W/C (10 lb) has the most common speaker thread size of 1/4"-20 (and includes 5mm adapter).
Never tried...Don't know Sorry....I know it reads CF cards with adapter, but that's all....
Yes they will.
Yes, it fits the Bose cubes. And if you have the white ones like I do, they are easily painted to blend in with the speakers.
The ipad does not have an optical out, so this cable will knot work for you. :( sorry!
nope
2U is correct, although it is a bit (very tiny bit) out of spec, so if you sandwich it between two 1U units (that go edge-to-edge) you might have some issues.
Have no idea what a 4 SEj is. explain..describe the size?
I just received mind and ended up with v3. Anyone know the difference?
No slot in the back, but they do have a threaded barrel for a screw mount.
Sure can and that is exactly what I bought them for. Audio books and Slacker Radio sound great -- you will love them!!
Yes, I have. You have to be very careful removing/loosening the speaker portion from the headset. This will allow you to slide the old cushions out and put the new cushions on. It's a pain in the arse but it's worth it once it's done.
There was no question in this query, so I don't know how to respond.
Yes
it should if the lens fits it will
Unfortunately they do not, but it's a thick wire and doesn't look like it's going to break easily. So far so good for me!
1. You shouldn't be using AF at all when shooting video. 2. That's not digital zoom, it's a mode where the camera uses a smaller portion of the sensor. Smaller sensor = more crop.
I've only used this a couple of times but I would say no. This is more for portraits and it makes one object the main focus.
No Joan, it can only charge 4 or 2 batteries at a time. I tried three and the "green light" never flash to indicate that it was charging; plus there is no 3 battery selection at the top - just 2 and 4 batteries. But this is an awesome product, great price and you get a car charger for those long trips for your kids hand-held games; keeps them happy and preoccupied while you drive. It also charges other rechargeable battery brands (Energizer and Duracel)
They go in the ear, but it's not the same as bud. Because the clip is wrapped around your ear, the piece that goes in your ear is gently sitting in the ear, rather than dug in there.
These plug in to my mp3, my I phone 4 and my I phone 5C, my lap top, my desk top and my wife's iPod 3rd gen. Pretty confident they will work. I used to buy these right from Sony, but Amazon price is half. I have 3 pairs for spares. I wear these almost everyday to run, very comfortable and allow you to hear traffic without losing sound quality.
No it doesn't.
Nope! See http://www.nikonusa.com/Nikon-Products/Product/Remote-Cords/4730/ML-L3-Wireless-Remote-Control-%28Infrared%29.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-CompatibleWith
ear pieces are sized in diameter not just model of one company
It's not such a bad idea, but finding the right software to transfer your work can be irritating, that is if if you're not using an SD card. Pretty sure the system can only read up to 2GB as well, but files are generally not too big to worry about filling the card up anytime soon. Also, the files are of a format where you'll have to download a program to read them, and then re-save them in a format which is more pleasant for instance, .doc or .docx for windows. Any other questions let me know!
They are good for mini dv camcorders. Im using in Panasonic mini dv camera. I like it. Quality is good. Its very small tapes to fit in compact movie camera. If your camera says' mini dv camera' on it.
I used this mainly for street photography. I used it with a 60d. I like it because it's a very fast lens. This is also my go-to lens for vacation. I won't be able to give you an honest opinion on Northern lights.
No, this is a highly corrected lens with minimal distortion.
Yes and yes . EF canon lenses fit on both full frame and crop sensors . T3i is a crop sensor camera . Ef-s canon lenses will not fit on full frame cameras (6d, 5d series )
Yes
Probably a standard NIMH recharger. You can buy them for $5 and up -- I have a $40 one. The more expensive ones make your batteries last longer.
Mine did not come with an installation CD. But since I was using Windows XP the drivers were automatically installed.
I think it will. I installed this on my sister's laptop that had Vista
It is possible. You connect each laptop to the wireless (or to the wired interface on the router). Then you have to set up internet connection sharing on the one with the dialup. On a Mac you go System Preferences -&gt; Sharing -&gt; Internet and everything pretty much just goes. I'm not a windows user but if you search "internet connection sharing windows" on Google the first hit should be what you need. Keep in mind you need either wired or wireless ethernet cards for each machine.
Guys, This router will work fine with your ps3. Once configured (it comes with easy to follow instructions on how to set it up) Your playstation will automatically pick up its wireless signal. Or, if you chose not to use the ps3's wireless capabilities, you can just run an ethernet cable from the router to the back of your playstation (this is what i do). Either way it will work fine and you'll be online getting pwnd like a n00b in no time.
I recieved mine on 12/29/2007 and after contacting linksys to aid in the install they advised me that it was version 8. The box has the s/n number as well as some other numbers but no version info.
Hello! Yes, it will work with Motion Computing Le1700, because of the same technology (Wacom Penabled).
Yes they are paper with the a thin plastic circle on front
7 tapes
Now im interest on VHS tape
Just get some wire and connect it to the two the. Two metal places on the flim
Amazon
They don't make new film anymore for Polaroids so you would have to buy old film.
I have both. If you want the best sound then go with the Grado's. If you're concerned about looks and comfort, then go with the Sennheisers. Grado SR 60's definitely sound better and are much louder, but this comes at the expense of looks and comfort. I'd take the Grado's if I were you...
In this context, "supra-aural" means that the headphones lay _on_ your ear--as opposed to cupping around your ear or going in your ear (like earbuds). That makes them the same style as the PX100 model. The W likely means white. Best guess? They differ only by color. That said, the two product descriptions are not much help. One includes dimensions and one does not. One has audio specs and one does not. They weigh the same (one says 60 grams and one says 2.3 ounces--it's like someone intentionally tried to make a comparison as confusing as possible).
It's compatible for Satellite Pro 6000 series, M10/M15 series, Portege 4000 series, Tecra M1, S1, 9000 and TE2000 series. Unfortunately, C885D is not one of them.
No
More than one use. I have used it x3, and it is still good as new. Just keep it in the cover and away from bright sun light and heat.
We used this only to play VCR tapes or DVD's. I don't believe it could record DVD. I think it can record the VCR from the cable box but we never used it. We just record the programs on the DVR for a long time now.
Meaning that only for non commercial use only and not part of business of companies.
Yes
My wife uses this mouse with a Windows 7 desktop PC. She has not had any problems with either right-click or with scrolling in a Word document but scrolling does not work in Windows Explorer, though right-click does.
5.2 x 0.7 x 3.6 inches ; 3.2 ounces These posted dimensions are rather good.
It SHOULD be new unless specifically stated otherwise. However it is best to check with the particular vendor to be sure.
I can get most stations with this antenna near the receiver, though there's a few I can only get if I move it over to the windowsill, so I put a 6-foot extension on it.
From Canon's product support - Solution: The maximum memory card capacity is 2048 GB The maximum card capacity for the Compact Flash Card standard is 2048 GB. You camera model currently supports FAT32 allowing for larger than 2GB capacities to be used.
It will fit because there is one PCI slot on your motherboard. I'm not sure whether your OS would auto detect it, but drivers can be downloaded here: http://www.intel.com/support/network/sb/CS-006120.htm
No strictly a DVD or VCR player. You need a cable box or digital tuner for tv channels.
Most likely as all it does is raise the handset off the 'hook' switch. It will NOT work if the phone is wall mounted as it depends on gravity to keep the handset in place and hang up the phone. The GN1000 plugs into the phone handset jack; the phone handset jack has to plug into the headset cradle; and the phone line plugs into the headset cradle as well.
It did on mine. The antenna is about 9 feet away from my window.
I am sorry, I could not get this to work on my television, so I would not know if it would work anywhere.
The SONY TCM-200DV does not have a jack for an external power source. It is strictly battery-powered (2 AA batteries). However, this recorder seems to use power sparingly as the batteries last a long time. I would suggest after you've used it for a longer period of time to carry extra 2 AA batteries with you in your briefcase, purse, etc.
Yes I use one regularly.
you won't need RCA. The coax cable will transfer the sound.
Hard to believe there's no coaxial input on a TV, but yes this device will serve your purpose
Yes it does include a strap with the package. It's 3/8 inch wide and 41 inches in length, long enough to strap the binoculars and go around your neck comfortably. It also includes a carrying case which also has a strap attached for convenience, a tripod adapter, a cleaning cloth which is sealed for protection plus a manual with some basic instructions.
No. This is the modem only. You will need a router of some sort to have Wi-Fi.
it does not
Yes
No, its 120v
Im no expert however i would set the sub at 12 on both the power and crossover than tweak the sub with your receiver.also check your setup and use the small or large. the large will send a full response to the front and surrounds.just play with different adjustments and decide what you like. also google a link called subwoofer crawl it is very interesting.i did look @ the polks rm95 and i would set them to small than use the 505 to handle the low end.polks are 95 hrz low end so try you crossover @ 120.
They are stereo headphones.
Sony MDR-V150
Sure no problem, it's cheap plastic so be carefull . If you plan to use it often or have kids use it or let people borrow? Buy two!
realizing your post is nearly 6 months old, but i had the same question before purchasing these. I bought two headsets and use them both with the same base. works fantastic....
Yes, I use it on Windows 7 and it works just fine
Yes
These speakers are like any other speakers, just connect the speaker wires to the output on your amp, receiver, etc. They are speakers, nothing more!
NO JUST WATERPROOF CONNECTORS
I could respoder your question, I've never done that test.
I believe so. Mine is 62 (Tarman) & 67 (canon) they all fit perfectly. it is an industry standard.
No
You question "...I was speaking to whether it had noise attenuation like some surge protector/'power conditioners' for musicians - the larger 27 buck strip by this manufacturer does". Now that I understand the question the answer is still no. There are NO specialty plugs for noise, modem, etc. Just 7 electrical outlets...
they do not
This item plugs into your devices headphone jack, the wire is more than sufficient to allow you to connect your device to your belt. The range is determined by your device.
No
Yes it will
You can mount it anywhere there is enough room as long as it's level but if you do not have a 90s radio with control hookup it is worthless.
No remote but my wife loves it anyway.
They fit in the dash of my 82 El Camino, so I am guessing they will fit yours.
i think it will since its a pioneer. if you want to buy it, you can visit our website store at https://squareup.com/market/electronics-discount
I checked it twice for you. It does fit in a 1991 Ford f250. It is a good system. However,once in a while the cassette gets stuck. You have to press the release button again. Nice sound.I love cassettes over cd`s which I also own. Any other questionsmdon`t hesitate to ask. Mine is almosty two years olsd. I had someone put it it at an electronics place. Sincerely, Mark J.Malin
yes, look under your lens cap see the 52mm? thats the filter you need
In the past I have used Hoya filters and found them very satisfactory. I have never compared Hoya and Sigma filters "head-to-head" so I cannot answer your question. I am quite satisfied with the Sigma DG 52mm multi-coated UV filter that I am now using.
I bought mine for a Canon lens, but it should fit Nikon too. There were a couple of reviews posted where the buyer used it on a Nikon lens.
I've had this on the plane with me several times and never had a problem with it being a carry on. It fits under almost all seats on the plane too.
I am 6' 3 252 with wide shoulders. I wear a 3x t shirt and it fits me fine. The only problem I see if she puts more weight in it than she can carry.
it has two straps. it can be worn on both shoulders. go for it. I like the bag very much. using for almost an year now
Yes, mine was brand new. About tax, I don't know...
Yes, it came in the original box.
I used this product to remove years of grime from antique negatives and a few prints. It did remove some adhesive from a black and white print. Could you try it in an inconspicuous area first? You could also ask at a professional photographic store--not a big box photo department--that does specialty processing.
Yes. Usually $100 cheaper during the Christmas holiday.
Yes, it works with just about any size Newtonian reflector telescope, including the 114G.
Yes. It will work with any reflector that takes 1.25 inch eyepieces. I believe that the telescope in question does take 1.25 inch eyepieces.
Yes, the cable should work for the D series cameras
Yes, very well in fact. You will have a 44.8mm field of view with F 1.8. It was a perfect "standard" lens on my 60D. AF was fast and on the money every time and very sharp. Works great on a 6D as well so if you ever move to a full frame camera you have a great fast wide lens.
This lens is made in Taiwan.
The III is very slightly improved over the II and a bit cheaper... It works well but you lose a stop on your lens and on some cameras you lose auto focus...
pre order has opened. shipping in April. suggested retail price is absurd! http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF24-70mm-2-8L-Standard-Zoom/dp/B0076BNK30/ref=sr_1_55?ie=UTF8&qid=1328906482&sr=8-55
hi. Do you plan to shoot more weddings or landscapes...? i think it could be the answer of your question. I think about buying this lens too. i am a wedding photographer, and wedding conditions are always dark light situations. So i need the 2.8 aperture. If you are more a nature photographer, so the 2.8 is not so needed. During wedding the IS can't help too much, because the people that you take are dancing, the low speed will be impossible to use, even with IS on. I hope it will hlep you.
Yes however you just take into account the 1.6 crop factor on the sensor. Your actual depth of field is not f4 but f (4*1.6) and the reach is around 480 mm. Also iso is affected. It takes a lot of conversion to get full frame quality images but its possible
Assuming I've understood you, there are no epaulettes on this item. The shoulders are undecorated.
I think a man's small would work; very nice vest.
It has an elinchrom speedring As d-lite uses standard elinchrom Yes
It does help you focus however you cannot see the entire field unless you flip it up out of the way. So for stationary objects it will help. I have a D90 Nikon. I don't know if it will fit your eyepiece. You should look at the Nikon website.
Hello, this fit a Nikon D5200. I believe it will fit any D series 5000 and above.

Filter weighs 1.6 oz. One ounce = 28.3495231 grams, so the filter weighs (28.3495231 x 1.6) = 45.359237 grams.
I do not have a Canon XF100 Video Camcorder. If it has a 58mm lens with threads on lens so you can screw on a filter than yes this would work. I did a Google search for filters for the XF100 Camcorder and it looks like it should work.
It comes with a huge plastic case, not able to fit easily in a pocket or anything. Good for storage at home only.
I had the 52mm it is 5/16" thick. Oh ! it made in Japan. I did had a few 77mm but not Hoya. Hoya made a good filter but not the best one.
It is not the same as a 52mm. A 67mm fits the threaded end of a 67mm threaded lens. A 52mm fits the end of a 52mm threaded lens. You will need to determine what the size is of the threaded end of your lens if you have a lens that is threaded.
Michael, I do not believe your camera is capable of accepting screw on filters. You should be able to tell when you look at the front of the lens if there are threads or not. It's possible that some company makes a bayonet or push on-type filter, however, I am not aware of any. Hope this helps.
Hoya Standard filters have one layer of anti-reflectant coating to each surface of the glass to suppress reflection and increase light transmission. HMC (Hoya Multi-Coated) have 3 layers of anti-reflectant coatings on each surface to reduce average reflection down to 3.0% or less. Hoya S-HMC (Super HMC) also have 6 layers of anti-reflectant coatings. Finally, the Super HMC PRO 1 is made of thinner glass (only 1mm thick), also with 6 layers of anti-reflectant coatings bonded to each surface of the glass.
This 67mm filter is supposed to be the right size for the 67mm adapter issued by canon for that model. I have not tried it myself to verify that it works.

It will, but I wouldn't rely on it completely just because there are so many voltage output issues with portable gasoline generators. If the generator has a voltage output regulator (or other type of regulator between the generator and the line conditioner) it would be safer. What I recommend is use the generator to power a battery-backup UPS with a built in line conditioner and/or use this line conditioner to regulate the voltage on either side of the UPS. Then when you need to gas up the generator the TV and the Wifi won't crap out.
Many are 77 and many are not. Google the specs.
The filter size for this lens is 58mm. Any filter that size will work with this lens.
The one I bought was a 77mm and it was a "C". I'm pleased with the performance and if you Google around you can find test data where it scored quite nicely. http://www.lenstip.com/113.4-article-UV_filters_test_Description_of_the_results_and_summary.html

The 2 ring stero jack on the Sony headphone appears to be identical to Canri ear buds(2 ring stero) that wil fit an ipod. The jack size is approx 9/16 in length and approximately 1/8 in diameter. The Sony headphones may work if an ipod headphone set will work on your iphone....depends on the input size of your iphone.
Hi, this Sony audio cable connects your camcorder to an AV-equipped TV or VCR. Camcorder should have a 10-pin Audio/Video Remote connection. You may check you Sharp camcorder if it supports 10-pin connectors. -Ely
The large bag holds thirty-five rolls of 35mm film.
Yes it does... I have the same tripod as you do
Yes, the screw is pretty standard with a spring loaded button next to it. I believe it wIll fit almost any female fitting found on optic products. I use this tripod base primarily on Nikon products including 300D and a spotting scope. It fits my vivitar tripod.
The pin doesn't have any effect on what light you put in the bracket. It affects what you are mounting the bracket to. I would say get the one with the pin because it is easily removed if your application does not need it.
Hello there. Mine (02) came in little plastic bags with the Stroboframe Logo on it. But depending on the seller you choose they can send you XXX brand very similar to the original but the quality is obvious is much less desired. It is an excellent product. Very strong and well made. good luck... Aaron...
I run a signal from my dish receiver to a tv in another room and it works just fine. Crystal clear and the remote works too i just have to take the dish remote into the room with me
I have to unplug my wifi router in order to use the Terk. Yes, pain in butt if I want to watch tv in the kitchen. Doesn't matter what channel I select on router to stop any interference it does not work at all.
Why don't you upgrade your camera ?
You have to manually insert each slide. This is not an automatic viewer.
I purchased the Tamrac MX5378 case for my EFS 55-250mm lens. The lens with inverted hood fits perfectly.
The large will fit, but only with the lens shade removed. If you want something to hold it with the shade attached, get the xtra large.
I used mine on my 1998 Silverado. If you ask Best Buy or a radio installer they would know. I asked Best Buy and they helped me. I didn't buy them at Best Buy because they cost 18 dollars each.
I'm not sure about the PH-156Q, but I like the PH-157Q because it's made of metal. I use it for a spotting scope and I move it around quite a bit. The 157-Q stays put where you leave it and there seems to be no play once it's tightened down. I had a cheap plastic mount that I could never tighten down and had too much play in the mechanism. The 157Q is a compact, strong, rugged, and works perfect for my spotting scope, without spending too much money.
yes
It's my understanding it works with all hot shoe equipped cameras. However, Erin does have a web site and s toll free number if you want to verify that. I've had great results with my Nikon D3100. Hope this helps. Lance

I continue to use The Quantaray 70-300 with a K10D and a K100; I'm sure it will work with an istd. I used the nearly identical Sigma 70-300 on my old istd prior to giving it to a friend.
No. You need to find a lab that processes black and white. That will probably be a pro lab.
I use a volt meter to check voltage. It will not confirm that it is new or used but it will tell you if it is charged.
I have bought three of these. They all had a partial charge, enough to operate the phone when received, but they needed to be fully charged. Based on my experience,you would be able to have an active phone as soon as you install the battery.
As it turned out, the phone still did not work after changing the battery. We checked it in another phone and there is nothing wrong with the battery so the phone is no good. I don't know if the battery will fit your phone. We bought another battery before this purchase and although the description said it would work, it did not.
Excellent.
It should, it works perfectly on my Canon 6D. There is no reason to think otherwise.
It's been awhile but I think it is CL2.... but to be sure, I would recommend going over to the Crucial site, and enter the information about your device and see what they recommend. Then you can use their cross reference to make sure the PNY is compatible by part number.
Yes
Yes, it will fit.
No not stable enough
For smaller rooms definite. But outdoors maybe not
They hook up like any other speaker. For the price these are a great value and sound very clear at high volumes.
The low price offered is for a single bic rtr-1530 speaker only.
The outside of the cd is black and looks like a record and the label that is in the middle does have a small area at the bottom with two lines where you can write the title or content of the cd. But you can't write a book. But these cd's are really cool and sound great. I love them, I have bought many for my cd collection.
Yes, according to the outer packaging. Actually, Verbatim is a Japanese company (Mitsubishi Kagaku Media)....Don't let this dissuade you...I've been using them for years and the are still as clear as when I recorded them, nor are the "media" itself deteriorating.
They focus with each eye piece. There is no center focus. I like this way since my eyes are different. Focus is easy and the lens are very clear and sharp. The compass is very good but my compass light never did work, no big deal
so long as it is 1.25 inch diameter. it is celestron brand after all. It will actually work with any 1.25 inch eyetube from almost any telescope.
yes the ring with the lens element does screw into the filter thread at the bottom of the Celestron lenses and any others I have that were same thread. Park lens did not have same thread.
I think this one would be better. #93640 is more generic for any telescope with 1.25" accessories (you would mount it into the star diagonal or eyepiece holder. While this one screws on directly to the SCT. I used it on both the 8SE and the C9.25 so I'm not sure 100% it will work on the 6".
The Manfrotto quick release plate doesn't weight that much. Although it says the shipping weight is 5 lbs, which I assume they are including the weight of the box and stuff they throw inside to cushion the quick release, it still doesn't reach 5 lbs.
Yes you can take instant shots. Delayed timing and intervals are additional features actually
This will not work on any of the xxxD models. It will work on the 5D Classic and most of the xxD models (30D, 40D, 50D, etc.)
Yes it will
It should work with no problem. I used it on my Rebel T1i. When you remove your current lens, is there a red dot on the faceplate? That indicates the 180mm lens will work. Also, all functions will work with this lens (auto focus, depth-of-field preview, etc.).
Neither the Canon EF Extender 1.4x or 2x will work with that lens. They work only with L primes of 135mm and longer, and the 70-200mm and 100-400mm zooms. The Extenders will not mount the 24-70mm f/2.8L, are you could damage the lens by trying. There are extenders from other companies such as Sigma and Tamron that may work with the 24-70mm f/2.8L, but you may find the image quality disappointing.
2x does not auto focus plus you need heave duty lens to make this work this is not a lens but a lens extension good if you got 70-200 otherwise no do not buy this is for pros it is NOT A LENS
I don't know what is 70x300, but the chart is here: www.bhphotovideo.com/FrameWork/charts/canon2xExtender.html They say the new model is sharper, but I haven't seen any proof of that.
this reducer is a 2 inch hope that helps
No
Sorry I don't understand the question
It is made to work with telephoto lenses so it would presumably work with the 200mm end of your zoom. Not sure if it would work with the 85mm. That might be too short but, again, not sure.
Yes, if it has a filter thread that is 77mm.
Made in China
Yes, the connectors on the Terk AM/FM antenna will connect to the Sony HCZD-ZX66i just fine.
I actually have 2 connected and I can't tell a difference. It still sounds good actually. Unless your an audio connoisseur, then you might be able to tell a difference but I certainly can't. Hope this helps. They may sell a longer one too though.
Absolutely, yes. That is all we use them for.
Yes, it comes with a soft case.
Each eyepiece is focused individually
No compass great binoculars though
they are about 7" high and when fully open 8" wide at the largest lens area
Yes these should work great for you , my sons has glasses and uses them all the time hunting.
Used mine once so far for a play. Didn't have that experience.
Yes that is the camera I use this lens on
The answer is no. The S3000 cable is a UC-E1
NO. Do not buy this product. It does not work.
The paper bonding of the cover to the spine should hold up okay. My guess is that the vinyl sheets will be destroyed before the binder itself has a problem. I'd order some more up front and plan to replace some.
I've never tried the "Platronics 478", so I can't directly answer your question, but consider this- The basics of making audio speakers and microphones hasn't significantly changed in the last 50 years. The only thing that really changes is the marketing. Decide for yourself.
Yes. As Gary H has commented the only difference is the USM.
Yes. I am using the the hood on that lens.
it is completely black after removing the stickers
I can't speak for all of them, but my rolls were 2015
Yes, it can.
Just to see if they work, try using them individually and see what happens. The only concern I'd have is foreign material getting inside the jack holes and messing up the connections or that the prongs on the outside are perfectly intact. If they work for an entire day, you're in business I'd say; otherwise, these are not very expensive to purchase. Good Luck!
Mary, you do not have to register your TLP1008TELTV to validate the warranty. If you ever experience any issues, just call our Chicago-based Tech Support Team at (773)869-1234 and they will assist you with troubleshooting steps and/or warranty services.
The simple answer is NO. 10A X 120V = 1200 Watts. This unit is rated at ~400W? Assuming only 90% efficiency of most inverters, you want one that is rated at 1200+10%+ another 20% for good measure. As a practical matter and since the price of these has come down significantly in recent years due to advances in the technology, I suggest doubling your base requirement. IOW, buy a 2400Watt inverter. IMPORTANT! Your 10Amp pump will 'pull' about 100A+! from your DC source. You would need a substantial battery bank for that.
Three stops of light for an ND8
This was a gift for my father who is an avid photographer. I passed your question along to him and he said: A lens filter fits on a lens not on a particular camera (the T3i is a camera). This will fit on any lens that is threaded to accept a 52mm lens filter. Does not matter what camera the filter is on.
Same thing. Actually the ND8 reduces 3 stops of light, and it's the most common ND filter purchased.
I don't know,probably not. 50mm 1.4 lens needs 58mm filter size
This is an Infra-Red filter. It filters out all visible light so that the only thing the camera sees is the invisible to the human eye, infra-red wavelengths. You could use this on Black & White, or Color infra-red film, if you have any. I'm pretty sure that no one makes infra-red film anymore though, so you might have a problem there.
Three stops of light for an ND8
This lens requires a 58mm filter size but the correct size will certainly fit. The filter seems to be truly neutral and allows a much slower shutter or larger aperture in bright conditions.
I do not have a Canon XF100 Video Camcorder. If it has a 58mm lens with threads on lens so you can screw on a filter than yes this would work. I did a Google search for filters for the XF100 Camcorder and it looks like it should work.
Case, hood, and cover.
Yes it is. Any telescope with a open space of 2 1/2" x 8 1/2" will work. I highly recommend.
Amazon should stock these? Otherwise try B&H or Adrama for good search engines and descriptions.
About 10cm x 9cm x 2cm
Seems to work fine with my PMAX 160 as a replacement transducer, although I have not had it in the water yet.... just hooked it up and tested it to see if it was recognized by the fathometer, and it was, so I have no idea of it's in-water capabilities compared to the original.
It's about 7-10 feet I believe, so it is long enough to move a bit away from your rj11 jack's location. :-)
They merely serve to distinguish it from the double-barreled microphone, the Azden SGM2X.
The threading is smaller than the universal thread for typical mounts. Besides using an adapter (which may be pretty difficult to come by), it will not fit. Best to use a Firestick in my opinion.
approx 3 1/2 inches. I have mine right in front of my windshield, on the vent, which is metal on mine. Most put on the roof, or hood.
The antenna is 28" tall and the cable is 16' long
I just viewed the ad and it appears that you need the adapter for use with a handheld CB radio.. Swede NA7SL
i do not know, but it should be able to be upgraded.
I buy one but is useless. Not work.
Yes
This works good with 6 or 8 wire "flat" phone cable. I wouldn't get it if you have round telephone cable that you're splicing together with connectors. There are probably other pliers out there that are better.
Although I am not an expert on Macs, I checked over the specs for your computer and it looks like this RAM will work just fine in your iMac!
Yes, this is the proper memory for the Emachine model T6524. You can check the specs on crucial.com on the emachine site.
This should not be happening. The very construction of softbox prevent that from happening. Make sure all the fiber glass ribs on the inside are attached. Once you attach the diffuser panel you shouldn't be able to tell its an umbrella.
I used Alien Bee's with them for lighting. It does not come with a stand. So you will need both lights and a stand.
Hi muhmee, Please send us more details about your concern at socialsupport@am.sony.com, give us your contact details and the exact model number of your unit so that we can assist you further. Thanks. &gt;Joffrey
Filter weighs 1.6 oz. One ounce = 28.3495231 grams, so the filter weighs (28.3495231 x 1.6) = 45.359237 grams.
The filter size for this lens is 58mm. Any filter that size will work with this lens.
I wouldn't. The fan is very weak and probably wouldn't put out enough air for what you're trying to do.
I believe that this cord reel would work very well for storing strings of mini Christmas lights, actually. You could probably even use it for strings of lights with the larger C9 bulbs, but it would probably very easily handle the mini lights or LED light strings. Depending upon the length of the light string, you could probably store several, or at least a few, strings on a single cord reel, if you plug the light strings in end-to-end to make a long continuous string.
Storing a garden hose would be tough if not impossible due to the size of the thichness of the hose hose; check with your hardware store to see if they have a traveling reel... or purchase one of the shrinking hoses you see advertised on TV...
There is no provision made for this, no brackets or holes, etc. However, I did mount mine on hooks, just sort of hung it up on them on the tubular part of the base. The hooks are those screw-in types used for hanging up garden tools, etc. If you wanted to get fancy you could make a swiveling base, attach that to the wall and then the reel to the base.
I went online to the manufacturer but it was many years ago and I'm not sure it is still supported on any sites. Sorry I'm not much help.
as long as you have a pci slot on your board. this has worked flawlessly for me for years now. true 2.0 speed.
The filter is a polarizer only.
Filters are generic. Any filter can work on any lens, as long as the size (mm) match, so this filter is compatible with any 58mm lens. Filters themselves vary in quality between makers; B+W are among the best, if not the actual best out there.
I use the standard "pinch/spring" lens cap that comes with the Canon lenses, and this lens cap can be used when the filter is attached to the lens.
The Canon EF-S 55-250mm f4-5.6 IS lens requires a 58mm filter mount. The B+W Kaesemann Polarizer filter is 58mm so the answer to you "specific" question is yes. However my experience with this "high priced" palorizer filter is that it cuts down available light by 2-2 1/2 f-stops which I find objectionable.
I've noticed absolutely no difference in autofocus time. Also, the glass appears so much more clear to me than the cheaper brands. I'm guessing that's partially due to the coatings they use. Anyway, you should be very pleased.
It would certainly work if what you are looking for is a more inconspicuous strap than your traditional black/yellow Nikon strap, but you should consider the weight of the substantial 7100 distributed over a relatively smaller area of your neck or shoulder due to the somewhat thinner profile of this strap. The difference isn't huge, but worth considering.
I looped the ends through the triangle connectors that came with the x100s.
I don't have a d5300 so don't know for sure...but it works great on both my Nikon D50 and D7000 so I am guessing it will. Great strap, btw. Good luck.
No, I do not have them .
I have 77 mm filters so can't help with 67 mm.
Canon makes two 100mm Macro lenses. The L series lens is the f/2.8 L IS USM with a filter size of 67mm. The non-L Series lens is the f/2.8 USM with a filter size of 58mm.
The Canon EF-S 18-55 IS STM lens has a filter diameter of 58mm.
this super 8 film will not work in the revere 8 model 50, which used 8mm film [not super 8mm]. im not sure if you can get 8mm film anymore, but super 8 is a great alternative, and the cameras are easy to find. the main difference between super 8 and 8mm is the spacing and size of the sprocket holes which advance the film. super 8 comes in a squarish cartridge - like the size of the box. 8mm comes on spools, and is the older of the 2 formats.
8.75" (x 2.75")
No. As soon as you turn the power switch to on the RA motor begins to function.
no it is not included - you have to buy it yourself.
It's for Fuji Instax, not Polaroid. There are only two sizes of Fuji Instax cameras/film - Mini and Wide. This is for Mini cameras like the 7s, 50s, 25... Polaroid does actually have two short-lived cameras from a partnership with Fuji, that are rebranded Fuji Minis - the 300 and Mio. These will also accept the Fuji Mini film.
hi, yes it does
Nope. It ejects immediately after you snap a photo.
Yes! The quality is not amazing, however its perfect size and I love the original filter. You won't be disappointed. :) I used it for my wedding instead of a photo booth and everyone loved it
Its pretty quick- 20 seconds?
No, the 10-18mm lens is a 67mm lens as the hood is 77mm
At present, I have my Canon 30D w/ 28-35 macro IS lens, 30+ filters, flash attachment and diffusers, 2 extra lenses, remote trigger, Canon HF11 camcorder w/ spare batteries, laptop, GoPro Hero 3 with additional cases, attachments and spare batteries, software, a collapsible tripod strapped to the front bottom of the case, chargers for all the batteries and there is still plenty of room to spare. The bag is pretty heavy now and travels well. Hope this helps.
I do not know anything about that Sony model.
This photo is only the adapter. The actual memory slides into it. Memory can be anywhere from 128K to 16 megs. It is for the older Sony CyberShot cameras.
"Hi, 20 kgs."
Mine arrived on its original box
There is no cartridge included.
Just turn the knob on the top
Yes! It has one on the upper right corner of keyboard , it's part of the 10-key number pad on the right side of this keyboard.
The main difference is the Razer has one more bank of five keys, and the software stores your settings in the cloud. I find it very much better than the nostromo, even though I have 2 nostromos.
No. It is three-pronged. Which means it is a grounded plug. The third prong is for safety If you use it with an adapter, it will disable the. circuit protection and safety feature if an electrical surge comes through.
yes you can find a power supply on Amazon. Just go to Amazon under electronics Dept. and do a search for Power supply for crosley CR49-TA Price is $13.99
an AC-DC adapter AC voltage-120 and DC voltage 12
yes-it does shut off! I use mine as a demo unit at my local swap meet-I play 15-20 lps a day-and the only issue I currently have is that the internal motor drive belt has stretched-causing a slower play! I can repair that easily-but the unit itself is durable- i am going to purchase another portable unit in the future! very happy with the crosley line of record players-plus they stand by their products!
I love the sound. It's loud enough for a decent sized room to get lost in the music but not for a big party or get together
i dont recall, i dont think so though. k
I have not used it for facial hair, but do use it on bikini line. It works great in difficult nooks, cranies and corners. Having never used it on my face, I can't speak to how painful it is, but I would guess that it is certainly no worse than waxing. (For me, the pain really isn't bad so I may be insensitive, but I would definitely recommend this method of hair removal over all others that I've used.)
Hi, I actually tried it on my arms and it works. The problem is since it is small and meant for a smaller area, it takes a much longer time. I am actually thinking about purchasing a separate product for other body parts, such as arms and legs.
Yes, It does well. You do need to let the hair grow out enough for it to grab it, but for whatever reason, it stays gone longer than tweezing.
It uses 2 AA I use the ultra Duracell. It is a really great razor especially for the price.
Yes and no. It will turn your lens into a macro lens. You will not be able to keep this on your lens for everyday use, with the ability of closer focusing. You will only be able to focus up to a few centimeters away.
17x17x5 inches
You have to connect this to a receiver or amplifier. The speakers are connected to the receiver. You choose the receiver and speakers.
It utilizes 1 GB of the CAT7 cable's 10 GB capability
Hoya Standard filters have one layer of anti-reflectant coating to each surface of the glass to suppress reflection and increase light transmission. HMC (Hoya Multi-Coated) have 3 layers of anti-reflectant coatings on each surface to reduce average reflection down to 3.0% or less. Hoya S-HMC (Super HMC) also have 6 layers of anti-reflectant coatings. Finally, the Super HMC PRO 1 is made of thinner glass (only 1mm thick), also with 6 layers of anti-reflectant coatings bonded to each surface of the glass.
No... mine stays on...and still works good.... did yours have a file in it...on the desk top
Now days kids want fast and good.. This is neither
Do not buy this. it goes very slow, also very heavy, wish I wouldn't have bought this. please save your money and get better version
This telescope can be used to observe the craters on the Moon, the rings of Saturn, and even the moons of Jupiter. If you are more interested in terrestrial viewing it also works well for spotting birds. The amount of education one can receive from this telescope, or any telescope or scientific instrument, depends highly on the users own ability to properly operate the tool and their ability to understand what it is they observe.
With the instructions there was an 800 number to contact them. I would first try that they could help. I have never had a problem with them
Yes
No, Justin. This splitter is designed for headphones so two people can listen at the same time, and you can't record since it has a one way audio.
No, but i believe it is because of the easy (non-frustration) packaging policy of Amazon.
I do not know. Sorry.
Unfortunately not. Even though the pin-out structure looks the same, the wiring isn't.
Unfortunately this T-ring is not compatible with the Nikon Coolpix p510 as that is a compact digital camera. The T-ring only fits Nikon DSLR's. Whether that would have been the correct adapter would have depended on the specific telescope you were going to attach that to.
All or most Orion Telescopes have the Vixen mounting shoe that this fits. You would have to go on the Orion web site to be sure. You can also call thier 800 number (on the sites home page) to be really sure.
Yes. It works fine. The carrier serves as a padded carrier for the telescope and everything fits as expected.
I don't know the exact measurement, but I'm 5' 5" and it's taller than me. If you'd like more exact measurements I can measure early next week.
It should work with any 1.25in eyepeice.
31.7501 mm. hope this helps 8^)
No, there is not. As long as you're gentle the position will remain the same when switching eyepieces. The springs that hold the tube to the base do a good job of keeping it in place, but still movable. There is a bolt that you can tighten or loosen to control the amount of resistance to spinning.
You can adjust the tripod to use while sitting or standing.
I wouldn't use an inverter for something like that. Most charging systems on vehicles aren't large enough to keep up with something like that. Occasionally for a few minutes would be ok just not continuous.
Sorry this was about a Tamron AF 2X Teleconverter, not Tamron lens. This teleconverter did not work on my Nikon D7000.
I dont have the same body and lens you have, but I can report success with a 70D body using a Canon 70-200mm f/2.8 using this extender. The fstop jumps to f/5.6 and the autofocus still worked perfectly through the next 2 or 3 stops.
you should buy 77mm
You don't need any driver.......just hook up the monitor properly.
I have no idea. They were terrible. There was a lound buzz constantly and it the signal kept getting dropped. We returned them
Yes they do have a volume control.
These ear buds are a waste of money. Very poor quality and too expensive for what you get. I had two sets and they both failed in less than a year.
You must press the button, however, don't press it too many times or it will break.
All of the cables are removable and replaceable.
I bought a 3.5mm minijack extender (8') and an RCA to 3.5mm minijack adapter from Radio Shack and have it plugged into my Macbook while recording (and monitoring) with Audacity. This works well for my purposes. :)
for each speaker. are they worth it? VERY MUCH SO! I have the dv64's and the acoustech pl-26 center speaker also. no regrets!
The problem is caused by your tape nt the adapter.
The Rezo 30 is too small for the TG 830. I use the Rezo 50 for my TG 830. The Rezo 30 and Rezo 50 have a front compartment that will fit 2 batteries and a memory chip, depending on the thickness of the case used for the chip. The TG 830 camera is about 5 mm longer and 2 mm thicker than a TG 820 camera, which will fit snugly in a Rezo 30.
Yes, it is a cassette player.
There isn't one... I have tho head unit and it's good for the price though. Had it about a year and only thing I didn't like about it was that sometimes if it's cold weather it takes awhile to load CDs and change the volume until the can heats up
http://www.dualav.com/support/manuals/xdma6415.pdf Try this link it should take you to the .pdf version of the manual. This stereo was a piece of junk for me and Amazon couldn't help me and the manufacturer wouldn't call me back. It kept draining my car battery. My husband does this kind of stuff for a living so I know it wasn't the installer. Good luck!
Mine was
Take it into a place like Walgreens and they will develop it for you. You can ask them if it would be possible to process them in B&W but if not, once you have the actual prints then those can easily be made into B&W.
Can't see why it wouldn't be, it connects where the phone headset attaches so should not interfere with the multi line features.
Yes, it works on my d7100 and even better on my d610.
Yes, it can work. It is a discontinued model in Nikon's line up. It suffered from having a slow mode switching button pressing method to change settings and no thermal cut-off switch. Newer units use a switch to change modes and include a thermal cut-off switch. Sb-800 works very well with Radio Popper Jrx line, newer units cannot work with Radio Popper Jrx line. Sb800 had a Nikon sc-18 cord port for connecting flashes, new units do not.
Yes. Compatible with all Nikon dslrs
Yes it's fully compatible
1/4 inch
7.4 volts, 1800 mAh, 13.3 Wh . (The stock one was - 7.2 volts, 750 mAh, 5 Wh.) The new one has a lot more spunk. Takes a little longer to charge but it runs a lot longer and you don't have to change it in the middle of an event.
It depends on the camera. My Canon is too heavy and the tripod tips over when bent to such a degree.
I tried it on the radio and it says its a bad wire so I threw it away because I didn't get and answer form you people thanks.
what is a marc ? this is an analog scanner only with very specific band with for receiving.
This is an excellent radio. I have it in my f150 and reception is really good with a rubber ducked antenna on the back of the radio. Programming takes a bit to get used to. I would definitely recommend it.
Excellent question. It is not as strong as compressed air but it does a great job of blowing away most dust particles that accumulate in my computer. I used it just last night to disperse some dust while installing a new SSD. I was pleasantly surprised again by how well it worked.
yes
No
They have 8 ohm on the tag on the back of them
They should, unless you play music at very high levels.
The Sound Blaster Z drives them pretty well. If you are gaming I suggest also getting the AntLion Modmic for these guys.
Yes, it will work with that.
Yes it does come with a neck strap and a case
I've had that happen a few times, it hasn't done a thing to mine... they seem to remain unaffected with the Nikon brand..
This is a great filter - but whether or not to use it depends on your camera. If you're using any Nikon digital, you're good. And it should work fine with other digital cameras - Canon, etc. There may be one out there that is slightly thinner giving you a lesser chance of vignetting at 11mm. The Hoya 72mm DMC PRO1 would be a good choice. Slim for sure and I've had good luck with Hoya filters.
Yes, this is exactly how I use it. I have it even set so that the monitor is the primary screen and the laptop is an extended second screen. Plus, I get the benefit of my regular keyboard and mouse all with two simple connections.
Hello, yes it will.
I believe that camera only takes xD cards. If your camera didn't come with an owners manual, you can get one on line. It should list compatible cards.
It should as all the Vixia Line seems to be the same size. I don't have this model so it is a guess
Of course! I use mine on my K5 all the time.
I successfully used 64MB and 256MB xD cards with this camera. Not sure about the maximum capacity but the 256MB worked very well for me.
Not really. It's on the large side, and it's not noise canceling. They're open headphones, so people around you will hear what you're listening to if it's loud enough.
When I bought them 2 years ago the box stated "Made in Germany" but that could mean a number of things. Designed? Assembled? Packaged? where are the small parts made? Check this site. I don't know if its truthful but it seems to be ok http://www.productfrom.com/company/81/143/0,0,0/1/ Also I can add that after two years they are still in good condition after daily use for video games. Have not broken. Have not stretched too much on my big head. The around the ear pads did not lose the softness despite my sweating around them.
One
The case is leather on the outside and mesh lining on the inside, it is as advertised. If you are looking for high end leather laptop case this is not it. For me this bag is a great value for the what I use it for....love the price.
A cooling pad will most assuredly fit. This is a big honkin' case.
Is there any way of telling that with a precision? If yes, please give me a hint.
I haven't bought any in a while, but used to get it at Walmart. Also, check on line. I don't know of ay compatible cartridge--always buy Kodak.
The lens with a tripod mount (removable), the front and rear covers, a CD with the manual and specifications and the lens hood.
If your printer will not picking up the paper to print, try a cue tip dipped in alcohol and clean the roller or rollers on the printer. Fan the paper out to keep it from sticking to each other in the tray. I hope this will help you.
Yes, it has RF input/output. If you have more questions, do what I did and check the PDF version of the manual here: http://ec1.images-amazon.com/media/i3d/01/A/man-migrate/MANUAL000065138.pdf
It should work fine. I use the remote cord on my Nikon D7000 with an SB400 speed light.
I'm not sure it should list what it works with. If it hooks up to your camera it should work. You may have to make a selection in your camera menu though. Google it and you should find an answer. Hope this helps.
It should fit just fine. I think the the holes are the same size on all cordless phones.
Jewel cases are formed from styrene plastic, which has the advantage of glass-like transparency, but unfortunately is quite brittle and often breaks if accidentally dropped. Polypropelylene has a slight milkiness but is quite transparent for reading inserts or writing on the DVD contained inside. The polypropylene is extremely durable, so I have never had a cover broken, including those I have mailed to friends and relatives. Incidentally, jewel cases have smaller dimensions than the Memorex slim DVD cases: 5-3/4 in. wide by 5 in. high, versus 7-1/2 in. high by 5-3/8 in. wide.
No, I don't think so. They are solid and look just like regular DVD cases.
These do not have the flaps for inserts. Just the two facing hubs.
my modem wireless light is always yellow/ flashing yellow, and it works well.I have it since 9 months ago :)
I don't know the dimensions of the sleeves, but I can say that they hold perfectly a bluray or dvd movie cover folded in half, with movie behind in flap. I love this case, btw.
Not that I am aware. The pages have a slit design for the holes, not a circular. There are two slit opens verses a standard three hole concept with binders.
The sleeves are very soft. They are just like a CD case sleeve. The front is for the liner notes and they have pockets on the back for the discs.
Don't think so.
It works well with the At&t phone i have ( CL2939) But I dont know about the hearing impairment aspect you can adjust the listen and speak independently
The headset plugs into the base shown, and the base plugs into your phone using a phone jacl type connection. This allows you to easily replace the headphones alone if you.have a problem with them. Thi as is a great.model Ive used for years.
I could answer and dialing out would have to be from an actual telephone. People could not hear me but I could hear them.
Hello, not to my knowledge. Thank you.
No it does not. You have to purchase that separately.
you can google the answer to make sure.
I would think so. If you're worried about them getting wet these are weatherproof speakers. I've had them out through some pretty bad storms and they work just as well as they did when I took them out of the box. As for the connection if that's what you're asking I would go to a local Radioshack and see if they have the type of connector for that specific radio. I currently have them on an Insignia shelf top radio and they work amazing!! Hope this helps you out.
No
They are NOT wireless.....but I really don't know if such a thing exists either....but I love my set....mounted to garage and ran wire inside garage back to the stereo for connection. Good luck!
Looks like that one is for Nikon mounts, so I would say no. Try this one instead: http://www.amazon.com/Sigma-55-200mm-Telephoto-Digital-Cameras/dp/B0001VQ12Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1392059621&sr=1-1&keywords=sigma+55-200+canon
If I were u I would just get a optical audio cable if your tv and sound is setup for it you'll get a more pure sounds
Sure they can. Just go to windows7 backup or restore your files section set up back up and start. But before you start to copy make sure you have enough (DVD+RW's 4.5GB divided by how much space you need) and format them all before you begin. Hope this helps. Good luck.
I'm not sure know the answer (or fully understand what you're trying to accomplish) but I can't see why not. If the controller card is recognized in the BIOS, and the drives attached to the controller are recognized by the controller, then using the controller BIOS you can configure the drive array (RAID, JBOD, etc) and then set the boot order. Of course, using a controller card you will need to hit F6 to install the controller card drivers in order to load windows onto it.
No
Not that I recall I have some British Adventures of Robin Hood DVD's and they work on it
Absolutely. That's how I'm using it, but be sure to lower the volume on everything first before you try. It can get loud.
Yes, f/2.8 will allow you to shoot well in low light.
This is new AF version now.
You may be able to buy one, but Tamron won't give you a warranty. Amazon should take it back if defective. Believe you have 30 days, but check. There is really not much that can go bad on a lenses, it either works or it doesn't. Mine was used, and it works fine.
Yes. There is a small lever on the camera body end you can use to open the aperture but it's spring operated to fully close without something holding it open. By the way, this is the best lens I have in terms of image quality. I think you'll love it.
272EE is trhe Canon fit version of the 272E, 272EN = Nikon 272ES=Sony/Minolta
Yes
i let it sit overnight, it was fine
Yes, the latest version of the WRE54G sold by Amazon does have the ethernet port for wired setup. Or at least they did as of summer 2008. I do not think the older version is available any longer as a new product.
I do not know the exact weight but it is NOT 9.1 oz. I can lift it when completely full; not too heavy for me. The wheels are sturdy enough to support my items.
Round
Sorry no. But it is a good phone. I bought it for my kitchen.
I don't think so, it's just an inexpensive easy to use phone I got for a family member.
My Cybershot DSC-w310 has plenty of living space in that case. That being said, with the dimensions of the w310 being 95.3 x 55 x 18.7 mm and the H3 being 106 x 69 x 48 mm, your camera should fit right in. The cases are, after all, made especially for cybershots :)
Negative, these speakers will run fine with any OEM head unit, and fit in factory enclosures and locations.
Mine did
They will fit, just be sure not to break the factory mounts during the replacement process
Yes
A/C units draw more Amps than this cable is set up for I wouldn't it could cause it to heat up and cause a fire or burn threw exposing wires causing a shock hazards .
Yes 18 Awg Copper Wire
Hi Frank! The network card is a full function one (I never have sen one with restricted use as you mentioned). You should be able to do anything on a network you wish with this one.
Yes, but Windows 7 recognized it immediately so there was no need to install
The cable is 6ft long.
for the most part you are right! There is a 50 50 chance of it working right for you.
I sent mine back... It did not work either.
It depends on what the female end (the side that plugs into the TV) of the TV's power plug looks like. If the plug connector on the tv looks like the Mickey Mouse Ears then yes, this cable will work fine. From what I've seen after a quick Googling it appears that the LG TVs use either a C7 connector http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Cables-NBPCWH-06-Notebook-Power/dp/B002JBV2JG/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1378337755&sr=8-8&keywords=c7+power+plug or a C13 http://www.amazon.com/C2G-Cables-03134-Universal-IEC320C13/dp/B00005113L/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1378338105&sr=1-1&keywords=C13+POWER+CORD
I think it is aluminum.
The 93402 will work on ALL F mount Nikon's... including your D810 FX
I bought a set as was suggested, but did not worked in the system that needed to operated...Unfortunately I had to buy another model and I lost the money...
There's nothing on this phone to be analog or digital except maybe the ringtone. No answering machine, no speaker phone, just a simple plug in to the phone outlet and you're done. Works great.
Yes, but do not use much. You don't want to saturate the paper with the spray. If the paper is thicker you can use a little more, but still don't want to go crazy with it. Follow the directions well and don't spray up close to paper either, can pool in areas and leave dark spots if you spray to close. You can go back and re-spray for extra protection, just don't go crazy all at once.
yes.
75' is a real push but I had a much older unit work at close to 100' with the RF, the problem the newer units have are usually with the IR signal alingment
I did not buy my speakers from Amazon or through Amazon but I set mine on some small tables just to one side of my chairs. I don't see a way to mount them on the wall.
I have no idea. I've only used it inside a moving vehicle. It seems to make a fairly strong connection so go for it.
I checked the specs on you camera. I would almost guarantee it would it's very strong.
If you are talking about service because it isn't working properly then call Beltronics. They have a very reasonably priced repair service.
Yes, with a copy of my original purchase receipt. Gladly took mine and sent out a new one 8 months after purchase.
yes, there is a zipper on the front of the bag
Yes, It does
yes
I have honestly never used the bottle pocket on mine. It's of sturdy mesh construction and about 6 1/2 inches deep and probably about 6 inches across when laid flat so it should hold a large bottle without a problem. I'm in the middle of moving so all my large metal water bottles are packed away in boxes. I had a 26oz canister of salt on hand that fit with room to spare and very little sagging on the bag. Hopefully this helps.
Yes! I'm able to carry a 17" laptop, a 15.6" laptop, several files, a paper notebook and other small office items without a problem.
The bushings that you see are made to fit many different size shafts, but I am not sure how many millimeters. If I remember they will fit four different sizes.
i couldn't use these knobs at all and actually broke one trying to install. they look like they fit, but when you press down to turn, it only works the first time. what a waste of money. i should have return them but
Don't know for sure but they come with adapters that I used.
Hi if your old knobs pull off, then yes these should fit. It comes with different size know adaptors
Hi Brandon, Yes you can get slow motion out of this camera. First is to start with shooting in 24P (Frames Per Second) and to edit in post. Here is a link t o a article that explains it: http://www.studiodaily.com/2005/01/get-film-style-slow-motion-effects-with-the-panasonic-dvx100a/
Yes
Yes. Very easy to mount to wall or ceiling.
They will go well with the book shelf speakers but you will need two of the same 10" subs. Reason why is that the amplifire output rcs are channelled L&R if you use one sub you will only access one channel Unless your sub have both L&R rca inputs then you will only need one.
I think their good for 100 watts
They should, i placed these pyles in an old optimus cabinet app 25 years old, purch from R shack.
Mounting diameter is 11.06" overall diameter is 12.01"
ONE SPEAKER! ONLY ONE!
No
I didn't have problems with the keys - the screen malfunctioned after one year. It was terrific until then. The screen problem is well documented - I wouldn't buy it again w/o knowing the screen problem was fixed.
Hey James, California? I don't understand what the question is.
Sorry for the late response. The suction cups are included. Thank you.
No
you bet you can!
if your JVC stereo is a single DIN (2" tall) it will fit, if it is larger (taller than single DIN, over 2") then it will not fit
Because the kid is the right size for the stereo
No it is not. If you go to Metra online .Com you can put in your vehicles info and it will tell you which kit . Your 2005 Avalanche can take a double din or single din radio. This kit is for the earlier model Chevy/Gmc vehicles
No I do not believe this will work in the astro.
Yes
I am not sure, basically it is a mini usb to usb cable. The one I bought was defective and didn't work at all. Too much hassle to return so I ate the cost. I wouldn't buy this particular cable but look for a different manufacturer. I bought it top go with a Canon camera so it should have been fine. I sure miss the "Made in USA" days!!
Yes. I have a Canon PowerShot ELPH340HS
Yes, I have a Canon Powershot SX50 HS purchased in Nov last year. It works both with my windows PC (8 yrs old still running XP) and Mac (new).
it does not, at least i did not notice so..
Yes. It is as pictured.
those do not accept banana plugs. just bare wire then you tighten down the binding posts
I used this kit in a 2000 Ram 1500. Had to make slight modifications as dash was damaged. If not, it would have fit fine. Don't know if interior changed from 97 - 00 though.
Yes, they will fit the original speaker plug in on the 97 Jeep wrangler. I used them in my 01 wrangler when I replaced the speakers.
They fit my 2000 300m. No instructions but fairly intuitive and a solid quick fit.
Yes it will. I just replaced a radio in my 2007 Super Crew and it fit perfectly. I know it is a "crysler" product in its name but it also fit my 2007 F150 perfectly.
Connector with open ends, no plug at the other end.
Excelent
No, unfortunately, you will need to get a special adapter for your truck, if your truck has bose, you will need the Axxess GMOS-04 Class II OnStar Interface for Amplified Systems, and if it does not have Bose, you can use this: Axxess GMOS-01 02-Up Onstar Harness Adapter with Chime. they are pricey, but since GM made our trucks with proprietary wiring, you will need either of these harnesses.
They are most likely correct. The harness is for the simple radio. Most newer GM vehicles have the door chime running through the stereo system. I purchased it for a 2005 Silverado and ended up having to get the more expensive style. Check with a local car stereo shop other than best buy. I got one for $89.99. Hope this helped.
You need to check your current antenna connector. If it is the factory 2-prong connector this adapter should fit. I cannot comment on Amazon's "does it fit your vehicle" feature. All I know is that my daughter had 95 Pathfinder that had the same Antenna Connector as the 2000 Maxima in which I installed this Adapter. I am not an expert on Nissan's, but based on my experience it should fit.
Yes it does. It also permits diversity antenna connections from the universal antenna socket, that's the third connection.
I work at gm and from looking at the parts catalog it looks just the same. I'm not 100% positive. But I could email you a picture of the 2014 connector and you could see what I'm talking about. Or even you could go to your local chevy dealership and have them pull up a picture of the speaker and harness.

It it a pair
Both are powered at the same time. I'm assuming there is only one physical headphone amplifier so it would essentially be the same as using a splitter out of one of the jacks.
Yes. As long as the signal is sent via an XLR cable (the kind of cable the mic input uses), it doesn't matter whether it's an actual microphone or some other sound source. Just remember that sound souce will also go out with the "mic thru" signal, not just the user's headphones.
just electric tape it off and it be fine
Im not sure but i dont think so because its kind of flush in.
Indeed it will. Single din h/u.
This would not fit the single DIN Pyle stereo I bought. Also, the little storage slot size below is basically useless any way. I tried to make this one fit only to have to purchase the mount without the storage slot which worked perfect.
maybe the mouse should 'go back' in the box.
This antenna is a "universal" fit item. It is NOT specific to any particular vehicle. If you have a suitable, relatively flat mounting surface, you can probably use it.
The radio cord on this is not long enough for the Cirrus, you'll need a 72" cord or an extension radio cord along with this. Try this one Metra 44-GM935B 5 Base Universal Application Antenna for GM J-Body (Black) https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000COUZ5Y/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_2YTuvb1196FNS
Yes, I have found this mouse is compatible with all keyboards and software. Doesn't take anything special, just plug the usb adaptor in the usb and it will work.
Its a full size tripod
Your Acer has a DVI port. Yes you can use this cable. However, you won't be able to have the sound since this cable carries only the image. But you can also buy an audio cable that you'll connect to your Acer headphone and to your tv headphone input or tv audio input. I did exactly what I just explained with my Toshiba laptop. I've been using that for years.
I like them . I use them playing live music thru my Amp. I use them when I record my music. I have the 40's and they sound great.
Yes
I don't know the answer to your question. What I can say is this cable seems to take more time to charge phone/tabs and also I get warnings at time that I have too many apps running to properly charge the phone/tab all at the same time. That's when I'm browsing or gaming for example while plugged in. I believe these issues may be due to the length of this cable though I can't say for sure, this is just my observation.
Hi Sue. I really cannot say for sure if it will work. I can verify though that the specific cable worked without any problems when I had to connect to it another USB cable, both totaling 10 meters in length. I could not achieve USB connectivity in such a distance by any other kind if USB cable used in the past. I hope that this will help you somehow. Nick.
Generally, a ten foot extension is as long as you want to go past a powered device. Since this is a powered device, you should be able to add at least that much. If it has the same electronics as the longer version, it should be able to handle the length of the longer version. I can say from experience that I have used this very cable with a 10 foot extension attached to a hi-def webcam with a six foot cable and had no problems at all, so you should be able to do at least that.
One. Make sure they fit because it's considered "hazardous material" so you can't return it.
No, only when you are actually on the phone.
absolutely
They're closed. I used 12 of them on a 12 piece string section with the mic placed 10 feet above the players with no bleed.
Same here, virus about 25 years ago totaled the left ear. I use it for my right ear with an ipod (adapter jack needed, a couple of bucks), works great. Don't hesitate.
No I don't think so. This is made for a wah wah pedal (guitar effect). It is not made for telephones. You should look at Radio Shack for telephone accessories.
hello if it serves can use
no - it has standard XLR (balanced) and 1/4" plug inputs and outputs. Note that I found that two examples of the particular pre-amp you are asking about had a hum problem. If you search on "ART Tube MP Project Series - Microphone Preamplifier with USB" you will find what you are looking for, in a model that I found to be very quiet and warm.
This microphone requires 48 volt phantom power. If you want to use it with your PC you will need a icicle (or a microphone preamp that has phantom power). You will also need a Female XLR to USB adapter cable if you plan on using a preamp. You will not need the adapter cable if you use the Icicle since the Icicle has the Female XLR and USB connectors on it. I have used both methods and both work equally well.
I don't answer questions when profanity is used.
i had the same problem. you need to purchase a signal booster and the antenna. makes a ton off difference. look at part # 815126 booster # 859970 home kit and 301125 antenna. hope this helps.
Yes it can, that's how I am using it, works perfect.
Approx.10 inches
Possibly, if the fittings match between the antenna and the scanner and you don't mount the antenna in a concrete building.
I'd recommend using a frame to hang it on the wall, not glue. But, if you insist, probably rubber cement. That will cut down on contraction and wont destroy the wall when you remove it. You'll see where there's glue though, it won't look good. I built a screen with this paper, turned out OK. It was secured to the wood frame with staples. Moved, resized it, and that time, bought a stretchy screen from these guys, turned out fantastic. http://www.carlofet.com/projector-screen-material.html
If you want your subject not moving , yes , but the W is not wide enough for moving recording video, I recommend a larger size , and you still need a support pole to hold it up !!
Yes.
Both ways will work. I cut my mine to the lengths I need and reuse it. It lasts quite awhile, especially if you have clean props or subjects so as not to spoil the paper.
Not sure about non-apple product. I have used it with iphone, ipod and ipad though. Right now I have a wire running from the otherwise unused RGB "Tape" input connectors to a 3.5 mm "headphone" jack. I use something like this piece available on amazon for less than $5 http://www.amazon.com/eForCity-3-5mm-Auxiliary-Cable-Cord/dp/B0042DIZTE
Once you understand how to use the tripod, including how to mount the camera on the panhead (there is a right way and there is a wrong way, both possible to do), in my view it works just fine.
It has the round quick release mount, where the round part fits the bottom of the camera. If you would like me to send a close up pic of let me know.
The slik pro has a detachable part that is shaped like a hockey puk. It can attach to any camera that has the standard threaded hole
This product worked fine for me. I used it to transmit a TV signal (satellite & cable) from a TV in my bedroom to a portable TV that I used in other rooms or outside on the patio. Signal quality was good, but I did notice some degredation when people walked around alot. I hope this helps!
only if the computer has RCA outs... sound and video...
I'm happy to say it Works like a charm.
Sure. What ever audio is delivered from your connected TV set will appear in TVEars. They are independent of what you happen to be watching.
The only batteries you may need are if the power goes out and you want to shine a flashlight behind the opaque plastic back to see your slides. Otherwise, it does not require batteries as it works with natural and electric backlighting.
This simple gadget is not designed for negative strips but for one-at-a-time slide viewing. There is little magnification and no light provided. It is not much better than holding a bare slide up to a bright light.
No, it can only listen to sounds in the room - it has a microphone, but no speaker.
Not really, though it can see fairly well in dim light, better than most people.
the converter box by itself is fantastic try to get a state-of-the-art optical cables to connect to the converter as well as a coaxial digital cable to further enhance the sound
I am not familiar with your particular setup. This adapter converts TOS-link optical to digital coax, but not the other way around. It won't convert digital coax to TOS-link. They have another model that does that. BTW, mine is still going great after a year.
These leak very little and are tough, repairable, and sound great. I use them quite frequently on the recording studio and are loud enough for even the deafest drummers. Best of luck ! www.camilosilvaf.com
Yes, it will work in Italy. I have used it in Italy, Switzerland, Netherlands, UK, Ireland, France, Japan and Singapore.
No
I think it would work for you. Works for me io a slightly angled dashboard and holds my phone, keys, glasses, whatever.
When the legs are flat, it stands 3.25" from the ground (including the rubber feet)
I actually wear these about 4 hours at a time without any issues. These are much better than other brands I have used.
I think it wont work because a tipical set up for that would be 20 to 30 secs, iso 3200, f 2.8. It may work if your camera goes to iso 6400 without noise. Or if you wait 60 sec but probably some stars will look like lines instead of dots. I suggest to go with a 2.8. On the other side for architecture or landscape is excelent!!! Quality is really nice for the price well not from f4.5 to 8 but from 8 to 18 is great!!
I have just purchased 2 of these to try with the slingbox. If my wiring in the house is hooked up to work with these,my slingbox should work,or at least that's what netgear customer service told me. I will post an answer on here after I receive,and install these,and my slingbox.
According to Dish data,(tech.dishnetwork.com and serch for "home networking") only one HomePlug-to-Ethernet adapter is needed. The router is connected to the home plug and the ViP722 power cord is directly pluged into the AC plug. See reference above for more descriptive info.
I bought this exact display to use with an Apple Mac mini 2008 model and it worked out perfect! The MacBook 13in I think haas a mini DVI port and Cinema Display has a regular DVI cable so if u have an adapter mini dvi to standard DVI then it should work fine! You can find one on amazon also!
yes it will. just need to get a HDMI adataper.
I believe you will need an adapter as this monitor is VGA. To use with my MacBook air i needed a thunderbolt to VGA adapter
No issues. I've been using it for over 5yrs. "Knock on wood"
I just started having the same problem. According to the manual here are some possible causes and solutions. Life of rechargeable battery has expired Insert a new rechargeable battery. Rechargeable battery is being charged or refreshed in temperatures either too high or too low. Charging and refreshing temperatures should range between 32F - 95F (0C - 35C). Charging incorrect types of batteries. Charge only a Ni-MH rechargeable battery.
Yes you can without problem. it works ok
Other rechargeable NiMH batteries can be used in the Sony charger.
Yes you can but you will need a seperate program. It is called burn (burn-osx.sourceforge.net) this program will let you burn your movie as a playable DVD. It has a bit of a learning curve but it is the best program out there in my opinion. The website should tell you exactly how to use it an set it up so it will play in your country's DVD player (pal vs NTSC) hope this helps you!
Yes it will work
I have this hooked up to a car amp. it will not let any signal thru when all the way down. but you can slowly rise the signal to what ever you want.
Yes it is .
i'd say you could, because for its size (which is great and convenient) it's strong and resistant. You'll have to find a steady surface though to record something as long as a lecture...
If you want to connect the audio output from the TV to the home theater's input it would work but not the other way around.
Yes, you sure can as long as the amplifier has an optical digital input. I use it to connect an airport express to a pioneer receiver and it works great.
You could not use it on Bose Wave radio, radio does not have an additional description like SPDIF optical port. It is regular audio jack only.
This is a TOSLINK optical mini to TOSLINK optical digital cable. It will fit the headphone jack on a MacBook Pro or Mac Mini from about 2009 forward, as these are combo optical/audio jacks. The "optical" is a similar to broadband fiber optics. It's not for the headphone jack of something like an iPod. Check the specs on your equipment to see if there ares TOSLINK optical connections. That's what this cable is for.
Depending on the age of your Mac, you can take it to the apple store and get them to replace the keyboard with a French one free - I think this is for the first 60-90 days after purchase. I would bet after you could as well for nominal fee.This is a replacement OEM keyboard of language of choice. Done it 2-3 times with Arabic with no issues.
No .
The key to your question is "requires 12 volts". My answer to this is that 13.8 volts meets the requirements and that anything you wire up to the this Pyramid or any other power supply should always have a fuse or circuit breaker attached to the Power line. I cannot see any reason why there should be any damage to a 12 volt ethernet switch at this voltage level. Just my opinion but I use mine to power up all kinds of 12 volt electronics. I think the amperage would be more of a issue than the voltage.
I don't think so. For some reason known only to Bose, I had to buy an RCPMCIII-27. It has been a while and my memory is fuzzy, but Bose has a good customer support line so give them a call.
I had a ton of questions when I bought this amp. The best place to get the best response is call Bose. 1800-869-1855. They will answer anything
You have to go to the system options menu and then audio options. There is a bass compensation option that allows you to increase or decrease bass. The owners manual is online at the bose website.
The picture of the "29" battery is deceptive. It is distorted and looks squat. I just carefully measured it and it is exactly 1-1/4" wide by 2-1/8" in length.
This battery is virtually identical to the original equipment battery provided by Panasonic. I replace a worn battery with this one recently and it works perfectly.
No
Yes, it can easily fit in the overhead compartment on the plane. Like I mentioned in my review, it's not spacious inside. The size of the bag makes you think there's a lot of room inside, but there isn't.
Yes it will, I am 6' and it has worked beautifully for me.
No, it will not fit.
approximately 4 3/4" Wide -- 3 1/8" -- top to bottom -- 1 3/4 depth (front to back)
Honestly have no idea. Used mine in a boat application. Sorry
I hope I understand your question correctly. If you connect each of the three speakers to the connections on the crossover, each of the 8 ohm speakers will be fed correctly without any other modification.
No. I bought it so I could listen to tv while my husband slept. And I had to buy other attachments. Honestly I paid $15 for cordless and it was way better.
I hooked a DVD surround sound deck to my cable box with audio cables(you know the red and white) then I put the headphone jack in that so it has no effect on the tv.
These items are fulfilled by Amazon and they have included shipping. Shipping costs on Parts Express website would be additional, unless the order was over $98.00.
i have a micrometer i could mic them if you really needed. I can tell you with 99.9% certainty that .125" (1/8") hole is too small and will not work. I would believe the specs. as .250" (1/4") is around the dimension I would say the bolt is. I recomend looking at another product. Hope this helped.
The wire is an intricate part of it.
These are universal fit door lock actuators. They do not install in place of the original actuator. You do not even have to remove the original only remove the wires from the original to power the universal actuator. The universal actuator connects to the rods that control the hand operated levers. I used them on a 2004 Chrysler over a year ago and they are still working great. Chrysler wanted $65.00 each for OEM these were under $5.00 each. I posted some tips for mounting previously. Good luck.
yes i think they would be a great choice.they can handel a lot of power for a small set pair of speakers.and sound great!!
Yes! Slight bow to it.
Idk what CEC means, but when i purchased my cables from monoprice, the anynet functionality of the tv with the bluray player worked without a problem. Just simply connect the two ends of the cable, and tv will recognize it.
No. This is simply to change the optical toslink from the larger, standard square male plug to the 3.5mm male plug. Both devices must have optical connections.
Gentle but steady pressure straight back out from the plug.
Yes ... make sure you install both of the cards at the same time... system will not recognize unlike cards..DO NOT over handle cards (take out of package and install, have clean but not damp hands). should improve system speed, this upgrade is the max the system can handle... have fun and enjoy your new found speed...
Yes absolutely
No ... just a preamp for bass. You need an amplifier for you bass.
Yes your lenses will work...
Not available from us
The autofocus will not although the lens in general will necessarily work.
The autofocus will not although the lens in general will necessarily work.
It works with my 6D. I am not sure about the 5D MKIII since I don't own one. I believe the electronic interface for all canon camera is standard and the same, and so it should work. If you buy it under Amazon Prime then you can try it and return it within 7 to 10 days if you are not satisfied with it. I buy a lot from Amazon and returned few items before and had no issues in returning them.
I just measured it for you: 5" long x 1 5/8" wide x 1 1/2" high
Sorry, I returned this headset.................I don't know what a model Verykool r23 is...........anyway I didn't find this headset very satisfactory.
Well, it has a plug for the headphones and a plug for the mic, so unless your phone has a jack for the mic, you'll probably only be able to use the headphones.
YES! it is mountable.
This does not support surge suppression on HDMI. Unless you are running HDMI through the wall to get to your television, such suppression also should not be necessary provided you have surge suppression on the power delivery for all components, on the coax lines for cable/satellite, and any coax/phone lines for cable/DSL internet service.
Yes but I would keep the camera strap around your arm. read the reviews. Most are pretty accurate.
Yes, I own these speakers, and have doubled them as a home theater system, since they seem to serve a dual purpose. Sure, they are marketed as PC speakers, but with that adapter, you probably have the best television speakers you could ever own as an amplifier to what you watch as well, including sports and movies, where this set shines. I'd highly recommend these over Bose Cinemates, they give you about the same amount of sound for a lot less money, trust me.
Yes. 4.5v DC
Hi Ella, You can connect headphones with mini stereo plug (3.5mm). -Anthony
Midland , and other brands, have an output jack for siren or lamp. They need to have that jack, its a standard size jack same size as transistor radio mono earphone's use. Any wx radio with siren or alert jack.
20'red 10 ga high current superflex power cable atc fuseholder and 15' high performance gold rca interconnect hope that helps
Bout the same but it may be smaller gauge then 10. I would go bigger gauge just for piece of mind. I got BOSS 8 g. Kit was I lil smaller then standard 8/but handles 1100w mono and 4 channel 400 watt. Does it with ease
i am 90% sure it is
Pioneer says 3" here http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/Car/Speakers/Marine/TS-MR2040
I made some modifications. I took two metal pieces in the shape of an L, covered them with the soft side of Velcro to prevent them from scratching the top of my LCD. Then placed the spiky parts of the Velcro underneath the speaker to attach the L shaped metals pieces to it. Finally I placed it on top of my LCD with the L shape pieces holding it from the front LCD and the attached stand holding it from the back of the LCD. I used Velcro so that I could remove it later if I wanted to.
The TC-17E II was designed for Nikon's 70-200 f/2.8 lens and a few others. I suggest you contact Tamron and ask them
Ask Nikon.
Yes, the DR-6 is listed as an accessory for the D750.
According to Nikon, yew it will: http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Photography-Accessories/DSLR-Camera-Accessories.page?#!/tag:7WA:Eyepieces and Viewfinders/product:25476:D5100
The sound quality is ok. The design is just awkward. and make sure it fits the classic...didn't work out for me very well.
No.
Sorry! I don't know. I purchased this for my brother and can't remember why he needed it.
Yes, I have used it to do that before.
No it will not work on a Laptop. I would suggest a Firewire 1394A to USB Adapter.
I don't want to sound like a pretentious professional, but honestly? It's lackluster. You might end up being better off with spending another $50 to get a fluid head tripod, it's so incredibly worth it. The Ravelli AVT seems to be based on a Davis & Sanford design that i'm not quite fond of (fragile under heavy use) but is leagues, *light-years* ahead of this sad piece of plastic.
No diffuser.
A "date body" is a camera that can optionally print the current date directly onto the film negative. A "lens kit" includes the camera body and a lens.
You can put all your stuff but the lenses. I think that you can put 3, you can carry 5 but, you where taking the risk because the wont be on the "lens area" of the bag
Yes!! My bag has three lenses, battery & charger, my lrg flash & so much more . U won't b disappointed . Enjoy
It can hold a 5d mark iii and lens
contact canon they have a phone number on their web site just call them and ask
When I got my camera, the lens attached that came with it had a lens cover. I bought a second lens and had to order a cap to go with it since it didn't come with one...also, this was a good four or five years ago when I got my camera...I don't know what is included these days...best...it's a sensational camera.
I'm sorry. I have no idea. I purchased this battery to continue using my Sony camera. I love being able to use a disk that I can take out and instantly put in my floppy drive to access the pictures. Wish I could be more help!
Yes it will. If you look at the 70D you can see a white dot on the silver ring where you attach lenses. That means it takes both regular EF AND EF-S lenses. It's *the* wide lens for crop sensor DSLRs.
EF-S lenses are only compatible with some EOS and Rebel models. They are not compatible with full frame cameras.
Hello! Yes, it includes the lens and one back cap and a front cap.
Yes, it's normal. This is called lens creep.
Hi.no,the board does not support that cpu.here's a list of supported processors: http://tinyurl.com/a9oxfwy
I'm not sure what you are asking but I can tell that I have this monopod for about 6 years now and it works just great for me. I liked it because it is very long and the price is very good. The quality is realy good enough for me as I'm not a pro. good luck.
Tripod mounts are standard. Any tripod or monopod will fit any camera with a tripod mount. If your camera has a 1/4 - 20 threaded hole on the bottom, any tripod or monopod will fit. The Canon Rebel XS has a tripod mount.
No
3 Lines but must be connected to a pbx like KX-TA824
It is pretty well padded, but it would not hurt to put it in a sleeve. I don't think it is necessary though. I really like this bag. It is a good bag, for traveling on a business trip for a few days. It makes a great carry on.
It may, but I am not familiar with vocalist live 5. If you have the owners manual to the product, it should tell you what adapter will work for your product.
When you insert the disc the dialog box is displayed and one of the choices is to run the set up. Don't run set up from this dialog box. Close the the dialog box and open Windows Explorer and locate the CD drive. Find the Set up exe file on the CD and double click on it. This should run the set up.
The real question is whether the new lotus will work with Windows 7 or 8. I couldn't make it work on 7 unless I went to Virtual XP. Some others have had a better experience. I finally gave up and moved to Excel--but the new excel is NO LONGER compatible with Lotus. So my advice, if you have lots of Lotus spreadsheets wouldbe, if you can to use the older Lotus version you now have. I made the switch because I am disenchanted with Lotus' unwillingness to make themselves compatible, and to me, prefer leave the field to Microsoft.
No it does not. This particular unit was made in ~2001, long before HTML was in existence.
Not real sure about the transparency issue but if your homemade cd's have paper labels on them that you applied, these reek havoc with car players because of the tight tolerences. Won't play right and half the time the players just ejects them until finally one will get stuck in the player.
yes it will just be in mono not stereo
When you have purchased an appropriate amplifier there will more than likely be RCA connections for Line-Level audio. You're *supposed* to have an audio interface to filter out the highs, but I just run an auxiliary-to-RCA cable straight from my PC's audio jack to the amplifier. Works fine.
I am no expert but after doing my research this is what I got. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070Z87YO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 It isn't turned up all the way and it still does the job well. I do recommend a base amp so it will only go off when base sounds come through
same part, just turned upside down
the port should be adjustable. setting the lenght depends on the size of your sub, the cu ft of the enclosure, the free air resonance of the sub you have, and the size of the room or car your putting it in. there are many forums on the web you can get help with "tuning" your sub. I used home theater shack, but there are many to choose from.
yes this plays cd-rs but it seems to play factory cds more reliably
Wacom doesn't offer drivers for any distribution of Linux, only Windows or Mac operating systems as found here: http://us.wacom.com/en/support/drivers However, it appears that there is hope for folks on Ubuntu. If that is your distribution of choice, check Ubuntu's Wacom community here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wacom
Normally it is best to scan an image onto your computer, then use an application such as Photoshop, Painter, or SketchBook to digitally trace on a separate layer. While tracing an image on the tablet can be done, some setup is required as there needs to be adjustment for aspect ratio, and document size.
Yes, but you will need to buy a FireWire 400 to FireWire 800 cable (6 pin to 9 pin), or a FireWire 400 to 800 adapter.
Original owner with proof of purchase, one year. Get the mfg power supply, cheapies don't have the current producing capacity (3A). Works like a charm! Highly recommend.
Ethernet to Ethernet, just includes a crossover.
Take a regular straight through patch cable with standard RJ45 ends. Connect one end into the female end of the connector, you now have converted that patch cable into a crossover cable. Cross over cables are typically required when connecting to similar devices together, two PC's for example.
The description has the following listed: "Compliant with EIA/TIA Cat6, Draft 11" So I'd assume no.

It is a low profile card, but it does not come with a low profile PCI bracket; at least mine didnt.
It does the job. But when you plug it in or use head phones. The turn table sounds great.
Yes, I have Windows 7 and the machine works. BUT, before you burn CDs with your digitized music, be sure to go into your Windows 7 audio controls and set things so you get the fidelity you want. I did not, and the fidelity was poor--neither bass nor treble could be heard.
I lined it up, opened the door. When the alarm went off, I took the backing off and stuck it permanently. It works perfectly. Someone opened my door one night and I heard the alarm from upstairs. The intruder left promptly. Also, it alerts when children leave or enter the house, or leave the door open.
They are about a quarter inch thick
I used it for my Passport 9500i and it works fine. If the shifter has similar connections I don't see why it wouldn't work.
I don't have the mirror mount kit. Just the window clip with two suction cups.
Well, you are looking at it... One of the remotes from Logitech's Harmony line should suit your purposes.
The version of firmware that came on my HP Jetdirect 620n is V.29.12 and V.29.20 is the latest available. Now, I don't know if PCI compliant, but it was very simple to upgrade the firmware using http://h20564.www2.hp.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-bpj07429#N100C0

When DVD media technology was first developed, the plus (+) and dash (-) formats had different writing/reading specifications. Today, most DVD writers and readers work with no noticeable performance differences between DVD+R and DVD-R disc formats. Check with your manufacturer's suggested DVD format to ensure compatibility - especially with older units. (From Verbatim Website...)
really don't know- I use them the same way as other dvd's (DVD, data, read write)- I get verbatim always, never had a problem.. maybe the name 'branded' means 'same ones like before'..:)
No, it doesn't
It should, it fit my 01 LS
Idk for sure. If u can find a pic of the back of the package it shld say tho. It sells at Walmart also.
No
yeah it has an ear phone jack and also inside the battery compartment you can switch it from rechargeable batteries to regular depending on what you put in it and yes you can charge it either by wall outlet or car but you have to purchase them from radio shack or something... ebay
SORRY I CAN'T HELP YOU
I had purchased this remote control for a Toshiba player and it worked for me.
Not hard to do. If you order a new lamp, it will come with instructions. Basically, it involves removing the bottom front panel (snapped on - I forget if there are screws at this point as well) and then unscrewing the lamp from it's mount. Swap the new lamp out (more involved if you bought a bulb-only replacement) and screw it back in. If you're even a little handy, you won't have any problems.
Hi Michael K., You can get VHF/UHF supported Antenna for your channels and you don't need any converter for HDTV. Dave
I don't sell them, but I got 3 pairs for $4 here : http://www.amazon.com/Foam-Cover-Philips-Headphones-2-5-16-Inch/dp/B0040FHB6C/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1376155635&sr=8-1&keywords=sony+mdr+nc6+ear+pads
Yes, though I wouldn't say the Bose speakers are portable. I have several laptops which I use on my desk in my home office. The Bose speakers are nice companions to my work and my appetite for music, games, ... etc.

It comes with a screw to put in the wall and you can hang it on the screw. I however, used 3M Command Velcro strips. I wasn't sure exactly where I wanted them mounted. It's heavy duty and works great! You apply a velcro strip to the wall and one to the unit. I can change my mind and remove them any time without any damage to the wall. I would recommend this installation.

According to the SanDisk website, this will support SDHC card formats. You can get the full set of specifications from the SanDisk site at: http://www.sandisk.com/Products/Item(1151)-SDDR-99-A15-SanDisk_ImageMate_5In1_ReaderWriter.aspx
The stands are removable.
Yes, Sigma makes a Nikon EM-140DG version of this ring flash -- make sure to buy the Nikon version and not the Canon version. It is a good ring flash for macro (closeup) photography and compatible with the Nikon electronics. RS
It should work with the proper adapter ring.
Yes you will have a problem. You need the correct model of flash. The connections to the cameras are different
It should work with the proper adapter ring.
An external flash must "communicate" with the camera to which it is attached to fire properly. One of these is configured to operate with certain Canon cameras, and the other is configured to operate with certain Nikon cameras.
not sure, it will probably hook up to the camera, but as far as working, I really don't know. What I can tell you is it didn't work with the D-3000.
Yes it will for with the Nikon D50. It is a manual lens..
I don't know I can't use that one on my device. Sorry.
Yes, and yes.
Mine were white
I do not see buttons for country. There are only buttons for setting an alarm and time, and a scroll wheel for tuning from what I can see.
Nope.
Sorry, I don't know. I use an NB4L in my Canon Digital Revio XTI SLR and my Canon Optura 400 and 500 Vid cams.
This is model is no longer in production. If you send email to info@kaitousa.com , I will send you the pdf. Thanks. Kaito Customer Care Team
Hi I believe a Kaito Radio. Might have been a good radio but the one I got had NO FM. I returned it.
PCA. No, they only work with Wacom tablets....in fact this particular unit only works with the Intros 3 RC
My Tamron 28-300 is for Pentax mount and not the current model. The Nikon mount should work fine with a D5100. I always try to download and read the manual befor I make a significant purchase. That way I am not blindsided by a feature or limitation. Bill
I have a D90 and don't know enough to say definitively about yours, but the autofocus DOES work with the Tamron & my D90. However, one warning I have - a big one - is that the use of filters can affect whether the autofocus works or not. Once I took the filter off it worked fine. Others have mentioned the same problem.
Yes, but at the time of purchase, you specify the target mark (NIKON). But in Nikon3300 with DX sensor work with the focal length of 46-630mm. Good luck.
Yes, it is hot swappable.
OK, so this is a really old post right now, but maybe someone is looking for the information. Any FM transmitter in LA is going to be so-so. There are simply so many FM stations in LA that it's hard to use a transmitter without interference. If you are driving in your car there will be several times where you will need to fidgit with the settings. It can get really annoying. So, will it work? Probably. Will it be stable or enjoyable? Probably not.
i'm pretty sure it works with anything that has an audio jack for headphones.
Yes, this will work with anything that has a headphone jack.
Absolutely not. You'll need a receiver or a power amp of some sort. (And no, not an iPod.)
Hello Melodica, We do believe there may be some confusion here. These are bookshelf speakers that connect to a stereo system. There are no components to play cassettes or other media. You would have to have a playback device and connect the speakers to that.
I wall mounted it at the very top of the wall so that I could screw into the top plate. The room that I installed it in had a cathedral ceiling and I didn't want to ceiling mount. You will need a drill as holes for the bolts should be pre-drilled to make it easier to screw in the bolts. You won't be able to do it if you don't pre-drill. A ratchet set would also be helpful.
Works with my Optoma hd66 very adjustable
This mount will adjust to absolutely any angle you need. If you are in a tight spot, then this is the mount for you. If you need to angle the projector "down" then you need a longer mount...one with a "down rod" preferably...Angling the image downward will cause a distortion, or trapezoid. It can be "corrected" with the keystone function, but that should be a last ditch attempt. You are far better off getting the right mount that will put your projector at the correct height for your screen.
No it will not work. You need Samsung SLB-10A battery for that camera.
Yes
No 10V.
If you have an MP3 player out to RCA in... It is possible. I would not recommend it though. It is always best to have a deck between the MP3 and the Amp as the Deck is designed to interface with the amp
No it does not.
Yes.... But, You must have windows update with windows update in control panel....
You can change options on the Honestech TVR panel. Please click on the TV button. Maybe you have to click on the properties button to do some settings. I hope this helps
No
The lens this question is linked to is a Nikon-fit lens, so that will not fit a Canon camera. The Canon-fit version might: http://www.amazon.com/Sigma-55-200mm-Telephoto-Digital-Cameras/dp/B0001VQ12Y/ref=pd_sim_sbs_p_3. Double-check if you need a focusing motor in the lens or in the camera. For Nikon that is an important differentiator. Full disclosure: I bought the Olympus version and am not a Canon user. Glass-wise this is a great lens.
It is single. The quality is decent for the price.
No it will only raise from the button on the headset
Mine came with a straight plug unfortunately. No idea why... works perfectly otherwise.
It works great but the sound distorts on high volume not as clear as my older version of this headset but to get the options I needed had to upgrade to this one. Overall it works great and I have to have full volume because I have hearing loss and it seems to distorts a little when its cranked to the max but as far as whats on the market its the best for battery and functions
I think so
Yes they can. However, you will need a RCA stereo audio (male) to 3.5mm (female) adapter.
yes, for this reason: they are not noise cancelling phones. you want to hear some of what's going on around you. they can be difficult, or awkward to put on. you may want to consider using a headband to keep them in place, and to provide tight contact with your ears. these are excellent value; go for it. gj
The question is "church"? One word question? Are you asking if the Bose 901's would work well in a church venue? There are other Bose products designed for open settings such as convention halls, conference centers, or church.
They were designed for the music Lover and not so much entertainment system. I suppose they could work in that capacity, but remember they have a separate control box that sets in between the amp and the speakers themselves.
All 5816 work with vista 10,15, 20 and 21ip panels providing you have a 5881 series receiver, or a 6150rf,6152rf,6160rf,or 6162rf key pad which has the receiver built in. I have never really heard of the need for a date code.
No,I had to buy one from ebay
It is a connection and a case. You take out your old laptop drive and insert. It's a handy product for re-using old laptop drives or for transferring information from an old laptop drive.
Mine only has one USB port. Power and data are through a single USB cable. Sounds like you would be better off with a unit that comes with an external power supply. More of an opinion than a proven fact. Good luck.
Yes, it works perfectly with the Epson TM-U220PD.
Hey Megan, I have the SR-60i 'phones and use them with both my iPod classic and my iPhone 3S. They did not plug into the Otter Box cover I had over my phone as the plug did not fit in the hole provided. But without the cover, it works fine.
Unfortunately, definitely not. The system works outdooors but will malfunction sooner or later if exposed to moisture. Larry.
You dont need this, the TV be gone is a piece of garbage.
This macbook has an antiglare screen. Glossy macbook has a product # begining with Z0DR. Hope that helps.
i use timbuktu or "microsoft remote desktop for mac" all the time for the past several years to connect to my home windows or mac computers from the road. i use a apple pismo over cellular or wifi on the road everyday. both work fine you can also use vnc or a couple of others i think.
I act. believe 3Gb.
Buy whatever you will likely need (no matter how infrequently). If you're going to only be needing internet in wi-fi networks, you don't need the extension. Otherwise, it's good to have. You'll need a real CD drive depending on what you're going to do. If you are both (a) going to be in a situation where you would need to install software or watch a movie via a DVD and (b) not going to be around other wireless computers at the time, I'd say go get it.
I cannot say on Windows 7....my sound did not work either...only got Front L/R and Aux Out and it was not good hifi /CD quality....
From midfield it should be okay.
Yes, it will work on an e-410 body.
Indeed, the diagonal mentioned will fit your Meade RB60. That said, this is not an eyepiece - this is a diagonal. This diagnal is designed to redirect the light path from the telescope's lenses to your eyepiece so that the viewing position is comfortable for you. However, it is not an eyepiece (generally used to change the telescope's magnification). I hope this helps.
Just measure the outside diameter (OD) of the bottom of the eyepiece barrel. Less than 1" it has a 0.965" (24.5 mm) OD; otherwise, it is an 1.25" (31.75 mm) eyepiece.
It can tune in to some air hf signals. No weather tha I am aware of.
I have mine connected to a TV on one end, and tested it with a BluRay copy of that blue people movie, forgot the name, but it worked just fine.
I have no Idea. It does not say on the cable. Im using it for a 38" LCD TV in a small Public Access TV Studio. Output from a AJA Ki Pro. Not sure if that helps.
Don't know, haven't purchased (yet), but my question is where do you get the mounting posts for the satellite speakers that I've read about in some of the reviews. There is not any information about such an "accessory" on the Mfr's website. Is there a reference sheet provided in the box with the product?
I didn't work for my iPhone 5, so I'm not sure. My scratch may have been too deep. I don't know, but it not only didn't fix it, but left a rainbow-like pattern within the scratch. I wouldn't use it on the glass face.
unless there is a cable that can attach it to the docking station - I'd say no. The depression in the docking station can accomodate iphones, nano and ipods. Newer versions may have the capacity to hook up to an ipad - but not this one
I read somewhere that it was 120-150. I don't think Bose really focused on the "power rating" they were more about the quality of sound!
It's complicated, talk to Wilson tech support, they are pretty good. I am an end user, not an installer.
Hi, the other side is N-type. Typical coax on a TV is F-type which is not the same. This connector is generally for antenna wire - 75 Ohm. You'll find N-type on low loss cable for cell phone antennas etc.
That is the wave length of the light that will pass through it.
I have used them for gaming when my regular headphones broke, but not for regular use. If u had nothing else, I guess they would be fine, but not as a first choice. You can still hear too much background noise. Hope that helps! : )
I have the GE Simon XTi and it works fine.
No, just bare speaker wire can be fed in the back and tightened into place
yes mine did.
The Ultimate is the better card. There is no reason to get the Elite over the Ultimate. Why is it cheaper? SD has been out for a while, and these are just discounted more for the time being. Check other sites like newegg where you'll be paying $10 more for the Ultimate. Which is better for your cam? It certainly will never hurt to have a card capable of faster transfer. The 50x is certainly fast, and probably neglible speed noticeability upgrading to x120 for your Point n' Clicks, but you might as well invest for the future.
Yes. This memory card is compatible with the camera you asked about.
The Belkin RF Modulator lets you view DVDs, video games, and home videos on a TV that does not have audio video inputs. Simply plug the S-video or RCA-type outlets on your peripherals to a coaxial input on your TV and use the RF Modulator to connect your AV equipment through your television's RF jack.
That is really intelligent question to which I do not know the answer. I would suggest calling Pentax directly. If no latex is involved, I highly recommend this product. Every response to date to those who looked through them has been the same....WOW!
I don't know what your pin out configuration is but you'll need a connector that mates properly. Also, this is a dual frequency unit. I am displeased with the performance and purchase when mated to my Garmin 441s. Poor lock at speed and slow recovery and the unit is so big it acts as a trim tab on my 17' Boston Whaler. Airmar customer service did not follow through to resolution. I'll consider a different supplier next time though there are few. I hope this helps in some way.
Mine is on all the time. I think it just means the circuitry is working correctly to let you know it's available if needed.
No it doesn't. It fits perfectly with the iPad 3
Two I wish I new befor I ordered 2 boxes n for a unwanted 4
A tablet that size could easily fit inside this case along with a DSLR camera.
I have one and I've recently reviewed the manual. I recall there being a 10 second delay (to get in the picture), and a 2 second delay (for stabilization). The manual is downloadable from Kodak's website.
As I recall, it did come with a USB cable.
You'd have to ask the seller. Great camera though.
A decent match would be any decent amp that is around 1100w if youre getting two subs then get a 2000w amp. I bought two of these and a Pyle 2000w 2 channel amp and it sounds excellent for the price of it all! You should try to avoid getting an amp that is more powerful than your sub's as it is easier to blow them but you can always tune an amp down
Im pushing 500 watts rms to 1 sub with no problem so anything up to that it can take with no risk of blowing.
Sorry, we currently do not ship out of the United States.
xD and CompactFlash (CF)
I am not selling just commenting on a great camera. Mine came with a 1gb XD card.
it fit mine great!
2" in diameter
Couldn't say. Mine is on a desk where that's not an issue. But it will adjust to any degree, so that might help.
I have never had that problem. It is probably just your particular monitor. You need to contact Amazon and they will get you another or do something to help you out.
Only if you have a double din radio opening. Attaching bolt placement must also align to fit.
Not sure I have a 05 f150... Fit perfect on mine.
I don't know about your camera, but it works fine with the C330.
I am sorry but I do not know.
Ink cartridges come in a package with the photo paper. So, if you buy an ink cartridge and 12 sheets of paper you can print 12 sheets of paper. The ink and paper are very expensive.
Hello. I am having no luck with the CD-R's I have bought. Is there and brand that actually works in this machine? Thanks for your time, troy.
Not sure how much but they where a little heaver than the 8in pyle's that I have in my celica. They also looked realy cool with the cover that was provided. There is green detailing on them that I did not notice in the pictures. Hope that helps.
Yes they come in pairs
You will also need an amplifier and and amp wiring kit. [And probably an aftermarket radio] go to youtube and look up a guide on "how to install subwoofers in a car"
If it has 6.5 inch speakers. But seriously, don't waste your money. These things suck so bad
FYI, each box comes as a pair. So if you want 12 speakers, you only need to order 6 boxes. Other than that, the only limitation should be merchant availability.
sorry but we cannot ship to grenada.
About 5 7/16 diag on center... about 3 13/16... pretty standard 5.25 inch speakers... No complaints
You can see the full route map by doing the following: - when on your route, touch the current route instructions shown at the top of the map. - This opens a view of each step in your route. - At the bottom of the display, there is a button in the middle of the screen called "Show Map". Press this button. - This opens your full route map from your current location to the end point. Hope this helps.
I am not able to identify what lens you have. I can't find a 55mm f/1.8 lens. The polarizer I reviewed was a 52mm dia which is kind of the old standard for Nikon. The quick answer should be that if your lens has a 52mm thread diameter at the front of the lens it should work. The easy way to find out the thread diameter is to look at the lens cap. It will say the size of the cap which should be the same size as the polarizer filter you will need.
No these are for recording only. buy DVR-RW
No
No
Hi Johanna, this camcorder doesn't have that feature of live streaming via internet. -Ely
As far as I am aware these are for recording audio only.
It comes with a strap.
They are not thick at all, they work well in wire molding strips. Thick HDMI cables often break because they are to thick and have no flexibility..
Don't really know....
No I would say an inch or thicker. I was surprised how good the quality was when I recieved it. Gives a good connection and strong clear picture
JOrge, this cable worked for our computer to monitor set-up. It should not be a problem. All the best!
the bit rate of this cable is 6Gbit
No I would say an inch or thicker. I was surprised how good the quality was when I recieved it. Gives a good connection and strong clear picture
Yes
yes, i have ipod classic and the sound is great with these speakers
I have used it at a range of 20 ft but I expect it will work farther but not sure. I think the sensitivity is adjustable but I don't know the max range.
Sorry, can't answer you question, as I ordered this item a looong time ago, so I can't even remember what it was that I used for (I think I was using it for an old direct tv satellite box, but again, not sure). I think back when I ordered it, technology wasn't as advanced/complicated as it is today, so this item can go either way (work or not)... Good luck...
Not very good. These have pretty shallow sound.
This low-priced SONY does NOT have the bass for us to enjoy great sound produced by PS3. I use my other headsets (V-Moda) or (Tritton-PS3) for PS3.
Hello. I found this via Google. http://softadvice.informer.com/Mx_850_Editor_Software.html. If that doesnt work, I would go to your closest URC dealer and ask them if they can get a copy of it for you. Good luck
I just downloaded Skype for my Windows, and when I logged on it said to configure my webcam, so I'm guessing it picked it up. But, then Skype froze and I couldn't get it to work the rest of the night. So I'm just guessing that it works. I'll have to try again later. Hope this somewhat helps.
Yes. I bought this ages ago and it has been a champ for me since I got it, from XP to Vista to 7 to 8 RC, 8 release, and then 8.1.
I only used for a DCR-SR68.
nop rip off.
Yes they are great and kids cannot use iPad or phone etc without them We love these
Yes. In fact, my husband and I often use this headphone set if our 7-yr old son leaves them near our laptop.
No, in fact, it turned out to be a dud because a lot of the time it doesn't work and I need to jiggle the plug. The worst part is I can't tell if it is working until it is too late. A waste of money. I learned that it is best to stick with a wireless bluetooth device.
No this is a serial port adapter Video monitors do not connect to a serial port
First of all its going to run really hot. It's not going to give you a constant 120 volts maybe 117 but thats still safe for you eletronics. That's not a quick fix using the opti ups I woud contact the power company and have them come out and check it out the opti is used on old homes when there is a drop in voltage for a moment or to. Like when the ac unit kicks on. Sounds like you have a bad transformer on the electric pole. Ifs that the case they should replace it.
Yes
Sorry, never had to
The MX350 can be manually programmed using the Roku remote so I don't see why not.
There is no battery holder for this NP-F550. We suggest placing the battery in a sandwich back for protection from any external damage. We appreciate your inquiry. Alex G
NO i do not believe it is. I am extremely disappointing with this one. Problems I have: the swissgear logo on the back is upside down ( I like to think that this would have been noticed at swissgear), the zippers are horrible. the main pocket is already messed up and will not zip properly.
Big hands - Nikon, Small hands - XT. Budget - Pentax K100D, so you can save some bucks on non-stabilized lenses (it's in the body).
Send it back ASAP As it in warranty as Error 99 is a general error some time due to a out of range setting in manual mode setting in the camera, bad lens and flash mounts plus more one thing to remember digital cameras with auto lens are very complex thing Thus more things to go wrong. Canon makes a ton of these, so some can be bad which is why we have warranty's
Yes, but my wife prefers not to wear her glasses because she can focus without them.
I have had mine at least rhat long and have not had problem. Maybe battery?
You need a multimedia switch. Check out this site: http://www.cyberguys.com/templates/SearchDetail.asp?productID=2696
aluminum. Powerbook not macbook
It really depends if it's already on a cd being this is a old model of Apple product 2007 you can not even update this model to the newest update ... You will just have to try it out and see some games due work and some due not a big downfall for me...
Yes tris model does
You use IDE SATA Adapter to connect to new computers. If the new computer have 40 PIN IDE Connector, then use regular 40 pin Ide Cable to connect the hard drive.
16 gauge should be OK.
The top is silver. You can print on the disc but you have to use a marker. I use a sharpie.
These are not rewritable. For that you should get a DVD labeled +RW. On the +R you can add new material at the end if the disk is not full and it has not been finalized.
DVD+R divides a recorded title into chapters, making it easier to access something in the middle when playing it back. DVD-R treats each title as a single unit, requiring you to fast forward to anything in the middle.
In broad daylight, not too bad....in low light - pretty terrible. That said, I don't hardly use autofocus, and overall this lens is a good buy. I don't regret it.
Sigma DC lens are designed primarily for APS-C sensors (comparable to Canon's EF-S lens). They will work on full frame sensors but, as I understand it, the edges of the photo will be affected (darkened...) because the lens does not provide full coverage of the sensor.

Nhat, this lens will work with the D5100, just make sure you order the Nikon mount.

It is no a zoom lens. Might be an error on the listing. It is a 30mm prime lens with largest aperture of 1.4. FANTASTIC LENS
Hi Lady H, I use it on my DVD recorder. I believe it will work on any CD or DVD machine. It works well for me.
I would most certainly try the Digital Innovations disc first. Even if it doesn't fix it, she will always have it to keep cleaning her new DVD player. However, I read multiple reviews that claimed the DI disc resolved their problems. Before you go out and spend big bucks on a DVD player, try the Digital Innovations disc. I use it to clean my computer's DVD/CD and my DVD player in the living room and my boombox CD player. (yep..I still have a boom box) LOL ! Hope this helps.
Sometimes, but you would be better off buying their stereo mic.
Yes, use it all the time
This is not a scope I would think that would travel well. First off it is a Jones-Bird Reflector design which means it is difficult and somewhat time consuming to collimate. Travel would just complicate that more. The box is fairly large as well - As far as weight 30.9 x 16.9 x 8.5 inches ; 17 pounds assembled - 30 pounds packaged. You would be better off with a small refractor type scope for travel or a small maksutov-cassegrain around 90mm or so.
Yes
I'd suggest you just call Celestron and ask them. They're friendly and helpful, and then you'd know for sure.
As long as it has a 1/4" mounting screw on the bottom of the camera, then it will work. The camera sits on the platform and the clamp goes around the eyepiece of your telescope.
It twists off.
If u can get it in 8ohms yes, if not u would have to run two in series. Home stereos are usually 8ohm loads per channel
there isatape monitor and a loadness..but don't uses this with a plyle pro power amp ..there seems to be a voltage mismatch ..and you turn the volume al the way to the right tom get volume
Yes
You migh want to try something else I don't think this would work for you it did not work for me,here's a link for the one tha I'm sure it would work I've used them before and had no problems.good luck
As long as you don't exceed the 12 amp rating between the receiver and signal booster combined. I would install after the signal booster or to the receiver only.
you have to flip it over to play side 2
Yes! Just keep a steady hand.
The biggest difference is how close you want to get to your subject? What will you be shooting macros of the most? Is the Tamron a 2.8 also? Because that is a very nice aperture to have. As to whether the Tamron will work, I honestly don't know because I'm not familiar with your camera. The Tamron website should be able to tell you. I know people with Tamron lenses and they like them.
I don't know I have a t2
no, it was used
I don't think so.
will trip over 15Amp
Yes. I used it to hook up to a new receiver for my Toyota Highlander without an external amp.
Thats exactly what i have a 2007 ford f150, the one i purchased, plugged right in and no problem watsoever
Aubrey - I have an '07 F250 Lariat w/Steering wheel controls (SWC). You will need this wiring harness and the "Metra Axxess ASWC-1 Universal Steering Wheel Control Interface". I posted a review for this wiring harness that explains some incompatibilities between the two products and how to overcome them.
Yes, this indeed will fit your outback. I drive a 01 Forester and it fits; all Subarus in this time period have the same stereo mounts. Just make sure you read the directions and use the correct pieces from the kit. It comes with several different pieces to make itself more universal; therefor, you don't use all of the pieces that come with it.
I am not sure I understand your question. shutter lag is 0.37 seconds. Top shutter speed 1/8000 second. Top standard flash sync speed 1/250 second (may be pushed to 1/8000 depending on the flash). Estimated shutter lifetime cycles 150,000. I hope this helps.
Yes it works with standard AA size rechargeables. I use it with 4 Sony 2500 mah and works fine.
Oh, yes, it does play cassettes, and very well, too. I'd highly recommend it for your mom or for anyone else, as availability for buying (good) boom boxes with tape-playing capabilities dwindles with each passing quarter. Hope this helps!
The the lower the ohms the MORE volume you have. So 24 ohms will be a bit louder than 32 ohms, you could a one time buy headphones with a 16 ohms. But now most headphones are 32 ohms. T. Smith has given you the wrong answer. Anyone else want to confirm this?
No it does not.
I also would like to know if they are silver or black. http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/pna/v3/pg/product/details/0,,2076_310069639_108990338,00.html On Pioneer's site they are black. I do not see anything in regard to a special edition or something...
Yes. Visit www.gomadic.com They have a charger. Amazon also carries the product. It's around $20.00
Hi. I think that if you are looking for a point and shot like that, it is better to buy a DSLR entry level and consider buying a lens zoom, at the same time or when you can. You will appreciate my advice.
no, just make sure you leave the song in your itunes playlist (and stop it deleting automatically in your options settings). it will have a little exclamation point next to it but as long as you dont actually delete it from the playlist it wont delete it from your ipod. I dont have space to hold all the music on my ipod on my pc so i did exactly this.
The 5D can take up to 800 shots on a fully charged BP-511A battery. ^^
yes it should do just fine
Battery life is around two hours and you can swap out the battery easily.
Works perfectly fine
I do nor know. My apologies

I ordered Tamron 1.4x for my Nikon. I have not had any problems with the Teleconverter. But realize that I made sure it was for a Nikon not Canon.
I have a 75-300 zoom and it does in fact autofocus.
I believe so. Mine has them but the surface is actually smooth.
this Logitech MX518 optical gaming mouse "rebate" is good thru 2/26/2011. the URL for rebate is shown below: http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/00/00/13/04/44/67/1304446730._V170842935_.pdf
Yes
The sigma 24-70 is also for full frame (DG), but yes, it'll work with the d5000 and it's cheaper than the nikon.
I meant yes it will work.
Yes it will work
I meant yes it will work.
I have the Canon 7d and it works find with it. I don't know about the Nikon.
Yes
Yes it can! That's why I purchased it. With a bit of glue, a 3" to 2" PVC pipe reducer, an AC to USB adapter, and a few zip ties I now have a fan that attaches to my washer. Saved me about $40 over the washer kit you can buy online. I leave it on all the time and it keeps the mold away.
The VR knob controls the speed of the fan.
Hi Juan, No, those specs are incorrect. The dimensions are about 4" by 5" and about an inch and a half high. I would estimate the weight to be about six ounces. The product has worked perfectly so far. I would not describe it as rgggedly built, but it gets the job done. I hope this helps. Tom
Not with this model. There are two pretty good built-in speakers. There are also plugs for external speakers if you want something with richer sound and a sub-woofer.
Yes, the earpads conform well enough that these are comfortable to wear over glasses for hours. I should know because I wear glasses and they fit just fine over the legs of the glasses. I hope I answered your question with what you want to hear.
You bet. You'll need an adaptor to combine the mic and speaker cables, but works like a charm.
This is a traditional set of speakers with the two wire cable that connects to the back of a stereo amplifier. I also have the type of set that can be used with the 3.5mm connector and this set from Dual does not have one.
What is an airwatt
Our house is 3000 sq ft.
To be honest, I don't know for sure, but I strongly suspect you can use with mac. It just requires a USB port. Plug in the dongle and it loads a generic keyboard driver, at least with Windows, but I don't know why it would not work with Mac too.
This simple cable is to connect 1 VGA (Computer/Output) to 2 (Monitors/Inputs), which is useful for having 2 monitors in different locations viewing the same output, like a security system video output. If you want to connect 2 Towers (Computers) to 1 Monitor, you will need a VGA Switch box or a KVM to be able to select which Computer to be displayed on the Monitor.
I don't think so because the device requires a disk. It will play mp3 files but you can't download directly to the player.
There aren't any instructions needed. All you do is put in the cd and press play.
The filter has worked well for me to reduce glare on windows, water, etc, so I assume it will work well on paintings. (I've not shot paintings with the filter, however.) I'm always amazed at how the view changes as I turn the filter. The results you get will rest somewhat on your lighting scheme--I assume you'll shoot with two diffused light sources, set at 45 degrees on either side of the painting. You can return the filter within 30 days of delivery if it doesn't work as well as you hope.
no, direct sunlight may still enter the lens/
I do not believe that these speakers are compatible with a computer. I believe that you will need amplified speakers with a single connector that plugs into your computer speaker output.
Hi Krish, yes, the camera will fit inside this case. Thanks_Mitch
I and many other people who bought and used this do NOT recommend that you buy it. :-)
The short answer is No. Twc or DirectTV boxes will not let you output . Apart from that, the DVC 20 is a piece of garbage.
No, it will not show song lyrics. It will show the artist and song. If you attached a pic then it will show the CD cover, song and artist. Hope this helped.
No, the 880 is strictly IR only.
TOP!
According to the product description I am seeing and reading, 100 pages of the Ultra Pro 2-pocket for $19.86, which should come in the paper box you also see in this listing. Hope this helps.
Yes the one I got did
yes it is
Yes it does.
yep...it apparently doesn't cycle the battery so you have to keep unplugging it when it is full...if you disconnect the battery, you can still use it with the power cord plugged in. i haven't had any luck locating a battery for it, yet. (i can't find anything about it on wacom's website or any replacements at the "we carry every battery known to man" stores...apparently they're all liars.)
I meant yes it will work.
no HSM (hyper sonic motor) so it wont work with the d3000 series and d5000 series. if yours has a built in focus motor, then your good
You should have no issues, but if you're uncertain, you can consider what I did -- which is to use a Monster On-The-Go Power Strip -- http://www.amazon.com/Monster-MP-OTG400-BK-Outlets/dp/B000F9YN2M/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1400744672&sr=8-2&keywords=monster+power+strip to connect to the outlet, then plug your Note 3 into the Monster Power Strip. This way you have the power strip to buffer against any surges.
If it is a canon mount then yes.
It should. But, the Amazon website will explain what Canon Cameras to which it will fit.
If I remember correctly, you hold down the "play/pause" button.
The difference between the two is the Zen Nano Plus has direct cd recording. I don't know for sure why there is such a big price difference but my guess would be that the Zen Nano isn't produced anymore (the Zen Nano Plus is an upgrade) and so there's a limited quantity.
Well moniter will work with a security system,if the system you have has hook up for computer monitor
The monitor is very basic. The screen was easily visible but, would likely have issues in a bright room. This monitor was made before some of the newer, fancier capabilities came out.
I just received my shipment today, when I bought them I thought it said a piece. They are pairs. I ordered 4 thinking I was getting 2 sets, but I got 4.They are abouyt 1 1/4 " without holders, about 1 7/8" with the holders. They sound great.
Went on a trip with my new D50 and it stopped working after 5-6 pictures. Showed an error message. When I got back home I decided to read the book. Seems the lens slipped out of F22 to F16. Rotating the F-ring back to F22 fixed the problem. Ignorant me. Since then I try to only purchase lenses with a little snaplock on the f-ring. Problem solved.
I totally agree with you!! Amazon should update the shipment date online. I personally feel that it is very deceiving to customers. I ordered the Nikon D50 on June 22. Amazon kept pushing the delievery date for 3 to 4 times. I just cancelled my order of Nikon d50 from Amazon and order it elsewhere.
it should but it is a pain trying to install this as you have to break parts of the plastic off to fit your car hurt myself a few times doing it for a 2004 cr-v
Standard play is 60 minutes. Long play is 120 minutes. Some machines allow SLP (not recommended), for longer record times. 60 Minutes will provide best recorded play back.
I believe it does, but I don't have the camera with me at this time.
Most Nikon lenses are interchangeable from cameras... It should.
yes. The only lens F5 cannot use is "pre-AI" whatever that means. per http://www.nikonians.org/reviews?alias=nikon-slr-camera-and-lens-compatibility
Yes but i used sterio
the ad says "Sony AC L200" and it also says "by Sony", and one of the reviewers says "Good OEM product", and another says "the power supply is an original Sony part..." Yes.
This unit only works with XM service.
Yes. It comes with the antenna and the data cord from the unit to your Pioneer head unit. Check your head unit to make sure it's compatible. It will have a large data port in the back and it will say XM ready on the front.
I don't see any reason you can't. I have one for my radio in my truck. Of course, I bought mine new and it came with an auto type antenna with a magnetic base, but any XM antenna should work with this tuner as long as it has the correct sized male input.
Very high
I don't know understand your question. I used this for Comcast cable here in Maryland until my service started having problems. Not sure if it was this modem or something with Comcast signals. But I've since purchased another modem and Comcast works fine. Hope this response helps
Not sure.
yes, the power cord comes with it. the only draw back was that the cable company service is required to activate the device. According to my cable company I was not able to use it with my existing service as an extra box without incurring an extra fee.
This thread should help: http://priuschat.com/threads/improving-xm-satellite-radio-reception.129447/page-2#post-2030256
We have 195 pieces in stock. Shipping from California.
Yes, this product is identical with that picture, I recommend this product, it is very good with any devices specially with ps3!
I don't know if it will fit the 75" Samsung. It fit my 60" Samsung with no problem.
I'm not sure, but you can always buy a power adaptor that can handle both
I used the Dynex to convert my converter box signal to a coax cable signal in order to run it to another room. My TiVo had RCA style connections for output that connected to the input jacks on the Dynex. I then connected coax cable to the Dynex that ran to the kitchen and attached to my TV there. The aim was to have the same signal in the family room and the kitchen at the same time. I hope this helps
The rca's are in and rf (antenna) out. This works with the ROKU LT.
Yes, I believe so, but not when using S-Video input. S-Video is video only; no sound. The RCA jacks will accept audio, and it should be sent out over the coax just like TV.
No
no....if you download your pictures to any PC, you can print with any printer. Use the included cable or if you are using a memory card (which you should), you can use almost any card reader, usb or built-in to print from.
Did not work for me, as it ha as to be connected to the Internet
Wi-Fi only. But a great Wi-Fi booster.
yes it does or at least I use this one here. Its small, but works well. You have to set your camera to trigger from it but thats easy. You select "Remote" in the same menu where you select the self timer ( the Fn button on the back of my *ist DS) Pentax Remote Control F for Pentax Digital Cameras
As long as you observe CPAP electric current draw demands made on the converter, the CPAP should work.
Yes
No
It is the complete thing. Base and headphones. My husband really likes the unit.
I did a web search and found that they are manufactured in Japan, Taiwan, and Luxemburg. So, whatever you buy, your guess is as good as mine as to origin. Here's a web site that gives country of origin for various DVDs: http://www.digitalfaq.com/reviews/dvd-media.htm
They are blank, silver. No irritating lines which is one reason I like the TDK brand. The most important reason is that I have never had a bad burn...except when I screw up :)
Office Depot sells an Xtra-Drive which is a USB based shell in effect that you can just slip your SD card in a slot, then plug it in and drag and drop or copy using My Computer. All you need is a front panel USB port. Works wonders. The adapter costs about 7-10 bucks. I forget exactly.
I could not find that specific Acer computer on the Crucial site. It helps to know if it is a desktop, notebook or netbook computer. You can go to the Crucial web site (http://www.crucial.com/) and use the Memory Advisor tool. It can even scan your computer to make sure it has the right information to suggest the proper memory for it.
Nirav, Crucial's website recommends a different part # than this one, but all the specs on it are the same as this one so it should work. As a side note, crucial's website had memory for the pavillion a1130n, a1130n-dk, and 1130n-uk. This memory will work for the a1130n only; the other two systems require a different type of memory altogether so just be sure you are upgrading the correct system.
demand and supply
I bought the same unit.........and confused what cable to get. I am hooking this up to a Sony Bravia HDTV 720P .......I want the capability to record in HD, and not sure what HDMI cable to get with all the price differences.......DId anyone tell you which one to get?
Sorry i sold my car but this alarm did good its small but really loud sounds like a actually alarm instead of police sirens and fire trucks i had sirens like the one you was describing but this one was great
It depends on the model of alarm you have from DEI ELECTRONICS. If your looking to replace the factory ford remote, it will not replace it.
No, it has a microphone on it that you have to speak into or play a recorded message into. I took my button apart so I would not hear the clicking of the button in the recorded message as it is attach to the microphone...
Both at the same time.
download logitech setpoint from their website and install.
No it does not have the brightness keys, or several others on the Apple keyboard. It does have volume control though
Yes it will attach to vinyl siding but you need to make sure the screws are anchored to the siding/house tightly. It does put a strain on whatever it is attached to.
You're not really going to find an equatorial mount for this scope. Your best bet with this scope is to get a wedge like this one. http://www.amazon.com/Celestron-CPC-Heavy-Duty-Wedge/dp/B0040GXO8K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1385039107&sr=8-1&keywords=celestron+wedge
I don't know.
as far as I know, the mounts are nikon and canon..
This lens was made by Sigma for Canon cameras only. I do not think it will be compatible with Sony products.
Don't fool around. Go with the 28-300mm. Less lens changes and it just the perfect walk around lens. I know, I've been shooting for 35 years.
as far as I know, the mounts are nikon and canon..
Yes, I have printed over 50 DVDs with my Canon MX922 & Canon MX882 with not problems at all.
I have a Nikon D3000 and it fits perfectly and works awesome!
I am quite sure that it will,just have too find the particular model that fits the Nikon mount....you wont be disappointed in the lens......
It fits all full frame Nikons, both of the cameras you refer to are not full frame cameras. I recommend the Sigma 70-300mm f/4-5.6 SLD DG Macro Lens with built in motor for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras. It is fully compatible and has a wider focusing range and internal motor. You will have more versatility and be happier with the results.
This is something I would not know. I do not own the D700. However you could use the internet to look up the type of shutter remote it is to see if it would work. I do know a lot of Nikon items are inter changeable with other Nikons. Good luck I am sure you will find the answer to your question.
most likely. I just measured the inside distance between the "spring clips" and it's about 62-63 mm. I use mine on a Canon fixed lens that uses 58mm lens cap. I added an inexpensive ring adapter so the Raynox would have plenty of room to hang onto but that's probably not necessary. Hope this helps you!
No you just squeeze the sides and it holds on to your lens.
The strap is about 40 inches, connects to camera, very durable.
There aren't any hooks. They have the nylon straps that go through the camera loop and loops back into a plastic belt like holder.
Uses a "wall wart" power converter. Just use any generic 9volt DC converter that you have.
This is a pre-amp for turntable MM cartridges only & not a Mic pre-amp. Sorry...
Yes. Everything you need is included.
no. the omni 127 uses 1.25 diameter eye pieces. these are 2 inch.
There are connections (red, white, yellow). The connection to the cable input is on the back also. You can download the manual by searching for the model number and panasonic.
I have no European casettes so I do not know. Sorry.
Compatible how? There is an ipod camera adapter you can get. Just search for B00083PGFS That should let you hook up a digital camera and download the pictures to your ipod.
If the person who posted before me actually has battery life that poor, he should return his product. I have the 30GB and I tested my battery life, twice. The first time I got 14 hrs, 15 min, and the second I got 13 hrs, 50 min. The battery life is as advertised. If you read reviews for the product on many diff sites, you'll find that often the battery life even exceeds what Apple claims.
I got a response from Sony - its a known problem with the new sony pictures copy protection scheme. The unit can be mailed in to Texas for service to make it compatible. Ill pass on that for now and wait and see if other movies become an issue (or stop watching sony movies)...
Believe they are acrylic
YES, you CAN use the Garmin StreetPilot 2720 as a speedometer. I use it all the time to check speedometer calibration in my vehicles. However the numbers are about 3/4 inch high when it is in the Map mode. It also gives you the number of miles remaining to your destination as well as Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA). If you reset it when you start your trip, you can also use its Trip-odometer feature to determine fuel economy.
Yes it is. I have used wireless Logitech mouse for past few years and works well with this keyboard
Hi, Jerry! The manual says to use speakers "with an impedance of 8 ohms or more." The speaker connections are not RCA, they're bare wire connectors with a screw-on type fitting. I hope this helps you out. Good luck. By the way and for what it's worth, we've enjoyed our amp and it hasn't disappointed us at all.
I have mine connected to a Technics turntable a JVC CD player and they both work fine.
Don't know what Lomo Diana F+ Instant Back is. This camera provides a print photo on the spot. Nothing digital, just a single photo print.
I think they are glass. I like these binoculars so much that I purchased another pair for my son in law. He also likes them.
Not by the user.
Yes!! It comes with its original strap.
Yes it will.
Amazon is the best place to purchase cameras. Most importantly, if you have any second thoughts after receiving the merchandise, Amazon will always take it back. No questions. THey are the best.
Yes
it worked to connect my Sony Video Camera to my iMac. Keep in mind the computer did not automatically see the camera. I had to open the video software, which recognized the video camera
For a car you need to get the car mounting kit. Comes with a window suction mount and a cig lighter power plug too. You have to use the bluetooth headset when it on the bike OR in the car. No audio plug in or output jack.
Yes - it's what I'm using too.
They should work well enough even without active noise-cancellation. The earcups do a decent job of blocking out unwanted noise, but if isolation is your biggest need, then Sennheiser HD280's might be better suited for you.
You can but, honestly, it's one of those get what you pay for products. The strobe can't be adjusted in regards to power, you have to use the warm filter just tiger a balanced color, as it is as warm as spilling light blue pair on your subject. Would NOT recommend.
Yes that is exactly what I got. Haven't used it much but they do fit.
i've had a couple of these kits...you can do pretty much what you want...cant hurt..i personally do not use mask..some people put elect. tape around the back where the door meets the camera body to lesson light leaks..thats the only extra thing i've seen other photogs do..good luck tons of fun
If your laptop has a usb port it will recognize it and name the floppy drive. Just open the drive with a double click, view files and transfer what you like.
Yes. That is the only thing I put in it.
I use the macro with a single focus point. I found if I use multifocus the object will sometimes focus on the wrong area. It works great with insects small vegetation with water drops etc.
I purchased this lens for a Nikon camera. Unless your Black Magic cinema camera has a Nikkor compatible mount it will not fit. Order the lens with Canon mount.
Requires A/C power.
According to the Mount Finder tool on the manufacturer's website this mount is compatible with the Samsung UN75H7150
I don't believe so. The remote does not detach. You should check Sony's website for one. There are others like varizoom that make universal remotes and zoom rockers that can attach to tripod arms.
It has a headphone/line out for audio output, so you can plug in a headphone to RCA red/white cable for external speakers or just plug in computer speakers. Everytime you power it off, the CD starts from the first track, so it doesn't have that feature. This is just a normal CD player, just with Bose branding. It has excellent sound quality output and is better at reading scratched discs than other CD players though. Bose used to sell it for $50 about 5 years ago.
no. anyone will not work. take it to radio shack, they have the adapter and power supply in stock. Take the unit with you.
I have never tried. My older Bose radio has no cord to connect. My newer ones have players on them. I'll have to see if I can find cord that will connect my older radio with this player.
Yes
http://www.amazon.com/Pedco-UltraPod-Lightweight-Camera-Tripod/dp/B000ANCPNM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1359150733&sr=8-1&keywords=pedco+ultrapod George: I'm not sure, but I think it will, as long as the kit lens is not very long or heavy. You may want to look into the Ultrapod II, it is made for DSLR's and is only $6.00 more. I am sure that The Pedco Ultrapod II would fit your needs.
from leg to tip is 12-1/4 inches. Sorry but I'm not familar with ultrapod II.
We have three portable, interlinked phones that rest in charging bases and when the phone is in the base it's off. The headset plugs into any of the phones and can be used walking around the house, sitting in room away from the base, etc. It would defeat the portability of the phone to plug it into a base and I don't believe it's possible in our system.
That depends on the size and wiring of your jack. The plug is 2.5mm in diameter and has three conductors. It fits into the jack of my Panasonic cordless phone
No
My recollection is that there wasn't much volume control. This was a pretty decent (and inexpensive) headset for some phones but it did not do well for outgoing volume when I switched to a Panasonic cordless phone. I now use a Panasonic KX-TCA60 headset.
It has a 2.5 mm male plug, too small for PC and Samsung pjhones which are 3.5mm size.
Yes, it will work with any EOS camera with a type A body.
I'm not familiar with that camera, so I don't know for sure, but check the manual or look up the camera features online and see if it can use TTL metering. If it can, then it should work with the 430EX. The 430EX normally uses E-TTL, but it is backward compatible with TTL. I'm not sure what you mean by "430EX 11" so I don't know about your second question.
I downloaded an aftermarket application and driver bundle called "TV Expert" to get mine to work. It's a little glitchy, but my kids can now play games from an external console through it.
Yes it will. It's standard PCI. This card is a bit of a pain to setup though. That and the SD quality are why it's so cheap I believe.
Its a crap shoot, to each there own, Pioneer is tauted as the better plasma, as far as LCD, my opinion it comes down to asthetics/appearance of the set, features, etc. basicly which ever one your perfer, but more importantly than any brand name... think about getting an extended warranty, they are astronomical to repair, minimum of $500.00 (parts/labor). Warranty is well worth the piece of mind.
No.
Yes... they are not magic :)
The battery is a 3 volt CR-2025. It's readily available at Amazon and Radio Shack among other dealers. Check this website: http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9599/~/purchasing-a-replacement-remote-for-my-mm50
Nope... plays but dosent charge
Did you find the answer? I would like to know the same thing.
Yes. But the warranty sucks. They dont repair it.
no atleast I don't think so the 210 film is much bigger then the mini
Yes, they all use the same size photo cartridge. You can even use it with the Polariod version of the instant mini cameras.
I'm using this tripod with a Canon T3i with a 18-135mm, and it works fine. This tripod is actually bigger and stronger than I had thought initially, and while it may not be very practical to carry, it certainly is very strong.
Approximately 2" I gave wrong answer before.
I'd talk to the manufacturer - I ran into the reverse problem, trying to step down from US 220 outlet to a 110 circuit. I finally got them to acknowledge that it doesn't do that - it is made for international use, like taking US appliances to Europe and Asia.
It will fit around a device that is not exactly the dimensions of the GPS. If the fish finder is close to the width of the Gps it should work fine. It attached with Velcro that can be put anywhere along the device.
Absolutely. My girlfriend used it step down the usable vlotage to US bought appliances
yes, I don't know why not. I had to replace my radio & I just called them with the new serial # & they hooked it right up. I love my Roady! I think it's their easiest receiver to maneuver in the car.
yes
YES it does
yes.
No
I use two outlets for an external 200w amp and 250w subwoofer and have no issues. When I power on, I do notice the lights in the room dim momentarily despite the sub amp being on a delay turn-on outlet. This unit saved my equipment when we had an abnormal voltage of 131vac. The warning light came on and I called Com Ed to fix problem.
It works just like a normal screen. But you will need the pimary screen to setup it up
NO. VIVITEQ INC
Certainly. The description states "ideal for both digital and 35mm SLR cameras". However, pairing up a Sigma with a 6D would remind me of putting a Hyundai hood on a Lexus! Of course it will be the cheapest 28mm at 2.8 aperture you can buy for a full frame camera, but please expect the quality to follow..
The CP510 is much older technology than the 5C. There may be some apps you could use to help you print but I am not sure this will work. You may want to look at a newer model and ask canon.
No, the 24-105L is not a macro lens. It can focus relatively close -- but the maximum magnification is only .23 times life-size. For macro, the standard with recent lenses has been a magnification of .5 times or greater.
Yes, this is a common practice with resellers where they break apart a package deal and resell the parts of the set separately at a reduced price. You may or may not get the factory warranty here? You should call or message the seller to find out what is going on. If the product is new and the seller is willing to state so it could be a good deal for you. This is how I bought mine and it has been a great piece of "L" glass for me.
No. I am sure there are better choices. In fact I just removed and recycled this switch. It became very unresponsive to the remote and I can no longer recommend this product.
I see no reason why not as long as you locate the correct 240v power supply. I haven't checked but I am guessing the power supply shipped with it is 110v-120v. The unit itself runs on 12v DC.
depends on how strong the signal is getting sent out...I'd say 500 feet is very far...I used it for about 100 feet, through a metal garage however, but it struggled. It also depends on how strong the wireless adapter is that's built in the computer (that you're hooking this up to). a better solution is a wireless bridge.
Sorry, no.
It is possible if you have very few things in the way. You may need a 1/2 watt or 1 watt power booster. If you have to Hawking antennas aimed at each other it should increase your range. Be sure to check on speed to make sure the connection works correctly. Sometimes you can have a good link and no speed.
Yes it will. I have a Canon XTI and it fits just fine.
It is a universal fit diffuser so there should be no problem with installing/uninstalling. Working "well" is a bit too subjective to answer, be subjected to your personal preferences of the result. Bit it will work.
Hi Steve, I'm Jewel with Kingston Technical Support, here to answer your question. part number KVR667D2S5/1G is not compatible with your Dell Dimension C521 as it is notebook size memory and your system needs desktop size memory. The compatible and recommended part number is KTD-DM8400B/1G. For any further assistance, please call us at 1-800-435-0640 (USA and Canada only) M - F 6am - 6pm PT and I or another available Technician will assist you. Thank you for selecting Kingston as your upgrade partner.
Yes, this unit has wireless wifi capability, BUT you have to buy the USB dongle. My experience is that performance is inconsistent, and too often I would get a message saying my internet connection was too slow, after multiple long pauses for rebuffering. This was particularly a problem with streaming Netflix. Now I only use the unit for the audio for my home theatre system, because the Blu-Ray player won't play Blu-Rays and can't be updated, and the issues with the wifi reception.
No
It should fit any standard mounting bracket. Ours was super easy to mount from the ceiling.
I doubt it. This is too thin to diffuse something directly touching it. You would need some kind of thick plastic or foam.
no it's not look like it thinner , I haven't use before the TRC 90509-8, but as the picture it doesn't look it thinner, sorry couldn't help as you wnat
I do not know
Yes you can, though it's relatively dark and of course changes the colors. I bought this after reading about the effects of blue light on circadian rhythms. I didn't have a good way to temporarily attach this to my laptop, so I opted for amber glasses at night instead.
can't help you
No it does not come with the clear dust fabric cover. At least the one I purchased did not have one. Great product and price however!
Personally I would use these for your mids and rears. Get a matching LCR set like the pl-89s and a pl-28 for the center. If you must be all in wall, you will need seven total. If you get fronts with a center you will only need 4.
I have an Boston Acoustics 2 way in wall speaker, it has an 8" speaker, pretty good sound. I might move to a bigger one someday, but it works great.
You would want to use in wall speakers since the sound is being directed AT you instead of on top or over you as with in ceiling speakers. Bic makes an almost identical in wall......model ht8w I believe. The tweeter is separated from the woofer and also has gain adjustments.
Yes, you are able to switch between manual and auto focus on this lens by sliding the ring on the lens forward for auto focus or back for manual focus.
This remote work with all Toshiba models.
Many of the reviews indicate this item does not work. I do not know if it is specific to models.
No, there's no pause function to record multiple times during the 10 second sequence. You would have to plan how to get all your sounds on the recording in one shot. Hope that helps.
Absolutely. It basically reads two magnets. One attached to a spoke for speed based on the circumference of your wheel. The second one attachs to the crank arm and measures cadence as each time the crank arm magnet passes the cadence sensor. The bike's gearing speeds have nothing to do with it. The 10 is simply Garmin ' model number.
With a minimum focal length of 18mm you likely need a lower profile filter than this. A UV filter generally has no tint but is treated to reduce the effects of UV rays and will brighten colors.
This Product works perfect with Vista , but only with windows media player 11 , no other players work with it. Robert
No question, the Roku is much better. My review of the Duet: http://piaw.blogspot.com/2009/08/review-squeezebox-duet.html My review of the Soundbridge: http://piaw.blogspot.com/2009/09/review-roku-soundbridge.html
The model I had did not have a camera.
The sound is awesome, just keep in mind that based upon the width you will need to install it parallel to the studs (joists?) in the ceiling or you'll need to cut the studs and frame it in if you need to go perpendicular.
No. You have to burn your Itunes songs to a CD, rip them into the Creative Platform and then load them on to the player.
The warranty is supposed to be 12 months parts and 12 months labor. Thats what i saw in another website.
yes
There's already an "operating system" (quotes, because it's not really much of an operating system) on the hard drive, which takes up that extra 38MB that are in a gigabyte. So you have to lose a little bit. You didn't get cheated.
The one I have does work with the garmin nuvi 255W
You are so right and Amazon had this for $16.54 in October. The price has gone up even more since your post!
According to the features section in the ad: Compatible with nvi series GPS navigators, except nvi 3700 series (3750, 3760T, 3790T) GPS navigators.
I do not believe you can mount the monitor backwards, although, if you look at the pole with the monitor base plate, it can spin 360 degrees. It has two allen wrench screws that can be loosened and tighten to secure the tv screen in place. That is why I purchased it, it is very flexible to place the tv screen in position for watching or storage. The only caution is do not over tighten scews, as the allen wrench opening may strip. I need to find a few replacements. :) Best of luck, Greg
Reading the description...Compatibility: iPod nano (1G only), iPod mini, iPod 3G, iPod 4G with click wheel, iPod color, iPod video. I t says nothing about phones at all so I would think not.
By Michael Paradis "Diceman" (St. Louis, MO USA) On the FM transmitter box, push the middle button (Function) and then press and hold the "Mode" button (the right one) for approximately 10 seconds. When you let go you will see a menu for "Us" "Eu" "Ja", select the middle button, "Eu". Let the device sit for a few seconds until it goes back to the main screen, then tune your radio and the transmitter to 87.7 - 87.9! Now you can use the device on the frequencies that will rarely give you interference.
Just a more powerful nic then stock.
No, the osx 10.7 is the last upgrade you can do.
Hi D. Chaves, this Sony battery is a G-type battery, in which your Sony Cybershot W800/B uses N-type battery. Exact model number for Cybershot battery is NP-BN1. Hope this helps. -Ely
Does the D3300 have a built in focus motor?...if it doesn't this won't work
Only if you have the built in Focus Drive Motor...check your manual.
Hello: Could you tell me what MAC you have please? I can not get my Sansa e280 8gig device to connect with my G4 emac. The screen of the Sansa says connected but nothing showing on my Mac. It did show as a volume a few times. Why only a few times I don't know. I have the USB mode set to MSC. Thanks for any help.
No! But you can have Costco convert it onto a DVD.
It's okay, if you're just reviewing work. My friend had recorded her kids singing using hers. It's okay, sort of comparable to a tape-based microrecorder - 32kbps bitrate for the recorded audio. Wouldn't do well with background accompaniment.
You can only delete files while it is hooked up to the computer via USB cable. There is no way to do it using the buttons on the player. When hooked up via USB, you will see an extra drive appear in Windows explorer. Simply right-click on the file you wish to delete, and select "delete". You can also delete files from the device using Windows media player (I have v10), which is probably the best way. There is an "explore device" button near the bottom when you have the player plugged in.
Hi Mark: I found that there is a bug in my 250 at least (it was refurbished) which makes the volume drop way off if I don't have all the equalizer settings in 'custom' set to EXACTLY FLAT. If you do that and OK it with the checkmark, on mine, suddenly the volume goes up. Sorry no idea what firmware I have.
Yes, they do: isopropyl alcohol, C3H7OH, a common rubbing alcohol; search the web for possible reactions; no problem for optical lenses, of course.
No
I went to JBL's Website and compared the white and black On Tour speakers. They were exactly the same. I think the reason the white model is more expensive is because it matches the ipod in color. Maybe they think ipod users would be willing to pay more to match their system.
These speakers work with almost anything earphones would.. Mini male to male stereo cord required for connection..
It is a two channel cable. Two cables stuck together. 2 plugs at each end. I used it as a signal cable for right and left channels of a stereo system.
It does work with a Macbook Pro laptop. However, it will depend on your computers model if it supports the software when you press the Menu button. Mine, for instance, does not include this software anymore (Apple decided to cut it out) so it is good for up volume, down volume, next song, previous song, pause, play. Hope this is useful.
It works with several Apple products so I would think it would yes.
It won't work with a 4S (3G) iPhone. It displays the message "not compatible with this accessory".
Since I use the Edge 305 mostly for my bike I did decide to get the bike specific model instead of the Forerunner which is made to go both ways. I found a cheap cell phone holder with a clear plastic front that fits the Edge 305 perfectly. I clip it to my shorts and it works perfectly. The only issue is that it does not calculate calories burned correctly when running or walking. I'm quite happy with the solution.
I have been struggled with my own so don't know I can help.
I read somewhere the "technical stuff" on this unit and I cannot remember what it was. I use it with my Logitech keyboard and it works fine for the most part. Just get some extension plugs because it blocks the other USB port beside it.
Yes
The ATX mother board dimension's 12"x9.5". The Micro ATX mother board dimension's 11.2"x8.2". The Bags are 10-in x 14-in. I have aready used one of them to return a defective motherboard. Regards R O Wright - vanairent.com
No ABC Channel...... I live in the City less than 8 miles from ABC Station
No, a computer is going to need a lot more power than this can carry.
It should work fine. The RJ45 ends are going to be the same size. If you are going for a fully grounded system, then you might want to find something else.
no
Nope. You need a phone bridge module. See leviton 47689b
There are no provisions for the shield on this patch panel. If using a shielded cat 6 you will have to come up with some sort of termination for the shield wire from the cables to the isolated ground. No big deal, it's just not included on the panel.
Assuming the dimension are of a CPU tower and 7.5" is the width across the front of the CPU, then this mounting bracket will fit.
There are a couple of heavy plastic bars that screw into the top, then the straps go through the bars and around your CPU and tighten up. The straps really hold it securely. I have an 80 lb dog that likes to get under my desk and he hasn't moved it yet and I've had it for over a year.
It's designed to capture the case within...but where there's a will....
My Mom Lost her usb cable for her D-510 zoom olympus 2.1 camedia i have looked all over, mom is stresed out please help before i become an orphan!!! Robert
My car also has no aux port. I had the install done with a wired FM connection to the car's antenna. I live in an urban area (Miami) and can find a clear channel. Sometimes when I drive around I have to change the FM channel to find a clear one, but it is usually not a problem. I've had the unit since June 2007. The wire to the iPod went bad, so I just bought another one to install and replace the unit I have.

(THIS IS SPECIFIC TO FLASH MODE ONLY) No, when metering in flash mode you set the shutter speed and then take the reading and then adjust the power of the flash and take another reading to get the f-stop. If you try to adjust the f-stop in flash mode it just clears the reading.
Not directly. You need adapter to mount it. Also this lens is very heavy relatively to the Pen body. I will not recommend IMHO.
I use it with my Olympus E-510 and it seems to work. Cannot offer any help with use on other cameras.
Yes, all WRT54GL routers operates on 2.4GHz only. As for the version number, it can either be version 1.0 or 1.1 depending on which is available in Amazon.
About 3/4"
The fish finder floats just under the surface so it shouldn't get anywhere near rocks or reef on the bottom.
I have an HP 6P and Win7 64bit and it works...
Im using a MBP and a 4X6 tablet right now...and am going to take back the 4X6 beacuse it is too small and feels "jerkey" to me. It is only about 1/4 the size of your laptop, so a small move becomes a pretty big one onscreen. You may have different needs, as I am using mine for CAD (yes, they are *wonderful* for CAD), so keep that in mind.
CatsAndStuff...yes, I currently have my Samsung Blu-ray player atop the unit which then has a Verizon FiOS box on top of it. No heating challenges that I can notice and no interference with the television signal. Hope that helps!
Probably. The arms move around to any screw hole configuration.
Thank you! I finally solved the hum problem by plugging the iMic into "Line Out" on my amplifier instead of directly into my turntable. The hum disappeared! Hope you got your hum solved, too. Maria
Yes. I moved it from my D800 to the D810 without any problem at all.
You'll want the DK-21M: http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-25339-DK-21M-Magnifying-Eyepiece/dp/B000C0OF54 No guarantees it'll work; as, it's not specifically listed as compatible.
Not sure if this question has been answered already but yes, there is a volume control for the 2730. It has separate volume for the voice commands and XM/MP3 player.
When I purchased my 7200 it came with a power cord so I could plug it in while in the house. Otherwise it has a power cord attached to the unit for mobile use. Yes it is large and has no built in battery but I've been very pleased with it's performance. I'm glad I got it at the time because it hasn't been in production for quite sometime. When I do see a used one for sale it's at about twice the price I paid for it.
if you mean a grille, the answer is no
Its been a year, but I think it was about 6x6x14
yes I certainly did and it worked really good,but first make sure your computer doesn't have its own built in one
tbh im not quite sure but whenever my mic is on people don't tend to have problems hearing me, and i keep the mic maybe within an arm's reach from me. i hope this helps :)
Yes. I bought this battery for my D90 in 2009. Still using it today, may 2014.
This Barska Tripod Adapter will definitely work for this pair of binoculars. To confirm what I mentioned, here are two links; www.bestbinocularsreviews.com/Minox8x44BLHD-135.htm youtu.be/1ihUtVgaRts
So long as your camera has built in flash you don't need SU800 commander. The R1 kit comes with blind screen that attaches to built in flash so built in flash light does not fall on to subject but it triggers close up flashes! I am using it on D7000.
The only difference is you have a controller in the kit with the R1C1 and depending on your camera if it has commander mode you may not need the R1C1 controller, but it is nice to have.
yes this works with an am3 & am3+
Not sure. It worked on d90. I imagine it should.
Yes but any movement of the player causes skipping. I can't recommend it to anyone.
Def not
Yes, they come in a pair.
I never measured it but is long enough for the b distance I needed it. It is around 4 feet and u can open it to increase the size for 3 - end spilt
This amplifier is not stable at 2 ohms. it is limited to 4 ohm loads or higher.
Yes.
Yes it will. Same plug size.
The camera uses 2 AA Lithium disposables, 2 AA NiMH rechragable or 1 CRV3 Lithium battery pack (can be had either disposable or rechargable). The use of alkaline batteries has never been recommended by Kodak. Your best bet, IMO, is to pick up a couple disposable CRV3 battery packs. I've seen them for as little as $6 each. They last forever.
Yes it is confirmed
There is no possibility to mount a protective filter on this lens. The lens is concave, so it protrudes in the middle of the glass. Not possible to have a filter on top. The surrounding metal lens hood will protect the glass quite well, otherwise one has to be careful with this special purpose lens when using it.
On Sigma's site this lens is NOT listed to fit any Sony. However, the Sigma 10mm F2.8 EX DC HSM Fisheye IS listed to fit Sony/Minolta mount. I have no user knowledge on the 10mm F2.8 EX DC HSM Fisheye lens. By the looks of Sigma's sample photos it is a keeper.
Anything that can handle 5.1 speakers should be fine.
These speakers are open. You might want to opt for using outdoor speakers or find a weatherproof speaker enclosure to put these units in.
Overall diameter was just a hair tight with my Gemini Studio/PA set. Just a slight tap setting it in. The holes lined up perfectly. I am extremely pleased.
No just the crossovers
I don't think so, this is used to program a Remote Starter System.
Absolutely that's what I use mine for.
Yes. It's adjustable.
Only left side and the suck cant hardly hear the other person in them with the volume turned all the way up I would not suggest them to anyone hopefully this will help you
The push to talk button is secured with a Velcro strap
I'd say probably not Tony, as you can't turn one of the cans back of your ear to free it up. Also the comfort factor is definitely NOT good for longer periods. Sound-wise they're probably adequate, but not 1st class by any means. Hope this helps... Geoff.
You need an external amp, pretty sure only Bluetooth headsets can work with a PS3 without an amp.
The part that goes into the radio is two prong......so Yes
6 inches
Older networks used to be OK, and a wireless card should not be needed. I have done it in the past. But the only encryption my Axim X51v (with Windows Mobile 5.0 OS) accepts is WEP. This may still be in use in public places such as hotels, coffee shops, etc., but I can not get mine to connect at home using my networks WPA encryption. I have not tried to connect through my iPhone nor Notebook using Bluetooth, that may be a viable option.
Yes. This thing is a dinosaur though. Its probably worth like 30 bucks as a curiosity.
Yes it does work as long as you have the latest software on your dell axim x51v worked on mine
Only if it has a gm 03+ factory radio
The impedance of the speaker doesnt change in Bridged or Parallel or Series modes. The important thing is what is being presesnted to the amplifier. The speaker manufacturer here is saying that these speakers will suit amps that require any load between 4 and 8 Ohms....I've used these speakers in my car and would see no issue in a home...I don't know the distance
no it doesnt have a touch pad in the middle. I thought it was, but it wasn't. That was disappointing.
The spacebars are great! I find that there is a snappy response when hitting the keys - or, rather, you don't have to press hard for a response. Once again, this is the third or fourth Adesso Tru form keyboard I have had over a period of many years and I will continue to buy them as long as they are avalable. I highly recommend this keyboard.
They do not have updates anywhere! They stopped 31 Dec 2014 so now to me they are USELESS!!
Sadly no. This is exclusively a storage solution though it is a pretty nifty way to keep track of discs.
Yes. Will work with windows 8
3 prong...it DOES have the ground post
From what I've read you can't turn on the PS3 through anything but the bluetooth from standby. This article discusses it more. http://crave.cnet.com/8301-1_105-9779733-1.html
Make sure that it is installed completely. The first time I put mine in, it did the same thing. It wasn't completely in the "slot" or whatever you want to call it. Open the side panel and re-insert the lamp. Make sure it fits snug. Also make sure to put the initial cover back on tightly. I didn't and the light just kept blinking.
The Seagull Right Angle Finders come with an assortment of adapters. I have used it on my Canon 7D, which uses the same eye cup size as the 5D MKIII.
It comes with adapters first you will have to remove the rubberized clip from your viewfinder then select the appropriate Nikon adapter and clip it on then the right angle viewfinder slides on
Sorry, don't know.
When you install the software for the Zen (not the stupid Yahoo Music Engine), it'll give you the option of ripping your CD's directly to your player, so yes.
Hi, I purchased the Creative Zen Vision: M and received it yesterday. I did NOT receive an AC wall charger. Even though it is a pain, charging through the USB port takes 2-3 hours (and it charges when you are docked, I leave it plugged in between transfers). Hope that helps.
To search for stations manually, make sure the preset stations is off. To turn it off, just push the play button ("Preset 1" or w/e will disappear off the screen) and just push left and right on the vertical touch pad to browse the station and start saving it as a preset station :) To turn the preset station on, push play again.
Creative has a a program called zencast. You paste all your feeds into it and it will put all your podcast in one folder. If your interested in vidcasts(video podcasts) it gets more complicated. The majority of these are in Ipod format(m4v) and need to be converted. Zencast does this but really slowly. More vidcasts are starting to make more formats available, and I think in a short time this should not be a problem.
Honestly it all depends on what type of headphones/speakers you'll be using as to whether you'll get more out of better sound quality. My personal cutoff is 192kbps for the lowest I'll listen to, but I try to rip everything lossless and download everything I can at lossless quality because you really notice a difference at 900+kbps. But of course I'm using 500 dollar Sennheiser headphones to listen to the music, so if you're using 10 dollar Sony's you might not need anything near that high.
I've loaded the unbox and it works fine. I have purchased several movies and TV shows and they are loaded on my ZEN. It plays perfectly. I did have to raise a "stink" with amazon to get my $20 credit. They said that they were having problems with the promotion and that it would be fixed soon. It never got fixed so I "made" them credit my visa $20. The phone number is 1-888-802-3080.
When you install the software for the Zen (not the stupid Yahoo Music Engine), it'll give you the option of ripping your CD's directly to your player, so yes.
You should be able to find those on Garmins site.

There is a program called UKtube which allows you to watch youtube videos on this tablet. http://maemo.org/downloads/product/ukmp If your son is a bit geeky then he will love this tablet. It has quite a lot of online software developed by other users. http://konttoristhoughts.blogspot.com/2007/08/ukmp-151-combined-with-updated-uktube.html. Looks like the Nokia 800 is cheaper online now than you can get this one here, so I'd check that out. It is the successor to this tablet and I understand has improvements including it can play youtube out of the box.
Katman -- in stereo mode (both channels driven), the manual says: 125W RMS into 8 ohms, 185W RMS into 4 ohms; 175W peak into 8 Ohms, 300W peak into 4 ohms.
i am not familiar with Godenear speakers, but I'd guess this amp will drive them fine. I have been using this amp in a bi-amp 2-channel setup and it has been solid, reliable and quiet (no fans).
Distortion is Inaudible. Specs on all good amps are excellent but they sound different because of other reasons. The Behringer amp is vey powerful and stable even with low impedance loads.
The sleeve doesn't have a window. they provide a little sticker that goes on the screen instead.
Hi yes it does. It's a very nice camcorder - you'll really enjoy it!
No this camera does not have RCA output jacks. You can purchase a SONY VMC-30FS cable that will connect to the camcorder using a Sony propietary jack and output to either RCA A/V or S-Video and RCA.
I had so many problems with the memory buffer on that camera, I finally got rid of it. Make sure Flash signal is on, check info to see if the flash has a separate battery. That's all I have for you.
Yes, though some old second party lenses may not be compatible with the Sony 100 autofocus, most are..
I am not real happy with the Kodak. Their older models are better. Thinking of returning and getting the FugiFilm s5200 Better report with PC World. check out the canon ratings on this website. www.pcworld.com
Hi D, yes the lens will fit and is compatible with the a35. Thanks_Mitch
This can be sent with camera for sure...It would be downloaded form Sony website....
No it doesn't, there is no image stabilization on this camera. I wish it did.
Try www.aquapac.net I have several different size aquapac models for different cameras and cell phones. I have used them with great results while snorkeling in Hawaii.
Yes, take it to Walmart photo department.
This maybe a driver problem with your computer. I solely use the RCA port as well and I have experienced no problems.. Try checking your sound driver on your computer. If that doesn't work let me know, I would be glad to explore more options with your problem. Just let me know.
In fact I cannot even read the MPEG2 file with Quick Time. Also buying the $20 MPEG2 plugin did not help as it does not support DTS or AC3. I have found a shareware that decodes the files ffmpegX, any other alternatives? BTW QTPro does not read MPEG2 files either.
The D5100 doesn't have commander mode so it will not use the flash for wireless
Good 720 super clear and ajustable
No. But some HD-DVD titles are released in combo disc... meaning that side A is HD-DVD and side B is regular DVD. That way you can play the discs regardless of your player. No Hi-def format can simply be played on a regular DVD player. They use a different type of laser DVD players do not have.
Mine plays DVDs better than any DVD player. Return your unit and get another one.
No Not at all. This is a 1/4 inch connection. Your phone would most likely take a 3.5mm connection. what are you trying to plug your phone into? Most likely if you want to get sound out of your phone, you will need a 1/4 inch t0 3.5mm adapter. You can find that on Amazon. It cost no more than $1.50 to $3.50. Let me know if this helps or you have more questions.
No
Yes
Yes as long as there is enough space between the dishwasher and the wall to allow for the space that this takes up. It sticks out about an inch and a half from the wall. So as long as that does not make your dishwasher or range stick out that much more it should be fine
The software downloads data from my Garmin GPS watch to my desktop computer - which has a Windows 7 operating system
Yes
Yes
Well thats exactly what i use it for, i haven't had any complaints. Even with all these different stations in nyc. I dont have to move the plug around either to get that clear sound, like others. This is my take on it, obviously everyone has there own opinion hope this helps.
Perfect speakers for this box i have the same thing hits hard
No it's not slanted , but if your planning on getting it it really worth it . Before I bought it people have reviews that the terminals and stuff looks cheap it does not. I have two 1500 watts pioneer bass subs in this box and its amaizing you will literally fill the bass and the air bouncing on you . But just out of curiosity what type of hatch back do you have ?
If you use an adapter(essentially a transformer) for use with 220 volts, then the answer is yes. Check Radio Shack for the proper adapter/transformer or check Amazon. &lt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AMFNHI/sr=8-5/qid=1153729581/ref=pd_bbs_5/102-9501087-1264967?ie=UTF8&gt; &lt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000028F42/ref=pd_cp_e_title/102-9501087-1264967?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=172282&gt;
H is faster than M. Your camera accepts both types. Check www.olympus.com to verify compatability. I have a 1gb M xd card which is really slow. Recently purchased 1 gb H type and will let you know how it is.
if the volume is up, you would be able to lower it thru the headphones
3.5mm is a standard audio port. They're kinda over ear, but not very noise canceling
Hi You can find them in AMD page now the are the owner of this brand support.amd.com/en-us/download
With this card i played WOW on the highest settings, around 20fps in shat, works pretty damn well
Yes, I have a really small wrist and the end only sticks over a tiny bit!
I'm not familiar with that model so I can't say one way or the other.
No, it does not.
yes, it makes a great monitor, video quality is very good for Media center pc.
Hi, Jemore. This device will work with the following: - Delphi Roady Xt - Delphi Roady2 Audiovox Xpress - Delphi Myfi Tao Xm2Go, Pioneer Airware - Delphi Skyfi2 Pioneer - Inno Samsung Helix - Samsung Nexus 1
Despite the fact that the box claims to use DDR or DDR2 RAM, from my usage of it, it seems to just use DDR. Also, be aware that it does not have a built in Ethernet port, so you'll have to install your own NIC on it.
All white.
No
They are no longer. Ordered Dec 19, 2013, received Dec 21, 2013. Made in China. "Made in Austria" no longer on ear cups. Box states "Designed and engineered in Austria. Made in China"
it is the 2.0
no it doesnt use above the 2gb
They can be blurry, but there is a setting for that (I forget the name, either party or candlelight) under "Scene". It won't be good for catching a romping toddler, but posed photos are fine. Alternatively, I took a photo in complete darkness using the flash covered in white paper (specifically a straw wrapper taped over the flash) to diffuse it, and took BEAUTIFUL photos of people. Flash speeds up the shutter speed.
I find the EVF viewer to be clear and bright. My brother has an S3 and the viewer is very dark and tough to use in my opinoin.
Yes. The headphones could both be tuned to the one base with no problem and the range is quite good. I often put on a movie or some other audio source and then go work in another room. Also, I should add that the audio can still play through the source you have it hooked up to as well so you could listen from another room while someone else listens without headphones at the the TV or stereo.
When I purchased my Vantec, it came complete with the 120VAC power adapter to plug into wall and into the unit. It was complete with everything but the hard drive, which was simple to install. It had both a USB cable for interface as well as the bracket and cable/connector for the SATA interface to the motherboard. The USB connection transfers files and data fast, and the SATA connection is even better. The external drive is very flexible when moving between computers with the USB interface.
If you used the wrong power cord 110 to 17 volt, ( unit might smell Burnt). Or it has served it's purpose,
Not sure about doc adaptor but I have used an a/v cord plugged into the headphone hole of the iPod
Supply and demand, just do it, you will have a piece of ---- history
No, it does not. It only comes with a paper with a website address that gives you recycle locations. One of the locations near me is Lowe's, but I don't know if they take batteries this large. The only way you get a return label is if you buy direct from APC as I understand it according to their website.
The sound blaster card that I have has 3 line out ports for your speakers & 1 line in for your microphone. I hope this helps you.
No, it's not proper for PCI Express cards. It only fits regular 32-bit PCI slots.
yes
It is currently handling my ~22lb center OK. It doesn't inspire supreme confidence in its ability though. At least in my experience it does the job but it is a little scary looking.
I saw it on Sony's website in black....really neat looking in black, but I have silver since black wasn't available at Best Buy!
Yes, it will charge Nuvi 50.
There always has been a way. Most FM transmitters plug into any headphone jack, such as this one (my favorite). http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067LYFW/sr=8-2/qid=1149459389/ref=pd_bbs_2/002-8215653-1061658?%5Fencoding=UTF8
It quit working so long ago, I don't remember. The only piece of home electronics that has ever given me the "blue screen of death"
yes the the actual outside dimensions are 6.5 x2.75
You need to select the active pair, assuming you only have one line. Typical CAT3 phone cables have 2-pair, a live pair and a spare or for a second line. See http://www.directron.com/cableguide.html for a good explanation. When an alarm is triggered, your active phone line is seized through the RJ31X jack so that the alarm has exclusive use of your active line.
doubt it...most games are on cable...however you will be able to get the games that are aired on upn, wb and fox game of the week...
These speakers are 8 ohm. Just freaking awesome power. You do need to drive them a bit to get the most out of them, but then again, you aren't buying something like this to listen at low volume anyway.

Yes it does. The antenna is "broad banded" enough that VHF will be picked up. You might see my other answers about beam width at distance as well as signal gain on receive.
I don't know for sure, I don't have the 478s. However, I do have several different models and I didn't have any trouble with these fitting any of the sets I do have.
Your front speaker should be tonally matched with the front L/R speakers. In other words, this front speaker matches C-V VE series L&R speakers. Rear channel surround don't have to be matched. My set up? C-V VE series LFR mated to PolkAudio rear surrounds.
Try using your remote. Go to speaker settings and set speakers to match your set up. This can only be adjusted with your remote.
Hi, I have an Emotiva XPA-2. It's rated at 300 real wats per channel. Make sure that you have the slow-blow type of fuses that are the correct type. My speakers came with the fast blowing type and poped when I turned it up loud. Love the base and there is no better performance for the money with both.
sober rain, This model is deigned to work only on a horizontal, flat surface. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
sorry im not the seller of this item please contact the sell
That's what I did and it seems to work fine. However, the copper wire is very thin so if I had to do it over, I think I would just cut off one side of the clip and then insert the remaining half in the receiver.
I didn't. I have the individual poles to make the connection.
Yes
Use a higher ISO setting. This camera takes great smooth pics all the way up to ISO 800. If your using it at the lowest setting (ISO 100) and you are indoors and/or outdoors with not enough light your pictures will blur occasionally.
Battery included, no xd card. I stil have my "new" extra battery and a 8Gb XD card I dont use anymore. Would u like to buy it also? I can give u a deal. Thx.. daniel.san399@gmail.com
The ones I received are clear!
Yep ! http://www.monoprice.com/products/product.asp?c_id=102&cp_id=10201&cs_id=1020106&p_id=556&seq=1&format=2&style=
I do not know, but it worked on my PS2 keyboard and mouse to my USB KVM switch.
Yes, that's how I use it
no. this is an output only cable. it will let you play videos on your tv that you've got stored on your zen
Yes. It has a USB port you can us .
It uses SD cards. They're available up to 2gb, which is the largest size this camera can use. Be careful not to get SDHC (high capacity) cards, as they will NOT work, even in the 2gb size. I've used 512mb and 2gb SD cards, both PNY brand, with success. They aren't fancy high speed cards, but I don't notice any objectionable delay in writing to the card.
No, my purchase was made two years ago.
On the back of the camera there is a "lighting bolt" which indicates flash. Press once when the camera is on and on the lcd screen you will see that lighting bolt with a slash through it indicating that the flash is off. A lighting bolt with the letter "A" indicates that it is back on and in automatic mode.
My sister and I both had this camera and we had the same problem. I think that once you start having issues with this camera there is no going back. I would just upgrade. We never figured out why the glitch occurred.
With the S3 IS set in continuos mode I get great shots with no delay of my 3 1/2 year old grandson going at full speed. Just keep holding the shutter button down until the memory card is full. With a fast memory card it will take more than 2 shots per second. In good light the stop action is near perfect with no blur. The S3 IS is as good as anything on the market without going to a DSLR.
Yes, from YouTube : Sony HVR-A1U Test Footage 3
The biggest difference I find is that you can use optical zoom in movie mode with the H2. Also, H2 has Carl Zeiss lens which i think H1 doesn't
I dont know what size the actual studs are. The nut to attach the wires is a 13mm. Hope that gives you a general idea or is of some help.
Only if you have a Roku or similar device.
The headphone port on this thing is the standard, super common 1/8" or 3.5mm you'd find on cheapie headphones in the local drugstore.
Hi, you can do this by going to the screen settings and set wide zoom under wide mode and turning off the auto wide option. -Ely
I haven't noticed anything like that. I've played movies on my ipod and everything looks fine.
One program that I recommend is CloneDVDMobile by SlySoft. You do have to pay for it, but I've had it for over a year, and I've never had a problem ripping a DVD to the iPod. It's really easy to use, too.
What format are your files in? If MP3 then there will be zero problem. I have all of my MP3's on an external hard drive as well & all of my tag info was kept intact when I imported the tracks into iTunes. If the format is WMA then iTunes will want to convert the files into a format that the iPod will play. Tags will likely remain intact but the files will be changed I believe.
I have used my remote to rewind and play the tapes. The touch screen got to where I could not use for any functions but could rewind & play the tape I had in there. That is all I have really used the remote for. Love the camera though.
Get either a pair of Sennheiser 100's or Koss Portapro's at about 35-40 bucks and you will be amazed with the sound that the shuffle produces. Dan
There's only 1 playlist on the shuffle.
I purchased the MacBook on Wednesday and got a shipping confirmation on friday.. Coming in on Monday! :)
Try ordering it from apple.com or go to the store. Yes you have to pay tax, but you'll get it faster. I ordered mine on Oct 30. and am supposed to get it by Nov 7. It's a lot faster and you can get the free engraving
I think you can print your playlist in I-tunes, but other than that, you just need to get to know your song list. This is a very simplistic machine. You have one playlist. You can listen to them in order or shuffle them. Period.
You mean take a CD and make MP3 files? MILLIONS of programs can do this. Hell Windows Media Player can but I'm not sure if that's your preference. Quintessential Player is my favorite so far, you can download it at quinnware.com. It allows you to rip from 8 kbps to 320 kbps and has a variable encoder as well. I haven't heard of many good DVD rippers that are free.
All computers (and that's really what an iPod is) will freeze occasionally. There are two recent posts about freezing (which, I suspect prompted your question)which, aside from sounding like they were written by the same person, were written by people without much knowledge of the device. Like your desktop computer, generally, an iPod is easily reset on the fairly rare occasions when it does freeze. I've had almost every generation of iPod. If they freeze more than once every couple of months, I'd be surprised.
You can play PC games on the iMacs only if you use BootCamp to install Windows XP. This is pretty simple process from what I have heard, but you will need to buy Windows as well. You can definitely use comcast internet service from any modern mac. I have done it.

Not as-is; the tray slide is molded for typical mounted 35mm slides to be dropped in, not a strip of film.
The battery we received was a genuine Lenovo battery, and my husband should know, as he works for Lenovo.
the only problem with this is that if you already have an existing tivo at 12.95 a month it will cost 19.95 a month for that same service after it expires
used pepsi points to get and i am happy with it works fine
This is just a "plug convertor" It allows you to use your plug in a different wall outlet. The power in the wall outlet will be the power you will get through your plug. Check if the iPhone charger accepts the power of the outlet in the wall in volts (V) and frequency. (HZ)
I don't know what voltage is used in India. Some hair dryers you can change the voltage on. It the voltage is different it will break your hair dryer.
first hook up your unit to your computer and go to the Music file on the unit. delete the music folder. Then delete the "tmp" folder on both the MSC mode and the MTP mode. This should delete the playlists as well as the songs.
I own 2 e280s, one of them since last July. I have found that it takes about 3 1/4 hours to charge fully. However I use a seperate charger to charge mine. I do not charge from my computer. I get between 15-22 hours on a charge.
i just bought one at best buy the other day. it's the iriver one. i have't used it yet and won't, because i bought it for my boyfried. but the sales associate at best buy told me that is the only one this mp3 is compatible with.
No, you can't use the device while it is connected to your computer's USB. You can, however, use the device while it is plugged in to an AC or car power adapter. So just get an AC adapter to charge instead of using you machine and problem solved.
I am very happy with my 2GB Sansa. Just updated the firmware (very smooth application downloaded from Sandisk site). Sleek design, not as cool as Nano, but very close. Ubercool video which Nano doesn't have, which works surprisingly well. Bigger screen than Nano too. Micro SD slot a great plus. And it also works like a storage device, so you can take files with it, something Nano doesn't do. Go for the $129 (at time of writing) 4GB model.
Hi, This product has a 20 hour battery life but it does not have a wall charger yet. So the only way to charge it for now is to plug it into the USP dock
No, it doesn't have a bookmark option. That's one of it's main drawbacks. Let's hope they change that in the next firmware update.
Go to www(dot)anythingbutipod(dot)com for solutions that don't include Apple's proprietary garbage... (change (dot) to regular "." - amazon doesn't allow placing links in here)
No, it's not compatible. At least the one I bought a few years ago wasn't as it came out before the iPhone 5. Hope this helps.
It should work... I used it for a iPod... I love it.. :) & I think u would to.
No I am afraid Walnut is the only color
Best Buy sells the SanDisk case expressly for this unit. The price is 14.99 and it is one of those frosted clear neoprene cases.
Is there an option to completely turn off or reduce the timing for the glowing buttons? Does that make a difference in battery life?
You can try buying the Nyko Blu Wave remote for the PS3, and then using the included IR dongle with the 550. I have heard of people that have had success doing this to allow the use of a universal remote.
I have the DirecTV TiVo HR10-250 (HD DVR) and this remote controls it perfectly(as well as all my other components).
You have to thread a loop. It has a place in the back that your belt can thread through. Quite comfortable actually.
The one i received WAS Cannon...And IS much better than the aftermarket junk.
According to Canon, the NB-5L is compatible with the Canon PowerShot SX230 HS. See http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/digital_cameras/other_powershot/modelSNACompatibles.action?accessoryCid=0901e024800c522e&accessoryModelName=Battery+Pack+NB-5L
Sorry, I don't know.
Here is another angle: http://i118.photobucket.com/albums/o87/heyjowee/IMAG0170-1.jpg
The neck does rotate right and left to just above horizontal. It also can rotate 360 degrees in a circle.
Sure, it should be very similar. 2.8 is 2.8 no matter which lens. The larger the aperture the faster your shutter speed will be. Obviously you need to be close enough, it seems like some of the other comments haven't read what you asked. I have used this to catch my son running around the house or outside. I also have the 70-200 f4 IS for telephoto zoom.
Tom covers this well, but I'd add that you'll want to select the center AF focusing point only...don't select the whole array. I was irritated by focusing issues on my new Canon 7D until I went back and checked the focus points. Sure enough, on large-aperture portraits it was picking out the nearest points first and not providing enough depth to keep the whole cubject in focus. I switched to running Av only and with the ceter focusing point only. Much better results.
Sorry. Not sure. I live in a rural community and have mine hooked up at work because for some reason all I would get is static at home. I was told it is because of the rock/adobe walls! I work at a law enforcement office and the channels work properly there.
To be honest, you should get the 50mm 1.8 lens first. You can take absolutely stunning photos with that lens that don't come close to the lenses you mentioned. The 18-55mm kit lens would be my last choice.
here is a link to flicker group judge for yourslef look for the portrait tag http://www.flickr.com/groups/37412600@N00 http://www.flickr.com/groups/tamron17-50mm this is a solid aperture lens F/2.8 thru out the range 17mm thru 50mm this lens amazing do it all lens from portraits,,, travel and low light
I just got off the phone with "Adam" from garmin. He told me (and confirmed it before answering) that if you buy a Garmin 360 you can get a "complimentary" 2009 map upgrade IF it is not already including. Which map included depends on packing date. The point to remember is you MUST REGISTER YOUR PRODUCT WITHIN 60 DAYS or you will have to pay for the update. I hope this helps.
I have the similar My Book Premium Edition 500GB and it does have a separate power cord. All of the larger external drives I've looked at have that. I like this hard drive a lot. I've had it about a year and it has been very reliable.

I know it's made for Sony. Just make sure to specify Sony mount when ordering. My copy of this lens was a learning tool for me. I kept it at f9 all the time (the sweet spot) and as high a shutter speed as possible and always tripot mounted. I learned quite a bit about manipulating a lens to get sharp IQ. I got good pictures, rarely great.
Tamron makes it with many different mounts, you just have to see if that make it for the Blackmagic camera.
This opens about like opening a coin purse. You need two hands, not because it is difficult, but because you will need to press the release with one hand and open it with the other hand. It is easy to use and it is sturdy and holds lots of sd cards. I keep mine in my camera case and keep it in my pocket while on vacation. It is about half the size of an average man's wallet.
yep. and a good long lasting one.
I have a Tivo Premiere and I cannot find any way to connect it to prevent pixelation. Some users report the device has a faulty TV tuner. I get perfect reception when hooking directly to the TV and bypassing the Tivo.
Yes it does.
from this page: http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-7608_7-1016109-2.html?tag=tnav it looks like 46 should be about 5.5 to 11.5 feet
I'm sure they have different sizes. If its the S6187W it's 61 diagonal inches. Perhaps the 50 inches listed is width.
NO it is not, the noise is caused by the picture settings, set up to max(looks better in stores, so you will be attracted to it). IF you calibrate the tv with the avaia or Digital video essentials, the noise should dissappear. Once calibrated, this set cannot be beat.
Yes, it fits my new RX100M3 just fine and it does have the velcro belt loop and snap.
Yes, mine did but that was a few years ago...I'm not sure how they package it now. (I love Lowepro camera bags!)
Yes it's a perfect fit - about a centimeter at the top to spare and 5mm at either side. I've got my RX100 here and am contemplating buying another Rezo 30 to replace my 6 year old Rezo 30 (only issue is one corner of the zipper teeth have come unsewed from the case finally). Other than this recent failure, the case has been solid - really like the belt loop plus swiveling shoulder strap.
The Rezo 30 is too small for the TG 830. I use the Rezo 50 for my TG 830. The Rezo 30 and Rezo 50 have a front compartment that will fit 2 batteries and a memory chip, depending on the thickness of the case used for the chip. The TG 830 camera is about 5 mm longer and 2 mm thicker than a TG 820 camera, which will fit snugly in a Rezo 30.
Yes, but I only enjoyed the one I bought in the store. Both of the two I purchased died in 3 months and the warrenty was no good so.... spend your money in the store, unless you are ok with only a few months of working condition. The CD player is broken on both. The radio plays ok. Good Luck
Sorry, but the answer is no, but if you have a blank tape you can record a disk on your tape.
nope. it's that quiet. pretty bad, eh?
This item boosts the signal transmitted on a coaxial cable. The signal on the cable is 'weakened' each time you split it. Typically, a signal from a cable company (TimeWarner, Comcast) is still strong enough to work after a couple splits inside a home by a normal splitter (no boosting). Should you want to split the cable to multiple TV's from the main source or having weak reception issues after a split, this product could be a solution by helping boost the stength of the signal.
very durable.. the feeling of the build and plastic is very stiff and sturdy
it does not have an ipod docking station but it will allow you to play ipod through a cable that plugs form the ipod headphone input to the front of the unit. (cable not included)
It does fit in and plays through the mm50, BUT you get the "will not charge" (I forget the exact wording) warning.
Before Comcast's stupid digital cable box I could record a show and then flip the channel to another while the first recorded. Comcast now prevents it- can't wait to dump the cable tv and go through the internet only~!
I don't have a TIVO, but I think you should be able to use line (A/V outputs and inputs (out from TIVO, in to ES15). That's the yellow, white red connectors. Good luck. Bob in TN
12X8X7
Lens is 10x optical zoom. 38-380mm equivalent. No wide angle.
Yes
I have a Phillips CD player, my husband has a different brand, they both fit in belt.
That's is what I bought mine for. Thee exact one!
My Sony Discman is approx. 5 1/4" across, and approx. 6 1/4" from top to bottom and it fits with a bit of room to spare in this cd holder....so, if your RCA is not appreciably larger, it should fit....and there is a pocket in it for extra cd's....hope this helps....Jo
The one I recieved was black.
Yes it does..
Works for me. Edwin
If you search thru the reviews, you'll come the the conclusion that it does NOT. PS3's remote controls only work via bluetooth. This doesn't make much sense to me --- Sony's universal remote can't even control their own device? But that's the way it is with PS3. You'll need a bluetooth remote
Yes, I have a swivel screen player myself. A GPX. As long as it fits in the case, you should be ok.I don't use the player in the case though. I only use it to transport it. You might want to get a different case that might let you hang it on the back seat of your car.
I'm not sure but I know it should be able to hold a slim digital camera or a smartphone like the iPhone.
Yes it did.
Yes, twist off one of the earpieces and replace two standard AA batteries.
No It does not.
I'm not sure. I bought it to use with my answering machine. It worked but for some reason the answering machine wouldn't record the time of calls when it was plugged into this back-up. Once I put the machine back onto a regular outlet it recorded the time again. Go figure. I tried that several times.
It's just a standard "American", three prong, grounded plug with four standard grounded outlets. It is not a European voltage converter. You would need a seperate converter.
Its a power strip and not a surge protector. But,traveling in Europe you discover electrical outlets are few and far between. This device allows multiple units to be charged from a single outlet, yet compact enough to throw in an overnight bag. Remember, its a power strip not an adapter or converter.
Yes for free
No Sleeves Included
I used a plastic frame I took from a slide, the ones you can open. then made inverse on photoshop and the result was ok. It gains a particular texture, but it gave the images a unique look.
Distance between the two mounting rails is slightly larger than 17 3/4 inches. Standard audio rack gear will mount in this rack cabinet. Depth is adjustable and should never be a problem with any equipment.
Of course. Fans just need power, and that's what the pins provide. Even if you gotta bend em you can do that to get it on there. (However, you shouldn't have to but if you gotta, it's an option). It wont affect the wiring any.
I am sorry all I know as a periodontist it works great with close up introral photographs.
hi, CP1500AVRLCD do not have sensitivity control
That's what I use,works fine.
Not but maybe 4 inch wide at spring, best mount would be buy a fender mount and use it on a toolbox instead
no, the paper provides the thermal transfer component - no ink required just paper roll, power, and usb connection to cash drawer or computer
Yes
Nexus Electronics televisions are listed in the manual (code 12183) as controlled by it. I don't have a nexus television, so can't be sure it really will work, but *they* think it does :-)
It has happened to us as well. Amazon handled the problem fast and provided us a new unit quickly. However it failed after two weeks ago. It also went dead. I am returning this one too.
According to the product comparison on Garmin's website the c530 does not announce street and point of interest names. You need to go to the c550 for that feature.
Zachary, Mine is broken too. I called Garmin and they want me to send the unit in for repair. They want $125. I could just about buy another one for that price. Have you figured out to fix yours? I am still trying to figure out a way to McGiver mine. David Wallace
There is only start and stop features, no pause.
yes, its just an audio player......no dock. hd radio works too but you have to turn your zune upside down in the craddle.
The cord I have is coiled and I'd bet it an stretch to 6 foot if needed. Mine doesn't look like the one pictured.
No it does not. Makes absolutely no sense, but the cable does not power or charge the ipod. As far as I can tell, no other company makes a compatible cable that does charge the ipod while connecting to TomTom.
You are right that lens filter size is 77mm. You need to do a search for UV 77mm filters or a Nikon NC 77mm filter.
If you are going to use a measurement mic, the computer program or the frequency spectrum could provide the pre-amplification that you need. it is more accurate if there is no pre-amplification in the input.
Yes
My experience has been that it reads everything. The only "issues" are if the file is so old that it was written in some fashion no longer supported by your operating system. This is generally only for applications; at this point, I have had no problems opening any MS-Office files. Craig
You'll need a lightning connector adapter, available for ~$30 from Apple.
If you used the headphone jack then I'm sure it would. But mine wouldn't wouldn't work with any iPod using the sync jack.
Your link went back to the memory card. What I can tell you is, I bought it to solve an older printer problem. I have a new camera that is less then one year old and it works just fine.
Unfortunately, it does not. No word on whether or not future models will include one, either. The only auxiliary port on it is a 3.5mm input jack.
Yes I use it for the Polaroid 300 it works just fine
It's tough to trim AFTER crimping. This is how I trim & crimp this connector without having to buy a $70 tool. Get these 2 tools: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Excel-Blue-Spruce-Cutters-EXL55594-/360815688800?_trksid=p2054897.l4276 ($8.00) http://www.amazon.com/TRENDnet-RJ-45-RJ-12-RJ-11-TC-CT68/dp/B0000AZK4G/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_10 ($15.00) Insert into the crimper, hold it there, cut as flush as possible, back out until wires are flushed with connector end, then crimp.
Yes, I have used them with both cat 6 solid and stranded and they work fine.
please read the description. It converts 110V from w all outlet to 12V DC. So, if your laptop runs on 12V and you have a 110V "wall" outlet in your car, YES Otherwise NO of course
Almost certainly. Bogen are now owned by Manfrotto so chances are close to 100%. You could drop them a line to be sure.
NO. This is a powered subwoofer. It only powers itself - it has no other powered outputs. It uses ALL the power it makes to create AWESOME bottom end, including subsonics (explosions, earthquakes, etc...)
My MX75s are the same way. They are made this way so you can wrap the longer one around the back of your neck. Since the left earphone has the shorter cable, you put it in your ear and then wrap the cord of the right earphone around the back of your neck to hold it in place.
I don't know what G7 XTR PMR446/LPD is? It works fine in a 9.6 volt Makita drill/driver
This is pretty comfortable for me, but I don't wear it for extremely long periods - usually for an hour or less. Instead of depending on being jammed into your ear cannel, it is held in place by the outer part of that wraps around the outer part of the ear.
it's stable for me. I've had the unit for about a month now. It was a pain to get it it setup properly, it took me 3 tries, and I had to wait 24 hours after each try, but now its very stable. Just remember that you have to have the IR blaster in front of your cable box at least when the TV is not in use. Otherwise the Diga can't download the new listings, and then all the listings will show "No data" until it downloads the new listings.
Not directly in front, but far enough that I've never had a problem with the sound pick-up. Have been using one for a long time and don't have any complaints about it.
I had the same problem. I returned it.
No, Google Voice is not SIP Compliant, this device is only for SIP services
Yes
Oh the fuse is huge, I think 50 amps. You can get a smaller fuse though and substitute it into the gold plated connector
The way I understand it: 'Static': You get a bare CF card inside an anti-static bag 'Plastic': You get the CF card inside a plastic storage case 'Retail': You get the CF card and a plastic storgae case, inside a blister pack for display. You should also get a data-recovery disk with the Extreme III, but not with the Ultra II.
I use them on my golf cart. They don't get direct sun or rain on them, but they are outside all the time. So far they have performed very well.
Yes, the device transmits a radio signal that will go through most walls. The receiver for these signals emits infared light pulses just like the remotes that came with your units in another room, so this remote must be placed so the light it emits is seen by the sensor on the units being controlled.
It can learn from the vcr/dvd remote
Select/find the specific buttons on the original remote - then add them to the new remote w/ learning function.
It comes with a tool to remove the grill very easily.
What you want is a multiple hdmi receiver. Amazon sells them for roughly the same price. This item splits 1 signal into 2. To display on multiple tvs for example. The multiple receiver will allow you to have both items plugged in and detect which one is on. It can also be switched with the push of a button. Good luck
Not certain what the settop box is? The splitter is meant to split one HDMI input signal into two output signals for two separate displays (two tv's). Thus you could watch what is being input (source) on two displays at the same time, etc. Whichever the case I would not recommend this splitter as it did not perform for me as expected. It does split the signal but it is too weak and causes loss of picture. Better to purchase a splitter with a powered amplifier.
All kinds. Unless you're asking if it plays blu-rays, which it does not.
i got only one,if you look closly its saying "Pyle PLG64 6.5-Inch 300-Watt Mid-Bass Woofer".There is no "S" at the end "Woofer" not woofers so .Only one...
I put in the Pioneer FH-X700BT in my car. I have one of these subs to replace the busted stock one. It powers it enough for the low notes but would recommend an amp for multiple of these.
YES, In the front left bottom their is a place to headphones
You can wake up to the annoying buzz, Cd or radio.
Because this product is protected under AppleCare (90 days of phone support + a one year limited warranty), you should be able to get any repairs or possible replacement work in that timeframe done at an Apple Store. Not having tried though, I can't speak for certain.
It should because it supports 10 and 100 Mb Ethernet. I use it to support two separate VOIP phone lines downstream from a router.
No, it does not assign IP addresses. This Ethernet switch has no configurability. It only facilitates connecting multiple Ethernet devices together. Another router or computer on the network must be responsible for IP address assignment.
It sure should! I have mine connected to my PS4, PC, and Gamecube!
It is to allow excess heat out from the oven. Often times you only need one drip pan to have a hole in the center the one right above the oven hole under the stove top.
Open up the front door where the access card is located. The receiver's ID will be listed there on a small white tag. Some HR20s have it also on a sticker on the bottom of the unit.
I kdon't know what "regional" and "copies" means. I have no problem with rented or purchased DVDs.
No
These have a Y cord
The contact presses zero on the phone to hear and speak to caller. If the contact can help, he presses 1 and then 2 before hanging up the phone. This alerts Telemergency not to call remaining numbers. Hope this helps.
Go to Crucial Web site and see what they recommend. I found that they recommend PC4200 DDR2 553 SDram. I am surprised because I assumed they would recommend SODIMM. I have used 667MHz PC2-5300 in place of PC2-4200 - but that was me. I knew I was taking a chance that it wouldn't work - it did work - I was lucky. Why not safe side it and use what Crucial recommends.
Yes =) You should also look at 2gb x 2, since that macbook can have up to 4gb. Just make sure the memory is PC2-5300, like this one.
Yes. Works likeep a charm. Plug and play. Lots of provisioning for extras that are not required. All done througo connectors. Easy.
Yes
I am not sure. It didn't work with the Honda civic for which i purchase it...i had to return it.
I don't see why not as long as the camera has two connection sites. Would not work with disposable camera as there is no snap in connection just a rubber band loop. Item is made from webbing and plastic so no problem with the water. Never tried it that way but food for thought in the future.
Yes it does. I don't know how the "inards" work but my tape deck is auto reverse and it never flips over.
It has worked for both my iPod and my Android phone, so I would imagine that it will work for any device that has a headphone jack.
It works for my iphone 4s so i dont see any reason why it wouldnt work for a newer model.
yes, purchased so it could read my media card for an Olympus Camedia C-3000 which uses a Smart Media card.
I doubt that your printer is the issue. Any printer should work, if I it is correctly set up. If you run Windows, I assume that you used the installation disc. It won't show up unless it is in the same subnet, but the installation should set that. I have a Mac and had to assign an IP address manually, but The router could see it. If you can't see it, send it back.
Yes, it works on Windows 8.1. That is the Operating System I used to set it up.
I doubt it will cause any harm. Other than the front cover logo looking weird I doubt you will be able to hear any difference when placed on their side.
If you are asking this question in relation to these speakers than no. You have to have a receiver/amplifier to use these speakers. Also I am not sure what the reviewer below me had a problem with. I have owned the entire JBL Studio L lineup including the JBL L820's, and they have performed flawlessly for going on four years now. Excellent speakers!!
There is no scroller wheel on the MoGo Mouse (like most mice).
No that would defeat the purpose of even having a USB audio interface. USB Audio Interfaces are meant to allow you to use XLR and 1/4" mics on your computer. USB Mics have the preamps built directly into the mic and therefore would not and could not(unless you have a yeti 2) use a Audio Interface. I'd recommend that you spend some time reading up about audio production before even considering making another purchase. Hope i helped!
I think it should if you will plug the IPhone charger into this converter.
No, did not
Sorry, you can't plug headphones or speakers to the turntable.
Yes, they are 5 way posts.
Yes. No buttons respond when the lock is slid over. Located above the battery compartment.
No.
no noise made changing channels/changing bands/or cutting on or off.
It works with my 64 bit HP computer running Win 8.
It's possible; I have not tested the card on any Windows systems, unfortunately. It is a "legacy" card. But, there may be support for it under Win7 64-bit. Look at the Microsoft Windows 7 Hardware Compatibility List on Microsoft's Website. I hope that helps. Another option is to look at online forums for user-developed drivers.
I think this is a wonderful lens for sports. Same as Nikon only better build quality and smaller body.
I use it on a D300.it is heavy!! It does take good pic and a tripod should be used
Dear Jeisel Thank you for the question. my shop -- canon and nikon -- both can be prepared. It wants without forgetting for a focal length to change in CCD size. Studio circus
No, it does not. It only stores them.
Yes a LR44 is equivalent I just bought them in bulk to replace the batteries in my 7 alarms
It has a standard maglock design in that it uses a large center bolt to attach to the door with a tap-in pin at each side to keep it aligned. All maglocks use this design to allow the door plate to flex by using the center bolt as a pivot point. I've installed dozens of full size maglocks over the years, this little guy is very impressive for it's size.
Simple games maybe... Hardcore games a big NO I'd check simple games on steam for Mac before buying
Yes it is! My computer has Windows 7. Just make sure you have a cd-rom player on your laptop or else you cannot install it.
I have no idea. All I can say is that it's a very well crafted mouse and I'm pleased with it. Sorry I can't answer your specific question. R
yes, we use it with a MacBook Pro and our iMac
The headphone port on this thing is the standard, super common 1/8" or 3.5mm you'd find on cheapie headphones in the local drugstore.
no, just make sure you leave the song in your itunes playlist (and stop it deleting automatically in your options settings). it will have a little exclamation point next to it but as long as you dont actually delete it from the playlist it wont delete it from your ipod. I dont have space to hold all the music on my ipod on my pc so i did exactly this.
Not sure if this helps but I got my 6-year-old 1st generation(!) ipod to work with Vista with no problems. If I can get that old dinosaur to be Vista compatible I'm sure the nano should work just fine. You might have to fool around with the itunes security properties, but other than that, I don't see a reason why it shouldn't work.
No. It can only accommodate 4"x6" sized photo paper.
I do have an old A616. I am not sure though if I know what the "photo tray" is. please explain further
excellent, despite it's transfer speed is slow, works really good
The cable receiver remote control should have a "FORMAT" button . Press this you will find various options to fit the screen, stretch etc. I am able to see all cable channels fit to screen using the "FORMAT" option.
Yes it will work.
Its an FX lens.
Thanks for your question, This item is eligible for AmazonGlobal Priority Shipping (averages 2-4 days). You can read more about it here:
Yes, the base flips and folds so it clamps to monitors and notebooks.
Yes, the included cord will plug into any standard headphone jack.
Definitely. There is plenty of room for that in the main pocket next to the laptop sleeve.
If you mean a 13" MacBook Pro - yes it fits perfectly, with ample space for an iPad right next to it. A MacBook Air would fit with room to spare. There's also plenty of room for the power brick, a mouse and all the cables and adapters you are likely to want to carry. One suggestion - get a guitar strap gel pad - the stock strap doesn't have any pad for your shoulder. With a gel pad, you can carry a full bag all day long and not get a sore shoulder.
Definitely. There is plenty of room for that in the main pocket next to the laptop sleeve.
The 4 small speakers are a newer version. They also do not split on the middle like the version IV. You can see this in the product photos. What ever system you get you will be blown away! Best system on the market!
Pictures made in any mode are too bright and have a wavy lines background
The ones in the pictures I've seen have 3 cable connects on the tower part,but mine has only two.One input from the antenna and one to the TV amp power supply.The power supply has no cord like the ones I've seen in the pictures also.It plugs directly into an outlet and the coax hooks into it. There is a splitter that connects the power supply, the tv,and and the coax from the tower.
I have not used the CM7777 with any amplifier integrated antennas. The CM7777 is designed to be used as the first preamplifier connected to a passive antenna. If your antenna already has a preamplifier integrated or attached, you could next attach a distribution amplifier such as the CM3418 to drive up to 8 TV's or TV recorders. Mohu also has a distribution amplifier add-on but I couldn't find the specs. (Also, for TV antenna installations, I recommend starting with the antennapoint.com website to identify the locations of broadcast towers.)
No, there is no hole for a padlock and if you tired to drill one the integrity of the case would no longer be intact.
The only way to know for sure Iis to call or email Dell. They know the motherboard specs. The standard Intel heatsink/fan should work---mine did.
Some of them having single while others have dual HDMI inputs. You have to find out which monitor you have; what series. I purchased this unit and it does not work; so be careful.
Sorry... I have no idea
You pay extra for the BIG RED BALL on the camera. The software is more complete (if you have photoshop or something like it who cares) The Leica is made by Panasonic under an agreement that includes lens and electronics sharing. Big red stickers are availible at Staples for $1.50 per hundred. Nuff said, the Panasonic is the way to go. Ever notice how hard it is to find anything about the LUMIX cameras in the photo mags? Leica won't allow it.
Shutter lag is almost zero - one of the principle reasons I opted for the Panasonic brand. WYSIWYG results. The FZ50 fits this old SLR guy like a glove, and I don't have to carry multiple camera bodies around my neck. The Leica lens doesn't hurt either. However, I think if you are looking to shoot fast action sports there are better choices out there if multi-image features are important to you. This one camera has all my old equipment sitting dusty on a shelf somewhere...
I cannot answer for your Garmin. It works great as a Cisco console cable, data cable for my Cannon camera, and power cable form my Li battery
There is no reason that it shouldn't, given that the port specifications on both sides are according. Double check if your device is actually USB Type A &lt; - &gt; Mini USB Cable.
You have to use your imagination. The camera is meant to be concealed in something (box, basket, ceiling tile). The only thing that should be visible is the lense, which is very small. The wires can be concealed in the wall, ceiling, or any other way.
No, it is wired camera.
I haven't had any luck with high VHF channels with this antenna. An amplified leaf antenna did better.
I'm sure it can, but you can check the TV owners manual for compatability. This is a really sturdy mount...pricy but top of the line.
Presione el reset por 15 segundos y vuelva a programar por web, actualice el firewall y revise q los discos duros funcionen correctamente. Esto deberia solucionar el problema.
on new egg some of the feedback said it can.
Mac OSX 10.5 Leopard users... You have to go here: http://www.uc-logic.com/download/download.htm and download the latest drivers. But yes it does work on Leopard.
Yep! That's what I use it with. It's so simple that it doesn't have the driver complications of the complicated Wacom models.
I do not know. You can ask Sigma if they sell it with a Canon compatible mount. Mine was purchased with a Nikon mount.
Yes...It has six 3.5 inch drives bays for your hard drives and can mount 3 optical drives. It has two 140mm fans. You can install three additional fans (two in front and one on side) for a total of five cooling fans. It has no power supply, so you will need to purchase your own. This box is built for big setups and a lot of hardware. If you are planning on building big, this is the case to get.
Unfortunately no. It has two side pouches and the main compartment. You can change the layout of the main compartment by simply moving and/ or removing the padded dividers but you are limited to the overall size of the case. You might be able to rig up a way to attach a tripod but that option doesn't come with this particular case.
Definitely not! This an Atx motherboard. Look up "Computer form factor" on Wikipedia. They provide a nice visual of the form factors.
I had mine fixed under warranty (even though they never sold the Xacti range here in Australia) and it has never given a problem since.
Yes, press Stop button then press Menu button as soon as the DVD loads. I think it's called Direct Play feature.
I bought mine from Amazon, received it last week. Yes, the 6ft HDMI cable it's included.
You have the option to make the 3 center speakers (the tall ones with 2 speakers on them) covered or not covered. The 4 satellite speakers and sub woofer you cannot uncover
I'm use mi Nikon D3200 with my nexstar 4 SE. And i don't have problems. Of course, you will need a T-Ring and T-Adapter, or a Piggy Back.
The T-adapter has the same fitting on the camera side as your lens and the other side is a 1.25 inch tube. Push the tube into the eyepiece hole of the telescope (or the camera port - I never use that because it puts too much weight on the end of the OTA). The T-adapter must be chosen for your model of camera.
Leonardo O - I think that the weight is correct. The reason is not the telescope...but Celestron includes also a sturdy tripod... and the tripod does weigh at least fifteen pounds or so ( my guess ). Also because this is a telescope , Celestron uses quiet a bit of cardboard and packing materials to protect it.
No way. The box is inside a bigger box. All the pieces inside are all in individual boxes and Styrofoam. It is very large and extremely heavy. I doubt you could even get it through the plane door to board.
This siren works with 6 to 12 volt DC, it would not work on 120 volt AC.
Yes it can.it does use the individual wire connections. All you will need to do is clip your connector and the individual wires feed into the back of the 6150. The connection points are labeled with the color of wire, so you should not have any issues figuring out where they go.
The VCR records and plays; the DVD plays only.
yes if your vhs player is connected to it while playing tape and dvd recorder os on record
This is a piece of hardware used to give GPS access to devices which don't have a GPS built in. It pairs to the phone/tablet/PC via BlueTooth. It doesn't include any software. What device are you using with Verizon Navigator?
This works very well with my blackberry pearl.
Yes
no you have to plug it into a power source. that's the only way it will work.
No the 6150RF is not the replacement, this keypad can work but it has a receiver built in. You can use the 6150 basic or 6148 keypad which would be cheaper. It also depends on what model panel you have.
Hi, If in fact you mean a 6128 (not a 5128) yes, but you do have to manually address the key pad by powering it down, apply power, and then hold 1,2,3 keys down together at the same time to see address, most likely address 31, then address new keypad the same way on power up. OR you can send me a picture of the keypad and type of alarm panel and model number. I could not find record of a 5128 panel at all. Good luck!
Yes
no
Try ordering it from apple.com or go to the store. Yes you have to pay tax, but you'll get it faster. I ordered mine on Oct 30. and am supposed to get it by Nov 7. It's a lot faster and you can get the free engraving
Just checked the label on mine and yes the Mouse is an 8000.
According to what I have it says shortcut keys for future use. I would suggest contacting Dish, they should be able to tell you if their usable for that.
I belive it tells right on the item as listed with Amazon-made by Spion.
Not wireless. They need to be physically wired to amp or receiver as they are not powered either. They don't come with speaker wire. Maybe something lost in translation?
Probably not, it is just a switch to select one input line or the other. So if you had cable and antenna, you could switch the input between the two sources. Your Verizon box probably has some type of de-scrambler for the signal from some if not all of the channels.
See LaCie's tech support page at http://www.lacie.com/us/support/faq/faq.htm?faqid=10137
Check the lens to see what size filter they require!
Not sure what the real question is. A 55-300 is 58mm and the filter in question is 58mm-yes those can go together. The camera is immaterial.
Because the site you have referenced does not look legitimate. The site is poorly built and the pricing on the items is very inconsistent. I would say this is probably a scam.
This product will not work if the plugs don't match up. Return it.
Not sure if it will work. It didn't work with me under 220V with my hair straightener . Sorry
The suction cup generally won't work on the dashboard. However, the unit comes with a small plastic disc that you stick on the dashboard. The suction cup sticks to this plastic disc with no problems.
Can not find your Model # as given. If it is a dv6-6000 series then yes it will fit. My 12 cell works fine, but it is my second 12 cell non HP battery. The first did not last a year, but Amazon made it good since the vendor selling the first was out of business. An HP OEM replacement may be your best choice. (FYI) The battery makes the laptop very heavy.
The one I received has Kodak brand logo on the package as well as the battery.
If the dimensions, air vents, and the wattage are the same as yours it should fit. The BP350 unit only has the one fan that faces the outside of the case. I have had issues in the past where the fit was tight or some mounting holes did not line up right with some power supply/case combinations.
Sona, This camera does that and more. There are many, many features - both auto and manual that will allow you to take night shots and low light scenes. Enjoy.
I've owned two of these and don't have a clue what that is. If it's not an error, then I'm baffled too.
If you make sure to use the "Night Snapshot" mode and not the usual "Auto" mode, it's takes shots that are quite good. Also, I find that if you set the camera to "Manual" and have the ISO set to 200 and the +/- set to -2/3 with the colour setting on "Vivid" and the exposure set to "Center weighted", with a slightly steady hand, you can take good indoor shots without a flash.
It will work on Window Vista.
You can decide if you want to see the image or not. Someone in the store must have set it that way. It is nice to be able to turn it off if you know you are trying to save your battery, or are more concerned with taking a lot of pictures together and don't need to look at them until later. The feature is easy to turn off or on.
nostalgia. just imho, of course. as soon as a camera is superseded by another, the previous model is suddenly the best camera that ever existed. in the G7/G9 case, there has been discussion regarding an increase in noise levels that accompanied the increased resolution. not having owned the G7, i must judge based on published photos. neither is noise-free, but (again, imho) i believe the G9 is a net plus...especially given the fact that you can grab raw images from the G9 and work on the noise yourself if you wish. that isn't an option with the G7.
I don't know how well this would hold up under the elements of the outdoors. I use my inside my bedroom and it works great for indoor use.
I use mine inside. As I live in a tropical climate in Southeast Texas, I can't give a definitive answer.
It probably won't work with any camera as it keeps falling off!
Yes it is awesome!
As far as I know, it is video only. I see no inputs for audio. You can stream to the Yoics client, but if you want to embed a stream into a website, you'll need to install a the OpenSource firmware.
If you have a BD player that streams Pandora and the output is properly connected to this receiver (hopefully you will use HDMI cables & not the old RCA cables), it should play the audio seamlessly. The only downside is you'll probably have to leave your TV on to see the Pandora info. I stream music from both my PS3 & Apple TV through this tuner pretty easily but I have to leave the TV on to see the station & song info. Hope this helps.
275watts
I don't know but it works with my T3 canon.
you want the g series or the mx1100 for gaming.
This HDMI cable work with both video and sound however, the sound quality is not that great; perhaps the cable shield and wire gage could improve.
I tried this with my Seagate drive with dimensions 5 1/16" X 3 1/8" and it fits OK. I bought this case for my Toshiba drive with dimensions 3" X 5" it fits well. Based on the Amazon product description, the WD Studio 2TB mentioned is 2.7 x 5 x 6.5 inches, so it appears that this drive is too long and wide.
Stay with 1080i, you will not notice the difference with 1080p. It's not as dramatic as people think and you'd be hard pressed to see the difference if you were in front of two TVs, one with 1080i & the other with 1080p!!
I recently had a very long talk with a rep from Nikon. He said that there is no new replacement for the D80 yet in the pipeline. Can not verify that this is the truth, but he usually is honest about this sort of thing.
It is the DX format sensor.
It is two boxes for the $24. Very great deal!
The short bars are 10.5 inches long, and the long bars are 12 inches long.
Yes. But it was so easy for you to find out. Google "D5000 lens compatibility" and you get this page: http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/dslr/d5000/compatibility.htm The lens is a AF-S sense and fully compatible with D5000
I really doubt it. This is a great big monster of a fan. I would hesitate to try it in a mid-size ATX let alone a mini. In fact I'd worry if I had a full size ATX with side fans in it...
You an wire a large attic antenna to multiple TV's but, this small antenna would be difficult to wire to multiple televisions. With how inexpensive it is, I'd just buy one for each tv. BUT just buy one first and make sure that this antenna actually works in your area. Topography, weather, distance to the antennas, etc. all have an impact on which kind of antenna is best for your TV.
Did you make sure to change your input settings to TV? Then you need to go to your menu on your TV and run a channel scan to see if you are receiving any broadcast signals.
I noticed it said that in the description but I haven't tried it for that purpose. It's the basic technology of a car antennae so I don't see why it wouldn't work like that as long as u remember it has a coaxial connection only.
I have had no problems with my Sharp TV. I fact I have 2 of them and have never noted them running warm or over heating.
did not work at all for me
Isn't it just the EyeTV software that's updated? Wouldn't the hardware unit be the same? Where would you find a version change for the hardware unless there is a name change?
I just got the Eyetv hybrid and to my surprise, it does not have the SAP function, or at least I can't find it, it's absurd if it lacks that feature if you ask me.
No,, this is only for music CD's.
If the protected (green light) light is off and surge protector is plugged into a live power outlet, the surge protector has done its job and must be replaced. The warranty seems to cover lightning strikes, contact Belkin International, Inc., at 12045 E. Waterfront drive, Playa Vista, CA 90094, Attn: Claims Department or call (800) 223-5546 or use self service claim form at http://www.belkin.com/support. You must be the original owner of this product.
it works like a circuit breaker. when overloaded it switches off. After that, then switch it back on.
Length=13in. Width= 4.125in. Depth=1.375in.
YES, you certainly may. Screws are not provided.
George, I did that one time.. I placed the screen on a table and set it in a corner so that the sides of the screen were at a 45 degree angle with each side wall and just barely touching to give it stability. I used a sturdy 30 in high table and it worked very well, but I wouldn't recommend it on a regular basis. Jim Bell
The screen (viewable width) is 72 inches, with another 4.5 inches for the container pods on each side, for a total width of 81 inches.
I'm using a 2GB SD card with no problems. I've also used XD and CF cards without a problem.
does this frame have random shuffle?
Based on all the research I've done, that option is not available in this Philips model.
The internal picture frame memory is loaded using files found at the root level of the memory card. If you create a file folder on the SD card and save your pictures to the folder it will not find anything to copy to the internal memory and run directly from the card.
No turner but can be hooked up to cable or antenna. I bought because I needed the antenna hook up that many units don't have now.
Yes
i have one with the one i got eight months a go or try to ask them get you one
Hello ar to your questionYes the Player does attach with the red yellow and white wires as usual.In addition it works really great.I am so happy I bought it. Good luck, roberta
No wireless remote, but it does have a pod that controls volume, mute, and allows you to connect many devices and headphones. One feature I like about the Pod especially, is that you can connect something say like an Ipod and it doesn't cancel you computer sounds. I use the BOSE Companion 3 & 5's on all my computers just for the awesome sounds and versatility.
Approx 4 feet from the subwoofer connection to the speaker base.
Main speaker cord to second speaker is 72 long, desk top to main speaker cord is about 42" long, power cord to main speaker is 63" long. They are great speakers. Hope this is of assistance.
It's fairly narrow - about 1.5 inches wide. I fit a power cord and a thick HDMI cable in it pretty comfortably but anything else would be pushing it.
Edward, if you format the drive as NTFS, you would only be able to view its contents on a Mac. Writing to the drive would not be possible.
Yes, the center column is detachable around the middle.
With the legs collapsed and the ball head handles folder down the length is just short of 19.5 inches. One ball head handle screws into the other than together they fold down along the length of the tripod.
Yes
I'm not familiar with that particular player, but if it has a standard IDE connector, then it should work.
Dawn, The ink cartridges are usually included with the photo paper.You can look for photo paper kit g-100 or g-200. Hope this helps
No. If you want to remove them you should cut them !!
Two one left one right One rec left one rec left
Does this have a LINE-IN Recording function? (sorry for the repetition from the audio output section)
If money is a concern, try the "fantastic plastic" or sometimes called the "nifty fifty". That's the Canon EOS 50mm f/1.8. Great lens. Best optics per dollar, for sure. Only complaint people have had has been about the quality of background blur when shooting wide open. I haven't had an issue personally, it's acceptable for the price. It IS rather ugly compared to the quality of bokeh on the f/1.2L .. But you can buy 15 of the 1.8s for the price of the 1.2, so that's to be expected. The 1.4 has had some great reviews as well.
It will definitely work 'well' 'functionally' on a canon 6D. Since 6D is full frame, you will actually get 50mm in range compare to a crop sensor. This lens takes some time to get used to for sure as the depth of view is so thin at f1.2, you may get a lot of out of focus shots if you don't have a tripod or steady hand. So how 'well' it works may be subjective from person to person.
Canon recently announced that a new 50mm f2 IS will be released. Also Sigma announced the complete renewed 50mm f1.4
the DP300F uses a standard mount, so no reason why it shouldn't work.

is work in kenwood dnx570hd
yes but you do have to purchase a sirius xm radio only . regular radios wont work. thanks

I do not know. Please go to Apple website and look for specs.
I'm looking for one too. I'll try radio Shack first... let me know if you find one & I'll do the same.
Yes, as long as it clears your MB. You can nearly park a truck inside this case.
Yes. On one end the cable is molded into the antenna. On the other end is a connector that goes into the back of the radio.
It's apparently slightly thinner to be the same thickness as the 30GB model. Other than that, I think it's the same.
I am sorry I do not know because I do not use Mac. But I guest it should work because a lot of photographers are obsessed to work on Mac and Wacom had been an important tool for photographers to work on Adobe Photoshop.
You cannot access digital cable stations with these homemade solutions. You will only access standard non encrypted cable and over the air broadcasts. You could possibly receive over the air HD broadcasts provided you purchased the right cards. However, by the time you buy the 3 video processing cards that would equal the dual tuners (and one for play back), you are looking at several hundred dollards already. The you have to factor in the rest of the computer, the harddrive space, etc.
Yes, this boombox is definitely compatible with the ST4 satellite radio.
No joe, it doesn't come with a receiver. Unless specified.
Yes.
They will work with any mp3 player.
I am not familiar with lepai...but these speakers have a broad freq response on there own. I recommend a subwoofer so you can FEEL the low end.
It seems like it would work fine ...
I ran these from the audio out on my DVD player to the TV. Then ran regular audio cables from these to my stereo receiver which I have my external speakers hooked up to. Now I can play a CD in DVD player and bypass the TV all together. Would have to see the back of your TV.
If you are talking about 2 audio sources this wouldn't work. you will need mixing equipment.
My DW-RJ45AB switch's box is marked 'Made in China'.
I see no difference in download speeds at all Mike V
I would say yes because the adapters should fit almost all of the products we use. I use it on my lap top and other areas as well in the house
No
Yes.
Yes, I bought this player to listen to audiobooks which I borrow from a couple of different public libraries. There is room for 10 bookmarks, so I can keep up with several different books or different sections of the same book.
I ran one over 50 feet
YES this works on CLASSIC iPods only. It does not work for iPod touch. Thank you for your inquiry. Mary @ FAB FINDS 4 YOU on Amazon
This model, as I purchased it, predates the Lightning connector, so no.
Yes the TV can easily be removed from the mount. By removing two screws the tv can easily be removed from the mount. Unscrew' tilt up' lift and remove. Very very easy to work with this mount. It would be wise to get a more solidly built set of screws if you plan on screwing and unscrewing them over and over again.
No, Mine were made in china and look 100% real but they are fakes as the real ones are not make in china. they sound decent for the price even if they are fake. the metal band is off center and the band and plastic and already separating from each other. Deals on Wheels is not a Sennheiser Authorized Dealer. you should read my review about these. I decided not to go cheap after a bought these and purchased the Monster Turbine High Performance In-Ear Speakers http://www.amazon.com/Monster-Turbine-High-Performance-In-Ear-Speakers/dp/B001LNO722 Direct from Amazon.com and not from a reseller.
Yep, check out this link... http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configurator_new/modelsInfo.asp?SysID=35117&Find=Find
yes. 1GB one does work perfectly for my VX8600, but CNET.com says a 2GB SD doesnt work in their 8600 by somehow. another thing, after you bought this card dont bother for a music essentials kit, I found only a pair of earbuds is usefull.
Hi, go to this link: http://www.cpu-upgrade.com/mb-ASUS/P5VD2-X.html. It says that yes it is compatible. But Always check your mobo website for more info and exact compatibility before doing anything. Good Day!
Yes, you can use your own photo for the wallpaper. I don't have firsthand experience with the M so can't comment in detail on which is better.
I am buying the creative W. From looking at a competitor's website, it appears the the archos has less choices for download possibilities. In other words, the creative W has more choices. I am buying for the image viewing and mp3, but I want the capability of watching videos in the future
The Zen Vision W does come with an ac wall adapter but an auto charger is not included. Also, you can charge your player via the included usb cable by plugging it into any computer.
Yes, considering they do not cover your entire ear they do block out a good amount of sound.
The iPod shuffle comes with the docking station and the headphones included in the box. Everything you would need to start using it, and perfect for a 9 year old girl. They are very tough and durable, though somewhat small (might be easy to loose).
This camera is NOT waterproof.
Hi, problem probably came from the flash memory card, you may try with different one (fast one like San Disk Ultra II or Extreme III). If you still get banding on images, then it's the camera, you should return it or exchange for another one.
yes you can...what i do is load a dvd movie to my sd card media videocam (thru AV in) then from my videocam , transfer to my desktop..then convert media via vision w media explorer... it goes straight in my Vision W
The one I have will handle legal size.
40 1/8 in (101.92 cm) OR 3 feet 4 1/8 inches
What connector are you using? Get one long enough to go to the receiver and tv #2
Video and Sound travel through HDMI. That's all you need!
We can ship to APO addresses, however the freight charges may be higher. Thanks
You can as far as I know, some airlines like AirTran offer it on their planes at no charge. Reception will be the big issue, best thing is to get a Stiletto, record your favorite stuff before you go and use it like an ipod when you fly..that is what I do. Hope this helps you. Stellite radio is great, I know have 4 Sirius receivers and listen to it on the computer all the time, you will never go back to regular radio! Good luck.... mike k
yes it does.
Adaptor is in combo with the lens , please check it out.
I ordered the lens to work with my Pentax K-50. Be sure to get the 2X teleconverter with the lens. You can get T-mount adapters for the lens to fit several camera mountings.
I don't really know but I 'm going to check this evening : if there's a thread,it probably means we can find some ! Your question is interesting !
This is not recommended.
Yes, the Harmony works fine with my Olevia 242TFHD. However Olevia is not a pre-listed component, you enter Olevia and model # under other and it finds it under Syntax-Brillian (which is Olevia Corporate name). Or use Syntax-Brillian instead of Olevia in the pre-list.
Just make sure that if you are planning to use a barlow that it is a threaded barlow
Standard T-Mount
As far as I'm aware ... yes
Look for a wireless booster for your signal, if you can string up a LAN cable it's much better and faster. Cheers
Hi, This lens as you says the D3000, D5000, D7000 in the series of camera does not work for the auto focus. And you can manual shooting. Thanks in advance.
Yes, this lens has a manual aperture ring. Hope this helps. Thank you for shopping our store. We appreicate your business. Blue Penn Cameras
it will
I think they are sending out refurbs or returns. My remote does not work with my HD period and never did. My set came in a white box and not the retail box pictured. I guess this a case of getting what you paid for.
as it was explained to me by a garmin tech, the license is on the gps receiver allowing me to legally install and use the software on more than one phone. i use the software on Moto Q's running windows mobile 5
The bose can read mp3, but your better off getting an MP3 player, go to radio shack buy a 3mm male aux wire, plug in the iPod, and now you have music coming off the Aux.
You specifically have to plug it into the Line In on your soundcard (usually the light blue port). Also, make sure in your volume settings that Line In is not muted, and that its volume level is high enough. I'm not sure what speakers you have, but the jack on the front/side of the speakers are usually for headphones.
Yes I believe it is compatible with Mac devices.
Yes it will, just make you set your boot priority is set to USB not CD-ROM
I bought this item for two totally different hard drives and used a youtube video to show me how access one drive and it worked great on both drives.
2
This is a sound card that goes inside your computer to play sound ..music..its not headphones or speakers...its the part that makes the sound work in your computer...it works very well i have one in my computer...... you have to buy speakers and headphones to listen to the sound on.your computer.. Hope this answer helps.. Ken Irishman 55...i would recommend thissound card to any one looking for a good one..
It comes as a pair. 2 speakers.
The CH6520 is a 4-ohm unit so you need to connect two of this in parallel to work on a 2-ohm system.
I bought this product by mistake. So, I haven't used it yet.
mine didn't connect
When I ran out of rope,I used them to tie a hooker to a goat.
The box says it's good to 70 inches. Should be OK. The reason I got this one was because it was wide enough to be sure I could mount it to two wall studs. Most were only 28 or 30 inches. I used lag bolts to mount to the wall and might suggest it for anything that big
Don't buy it- mine melted. Dangerous.
Yes two prongs will fit if e.g. european but not german schuko. Note also other comments about wattage. I use it with a 230V charger for my toothbrush, my charger has wattage of 3 Watts. With this wattage the step up converter works excellent.
Unsure as we use for inside announcements only.
Yeah it has the mini headphone input. I've ran my phone through it playing Internet radio
If you read the instructions on the original page, it says to put it in your phone to format it, not your computer.
Definitely (mp3 compatible), though may depend on the device being used in (e.g. older phones/players).
The answer is "yes" but you don't need it for a laptop. Laptops, cell phone and camera chargers are all "universal" (dual) voltage devices and will automatically detect and adapt to 110/220V. You simply need the correct plug adapter for them. Most of them are stamped as "110v/220v" on the power source and can easily be checked. We use this converter for devices that can only handle 110v such as electric toothbrush charger, electric razor or other small appliance.
Yes it works everywhere where is 220v power
Without knowing what you want to use them in, it's not possible to answer your question. Let us know if the memory specification of the computer/motherboard lists the voltage and timing requirements for the memory, and if it will accept ECC, only non-ECC, or allows for a mix of ECC and non-ECC (error checking and correction).
No.
I have a Canon t3i and I bought this converter. It did not fit the camera and I had to send it back.
Not compatible with EF-S
You're lucky your Momento still functions at all. The back light on mine failed years ago. I don't believe they can be "reset", its slowly failing.
sigma recently came out with 17-70 version which has a C mark on it. its a good walk around woiyth f2.8 to 4. IS or OS is a good thing and its a personal decision. I have always preferred them as sometimes you forget to hold your breath for that magic moment which may not be as crisp otherwise.
Mine is made for canon.. U need to get the one for Nikon.. But I am not sure about Nikon lens since u got 2 kinds of lens for nikon
Well I have this strip but it didn't list it and Belkin doesn't make this brand any more. There is a newer version that is listed at 1800J. Here is a link on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Outlet-Protector-Telephone-Protection/dp/B000JEACFK/ref=pd_sim_sbs_e_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0ZTVHR271WGRDJ253FCW The info on Belkin site is at http://www.belkin.com/us/BP108200-06/p/P-BP108200-06/
Hi Christine. This Belkin Pivot-Plug Surge Protector model BP112230 doesn't have a built-in / resettable circuit breaker. The following models have built-in resettable circuit breaker: Belkin F7C007 Conserve Smart AV and Belkin F7C01008q Conserve Switch. Thanks. Belkin Support http://www.belkin.com/us/support
It doesn't. The claim works well for Belkin to sell what they call surge protectors. If you read through the comments you will see that 1) people's equipment is damaged when a surge goes through these surge protectors, and 2) Belkin denies damage claims from customers who had faith in the company.
there are two holes on the back of it so that you can hang it on 2 screws on a wall. the screws are not included.
EF-S mount.
Yes but on regards to this system it has been discontinued and these while available are leftovers. My wife bought this unit about a year ago and it died 4 months after she bought it and it was not returnable any longer Just an FYI
It will with a lot of effort pretty much useless thanks for recomending it when i bought the camera.Ihave since bought one rhat fits from another source.
It has two slots so it would fit a 5v or 3.3v slot, 3.3v slots are fairly uncommon from what I have found though. Do you know what mother board you have, or model of pc?
It has JVC printed on it so I think it is. Has worked well with my JVC radio
Height is 5.5" top to bottom 5" side to side
It has 28 sleeves that hold 8 CDs each (back and front). You wouldn't want to put anymore sleeves than that since it gets heavy when it's full.
They are bundled together.
If I recall, it comes with an info sheet BUT this is a universal bay, which means it's compatible with most motherboards. Where the plugs go depends on your board, which is why it would be best to consult the motherboard manual before installation. If you have a late-model board, the plugins should be clearly marked. Be careful! Plugging one of these cords into the wrong outlet on the board could cause the bay to burn out, which is why I had to buy another! :)
The camera inside the casing can move up and down only. So you can point it anywhere between the ceiling or floor. The only way to move the camera from side to side is to move the external case the direction you want. Hope this helps.
The Nikon D40 and D40X do not have a focus drive motor and thus can only use AF-S and AF-I lenses. I do not believe this Sigma lens falls under that category as it does not have its own AF motor.
Not familiar with that model, but as long as you have an available PCI-E port, it should work. You should be more concerned about the OS you are going to use this on, versus the hardware you are planning on plugging into.
I don't know however it works fine with ESXi 5.1. I would go to the intel site and check if there are MAC drivers for this.
Movil part 14 cm X 5.5 cm and base 6.6 cm(10.5 with the screws) X 8.9 cm
This head will work with the Manfrotto monopod 294
5 rolls.
no
No. The DK-22 adapts a rectangular viewfinder for round accessories, like a round eyecup or right-angle finder. The D2Xs already has a round viewfinder. Just unscrew the eyepiece that comes on the camera and screw on whatever you're trying to use...
Yes, I have a canon 60d which I use with this tripod all the time. The plate has a standard size screw that supports medium sized camera nicely.
It is!
I have no idea what you mean by "plug in"?
the HK turns off automatically if no song is played from the ipod. i assume that's the battery saving feature. i am not sure how long it takes to turn off, but in my case i had to wait about 10 minutes until it turned off from alone.
It has a section at the front and back for page inserts but the DVD pockets are four to a page and double-sided. What I did was use the bottom left pocket to store the page insert for TV seasons and store the disc in front of the page. If you attempt to use the upper pockets then the page will stick out the top of the book.
yes. an adjustable one.
handbrake is a good tool (for macs & beta version for pc-google search) to covert dvd to ipod format & drag to itunes or your ipod directly.
It's flash memory, not a hard drive. Flash is far more expensive for compact sizes. I would do a few searches on "NAND Flash" and "High Capacity Flash" and you will see that the price makes sense for the low amount of space.
Nope, according to Ars Technica's Review of the iPod Touch, the iTunes Wi-Fi Store will not have Podcasts, Audiobooks, TV Shows, or Movies available. Sorry to be the bearer of bad news...
I'm selling mine! :)
Don't be sad, I actually prefer the 5.5 generation over the classic. I ended up keeping mine instead of getting a classic. Its much zippier in navigating, especially if you have a lot of videos and the click wheel works much smoother. All in all the 5.5 generation is my favorite thus far.
you get all the apple box stuff, and then that's put inside an amazon box
There is a way to transfer your songs from the old computer to your new computer. I did this successfully a few months ago. I am fairly technically inept, but I was able to do it following Apple's instructions (see link at end of this post). It was a little bit of an ordeal, as I had to use my iPod as an external hard disk to move all my stuff over. However, if you follow the instructions from Apple's help link, you should be able to do it too. Good luck! http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1329
If you're planning on running, get the Nano. Hard drives don't take kindly to shock and the drive in the Classic is no exception. It will fail much, much faster with the repeated shock of running while the flash-based nano will play merrily along to however many miles you want to jar it over.
I got the two-port and the cables are about 3ft or so
Wish I could tell you for sure but no can do. I use this unit with a laptop for programming electronic keypad access control units. Didn't say it would work specifically for this use but communication is communication. Works fine and the price was right to give it a try.
the blue power adaptor you are talking about is called "inverter". You need that one for it to work.
Yes
Only if you have a wired connection
Although I'm not where I can check the length IIRC it's about 4' long.
I bought it for my XM INNO satellite radio receiver. I don't know the exact size of the pin. Perhaps you can do a search for the replacement plug for the INNO (I believe it is Panasonic) and see what the size is.
You need a receiver.
It seems as if the SB5101U has an Optional 1.1 USB data port available. That may be the only difference between the two. I just bought one from Best Buy yesterday and if works just the same. It was a replacement for my old and broken SB5101, which was made approximately on Dec 23, 2004. (I took it apart and looked at the circuit board. Part number - 512841-003). I like to take apart broken electronics to see how they work.
No. You don't need this on the Nano 7th, the nike run app. is already installed and I think it works better.
I'm not certain, but it's between 17 and 21. It's plenty of bandwidth though.
Unlimited, but the number of concurrent IPSEC VPN connections is 25. If you don't need more than 10 IPSEC VPN connections and aren't going to do failover, you can get the ASA5505-UL-BUN-K9, still get unlimited internet access, and save over $200.

You are correct; one is for the telephone line from the wall and the other is for the telephone receiver at the desk. In my case the receiver on the desk is the master station for seven cordless handsets in seven locations in the house, so the whole house is covered.
first answered I dont know, but then i tried it and am sorry to say NO mine did not, it is however at least 50 % faster than the Willrose that I was using, it actually slowed the PC down, hope this helped!
There are two slots in the back of the case, and the armband easily slides in behind them. I have it on right now, and it seems to work well. I've tried swinging my arm around, and it's barely budged. I'm definitely quite pleased with this set so far. (and the case itself is not nearly as hard to get on and off as some people have said. All I did was slide it through the hole where the screen goes, then pop the top up over it)
This will allow you to output a VGA signal from your G4, but as far as the VGA to HDMI goes, that depends on what type of converters you have. If you currently can run a VGA signal (from another computer for example) through your adapters and get it on your flat screen via HDMI then yes, this adapter should make no difference in that chain of connections. It will of course a non-HD resolution (unless your VGA/HDMI adapter happens to be an upscaler), but yes there shouldn't be any reason why it would not work.
Revisa las specs de tu Vaio... Verifica la velocidad 667 MHz? o mejor todavia confirmar la compatibilidad de este modulo con tu Vaio... Saludos
No, it can be mounted to a wood surface without grounding.
The information I have says it will not work.
Hi Wes We appreciate the question and the interface you will need is the XSVI-5520-NAV(J) Thank you for choosing The Wires Zone.
Yes
It will fit as long as your trailblazer doesn't have a Bose system. If the radio or speakers have the Bose logo on them you'll need the PAC os2c bose
If you got factory amp no don't work you need different gmos
It does not work on 220V, the box is really big and heavy.
There are two 1/8" stereo outputs that can go to anything. I have it setup to switch between a set of wireless headphones and my monitor speakers. I leave the mic jacks unconnected since I don't need that functionality.
No, this product doesn't do any amplification. It can only reduce the output volume. You need to find a "headphone amplifier" to do what you need.
Bruce, yes it will work in your Nikon D40. These are great SD cards and they are fast enough to capture several photos per second. Hope that helps.
The item I received was in a cardboard mailer that protected the SanDisk card that rattled around in the protective container.
I used this in a Dell 3100 with Windows 7 Pro with no problems...
sorry... we haven't used this in years and I have no idea what to tell you. I just wanted to respond so you knew Amazon really did forward questions to people who bought items you ask questions about. good luck!
It isn't marked on the item so not exactly sure. It may have been written on box but have thrown out.
Yes, it should work on any door where the prongs can be wedged between the door and the door frame. Then when the door is opened the prongs separate to activate the alarm.
220Volts? No 9v. I believe 800ma. It is for connecting multiple component devices to one tv input.
no it doesn't. this unit works with 30-pin Ipods , but the new Ipods are 8-pin. You can however buy a converter/ adapter so the new Ipod will work with old 30-pin accessories.
Pocket Access is not part of the PocketPC anymore, it hasn't been for quite a few years because they want the developers to use the PocketPC version of SQL Server instead. You need to find an older PocketPC and copy the necessary binaries from the old PDA to the new one but unfortunately I don't know what their names are.
It's like 1.5 times a ski case and very heavy. You need two persons to handle it and a truck. I would not recommend traveling with it.
As stated above, it is a 16:9 aspect ratio. The wall hangers(flush mount kit) are included in the box.
Yuo need 3.5 audio cable connect to pc
Yes it is
no wire ga. size on wire. rated 15amps and nearly 1900 watts. I bought two and both are on 15 amp fuses. Heavier duty than prior strips.
Yes, it should work with any Nikon DSLR.
Good Afternoon, I apologize but most dash kits come in black/dark grey looking color. Thank you.
Easy lower the freq range where it does not blink anymore and then make your search in the place you living.
Your will need the Canon telephoto camera mount 20-0051and the Opteka adapter for the canon EOS to make it work.
it fit anywhere because you have to put it to the lenses to be able to attache the lenses to the camera.is not a too big is a decent size for lenses also fit even the telesphoto lenses too

Don't know
I would say no as this uses the Sony charger adapter which is unique. The NZW-B133F looks like it has a standard USB connection to a computer and doesn't use the Sony adapter
No because it has the SONY connection, not the IPOD connection. It's a proprietary connection
it's come only case.no ssd adapter.This case just switchable hard drive.
The largest drive I've installed is 500GB, but I'm using 4 of them in two different systems (2 each), and am very pleased with them. I use Acronis True Image backup to multiple partitions on my backup drives, which are easily swapped out with the power off.
It comes with a charger. About a three hr charge per charge
No
Nope you have to order. 3 months for 65. Not bad. Cool little radio
You can take the audio output from your satellite receiver connect it to your pc and save it as a .wav file then use an mp3 ripper to convert it to mp3.
Use any length USB cable i.e. RadioShack Model: 13172 | Catalog #: 55010623
I bought this item and could not use it because a dongler is needed, meaning of dongler: a converter from RCA cable to HDMI, meaning of RCA cable: the cable that has a 3.5mm tip on one side and yellow, red & white on the other, another important detail if your blackberry Q10 has a 3.5mm output you can if not you cannot use it unless you have an adapter for the output plug
yes it is 100-240v 50/60Hz
The Lenovo made pens are garbage. 50 bucks for a bic quality pen with a button that breaks with the slightest push too hard. Whether it works or not I'd avoid it.
Yea. you need to remove the plastic around the radio on the dashboard. Behind the ac control is a black box with a small switch on it. Flip the switch to the "set" setting with the key turned to accessory. Press lock and unlock on the remote til the hazards flash. Then set the switch to it's original postion.
Yes 04-06
One.
Hi Matt, I believe that lens takes a 58mm filter, which will be a lot less expensive than the 77mm I had to buy for my lens. Double check. It should say on the front of the lens. Make sure you order the right size. I've been happy with these filters. Good luck. Larry
it does magnify them, but i'm not sure how much. if you just want to look to get an idea of what the slide is, the window is fine. if you want more, like who, where, etc. I would recommend the viewer. I used it to sort slides that i inherited to decide what to put on a disk to share with the rest of the family. It was a good investment for that.
2 3/4 in diagonal
Sorry-cannot, as I sent them unopened to my sons. Is the screen size not in the description? I thought it was. I would imagine rather small as the boxes were not very large.
Yes it does it's really a party favorite
We used a PC and this Mac the Mac was much better. Much more simplistic and apple has a superior product.
Honestly what I've found works best (especially with skin oil) is a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. Obviously, don't get the thing wet as you would if you were cleaning a kitchen counter or something, but a completely bone-dry Magic Eraser works very well for this.

It's more about the lens than the camera body. You can use this with any lens if you buy the proper adapter.
It's just a little accessory bag, I'm using it only for a small flash attachment I bought for my Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ200, which is a big camera. The camera does not fit in this little bag. The dimensions of the bag are found in the Lowepro technical description. If you own the camera, take a ruler and measure the dimensions. Otherwise look online for the dimensions of each item.
on the bottom is both a 1/4-20 female
Probably can - I used it with a Nikon AW100 for selfies.
it fits on mine
No set up is required. Just plug in all of the cables and go. Your computer has no idea that it is sharing a mouse, keyboard, monitor, mike or speakers.
Yes, the KVM draws power from the USB ports, so a monitor connection is not needed. Especially when you have multiple monitors for each computer, using a KVM to switch monitors is not practical. Using one set of keyboard and mouse for multiple computers is.
Did you format the card ? If so then are you on mac or Windows 8?
I am sure that the 16GB card would hold plenty of MP3 files
you can place an jpeg image on the screen and write at top of it. Then you can save that to pdf or jpeg. the pad record everything that is been writen on it.
You are supposed to be able to do so, but the conversion process is faulty. They need to do much more work on this tablet to bring it up to the level of their promises. I waited too late to send my back so I'm stuck with it, but I don't bother to use it because it does not work properly. I even bought the software to convert and it was a waste of money.
I dont know, I have a d3100 and it fits fine.
Still available
Just received the DAW-652. By the look, it sticks out about 1.5" out of the slot!
Do not understand your question. Woud you please elaborate. I've had great success with this device. It will receive on the "N" band and is backwards compatible with the "G" band. Didn't even install the software, simply slide it in the PCMCIA slot on your PC and you should be good to go. I get an average of 270 Mbps on the download.
Yes it is PCI sound card. Creative Sound Blaster Audigy SE PCI Sound Card.
Yes, this is compatible . Also, this is a full height bracket, if your PC case supports half-height, this wouldn't fit.
Don't buy this even if it would. Its a generic one and our broke in two weeks and we had to buy an authentic one. Put your money towards an authentic one. After it broke, in read so many reviews of the same thing happening to other people.
I believe it will work with Linux. I do have a fair return policy if it doesn't work.
I have the speaker placed on a shelf. The speaker appears to be heavy and substantial. However, I don't know the weight and/or the dimensions of the TV you indicate you want to place on top of the speaker. I would be inclined not to place a 40" TV on top of any speaker as I would be more concerned about the TV being on a large stable surface so that it wouldn't topple over.
Should be just fine. This is the manufacture's specs on your laptop: Memory/ RAM 2 GB Max RAM Supported 4 GB Technology DDR2 SDRAM Speed 667 MHz / PC2-5300 Slots Qty 2
Sorry, I'm not sure, I'd ask the seller, we bought the memory for a Toshiba.
It depends on a lot of things. You have to take into consideration FSB, cache, the new features of the core 2 duo chips, if your motherboard can handle it, etc. I'm currently running a low end dual core pentium d 2.66ghz and it would not perform as good as this e4300 even though it's faster. It has a smaller cache and slower fsb among other things. Processor frequency is like a lot of other things, sometimes quality is better than quantity; a higher frequency will almost never dictate whether or not it will perform well.
Hello. Bob I buy it for a dell dimension 8400 and works perfect.
The box says that it has 'compatibility to newer 24-pin and older 20-pin motherboards" and lists various Dell models. Their '24 hour online user-friendly technical support" is www.startech.com/support
Don't know about OptiPlex but works perfectly with a Dell Studio XPS.
I bought mine 5 years ago. It had a stock fan and paste applied. The cpu is still going strong but I have oberclocked it to 3.0 going watercooled. I wouldn't use stock fan unless cpu is only used for office type application.
No
Yes, you have to lift the handset in order to listen the dial tone.
You will either need a headset and an amplifier combo and that will include everything you need to work. Or depending on the Plantronics headset you have you could get a direct connect cord that would plug directly into the phone without the amplifier.
Your headset might be damaged. Suggest you contact Plantronics support.

The 981 is 5.1 audio, while the 980 is 7.1. The 980 is built as a great "all rounder", which means it has good video output and good audio output. The 981 gets better video, but suffers in the audio. If you are willing to spend a little more, wait a bit for the 983. Much better video output, and will be 7.1 audio too. Oh, one more thing, the 980 can accept USB devices, but the 981 cannot.
Many "backups" are converted to a lower bitrate to fit a dual-layer disc on a single layer DVDR, which is why backups may not look great at 1080P. 1080P isn't as forgiving as a standard 480i set.
You probably don't need this top-of-the-line Oppo player for a 23" set unless you plan to watch a lot of PAL discs from overseas (the 981 has the best PAL-to-NTSC conversion of any of their players). I would guess that you probably don't need an upconverting player at all, but I don't have any actual experience to base that on. Just a guess. You might try asking over in some of the forums for TVs that you're considering to see if any owners have bought (or regretted buying) and upconverting player.
Yes, that is the camera I have.
is your camera a cool pix 800 no fit or a D800 should fit
I'm not using am amp currently and they work great!
Not sure, but if it does it's not hard to connect to the unit
Very good product. Fast response will buy again.
I used "Mediabridge Coaxial Digital Audio Video Cable - (50 Feet) - Triple Shielded, F-Pin to F-Pin with Easy Grip Connector Caps" from Amazon. This is RG-6. Works like a charm.
Yes! This also lets you have a lower signal from the tv, and then amplify it with the control nob, plus up to three other people can listen with headphones too, each with their own control, which is great for video gaming and watching movies when or where there needs to be quiet. Have fun!
The ones I purchased both times are DVD-R, NOT DVD+R.
Could you please explain in more detail. Are you trying to say you would like to use this item to connect via Wi-Fi? If so, then no, you cannot do that with this item, this item is just a switch. What you need is a Wireless Router.
This is referring to the diameter of the threads on the end of the camcorder's lens, where you screw on lenses and filters. This camcorder is designed for 37mm lenses and filters, so if you stick to that size, you won't need any adapter rings.
Yes having a slot for SD card extn
It would not read any floppy disks. I did find one at TigerDirect and CDW that works. It is a BYTECC BT-144 and is around $24 at either store.
I don't see why it wouldn't. I have the sony 2gb memory stick and I have used it in this camcorder for several years. You would have more memory than I do, but that shouldn't be an issue.
I do not see a traditional exterior jack for a microphone.
No, you down load to your computer
This was a gift to our grandson, so I am not able to answer. He used it to record his skateboarding.
it has a low light option that kinda helps. one of the sony's has green night vision thing
Yes, but it can sometimes be difficult to get steady shots with it. If you're doing long study shoots for school, get a tripod. But it is a nice, easy to use camera. Also your pictures will only blow up to the certain size, which is fairly large, but just make sure it's large enough. ;)
I am currently selling mine with the charger (and a lot of extra accessories) with the camera but amazon does sell them separately as well.

Yes.
Yes it does.
The Sony web site says that the silver version is only available on thier site (directly from Sony) so buying this camera new from anywhere else you should expect to only get a black one.
I'm getting my GS320 delivered Monday, and will post a list of the accompanying accessories at that time.
it needs a custom battery and charger, not just double A's
Yes
NO!
Yea but it gets hot and it cuts it self off
Yes you can change your voice from male to female and female to male. You have to play around with the tone pitch and bass of the voice to get the results you want. P.S also helps if you have a good mic
Well that depends if there are two connection terminals (positive & negative) for the antenna on the back of your system. If so, this antenna will vastly improve your FM reception. I have a 40 year old Pioneer SX-636 AM/FM receiver and live in the countryside. After adding this antenna to my system it now picks up numerous FM stations that I could not tune in before. I am quite elated and satisfied with the antenna.
Search on eBay 'SC-D372 battery'; there are plenty of dealers of various camera batteries.
Not being a expert on these things, looked in 'Specifications' in the Operating Instructions book that came with the unit, under 'power output' 2X100W. Have had this unit for over a year, and it has done everything I wanted.
not it does not comes with RCA jack or any cables, just comes speakers as is. hope helped you.
They are decidedly meh. As part of a decent system, their flaws will probably not be noticed. But don't kid yourself, these things are priced how they are for a reason.
I put my HX50V in here and it fits very well. A little bit snug -- the wrist strap sticks out or needs to be oriented to the bottom of the case. But in general, yes it's a great fit for the HX50V.
Hi Zippy, The bag was designed as a camera carrying case with room for spare battery or memory stick only. Vincent
My Sony HX50v fits perfectly in it (Product Dimensions: 6.1 x 5 x 2.7 inches) Canon PowerShot ELPH 330 12.1MP (Product Dimensions: 0.9 x 3.8 x 2.2 inches) I think you can fit your camera and charging cable too !!
These are not USB speakers; they plug into an audio jack on the computer. The extra "ipod station" has an additional audio input jack and comes with a patch cable to plug into an MP3 player/ipod. Sound is ok for the price. annoying electronic hum when not in use and left powered on.
Yes it's a Sony battery. Don't know about that camera compatibility.
According to 'Billy's 4-star review, this turntable can be used to connect to stereo systems and listen to your vinyl. I had that doubt as well, but reading the reviews helped.
This is probably far too late to help you, but I have the 680 in NYC, and the MSN Direct reception is horrendous.
I do not know the maximum weight but I do not think it would safely hold a heavy camera. We do a lot of photography also and I would not trust it for that. My husband is using this for a spotting scope while hunting and that is about the most I would trust it on.
Try updating the OS first with Garmin's WebUpdater which is found on their website under Support&gt;updates/downloads. Prior to downloading the WebUpdater, if you click on "show all updates/downloads" you can see what the latest firmware version is for your 580. Good luck!
Yes, the 275 has updated features (see the list on the Amazon page for new features) that the 370 doesn't have. The 370, while discontinued, is still supported (maps and perhaps firmware updates).
Since I don't have this unit, I'd be guessing. I very much doubt Mexico and the Bahamas are included. As far as the other countries, I'd assume that they are, but check with Garmin to be sure.
A subwoofer is all you need...perhaps even getting a subwoofer with its own built in amp would be great
I dont need S/N , this is e-delivery License - in PDF file .
probably not completely what else I think you'll need is subscription based upgrade from Cisco to get definitions to receive updates and fully function. -cory
Yes, with splitters you can run all 8! I currently have this set up powering 2 Swiftech pumps, 4 sets of cold cathodes an 6 120mm fans in an XSPC case holding my liquid cooled Xbox 360. So yes you can use this an run all 8 fans &#128526;
If the role bars are the same width on an 08 as they are on a 87-95 yes it will, if it is wider it will fit w a little fabricating.
I don't know,but I'm having problem with one of the speakers,Im going to find out.
you can update your nokia n800 by going to http://europe.nokia.com/A4305010 Hope that helps!
YES, BUT WHY DOES IT TAKE TOSHIBA SO LONG TO SHIP THE FREE DVDs? I HAVE BEEN WAITING TWO MONTHS. THIS IS SIMPLY UNCONSCIONABLE, ESPECIALLY AS THERE ARE LIMITED ITEMS IN THE OFFER. BUYERS BEWARE.
I mounted a bridge camera using the supplied 1/4" adapter. That worked fine. But as some of the other questions have alluded to, the tripod is a little bit shaky. It is very light weight.
No it doesn't
No. It is about as basic as you can buy with enough power to enhance your night viewing and enjoyment.
I've never tried the 21061, so cannot say how big the difference is. But with more than 1.6x the light gathering power of 21061, 21063 should be able to see more dark sky objects, like nebulae and galaxies. For terrestrial viewing and bright planets, there should be no big difference.
They are silver. I put them in my open bow boat. They work pretty well for the money. I'm happy with them. Hopes this helps
I'm not sure...your best bet is to go to humminbird.com, "Products" tab, "Accessories" tab, then search under "Transducers and related items" tab. In the details for each transducer it will tell you what model(s) that transducer fits.
transducer is generic. Be careful...The T in the model number designates that it reads temperature. The one they sent me did NOT have that capability, and I didn't notice until I had installed the unit.
No
It seems pretty comfortable for me. The buds are nice and round and fit well into my ears.
The cord is quite lengthy at 9 feet 10 inches. Hope this helps :)
I couldn't get it to work with a modem, something about the frequency difference, but I haven't tried it with a fax so I don't know for sure.
I returned it and never received a refund from seller and no wat to reach Amazon to help. Don't buy from Amazon
I listen to music on the boombox while I work in my garden keeping it in the shade sometimes up to 20 feet away. I often put the volume at the max and depending upon the songs can hear the music quite loud and clearly. When I walk away I can still hear music 85 feet distant. I recharge my 8 "D" batteries daily. I am pleased that I can enjoy listening to both my cassettes and CD albums!
I am very disappointed by this machine. It is said All Regions, but is not, and can't find any keys to unlock it. False advertising.
I am assuming you first removed the plastic needle cover ... ?
The EX811 is 4x7.
Take them to a video transfer store and have them convert to video files on DVD. Or if you have a desktop PC, buy a firewire PCI E card.
Yes
As long as the kindle has a headphone adapter (pretty sure it does) you should be able to use it. My daughter uses hers w/ her leapfrog tablet, MP3 player & my tablet.
The Califone 3068-AV has a 10Ft coiled cord.
I reall don't know, but if you click on the product's picture and then where the description appears, click on more details. Hope this helps. I don't use it myself, it was a gift for my son for his birthday.
Is it the one with the volume knob that's not working? (sorry, I don't have them in front of me). Have you ever replaced capacitors in them? That's what caused mine (and many, many other sets) to die very soon after purchase... but after replacing the bad capacitors they are working like new. Sorry, I don't know what you mean by re-doing the wires.
No. One stereo mini plug feeds two powered speakers. They only come in pairs. Works great with computers, tablets and smart phones.
Yes, Sharon, it most certainly does and the adapter was available on amazon the last time I looked.
it supports nothing,it broke soon after. I needed it to play French language cd's while walking and the product broke
I don't see why not - just plug it from the headphone jack area of the player itself into the auxilary plug-in to your SOLE treadmill speaker system (IF you have an auxilary-in on your SOLE treadmill speaker system).
nope
well, the TZ3 is more for outdoor/good light photos.... its bad for low-light(because the flash is weak, and the anti-noise algorithm employed by the processor for high-ISO blurs out fine detail)..... consider your priorities.... zoom, type of surrounding for shooting, size, price...
nope
How many amps does the tape deck use? I'll need to calculate the wattage for you.
If you mean USA 220V, then no! USA 220V is 3-wire split phase (two hot, one neutral), European 220V is 2-wire (one hot, one neutral). You can quite easily make a cord that splits the single 220 into two 110s, just run one hot and the neutral to one receptacle and the other hot and the same neutral to the other receptacle. This is what is done from the panel in your home to the dual receptacles on the wall. Note that I take no responsibility for electrocution/fire/apocalypse if you wire this incorrectly!
No
No. Only US. I live in Brazil, so I install the Igo and use it. The Igo allows to install any map. Since it you have the map (you can find on the internet).
Yes..its 52mm. Be sure your using the screw-on collar that came with the camera.
It fit my 561 perfectly and I believe it will fit all the 500 series models. Am not sure of other series. By the way, it is a nice quality and good screen protector. Lightkeeper
i'd say a hardware store there pretty common
I can keep mine on permanently
By being a 300W converter, it means that it can support up to 300W. Since the combined wattage of your sewing machine and lamp are 115W which is less than 300W, this converter should work fine for you.
Yes current will be converted to 110. But I will advice to check the product manual. Thanks
No it comes with the hardware.
Unfortunately the Electric84H (16:9 AR) is only available in a black case. However, the Electric84V (4:3 AR) and Electric85X (16:10 AR) come in a white case. If you absolutely need a white 84" diagonal size in 16:9 aspect ratio, you may want to look at our VMAX or Home2 Series electric screens, or even our manual series.
If looking at it its on the left side
Yes
Over VGA, you are limited to a maximum resolution of 1024x768. I have tried going further but have had no luck; if anyone has had success, please tell. Over DVI and HDMI you should be able to output 1080p, I think. If you are using it to just display photos, I think 1024x768 would be fine. Also note that with the fullscreen (4:3) resolutions, you will have black bars on both sides of the picture.
Yes, as long as your amperage is correct. So the 2000 W version will run 8 amps.
I am currently deployed to Afghanistan and discovered the same thing. I just use 240V and have had no problems.
Our's came with remote number: CT-90276. It is 9-1/4 inches long by 2-1/4 wide. I would guess that most Toshiba remotes would work. In fact we have a Toshiba remote number: CT-90325 that came with a different Toshiba TV that operates the old REGZA just fine.
Yeah, it really is annoying. This happens when you use DVD+R (Plus). I use DVD-R (Minus) just to avoid that "Empty Title" menu. But the only advantage with using the DVD+R (Plus), is that it allows us to edit/create chapters/delete scenes/hide scenes after recording. The Dvd-R however only allows us to rename the title of the chapter or chapters (if you pressed "stop" in between recording).
It will plug into any 1/8 inch jack. Be aware that, first of all, this is a mono mic, not a stereo mic. I don't know if you care about that or not. Also, if your camcorder requires a mic that has its own amplification, this mic may not be loud enough.
Yes, but this sound card delivers the worst quality and over heats headphonesto the point of not being able to use them. I got to of them and they both did the same thing. Very unfortunate.
i just took mine into the shop for the same problem, very irritating hearing it turn on and off all the time just to start, it would take like 10 minutes for my tv to finally turn on, the technician at the shop said the power supply was bad and i wasn't getting enough power to the main board to turn the TV on, 200 bucks later, I am happy, fix it, it is worth it.
Does the color white make it worse? We had this problem on our last TV, a regular tube deal, and I kid you not replacing the component cables fixed it.
Thanks, that fixed it.
I have no problem returning items to Amazon.. They have great service.
i have the same "buzzing" sound coming from the vent on the left rear side. not sure if its normal but im going to set up service call to confirm. *update* ive been tweaking the settings and the buzzing seems to go way down if you put the contrast on about 50%, thus throwing the picture quality off. ive decided im going to send this tv back and replace it with the samsung lcd.
It could be that one of the mirrors has failed. This would be unusual. Contact Samsung and have them check it out
Your cable might not be HDCP compatible. HDCP is the copyright protection protocol used by certain devices, and some HDMI cables that arent HDCP compliant will not work with those devices. Your cable will probably work with xbox 360, PS3, and upconvert dvd players but probably won't work with blu-ray, hd-dvd, and STBs if it isnt HDCP compliant. I've had this problem before.
I have, it looks great, very high resolution, looks awesome playing HD quicktime movie trailers on it. Connect my Powerbook through mini-DVI to DVI converter, then use a DVI to HDMI cord its pretty huge though.. for a monitor for regular use, in my opinion, but maybe i'm just used to my 13" powerbook screen.
The ps3 can output at all the settings listed(use 720p or 1080i for best picture), regular cable will be 480i. This tv will be fine for your needs.
The 89 has PIP, bluetooth, and HDMI 1.3.
I'm with you. I was waiting for pay day and 2 days before the price went up. I'm hoping it goes down in the next few days/weeks. Amazon does have a 30 day price guarantee where if the price goes down after you've ordered you can contact them and they'll refund you.
No, standard 15amp 120v couldn't even meet its peak power demand not to mention the size ac/dc converter you would need. Buy a 120v amp you will spend more trying to convert this one.
Yes this is how we ran it. Worked great
You can just buy the add on speaker. Part #SPK-VELO2. It is just 900Mhz technology, like a wireless phone. In fact you can plug in as many additional speakers as you want including wireless rock speakers, floating pool speakers, hanging shower speakers etc with no limitations. There are 2 or 3 different channel settings on the back of the transmitter in case of interference or cross talk. Thats the beauty of this product - simplicity and crystal clear audio up to 150' away.
The height is not adjustable. The 204B and 204BW are height-adjustable.
We always use the usb instead of the blue tooth. We use our own software to capture the stream.
You don't need a receiver with this unit! It's self-amplified. Just plug it in to your TV via HDMI. Plug your other components in to the TV as well. At worst, you'll need to run a pair of RCA audio cables from the TV back to the audio input of the Sound Bar. Hope this helps
There is a release button in the bottom of the column which allows the column to be positioned at a 90 degree angle. In that position, the column can be slid sideways which allows the camera weight to be brought closer to the center of balance. The ballhead will allow the camera to be positioned downward to photograph documents, etc. The 190XPROB3 has been a great tripod for me--great quality at a good price.
I have used it to record episodes of t.v. shows and a few football games to DVD. I was able to watch them later with no issues. Note: I use broadcast television. I do not have cable or satellite.
Not unless you have a separate VCR. This is just a DVD recorder. I recorded all my old VCR tapes with it, from a VCR, and it works great.
Sorry, I never tried that. I used it for copying VHS that I recorded myself to DVDs. But I was VERY disappointed that it would not record from my DVR, refusing to "make more than the limit of 1 copy". The VHS is broken now, will play but not record. So I only use it to play DVD's.
can red and yellow and white work?
I just purchased a Toshiba D-VR610 DVD/VCR recorder (tunerless), for the purpose of copying my VHS tapes to DVD. Other than a poorly-written manual, I like the unit. I'm using rewriteable DVDs, so that I can learn how to use the unit without wasting DVDs. If you read through all of the reviews on the various websites (Amazon, Bestbuy, etc), you will find that this unit gets high marks by customers, whereas most other brands have various issues.
Yes.
Looks like that should work. Fairly standard battery across most of the JVC line.
The answer to all your questions is no.
This is powered by the a/c adapter, not the USB. I think it may know when to turn off and on because its hooked up to the computer. When the computer is on, it is on, and vice versa.
The first thing you have to do is to make sure that the drive is set to the format your MAC uses. It should work perfectly fine.
The end that plugs into the hard drive is mini USB. Do not use third party USB cables with this hard drive, the mini USB plug on those adapters is too loose.
Hi, definitely not 6 pounds. Closer to 2. It's probably about 7 inches tall if I had to guess. I'm at work and can't look at it at the moment. Hope that helps.
I have two, and the oldest is from 11/09. Personally, I like the older generation of VCR's that you could record multiple channels, and this one, you can only record what your are watching. I am not a DVD fan and will cling to my VCR's as long as possible. I can stop and play at an instant. Do not have to worry about previews, subtitles, different languages, etc. I'm old school and like simplicity.
yes i bought mine from amazon and it's under 2 years warranty. just fill out the paper work form their website and send your item in and they will send you a brand new set
Don't know about the back hookup (which I too would prefer) but maybe someone makes 90 degree angled component cables??
What purpose on earth would propel someone to buy a hi definition player to play it with composite cables??? That makes absolutely NO sense.
The battery has 2000mAh on it, as well.
The external power supply is AC --&gt; DC 12V@200mA So, yes, you could take a small 12vdc battery that has an out of about 200mA and power this unit. If you did use a 12vdc battery you could charge/recharge the battery with a small solar panel that you could purchase for about $20. For Reference: http://www.emtcompany.com/x10-xm14a-ac-power-supply-charger-adapter/101334292.html
No
I think so. I have not been able to get mine to work as when I get in bios and set it up nothing happens. Have problem getting into bios and nothing seems to work. Think it is perhaps a bad board.
Yes, I've read positive reviews on the audio with the A560
They are an excellent binoc. I do have some problem with lost width due to wearing glasses but that's not a big deal.
It uses a special rechargeable battery. Lithium Ion Battery 3.7V 760mAh
Yes, you will be able to download pictures to your mac. You can use iPhoto, or you can use the Canon-supplied software. (The Canon software rocks.)
Amazon has a 1g sd card for $6.I bought one last week.Mike
Well, the camera of course, a white USB cable, a string thing that you attatch the camera so as to prevent from dropping it (all or most cameras have this), a video cable, a 32 MB memory card, software to view your pics (ZoomBrowser EX and EOS Utility), two manuals for the camera (one for basic and one for the advanced user), a manual for the software and a manual for printing.
My old s230 did remote shooting. Canon removed this feature for no reason other than greed. Make something old and simple an "advanced feature" and charge more for it. Last canon I buy.
Yes, you can move forward and backwards by one song per click.
NYC.
Yes u can
Yes it works with an iphone 5 but it gets a bit static at times but great for your music
It will work, but you will only be able to answer/hang up calls. U will not be able to push your contacts to your radio because it uses a different bluetooth profile.
It should work with ANY computer. It connects to the computer through a USB port. If your machine is 2 years old, then you shouldn't have any problem connecting it. I am presuming that you are using a USB keyboard now, like I am. If so, then all you have to do is switch keyboards. Hope this helps. If you are still using a keyboard with the PO3 plug -- the round plug -- then the only think I know for you to do is try to find a USB-to PS2 plug, and I don't know if those exist.
Yes. It is also compatible with Windows 8 and 8.1. I have purchase four of them.
Hi I seem to remember that it was a 10 year warranty against manufacturers defects ie. Abuse and wear & tear are not covered. The warranty only applied to the United States and you have to pay shipping to Nikon USA. Nikon in other parts of the world will not honour the warranty.
Hi Eric, I wear glasses but I dont wear them when I use binoculars of any sort. I focus and adjust the bins for my eyes and it is just a second to whip the glasses off and raise the bins to my eyes. I feel I would have missed the bird or action wearing my glasses and using the bins anyway. I haven't found a pair of bins that doesn't make me feel uncomfortable looking through glasses and bins together - I include Leicas, Nikons, Lynx, Zeiss etc. Hope this helps. - Geoff
i bought two of the "Nextop-2 Packs Nikon EN-EL9 Brand New 1800mAh COMPATIBLE Battery for Nikon D40, D40x, D60" from here on amazon for my d40x which has a aftermarket battery grip and have been extremely happy. they outlast the standard nikon battery and i have had no compatibility issues with them whatsoever. i don't have an aftermarket charger and have been using all the batteries with the nikon charger that came with my camera.
No it does not you can wire them right to the back of your headunit
the series 3+ for sure [ i have one] and another one, just check the kodak site , and look at Z series for compatibility, I bought mine on a special at compgeeks for like 40 bucks. [refurb] and so far its flawless. Mostly bought it to charge the camera, search ebay for klic-8000 batteries. Bought like 3 on there for as little as 89cents.!
You also need to consider that Z712 uses their own custom LiIon batteries that look like AAs but are not. They give you a disposable set with the camera. If you need rechargeables for the Z712 it will set you back another $50 since you need to then buy batteries as well as the charger.
Yes. Once the lens arrives, you register in online with Canon. It is a high quality, reliable lens that most pros carry in their bag. Canon's service department is also helpful.
Yes, it will. Now this is a great lens known for its quality. Camera body is constantly being improved, as it progress, new advanced models come out to market. So if you own a good lens it will always get you the best photos. It is also a lens made for a FULL SIZE camera. So in the future if you decide to get a camera with a FULL SIZE sensor like EOS 5D mkIII, 6D, and/or even Canon's flagship model you will be able to enjoy your lens.
Yes it is compatible as I have a Canon 60D as my backup to my Mark 5D III and it works fine. You have to remember because of the crop factor on the 60D that it magnifies the image so at 16mm your really shooting at 25 to 26 mm. You can check out some of the latest pics I did for a home at vrbo.com/462266.
Actually the coupon you speak of, from B&H is not a coupon. The price they show is the price AFTER instant rebate! I suggest you visit the Canon website and it will explain how the rebate works. I hope Amazon gets them instock at the $350 again and I will be ordering it. I sold my original 580 and want the newer one for my 1D Mark 3. Esp here in Alaska, the weather sealing and that metal foot will be nice. Thanks Kevin P Alaskan Photo Tours and Workshops www.PhotoTourAlaska.com
this charger only charges Ni-MH and NiCad batteries, and does not have a discharge button.
Yes as long as your total amperage does not spike over 30 amps you should be just fine. I run 3 50 watt radios off of one power supply. As long as you don't transmit on high power on two at the same time you should be ok.
I did not like them at all so I just recently replaced them.
The speakers have a stereo mini jack similar to the ipod, walkman, andriod. But working with your woofer I don't know.
yes but I don't have it in stock, you can find it on Canon USA website
I bought this case but the burgandy color and my SD1100 fits perfectly inside of it. Others have complained that it wouldn't close for them, but I haven't had any problems. I love this case, it is sleek and perfect!
No. It will not. There is another case for the SD800 IS on Amazon that fits it perfectly. Model PSC 55. SD800 models are larger than SD1000.
I purchased this case for an Elf 230HS and 500HS, and it dose not fit any of my Cameras.
Not that I am aware of. I would contact Canon directly and ask. Or give Calumet a call.
It might be but I would suggest getting the YOngnuo battery pack that is compatible with your flash. If you have a canon flash and camera use only canon products.
And the picture is not depicting the same item sent. Mine was far wider on the base and did not cradle the ipod.
This would let use access the I pod and add and play music
I have a 525i 2001 and it fit perfectly, I don't know if the cd changer model is the same on your car.
BMW does not make changers. From 1996 to about 2002/3 in the 5's the chargers were made by alpine and it is direct fit for the factory unit. Keith De Cay

Yes - those devices have the standard headphone jack and these headphones will work fine with them.
Yes it does charge an iPhone 4s with no converter plugs. The iPhone 5 is the one that would require an adapter. I don't think it displays text about the song on the radio readout. If it does I just don't use that feature, but I think I tried to get it to work with that TEXT button and it didn't work.
nope
It has a setting called color night vision. In low light, the image is grainy. In total darkness, you will not get a picture. Hope this helps.
With my iPhone, I get streamed images flawlessly (no audio). The refresh rate will depend on your phone's network speed and what image resolution you set. I suspect the behavior on your particular device will depend on which browser your phone is using. There are a number of video reviews online, including some on youtube.
Get a real camera backpack from Lowepro or Tamrac. You don't want your equipment rattling around unprotected. Check out the Lowepro Slingshot 200 - it is a good choice and reasonably priced.
I got Olympus EVOLT 510 with two lens DSLR camera about two week ago. This camera pack with all the features for the pro. I really happy with Olympus camera after 300 pix test shoot and I love it more... Also. This camera was voted the best DSLR camera on WIRE magazine. You will not disapoint. No issue sofar.
It might. The older 250 models do not (although you can touch the car icon to get your present location in coordinates). The last production run of the 2x0 series made changes to the interface that makes them like the newer 2x5 series. Touching the car icon "should" give you the info you seek on these models (I'm not 100 percent certain because I do not own this model).
Hi! I tried an a couple of .avi files, and had the same issue with only getting the sound portion on one, and nothing on the other (they had been written by different programs.) Then I tried using the DivX converter on one and it ran fine (though to be honest, the picture was pretty bad!) I haven't bought the converter software, just a 15 day free trial of it, and plan to try the Xvid freeware first. Does anyone know where to get free divX downloads?
I would assume that if a recorded book on CD is in the standard CD-DA format like all commercial music CD's, then yes. Having never bought a book on CD, I would assume they are made to play in any audio CD player. And yes, this Coby player does play audio CD's.
Depends on the actual dimensions of the unit, not just the screen size. That being said, I haven't seen a 7" unit yet that didn't fit it....
A double din is a double height head unit opening. Looking at stereos there at two sizes of head units: single and double din. Most newer cars have double din stock head units but I'd do a search online for what your car needs. I don't know the exact dimensions but there are really only two sizes of head unit. So while the internal measurements are going to be the same kit to kit - each car has a different mounting setup, that's why there are so many different options.
Yes it does. You have to break the tabs off, leaving the ones you need for the vehicle. Used mine in an 2004 Silverado. Was much nicer than the Metra mount by far.
Yes
Two (2)
Yes, I received two adapters with Qty 1
It is, to a point. I plugged it in to several of our Macs (an iMac G3, a G4, and an Intel Macbook), and in each case the camera's internal memory showed up on my desktop, just as a USB flash drive would. The pictures can be transferred to the the computer by drag and drop, which is good enough for us. In no case, however, was I able to get iPhoto or Image capture to recognize the camera directly, and of coarse the included Windows-based software doesn't work.
The only downfall the kiddizoom has in my opinion is the battery consumption is high, youve got to put duracells or energizers in as stores own make, cheaper brands will give u upto an hour-2hrs MAX and my girls will litterally spend all weekend on them, but even the best double a's (4x Duracell aa batteries)will only last 4hours if ur lucky.
Yes, we can sell you the SmartNet contracts. Thank you. - Core 4 Solutions
Yes it fits.
I don't see any reason why you couldn't do this. How much the TV could swivel would be determined by the size of the TV and where you mounted the TV mount on the wall.
No, but I have my wireless headphones plugged in the AUX AUDIO OUT when I want to block out room noise OR trying to understand 'heavy' English accents (no discrimination implied or meant -- I talk 'Southern!') ... almost four years - no problems - still happy!
It all depends, If you have AT&T Uverse, then it will not. AT&T places a watermark on all it's recording that will not allow it to be copied, the normal VCR will believe that it's copyrighted and will not record it. I have used a video capture board to copy it off the wire. Comcast diesn't watermark the recording, so it shouldn't be a problem.
It has a strap on the back that will fit over the handle of another rolling bag. The top of this strap is 14 1/2 inches above the floor.
The sound quality of these rear speakers were really impressive - you will not be disappointed. I ended up buying a full set of front, rear, center Chanel and low profile sub because the sound quality and options with the Yamaha was really strong
These are great speakers for what ever design you have
no they are not, but they sound great!
I think it just means that the mouse moves once every 30 seconds instead of once every five seconds. I've been extremely happy with my purchase of this mouse jiggler.
All the jugglers died is keeps a pc from self locking when not in use. If I want to step away from the pc fir an extended period of time I will simply remove the device from the USB port and my pc will function normally .
Mate ,I am not 100% shore,it might b good idea 2 match the voltage,.research b4 u connect. have a good one.I do know that it makes so much easyer 2 adjust sub,and u will love it.
Yes, as long as your laptop has an HDMI port.
Yeah you can hook your game up.I have my Ps3 hook up but the only downside is that I had to use componet in stead of hdmi.Its sounds real good.
well actually no it doesn't include a software with the Mic. But for a mic to work along with your webcam, i think any Mic can do this. So yes this should work with your webcam. I am assuming that you want a mic to work for Skype or other telecommunication programs along with your camera and my answer is based on this assumption. I am using this mic on windows 7 with no problems.
I don't believe you can hook this to a PC without some kind of odd setup. I have had this system for my home theater system for probably a good 5 years now and I still love them and have no thought of replacing them. I just really would have no clue how you could hook them up to a PC. I don't think a PC would put out nearly enough power to run these, the subwoofer is quite large and would take a bit of power to operate.
Thanks for your question. We currently ship only within the continental USA. This is a fantastic sounding speaker system. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud JBL dealer.
The satellite speakers are about 6" tall. The sub is 16"H x 14"D x 12"W. The V-675 is a 7.2 system and this speaker system is 5.1, it will work but you won't have the additional speakers to make it work as a 7.2. There are good articles that you can find to describe the different home theater configs available.
It is a metallic sticker. You can also get a red sticker and stick over it.
Yes, mine is unscrewed and stored for the winter while my boat cover is on as well
I would think as long as you have a stereo that can accept it and a place to mount it, why not.
14
not near my frozen covered boat at the minute.. but what I recall the plastic antenna itself was like 12 inches ling
No OTA compatibility. Works only in conjunction with ka/ku DirecTV satellite dishes.
I have no idea. sorry.
I do not believe so, this was made for use with a computer. It has two plug ports, as such I do not believe it will work with a phone.
No headphone jack.
not good got very hot blew up 2 of them traded for a merantz and im pleased
I'm not sure but I think 705 upconverts sources to 1080P, while 606 only to 1080i... if that's the case I'd go with 705...
It absolutely does. ETS2 is why I bought this wheel and I love it! I think you will too. It is unbeatable for the price!
Take it out of "just scan" and put it in "16:9"
I own a Cowon D2 and it works fine with Rhapsody To Go. I believe you need to make sure that the USB Connection is set to MTP. You can access this through Settings, System.
They are extremely roomy. They are larger than they appear. My husband has three of them. A set for his TV room, bedroom and my office. The beauty of the headphone is that it will broadcast all over our house. If he goes to the bathroom or to the fridge, he can hear the audio. His hearing isn't good. The headphones are a lifesaver for me. Without them, he would run me out of the house due to the volume he needs to hear.
single end in base red and yellow back of set set switch to 3 on base and headset should work
The iPod Touch 2nd generation docks and works well with this system, but it does not charge while docked.
I'm not 100% sure, but I would think, you would have to speak with the individuals/company that would be developing your photos.
... and you are there... Looks like 8 GB available too.
Just pulled a grill and they look like socket/Allen head screws...use an Allen wrench to remove.
Preface: I am NOT an audiophile. However, I believe it's contingent upon the AVR. I believe mines goes to 70db and the speaker handles every bit although I try not to pish it that high.
The speakers connect to an audio receiver. There is no headphone connection to the speakers themselves.
Yes. There are two sets of wire connectors.
Answer here...back of speakers have conventional exterior spring loaded wire clips, slide speaker wires into slot and release tabs.
You only need a sub if you want one, but they sound much better with one. I would highighly recommend a sub.
Yes
My garmin was loaded with the maps of Europe. I do not know how it was done because I bought it used from Amazon. Sorry that I can not answer your question. I questioned the seller to make sure it had european maps because I needed it for my vacation. I use to get the same GPS with my car rental from kemwel.com and they would give me the same garmin with european maps for $40. I go to Europe 2 times a year so I figured it would be cheaper to buy a GPS.
it has a long, thin, flexible, wire-like antenna
No. Just electricity.
It sounds like your voice got changed.... understanding that you only changed time zones... but is there some way you got changed to a voice that doesn't support TTS (text to speech)? I'd check that setting first, selecting a voice that has (TTS) after the name in the listing.
Yeah did you get pulled over? If not, they didn't have radars on. I pass them all the time going well over the speed limit (sometimes even waiting on the side of the road!) and my detector doesn't go off bc they don't have their radars on.
With the way I have it set up in my car if you are outside the car looking into it you cannot see the blue flashing lights, there is plastic covering over the back of them so the blue only flashes on the inside of the car
I would suggest going to the Whistler website for full details but to answer the question in short, it has every band needed in the U.S. and does the job.
do not quite understand the question I had it installed on a ford fusion, and automatically within 5 seconds of turning on the computer was turned on and lit plants sound at shutdown 60 seconds on and off during this time hear static but that's normal
maybe audio cable connect to video port. check cable.
Yes. Two.
yes theres nothing wrong with mine
Check the frequency response of your mains. Set your sub to cutoff near their low end response.
This should wire into any receiver with speaker terminals. John from J & B Wholesale. We have 1 Sony SA-W2500 Grade "A" refurb. in stock.
yes, they leak sound but it depends on 1) how loud you like somethign when noise cancelling is on 2) how loud you can turn it up with surrouinding ambient noise They defintely leak sound though
No, our water is filtered which may have prevented that.
165
you're taking 640 pixels by 480 pixels and spreading them apart to fit a larger screen, that's why its pixelated. The same thing happens on huge HD tvs when you give it a 480 line picture (standard definition vs 720 or 1080 lines which would be HD)--it spreads the lines of scan across a large surface yielding you a poorer, less defined picture. The only way you can solve that is to film something with a camera of higher resolution. The Flip is what it is.
Yes, the arm comes with a pin to attach to a super clamp, however, it is best used for a flash and not a heavy camera. Perhaps a smallish mirrorless would be okay (I'd probably attach one of my fuji's, but not my Canon), but it's not the strongest arm out there.
If you are looking at the same one I ordered, which appears to be showing, it's the dark grey, the atlas grey.
Yes it's still an 8th gen civic
No, the Apple folks have made their cables incompatible with other manufacturers. You can find iPad compatible cables in Amazon but the quality is not 100% so you may have to jiggle it or unplug and replug the cord once in a while. I have a Sansa Fuze and iPad and iPhone and the cables for the Sansa are different from the Apple cables.
We have plenty of this item in stock. You can go ahead and place an order with our company.
Yes
This is a new charger and it DOES include the adapter cable/power plug. You just need to have the battery which needs charging.
I probably will not be much help here, yes they should be the same. 24 Volts in, 24 volts out. My Xantrex did not hold up however, and caught fire within 1 month. I now have a MidNite Solar Classic MPPT Charge Controller - 150V, and it is performing great.
No it is not equipped with a blocking diode. If you plan on using a charge controller with a home made wind turbine you will need a power rectifier or Bridge Rectifier. I have one but I don't have it listed on amazon yet. If you look on YouTube their are some videos that can help explain what a power rectifier is.
You can, but the light bulbs that are supplied are for photography and minimize glare.
Whats an iPad? Only kidding AC. It has one of those USB do dads on it. Does that count?
I don't know but if they do these little speakers Rock, well worth the coin
No they did not.
http://car-speaker-adapters.com/products.php?id=adapter_search_consumer Try this, no guarantees. Best of luck!
The tweeter rotates slightly for better imaging but it does not stay at the extreams as you drive it moves closer to center, like its being pulled to the center . OK speakers for the money
These polks are 180 Watts power with 4 ohm impedance.Your pioneer unit allows for 4 ohm speakers and its Power Output Peak is 50 watts x 4 channels. So from an ohm and watts standpoint your good.
A pair of very good sounding speakers.
I like the Polk myself I actually have kicker in my pickup and do lien them much at all
I'm not sure exactly how they would sound when powered with a 4 channel amp. My deck supposedly powers 804 channel. It sounds great and I can say the bass doesn't bog or sound overly boomy. It just gives out a nice clear sound.
Good question and I don't remember at this point. However, you can call Polk Audio directly and ask them. 866-764-1801
No, just the two speakers and grills. Speaker wire can be found at any auto parts store or Wal-Mart along with the connectors. Very simple install as far as that is concerned.
Mine came with a standard profile bracket. When I ordered, the Amazon vendor emailed me asking if I needed a low profile or standard profile bracket. I think some vendors include both brackets when they ship.
45 watts RMS @ 4ohm
I do not know.
There is a designated port that you plug in a device that you want to control the power. When that"controlling unit" draws power, the strip senses that and then turns on the power to the other outlet.
The focal ratio is f6. 1200mm/200mm is 6. Focal length/diameter of objective lens
Didn't work for me either
The back of the remote on the bottom near the keychain. You have to just use your nail to slide it down out of the remote.
Absolutely
Yes
the Samsung Go N310 already has 1 GB of 800 MHZ DDR2 RAM. From what I read, it only has 1 ram slot. It is upgradeable to a 2 GB stick, from what I have read in some reviews.
the major issue sony had with the 2500 series was the clouding issues, the 3000's are free of that mess. also it depends on how far away ur siting from the display...IMO get the 3000, at 40"s you wont be about to tell the difference between the High def resolutions. not till the 50" range will that matter...o and sorry...didnt do an A & B comparision. I"m still browsing myself HAPPY HUNTING
Some networks broadcast in 720P and others at 1080i. I doubt you will be able to tell the difference. I imagine this Sony coverts everything to 720P.
Yes, it will give the US weather service forecast for the closest location.
Hi, I had ordered 4 of these radios and had to return one for the same reason you describe. You may just have a bad one. All the others work perfectly and simply . . . Just turn it on. Be sure you are setting the ON switch to the middle position. It takes about 2 or 3 seconds till you hear the broadcast. Be sure the volume is adjusted high enough on the left side. If nothing works, return it.good luck!
It will alert you to any National Weather Service emergency; thunderstorms, hail, tornadoes, etc. If you have it on at other times it will simply give you the forecast for your region. Just be sure you have it set to alert if there is any bad weather headed your way.
shipping is processed per order. not per piece.
Battery. Lasts very long. Alerts come in well. Highly recommend.
Be advised, unit has only a standard definition tuner. It can't record high definition tv. It will play dvds in high definition, and will upscale everything to high definition. But upscaled standard def isn't high definition.
A little with ihe hd tv we got. BUt looked fine on analog tv.
yes.
I noticed no signal quality loss in the 100 foot cable that i am using, i have a total of 160 feet of cable running underground to the camera and its still a crystal clear picture.
Yes, a soft one with a strap.
permafocus
I have a DC power black and white security camera and I do not have a problem with these cables. The length is great and I hook it to an old analog tv with no problems.
No a PCI-e card like this one is not AGP compatible.Some cards have both graphic interface though.
From what I can tell for the 8500GT 256MB it is 300W. That is from the best buy site for a similar card.
Yes, there is a strap inside the bag
The handles are rolled leather-very nice. I bought this as a gift for my husband who travels extensively. He loves it and it slips easily over the handle of his carry on suitcase. It's completely stitched throughout, no gluing.
Appears to be perfect. I have zero complaints and a lot of praise!!
i dont know my exact model, but i have 5th generation 30gb ipod video, and it works great
5th generation, 80g memory
No extra tools needed. The replacement battery comes with a plastic separator tool to open the iPod Video.
In my x5 e53 there is an open socket on the back of the factory harness where it just plugs right in Did not remove any wires
It did not work for my 2002 330ci so I don't know.trail and error is your best bet
The bulbs are 75W GU10 base with two pins.
You actually wouldn't have to cut a hole. There are many different way you can position the box. I actually don't even Velcro it together so that the opening is wider and leaves me more room to position my prop.
The lights that come with this set are perfect. You will not need whiter lights

I am now on my second pair of these headphones. I take pretty good care of mine and they will last me YEARS (I'd have to estimate at least 5 yrs of use before I purchased a new pair) . For sure worth the money. I adore these headphones. Let me know if you have any other questions.
Yes, even when ur using the headphones u can still control the tv volume. This headphone allows you to have idependent volumes controls.
I used search for parts needed for model on internet..I have usually found what I needed.
Not that I know of. This apparently is a known issue with this device. You can google and read the experiences of others. For what it's worth, I unplugged mine, and let it sit for 6 months hoping it would have a "healing," but it did not. I ended up taking it to our hazardous waste facility...they accept old electronics, computers, etc. for recycling.
I think warranty is only 1 year. Call manufacturer and check on third party about warranty transfer.
Sorry i do not know. Go to Kingston web site and check your computer model number there. I think they have a little whiz program that runs quick and tells you what kind you have installed.
Yes, it will do that and more. One note of warning though. I used it on my sailboat and it did not survive its first dunking.
I don't think Garmin has topo maps to most countries. Even if they did, you'd only be able to load a relatively small area as you're limited to 24 mb. There may be workarounds to use non Garmin maps, but they are beyond me.
Yes, it does miles/hour. You can either get instantaneous mph (which varies +-.3 or .4 between readings) or a moving average mph.
I have the same question, and it has been difficult, no answer so far. I don't care that much about price if it gets me in and out of the deep swamp and marshes.
Pablo, I have used mine in Colombia, Argentina and Chile. The accuracy is as good as anywhere else in the world. The map detail deppends on the map itself. In Colombia you can get a map from www.micropartes.com it has good detail but also some errors. In Argentina and Chile the maps are very accurate but I don't know the sources of those maps.
It's not even worth buying.
Yes it does.
its a great deal in the price range and you should buy this product. i own this device, it will take you some time to familiarize yourself with different eyepieces and their focal lengths but you will enjoy it.
Yes the tripod comes with it. The height with telescope mounted is 48 inches.
I have the relay mounted at the top of the storage compartment at the center of my motorhome. The antenna drops straight down. The storage compartment has thick sheet aluminum doors and steel bulkheads forward and back. Range from outside the motorhome is over 30 feet in any direction. I am extremely pleased. The relay powers LED ribbon lights mounted on the outside of my motorhome. By rating, power draw from lights should be over 60W, and the circuit has a 5A fuse. So, relay does not draw much.
Just some screws and extra wires
has very good quality. the sound is clear. supports very high volumes. I recommend them. support 100 watts RMS and 4 ohms. Are of the type Midrange (Midwoofer)and generates SPL 96dB.
I've used Crucial and Kingston brands quite happily. You can search on their sites for which memory is suitable for which specific Mac / PC etc. to help you choose the correct chips.
I have a mid 2007 iMac with 2GB which I wanted to increase to 4GB. The two specific Crucial chips were installed three times with no success. Each time the computer made what appeared to be a weak attempt to start, but did nothing. Each time I re-installed the original chips and it worked fine. I can only conclude that the computer did not like/recognize/want the Crucial chips, so I returned them. It was surprising because other reviewers seemed to have no problem although a few had my experience. Sorry I can't be more help.
Sorry, I have no info on minecraft. My used iBooks have worked for enough time I got my jobs done. When they have a problem I look for another replacement. It is not elegant but I get by. W. E. Kirhofer
This power supply is NOT for the elite.
Yes. Any computer loaded with Microsoft Windows must contain Restore CD. If a seller doesn't provide that and its not an authentic disc, they are selling the system illegally and you should report them.
No idea. This remote was listed in the instructions for accessories for my unit. I would contact Pioneer. They have a website.
I don't recommend it. The only buttons that worked were the volume buttons and then after a short while it just didn't work with the system at all. That's just my experience with it, though. And way too big for a car remote, in my opinion.
The Bose Speaker Wire Adapter Kit is meant for use only with the Acoustimass and Lifestyle Systems. The 3.2.1GS Series II does not have compatible inputs for this adapter.
If you want a great camera that will run off of AA batteries look at the A720IS or one of the other A series cameras in Canon's lineup... the A720IS is almost functionally identical to the SD850IS but adds 2.2x more zoom lens and runs off of AA's. In the trade off it is slightly larger but not that much... If I were you i would go to office depot or somewhere else and see it in person to determine if the additional size will bother you, but it is hard to argue against the AA versatility.
Hi, I don't have advice- but have the same problem! I'm frustrated that I purchased this camera and now can probably not return it!!! Good luck!! let me know if you find any tricks to get better pictures.
Almost every time we use the camera, we have to put new batteries in it. It seems to be more of a hassle than the camera is worth, to me.
no it does not. the tuner in the unit is an analog tuner. i have a digital adapter from the cable company that converts the signal so i can record a cable channel. the only drawback is you can only record the channel the adapter is currently tuned into and for any further recording you have to manually change the tuner to another channel.
I bought it as a replacement for my Google TV since I lost the original cable in a move. I haven't been to thrilled about this cable I bought off Amazon. It's a hit or miss of when it works. When it's working it changes the channel just fine.
You should look for something with a little more power. This could power one no problem. 2 it wouldnt be able to be very loud.
I don't have any micro SDHC cards to try, and I don't know whether there could be any issues linked to card capacity, but looking at the item, it does have a slot marked micro SDHC. There was no printed material with technical specifications.
I use a vip211k receiver and it is easy to set up, works with all three sats.
Yes they will ,I have one in my mothers room
Similarly. It's pretty stable, and it hasn't made any difficulties.
yes i have had that problem with other grundig radios not this one but i would send it back
no, i dont think you can go back to ip at the dvr, one way conversion
No. The IP part of that is internet protocol. Without the electronics required to assign an IP address it cannot communicate like other network devices. All this does is is cat-5 cable.
I think it is. To be honest, it didn't work very well for me, so i'd consider looking at other options.
Only if it is marked as a 4/3rds, or Zuiko.
First you need to strip the cover enough to put it into the fuse fully. Take the exposed wire and hold it in place and screw it down. That's all it takes
i think that 3rd party firmware @ pioneerfaq increases character number
You've probably already gotten an answer to your question, but to help future buyers, the answer is yes! I have output going to my monitor via hdmi to dvi cable, and digital coaxial audio out. Also, in the setup options, you can specify video only from the hdmi port.
just one
As I have responded before this is an inferior piece of equipment in everyway possible. What you describe shows that. If you have time left I encourage you to return it. Amazon should have discontinued this long ago. A major disappointment to those ordering it. Originally touted by Amazon as a 1200$ fine lab instrument. So what about it AMAZON why are you still pushing this poorly designed piece of junk?
The Power adapter says: Output is DC 12.OV at 3.3A max v=volts, A=Amperage
no I did not use any jumpers .I just took it the hard drive out of the box then I took the screws off of the old one and put them one the new one and used the sata cord that was already in the computer and hooked it all up and it worked . I would check the Bios to see if it will detect the drive.
I would boot to a WD CD on the XPS8700 and format it there
Assuming you are asking if the Belkin ultra-mini port is compatible with OS X, the answer is yet. It works great and I've never had any problems with it on my iMac running OS 10.6.
The hub is a square shape approximately 2" by 2" and 1/4" high. The USB cord is around 6 inches long.
The Siruis tuners match the head unit not the vehicle. JVC models typically use the SIR-JVC1 tuner
China... =/
Brings you close enough to see details of birds and animals. Good viewing for the price and compact too.
If the radio has NOAA capability, it will do fine. The NOAA channels put out enough power to overcome the poor antenna match. I installed several of the original NOAA systems in Idaho, and you could receive them with minimal antenna.
Yes it dose and well.
The original was I believe the first version and the recent one is a I1
Crutchfield says it's v1.2a
With any large Flat tv on a stand, you should take the precaution to attach it to the wall in some way so it doesn't fall over due to collision, accident, etc. Come on, your spending 1500 + on a expensive TV, and you won't be careful and attach a simple safety line to your wall? It should be standard procedure with any stand mounted set. Just take a tie-line, attack to your set, and attach to a simple screw in the wall. Accidently hit it, bump it, fall against it, your set won't go crashing down.
not sure but do not think so. This is not a very good tv. motion problems. Get a SAMSUNG
Yes it is a replacement for it (direct fit)
I looked up the compatibility list and is says yes. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA01M07Y6746
Not directly. The unit comes with a power brick that has a 110v plug
It runs all the time after you turn it on. I have mine plugged into the amp, so when the amp is turned on so is the fan.
its 12V 2A DC, the transformer I have will accept 100-240V and .5A/60Hz
Check for updated drivers for the USB... might have to call Belkin for updated software/drivers ... I know... I know... it's usb... should have the drivers installed right / backward compatible?? Might want to try to update the hub as well... When I bought mine years ago.. it had already been outdated by the standards of that day. I now use a wireless router with the USB ports built in... So MUCH BETTER! ... and you can network the item.. instead of waiting on the item to wake up from sleep mode....
I know! I'll be very very angry at Belkin if they don't release them.
Sanyo Xacti VPC line is fantastic. I've had them underwater (pool and lake shots) and the video came out great. Lightweight and small too.
Yeah hey need to fix that haha. Though 30fpm would still be an improvement of my old aiptek. I was wondering the same thing about quality until I found this grea review on a blog. It's shows the quality in and out of water. http://www.freevlog.org/index.php/2007/07/10/testing-testing-sanyo-xacti-waterproof-e1-review/ Just got one last night;) hope this helps.
It's ranges from 2006-2007
I think it will work, I also had an external drive go bad. I took it apart and this worked, like a champ.
Four ports are 10/100 only (no poe) and would act like a normal switch. The other four ports are poe which will power cameras, wireless AP, ect. Normal hookup would be to plug a camera into poe port, then plug router into the non-poe port (10/100). You can also use the other non-poe ports for other devices that do not require power over ethernet.
Hi Matt, The mount arms are of unequal lengths. The pivot-pivot length of the wall arm is ~9.5 inches and the TV arm is ~7.5 inches. Hope this helps.
I wouldn't suggest it. I suppose you could with some rigging. But you'd have some serious sagging Issues
This model is now discontinued as the new Samsung plasmas are going to be taking its place. Look for the new models to hit the stores in the next month or so. I dont know what the price Amazon was selling this 5084 for but I know that Circuit City has it on sale right now for $1899, so you might wanna check that out.
No. Just a hdd that is all
Just recieved ours a week ago and it has a matte screen. I totally forgot that it never asked for my preference when I was ordering! So I think you are right, Amazon doesn't offer the glossy. I personally like the matte better, less annoying reflection, though I've heard the glossy screens have better color, personal preference.
Apple will probably announce a new MacBook Pro at Macword in mid-January, but the new model will probably not be any cheaper. I also doubt that prices on the current model will drop much once it goes on closeout.
No clue but the base MacBook Pro model isn't being sold by Amazon.com anymore, its being sold by another store through Amazon. So not rebate on this model right now. I'm so mad! I left for work at 4 and it had the rebate, I come home and nothing!

Hi I just received the computer (2gig). I bought MAC compatible 2x2gig memory from newegg.com for about $96 (incl. shipping). Opening the back panel was pretty easy (you do need #00 philips driver). It took literally less than 5 minutes to do it.
i ordered it on the 7th 1 day shipping. It initially said it is shipping out on 8th and should be delivered on 9th. But on 9th morning they said it will ship in a week. I cancelled and ran to my local apple store. Fortunately they had it in stock, so was able to pick it up. Its awesome. Hopefully, you got yours by now..
Any display with DVI ports works with this model. it has two DVI ports on the back. You can also use a DVI to HDMI or DVI to VGA adapter to connect to a display with HDMI or VGA inputs. These adapters are for sell here in Amazon too.
Hi yes its a kit of 2gbx 2 that makes 4gb total Compuland 424-262-6187
No idea. Don't buy them! They broke within a month of me owning them.
You'd have to buy a new one
Yes. That's the only way to charge the battery, usb plugged into your computer.
DVI is 24 pin. Hdmi is 18 pin, hope this helps, I've used it on multiple monitors and works great.
this is a good cable
No it does not have virtual surround sound and it does not have HDMI or USB. It is more of a whole home audio receiver with 2 zones that are independent of each other. I connect my USB devices through a 3.5mm to RCA audio cable.
You can't
I googled the V220 and Office Depot sold it when it was still available new and they listed it as being compatible with Mac OS 10.3.9 but I can't verify that.
Yes
Yes, should be fine. I put in an old dell desktop.
Yes. I did.
The bracket that mount to studs/wall has multiple slots that span the entire width of bracket. It should work.
Yes and you can control the input level.That will be necessary because the mic is tiny and doesn't pick up well.It comes with a jack with red,white,and yellow RCA plugs. This is my second one (I lost the first) and it is an excellent product.
No. Will not work with hdmi, because the bandwith of hdmi is low. Even to work with DVI it need a dual-link dvi cable. If you have a displayport on your computer (or laptop) buy the displayport version. Displayport has a wider bandwith than dvi or hdmi.
I've put in as many as about 60. The paper is heavy weight. Each refill (10 pages) comes with 1/2 inch expanders for the posts.
Black, platinum and red albums have black pages The other colors have soft white pages
Dear Valued Customer, I have sent you question to our excellent product information department. They will be contacting you very soon. Thank you, Karen S
Hi Belinda, The Kolo Newport album comes with ten pages. We do not have the refills in stock, but you can buy from Kolo.com and the pages include expander posts. Thanks for checking out our products and let us know if you have any further questions. Kate
Yes, I would go to your local craft store and get photo corners. There are different types and colors. Have fun!
They come in old of ten I think
portrait format
I would not recommend it. If you had some way to anchor it to the floor, that would be better.
Apple does not make the 160 GB Apple TV. The only Apple TV Apple makes is Apple TV MD199LL/A [NEWEST VERSION].
It is possible to use to upload software with "patchstick" flash drives, especially Boxee and XBMC. I believe it is possible attach other storage devices after uploading special software... But these are unofficial hacks from hobbyists on the internet. As far as Apple is concerned, it is only to be used by Apple certified techs for repairs.
Also having problems: from the USB (as the dvd drive no longer recognizes discs, "Insert Disc" always pops up) tried .avi, .mp4, .wmv, .mov and none are recognized. will try other conversions.
The picture is often used to depict a Hard Drive. The drive I received was in a normal case and it is working fine. NOTE: do not attempt to open the drive to see the inards - that would void your warrenty and could make the drive unusable.
Large Block Allocation
It just accepts the signal. The actual resolution output is only 1366x768.
No, sorry. Webcams usually do not have speakers because virtually 100% of laptops already have speakers. Webcams have microphones, which is what picks up your voice, but not speakers. Frankly, if a laptop is so old/cheap/etc. that it doesn't even have speakers, I would be skeptical if it has enough oomph to use a webcam at all. Assuming this laptop has a headphone jack, your friend could just plug in some cheap earbuds or headphones to hear the sound.
You can't use both so just install one at a time and choose whichever seems better to you. HTH
No. 3 cables from camera 2 going to transmmiter 1 to the battery .
It should work even if you are using a separate microphone. You just need select source of input from webcam to the external microphone. I hope this helps.
It comes with a cover. Be careful though. I ordered three of these and two of them were a slightly different color. Had a blue/gray tint. Amazon shipped me around 6 replacements before I got the correct color, which matched the image posted on the site. Speakers sound good for what you pay. Had I gotten the right colors initially I would highly recommend them. But they apparently have versions from several years which don't always match when ordering multiples.
Yes, but you'll need the pages. At least it did last spring when I ordered mine.
No. This is not a monitor, it is a replacement part to fix a monitor. It comes with no power, no inverter, and only connects to a special ribbon cable.
It is perfect for Moto X, the led light let's you know if it is properly connected, also makes it easy to find the mini USB cord I darkness.
350W, still pretty low for this computer. Will be replacing soon.
Runs pretty silent, even under load. I haven't noticed it going above 45 degrees C with speed fan running.
You have a component video to VGA cable. The TV connectors are composite video connections. Different interface standard. Component video is and better, but if your tv doesn't have blue green and white connections, don't use that adaptor in the composite video interface.
it has to be in the dock. how else could it record onto the harddrive
I think the price went up because Sony was having a promotion that if you bought the TV together with a home theater system, the home theater system was essentially free. Now that the promo is over, I suspect the TV price will drop.
one
You need to use a power adapter. Several of the ports no longer function (side note).
If you have an aux port in your car then yes.
Yes, but be careful to start with the volume turned down and adjust it only to the necessary level if you are using the earphone output of the boombox.
As long as your boombox has an auxiliary input then yes. The plug is "headphone sized" so anything headphones plug in to, so will these. I connect my phone or iPod into my computer speakers all the time.
If you are talking about a router and the router has a screw on antenna i would say yes it will work
I don't think you can connect the antenna to this modem, because this type of modem does not have the antena you can replace. For what I know the antenna is inside your modem.
I have no idea what product you are referring to so therefore I can not answer your question
They run large.
no ...is only for connection of the computer to the component in the tv
Ues
No.
Hi Linda! It would depend on a few factors such as the sizes and resolutions of the images. The smaller the photos, the more photos that can be stored! I would think you should be able to put several hundred if you want a guess. :)
If you are using a memory stick, plug it into a computer and make sure the pics transferred. Otherwise, I would return it to amazon as defective and get another one. I assume the power is on to the unit. There is a switch on the unit for power on/off.
The tapes I have are plastic
As long as your computer accepts toslink interface and you have speakers hooked into your computer it should work! Toslink optical connections are audio signals only however, it has nothing to do with video signals!
Make sure that the lens is clean, look at it against the light, also make sure that nothing is blocking your flash, other than that I cannot see any issues with the beamer, first take a picture without the beamer lens and see if you still get lines, and take another without the beamer, just the flash.
Miguel, I use the Better Beamer on a canon 600. The better Beamer will fit any flash of close to the same flash head size and shape. I have never seen the flash you are asking about but I would be surprised if the flash extender would not fit. After looking more closely at your flash you should try to get the flash extender which is designed to fit a flash with the sharper corners of the neewer 520.
I would suggest you contact the company that makes the Better Beamer and ask them directly.
Thanks for the tips. I ordered the VRDMC5 then went to ebay and searched for the DVS. Found five for sale-only three were new. I purchased on wiht Buy it Now option for $34.95. Am anxious to try both in combination.
I was told it did but I have two different versions of this recorder and, if it does, I cannot figure out how to do it.
no you can't. But once it dials you it resets itself and the alarm discontinues after a couple of minutes.
There is only one mic input to the transmitter and one line output from the receiver. You can switch between two frequencies in case one has interference.
It will be in Mono, but if you can change the camera's audio settings you can have it record in Dual Mono (same feed on both R and L channels). I think that's what you mean by stereo since not many microphones can record true stereo.
Doesn't look like a question to me....Sorry
The mast has an interlocking end. No bracket is necessary.
Yes you can, however the channel master company and antenna web site both recommend 25-30 ft off the ground, using guy wires at every 10 ft . Luckily you will not need to ground the mast, due to its earth grounding
Kathi, 154212800 unfortunately is not a current Somfy part number so we are unable to reference it. However, If your Somfy motor is controlled by RTS, and you only need to control one motor or one group of motors, this remote is correct.
Yes, Decoflex can be customized for two channels
Not sure about that. Just log on to a desktop memory website and allow automatic memory diagnosis.
I do not know. Please go to Apple website and look for specs.
I don't know, I wanted it for a lable maker, which it was underpowered.
I noticed my plug to the pedal was to long but it works. So not sure what your question is.
In the Sony showroom at the Metreon (SF) the XBR5 had an RS-232 input (for a controller?) and the XBR4 did not. Otherwise they looked identical.
Yes
12.7 Volts using 6 Cameras (121 Volts from house outlet)
My Sirius radio is mod# sir-strpnpl and fits docking bay SM-4000, don't know if it will fit a SR docking station but my radio looks like this, don't know what a sr looks like.
No. Front firing woofer and tweeter. And side passive radiator
9.7 inches x 6.9 inches x 10.7 inches
Jo audio they have a pre-fit box that fits under the seat
Idk I'm not sure but I love this speaker hits really nice
Yep, it's really 2ohm. 4ohm wired parallel whether it's 2 subs or 1 DVC sub will present a 2ohm load. So, what you're saying is your amp works well on a 2ohm load, and this sub will present that same load to your Amp.
The setup guide suggests routing the front channels through the subwoofer, then running the subwoofer back into the front channels of your tuner. The setup works extremely well for giving deep bass. Also, the subwoofer has an independent volume control, so if you want you can crank it up and rumble your living room quite nicely.
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE VOLUME BUTTON THAT'S ON THE TOP RIGHT-SIDE IS TURNED ON....It's a volume knob!!!!! About an inch and a quarter in diameter. THere's a slight indent on it....turn music on...and then rotate dial both ways until it starts booming. I hope that is your problem. I think it got me when I bought these used...I didn't know about it until I ordered a new amp panel from Definitive Technologies....$95. But when I went to replace the amp panel...that's when I realized this circle WAS A VOLUME KNOB! UGGGGG!
Yes
It's a little less than a foot long and about as 10 inches around
the light seems to go on when you put the radio on, or when you change stations. It stays on for a short time, maybe 30 seconds. I use it during the night - and don't notice that it disturbs my husband - and doesn't stay on so it doesn't disturb me. I hope that answers your question.
101/4 inches by 5 inches and three inches thick
All I can say is it fit my 680 fine. If your 660 is the same mechanically to a Nivi 680 this should work great for you.
Yes I believe it will. I put it in a 2012 silverado1/2 ton. It just fits under your passenger seat.
Yes. I've had 2 of these. and got another for my friend. Be aware that they do not last more than a year. They work very well, until they just stop working one day.
This camera connects to a power source and to a BNC connector for video only. If you have a DVR compatible with Pulse then you may connect this camera to the DVR. This camera does not have any digital connector for online broadcasting. It maybe connected directly to a tv monitor or a DVR.
I think so. The housing is metal and very strong. The infrared works well in the dark. You'll need a monitor that accepts a BNC connector. Cables are widely available on Amazon (for example: http://www.amazon.com/VideoSecu-Video-Power-Security-Cameras/dp/B000P910OG/ref=pd_sim_e_4).
No it doesn't. Video only. Decent quality though
This type of camera would require some form of a dvr to accept the signal. I would suggest you look into a wifi camera that has its own software where you could view from anywhere. You of course would need wifi at your mothers house though.
ebay. search for logitech usb receiver. here's a link. http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p2050601.m570.l1313.TR0.TRC0.H0.Xvx+nano+replacement+usb+receiver+&_nkw=vx+nano+replacement+usb+receiver+&_sacat=0&_from=R40
Honestly they're totally fine. I've used it about a dozen times since I got it in May and even with the unfolding and refolding, we never notice it once the movie is playing. Its a really amazing product. The only bad thing is that my husband broke the zipper on the bag the first time we used it but it has two, so its not a big deal. I highly recommend buying it though!
Yes, it has an adapter for the 58mm threading.
I just turned my blu ray player from 60Hz to 24Hz and the motion is more smooth in 3d surprisingly. Without this setting the motion was very blur and uneasy on eyes. My TV is 120Hz, it is LG 47LW5300 and the blu ray player is LG BD645. Thanks Jaeckel, I was thinking of returning the tv and player untill I set this option.
The xbr5 only has 10 bit the a3000 is better with 12 bit both have deep color.
Yes, it does. I recently upgraded my phone. So far, it works on iPhones, and Samsung Galaxy S3-S5. Though the Galaxy S5 is a bit heavier, I have to be a little gentle with this.
Hi, Chris. This cable is compatible with the iPod 5.
Yes. As long as your Android device or other digital media player has a 3.5mm mini-stereo jack.
Comes with a cable that has RCA jacks on each end.
Yes it will...just be aware that you cannot use both the subwoofer in the soundbar and the Yamaha subwoofer simultaneously.
Can't say that I have, I have mine hooked to a yamaha sound bar as well. I would suggest checking your cabling, something may not be making a good connection.
It works in my Canon 60D! So it SHOULD work in yours! (BTW, VERY NICE! I want that camera for it's full time auto focus!)
Sorry, I haven't used it much with Skype. I tried it a few times when I first got it about 3 years ago. If memory serves me, it worked ok without any other equipment. I use this primarily in my math class. The only software required comes with the set. I have never used it with any mac equipment. I have just used it with a PC and connected it to a projector. Good luck.
Yes. I have used it with Windows XP, 7 and Mac OS X with no issues.
Yes, the unit has a AC power adapter since it is not a USB-powered device. We'll have to verify the amperage of each USB port.
Works fine with my Mac
The USB to Ethernet device comes with a mini (225mb) cd with drivers on it. The device works great on my Windows XP machine.
This camera does not have a burner. It uses SD cards, to record AVCHD video, to the flash card. Which can then be streamed to a TV, if the TV has an SD slot. Or you'd have to attach to your Mac/PC, to import, capture, edit and record onto a DVD, using whatever DVD authoring software you have included with or doesnload separately, to your computer. Though, this camera can connect, with wires to inputs of a TV, whether HDMI or video.
No
I have Bowers & Wilkins and they are incredible. Take a look http://www.bowers-wilkins.com/
No, the bracket is designed to attach to a ceiling joist. As long as your projector fits the bracket, you're good to go as long as your projector doesn't exceed the weight limit of the bracket. I love the bracket. It's the best one I have ever used. I'm in the home theater business.
It requires 15v DC - doesn't matter if you use 220 to 15 or 110 to 15 adapter.
Yes, it will work on any device with an Ethernet port. It works flawlessly on my Xbox and and pc.
I'm not sure if you can put it on a keychain or not. It doesn't come with a lanyard neck strap, but there is a place to run a string and use your own, but its recessed inside the end of the flash drive. I don't think you could get any kind of keychain ring in there. Unless maybe one of those flexible metal chains might work if its thin enough, but I don't know.
Depends on how big your laptop is. I have a 17inch acer and it fits snugly.
yes, will handle LED also
It does not zoom in movie mode.
I just bought this for my magellan roadmate 1212 and it is working great for me.
Mine did it's works when plugged in
I did same thing last night. I did receive a refund of $45 this morning. One thing is make sure your order number is referenced. I was going to return, but for $135 and 10 movies...I think still a great deal. I will sell a few of movies and then rent from Netflix.
Holiday returns extend to Jan 30.
Nick, I ordered from Amazon and received a cheap cobra in the valentine v1 box. I would recommend you call up valentine and ask for a return unit it's 360 and it is covered by the manufacturer warranty.
If it is against the law to have one in that state they just might have a device to catch you with and if its not against the law like in my state I don,t care if they do know I have it.
LIDAR detection is excellent, plus the device identifies whether the laser gun is ahead of you or behind you. Tip: keep at least one car ahead of you in city driving. The V1 will report LIDAR used against the car(s) ahead of you so you can react. I was the lead car from a traffic light and got caught by LIDAR, and there was no escape from that one.
Hi Summer, I don't owned a Dell Optiplex 745, so I don't know what kind of hard drive is being used. If it is IDE type then the caviar blue 1600aajb should work. If it is a SATA hard drive, the caviar blue is not compatible.
I strongly expect not. This is a full size (3 1/2") disk drive made for desktops.
very shallow
If you bought the tv with amex/mastercard premium, you already have a 1 year extended warranty already. Most of the things that break down is within the first 30 days or first year, maybe onto the second year. Trust me, 500 dollars is not worth it.
The price has gone back up significantly. Just before xmas it was about $1899, and as soon as the shipping deadline passed for xmas it dropped to $1595 and stayed that way most of January. Now I see it selling for $1,999.99 When the price was $1595 the TV was being sold by Amazon, now it appears that the TV is being sold by Cruthfield which is why there is a drastic increase in price. If you really want this TV, I would wait until Amazon starts selling it again.
Yes is it????
I just checked and this item doesnt have the holes needed in order to mount it.
It has a built in analog tuner. Hope this helps. Take care, Joel
The Sigma Lens has to have the correct fitting for your Panasonic. Only the seller can tell you the answer
Go to the Sigma Corporate website and scroll to the bottom to find Lens Hood http://www.sigmaphoto.com/shop/lens-hoods then you can find and purchase the right one for your lens.
Yes it came with the drivers for the hardware.
Depends. The ones I had were Dell/EMC pulls, but I am sure these were used on HP's too.
My experience: If you hit it with plenty of light the wrinkles won't show. You want a high key, completely white background anyway. So expose high enough or you might have some extra work in Photoshop.
It is a 30" square, translucent from all sides which means it can be illuminated from all sides including the bottom it is set on a glass table. It comes with 3 drop cloths (red, blue, black) that have velcro and can be attached to the inside to add color to the subject. Quite versatile to shoot product shots among other photo uses
They need to be plugged in for use. Their power supply is in the body of the strobe so the power wire extends from the unit to the wall or power strip.
Hello and thank you for your inquiry. As long as your camera has a hot shoe or x-sync terminal, this kit will work. Please let us know if you have further questions. Thank you and have a great day!
I believe it does. I bougt the pink version from Bestbuy and it came with a remote.
Ours didn't come with a mount.
These are simply larger space blocks on the strip made to accomodate the bulky transformers. The transformers can also be plugged into surge strips that do not have the special spaces but often the transformer will also cover up the next nearby receptacle outlet. Most manufacturers now design the surge strips with oversized spaces for these so that there will be plenty of room to plug them in and still be able to use all the remaining outlets.
I use it for my cell phone when riding my bicycle in case it rains here in Florida.
Intel 965GM x86/MMX/SSE2
This isn't a light stand. It is a frame to hang fabric backdrops. They have wing nuts on the top. There is nothing to attach a camera to.
Sorry. I'm not familiar with any differences in the color of the cables. However, I purchased this a while ago. Since then, I've reviewed a few tech articles indicating the expensive cables are no better than the ones you can purchase for a few dollars.
It came in the Monster packaging when I ordered as if I just picked one up from a store.
Hart to say. The m65 uses a laser sensor. Try to low DPI and set MS to 500 or 1000. This mousepad is all black. You can't offer better surface in therms off clarity to a sensor.
I can't really say for months since it's been only several weeks for me. It works fine now at least. I understand your concerns. I actually set my mouse at even lower sensitivity after having this one. I play world of tanks, a relatively slow shooting involved game but also fps like titanfall. Hardly see any problem for now.
Speaking from experience, this item should of came delivered in clear plastic packaging with the monster logo on it.
this cable is UL rated for in wall use
Thanks for your question. We have provided the only available pics of this wonderful cable. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Monster Cable dealer.
Thanks for your question. This is a self-contained, one-point-stereo speaker, so yes, four wires, two for left-channel and two for right-channel go to this speaker. Thanks again.
Speaking from experience, this item should of came delivered in clear plastic packaging with the monster logo on it.
Dear Gerald, Thank you for your inquiry. Monster's design is done in the U.S. The manufacture and packaging is primarily done in Mexico. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo
Mine is pretty secure inside both covers. I definitely noticed issue 1 though. I was tearing out my hair wondering what was wrong with the mouse and why it wouldn't switch profiles. :o
Yes it will
Just had the same issue. I tried using you it with my ATV and the tv would say no signal when hooked up to both devices.
Very well! Shouldn't really have any issues at all.
The plates aren't based on the tripod. You have to buy a head separately. That should come with a couple of plates. This tripod isn't intended to be connected to the camera directly. Any Manfrotto ball head would work perfect and they sell these legs with different heads as a combo package.
If the head has a 3/8" female thread you can.
This tripod head works for me. Manfrotto MVH500AH Fluid Video Head with Flat Base
Buy the TV then watch the price. I was given about a $200 refund 28 days after I bought my set from Amazon. They are easy to deal with and fast to refund the difference within 30 days.
Not directly, that I'm aware of. I use the Harmony Smart Control, which has a remote, phone app and a wifi hub to send signals to various components. I highly recommend that.
Yes it does you have to remove the back plastic piece
Yes. I have a 310XT as well and I have one parked in my desktop and one for travel.
Try the Q&A section on Trainer Roads website- they have info and links
You could switch out the speaker if you were really willing to compromise the structure of the box. The box may not be sealed very well if you take them out i would recommend resealing the box up if you switch the subs out. I would get it done professionally. If there are any new holes for air to escape you will lose bass and maybe get a vibrating noise.
These are for a vehicle u might be able to rig something up but these are quite large I used to have a set
Yes. I don't have it on my right now (it was a present for my uncle), but I think the remote had a small calculator type disk battery that could be easil changed.
It's not out yet. The release date is unknown. Do a little research on Google for more information.
My first one did this right out of the box. Sent it back and now my second one does it when I "lock" and then "unlock" the player. Needless to say, I'm not impressed.
It works fine when plugged into anything. What is your issue?
It's not out yet. The release date is unknown. Do a little research on Google for more information.
can't say for sure, as I don't have a W8 system to try it out on....but my guess is yes....its a very basic device and is worth a try at its very inexpensive pricetag.
yes, battery must be in and have at least a charge enough to power on in order to do anything with the camera (including upload pictures to your computer.) I bought an extra off brand battery works great, and its nice to have two.
I have taken it swimming, and took photos under water - not for a long time and probably only two feet below the surface. If we could have held our breath longer and stopped laughing - the photos would have turned out better. It captured bubbles, expressions, and images in a deep, dark pond. And, it still works. Also us it a lot to take pictures when skiing. We always pack a second battery, just in case.
It is the newest, least expensive and I think the most attractive of the rugged series (720, 770 and 790). I think the 720 screen could be viewed better in direct sunlight, the 770 you can have in deeper water (waterproof 33 ft vs. 790's 10 feet). But of the three, the 790 is the one I'm buying- it looks the best and fulfills my need of being a camera I can take to the pool and on vacation and can even drop (having previously broken a Kodak and a Canon camera due to my clumsy nature) without ruining.
That would be a question best suited to the individual seller. When I bought mine brand new, I believe I still had to buy the XD card separately.
the macro setting isnt exactly the best, most of the time it turns out blurry - works best about 6 inches away, but the super macro mode seems to work better - for as close as about 2-3 inches. I know this probably isn't the most helpful response, but ive only had the camera for about a few days, this is just what ive noticed.
I use the Battery Charger that comes with the camera
yes it 8 gigs and yes you install the software on it to. you have to restart your computer and load the disc that way like your doing a factory install.
no this is one that plugs into the wall with a cord.
I believe this battery will work with your F72 EXR camera. However for clarification it would be prudent to visit www.fujifilmglobal.com website and under support you can locate the manual for the camera. It will probably be listed as F70/75.
Yes
AFAIK there is not significant background noise. People listen to me loud and clear
It's not a built-in feature, but some people have been able to install the standard uTorrent on the server, and there is now a uTorrent add-in for WHS available.
I use it with OS 10.9.2. The problem is that it is not recognized and I could not set it up. I pulled my old g3 lap top out and set up went fine. Apart from that it asks that it's firmware be updated. Even my engineer son in law could not get it to do that.l
It's a ProDuo, which is the kind that is compatible with that particular camera. I don't have that exact model, but I do have a Sony in that line, and it's compatible with mine, and I've seen that model listed as being able to use this memory stick, also.
It depends on the size of your pictures or videos per the quality you select. This was purchased for a Trail cam that takes up to a 8gb card and it took about 250 pics and still had about 80% left space with hi resolution HD pics.
I don't see any reason why it wouldn't, it will work with my Nikon.
I've connected to my 1 year old macbook pro for the past year and it works great. I believe it has usb 3.0. This should work with all macs with USB.
Yes
Hello, I apologize but we do not carry and adapter of that sort, if it even exists. I wish we could be of more assistance. Thanks, and please let us know if we can help you with anything else. Have a fantastic day! Lance
this is for heavy speakers, not an I pod,it would take adapters
I guess that's just the drawback of the camera. If you don't have a possibility to download the video from the Flip Cam, you can't record anything new.
i was wondering the same thing, has anyone tried it?

At first I did have that issue - it takes a bit of getting used to. I find that if I press the red button with my left index finger, I manage to hit it at the correct angle. Right hand doesn't work so well. I'm right handed btw
I recommend using Nero Vision, as part of the Nero Ultimate Suite. It will recode and burn a wide variety of video files (*.avi, *.wmv, *.mp4). You just drag and drop, select menu template, and burn away. Yes, some camera may allow a direct to burn function, but Nero Vision will do it anyway.
Yes. You can do pretty much anything with them: put them on Amazon, on myspace, anywhere you can upload videos; you can save them to a dvd, you can watch them on tv, etc.
I had that problem once -- but it happened when my batteries were almost dead and the camera shut off on its own, and then began to overheat. I took out the batteries and haven't had that problem again.

A flash drive is a memory device, as is the SD card in the Canon camera. You'll need to upload the photos to an intermediate device, such as a desktop or laptop computer. From there you can save the pictures to a flash drive.
I agree that the pictures could use more color and now that i turned my camera on (had to double check) I see what your talking about. It does look grainy on the LCD prior to taking the picture Hmmmmmmmmm I never noticed that before..... Here's a link to check out some of the photos taken with the SD950 IS http://flickr.com/groups/ixus960is/ Some of these are very colorful. I probably need to learn how to set my camera correctly :)
I just came back from a road trip with this camera. I was taking 50+ shots per day and typically could use one set of batteries for each day. If you go out and buy a cheap 15 minute Energizer AA battery car charger, it will come with 4 rechargeables. There's two sets for you, and it's all you will need for this camera.
That guy at Best Buy is clueless. Wide Angle has nothing to do with the size of the print OR the aspect ratio. I do a lot of landscape photography an a wide angle makes all the difference in the world. I can often times get an entire mountain in the shot whereas, I can only get a part of it with a non-wide angle lens.
No...there is a headphone style jack for audio in...but I see no connections for other speakers.
No, you can let it play as long as you want, the charger will automatically stop charging the battery when it is at full capacity.
Xbox requires a 1000 watt transformer.
I suggest checking your drill wattage requirement. this is a 300 watts transformer, anything more might not work.
Thanks very much for your inquiry. This item is only available for shipping. It is not available for pick up. They are wonderful sounding speakers. Thanks again!
31x19x11 1\2"
For my setup they are placed about 16" away from the back wall to get them as far out from the front of TV as I could. My placement is 36" from sidewalls and 36" from sides of TV which helped minimize the sound reflections off the TV and walls. They sound good closer but sometimes it's . location location location that makes a very noticeable improvement... the placement will need to be tailored to your specific room.
I am driving mine with an ADCOM power amp @ 150W - 8 ohm - per channel - without distortion. These puppies clear AND loud.
The speaker is rated at 125 watts. I use then for rear speakers. This are fantastic speakers.
Hello , all polk speakers are manufactured in China except for the LSIM series and those are only assembled in the USA
Although I haven't tried it, the surface looks like it should accept paint just fine. Maybe try an inconspicuous area of the speaker first as a test.
Nope. These connect with speaker wire, so you'll need some sort of receiver to connect them to. They have good lows, so a sub isn't strictly necessary--especially for music--but for movies, you'll probably want a decent sub and surrounds too.
Just checked Magellans site and they mention there is no Mac support. Pity, cause the models have much to offer for the money.
Yes, I believe this leather laptop backpack will accommodate your HP 15.6" laptop comfortably.
This bag boes not have wheels.
I'm interested to know how to do it too. There is a search mode button (labeled in white - so it is from source) - but it does not work when the "high-end" receiver in a TUNER mode. Not to mention, that there is no way to navigate internet radio without TV on. Please update this post when you hear from Yamaha.
The sensor works when you start elevating the dish. The sensor requires a power source I directly connected mine to 12volts you also have the option of using a 9volt battery. Hope this helps
Once you set dish you don't have to reaim.
yes, if your cable box has RCA composite video output(yellow RCA output), you will need a BNC male to RCA female adapter to connect RCA cable from cable box to BNC input on converter, and obviously your screen has to have VGA input. You will also have to connect audio from cable box(red & white RCA outputs) to computer most lightly with a RCA to 3.5mm stereo jack audio cable
In my opinion it is not significant of an upgrade to change. The only real differences are an increase of 5 megapixels and an slightly increased shot rate. Not enough to ditch the older model. Neal
There is no "correct" choice, it is all up to you. The 30D is a good camera at a lower price, but uses previous generation technology. The 40D is the 30D's replacement and has the latest technology and higher cost. If your more concerned with money, go with the 30D. If you are more concerned with having the latest technology, get the 40D. Beyond that, look at each model and choose based on the features you want or need most.
Yes, absolutely. Completely solid
I got cheep aftermarket batteries because I got mine used and the Cannon batteries wouldn't last that long. The cheep batteries work great, and I can shoot for hours without a recharge. I got a bigger memory card, and that was nice. The flash on the 40D isn't that great, so consider getting something that will let you use the bounce technique. Lenses are all about what you like to shoot, so it'd be tough to advise, but I like the prime 50mm f1.4 Cannon lens for photographs of people.
I am not positive if it was an actual "SONY" replacement lamp, because there were some minor differences in the welding but there was no problems with installation and it works great so far. I have been using this replacement for about 2 months now and I haven't noticed a reduction in picture quality or anything. The item description might say that filters are included, but I have never received them...
Yes it will.
If you order the one that is for the canon product. I ordered mine for a Nikon.
I have not noticed any fringing with this lens. It is on my camera daily it seems and is my go to walk around lens.
Not sure and I don't use Nikon but it is a great lens so far. I haven't have to swap lens often since I get it. If the pictures are cropped it is incompatible.
Yes.
I don't think it should, mine never has.
3 inches
I also have had two VuPoint FSt-C1-VP Film and Slide Digital Converters. The first one quit, so I got a second because I still had slides to copy. I have been able to use it with Windows 7 with Google's Picasa, their free Photo program. You can download it from Google. In Picasa, I select the import tab. Then select the OVT Scanner. It is the the generic TWAIN driver that Picasa uses for scanners and it seems to work with the VuPoint.
Contact http://www.vupointsolutions.com/contacts and ask them if you can download one. I gave my scanner away but maybe someone around here might have one you could use.
Hello Philip. I assume you mean a Visio sound bar with subwoofer output. Baring an odd connection type on the sound bar, the subwoofer should be just fine. You do need, however, to ensure that the impedance is matched and that the woofer output of the sound bar is intended for a powered subwoofer, not a passive one. If not, you risk blowing the subwoofer. Best, David
I use with standard headphones and the push button allows me to answer the phone over music. Only minor issue is where to locate the mic/ button
it doesn't work. Don't buy it. If I spent more money on it I would have returned it by now.
That would be a question for the shipper. I would guess it was around 32" X 11" X 3" in size and around 10 pounds.
This is a grey market item. Canon will not offer any warenty. I have one and have had no issue with the lens for a year.
Honestly, it is a waste of money to replace a pen just for that reason because, sooner or later, it going to happen. In my case, when that sticky surface appears, I cleaned it using kerosene (or anoder soft paint remover as well) and thats it, like new.
I don't understand why these things are still impossible to get. Apparently they've been in high demand for a long time. Wacom needs to get on the ball and start manufacturing these things in greater quantities. It's starting to feel like they just want people to get desperate and buy whole new pens and that's a terrible way to do business.
It is a digatizer, not a key board. It works well for drawing. It would not work to type chinese.
Some company use the master code for all the houses they install the alarms that is why you cant demand the code, but some company use a diferent code for house
Excellent question. It could get tired after a whole day of use. But at night it will perform just as fine. If you use it in the dark though, you need to be careful with bats or other night birds bumping into it and getting confused. But you could also use it as a good deterrent, by swinging it around.
I know this is an old post, but I just purchased the Sony Walkman player over the weekend and was able to sync it with Rhapsody to Go with no problem at all.
Yes it does come with headphones and the non_noise is terrific
Yes, you can. If you have an AUX jack in your stereo, you can use a 3.5 double male cable to jam in your car. (any radio shack) It sounds great with this player, btw. Many new cars come stocked with the mp3player aux jack.
It's weak. I needed to get a hood attachment to shade it. Good at night though! LOL TomTom has very poor customer service, in my experience. My Rider 2 died in a download update and they would not help in any way
they are computer head phones so they have 2 plugs. the regular headphones plug(green) that plugs into computers or mp3s and the second plug is for the Mic only which is used for computer mics(pink)
No, it's not an add-on or "auxiliary" lens -- it's a full lens in itself. It goes on your DSLR *in place of* any other lens, not added on to an existing lens.
Yes it will work. Never mind about cropped factor, I use it for FX and DX format camera, regardless, it is THE best ultra-wide angle zoom lens. Have fun with it.
It is about 1/2 the size of a regular mouse. About 3.5 X 2. I use mine with a laptop and it fits on the right front corner below the keypad perfectly.
The mouse uses a standard-sized USB port. If your device has a port to accept the plug-in it should work just fine.
They came in a padded yellow envelope about 3 x 5 inches and weighed less than a pound.
I don't understand the question. Are you having a problem with your handheld remote device?
it should but you would need a headphone with a built in mic that has a three spaced headphone jack like apple or power beats via beats by dre works well with it
Yup.
Good afternoon, I apologize for any inconvenience. But we don't charge for shipping fee. The item coast $4.99
yes, it comes with high speed dubbing with it, along with several other very useful things.
You have to use the power adapter, USB and eSATA cables are for data transfer only.
The blade area is 10". The overall fan size is over 13".
Yes, it tilts up and down.
Yes, it has a mounting bracket and Screws everything you need
How do you copy the video to the computer? I am having problem to copy the picutres and vidio to my computer. Thanks
THANK YOU! I've been looking for a phone number for nearly an hour now! I can't log in to pay the bill, because I can't even register - I never received the actual card in the mail. I very much appreciate this. I sure hope others out there who are obviously having the same problems (according to the message boards) are able to see this post as well. :)
Check out the D300s - if it's beyond your budget, get the D90, not the D300- It's outdated. The D90 is an awesome camera. I have it. With the extra cash left, you can buy a lens ;)
yep! :-)
TV plate = either: VESA 75/100 mm (3" x 3" or 4" x 4") mounting hole patterns. Bolt size is M4 (4mm) 4mm converts to 0.1575". Wall plate will accommodate up to 1/4" fastener. Hole size is closer to 9/32" Hope this helps.
Yes
Are the electrical connections for all the components grounded? That can help. Then I usually jigger the speaker volume level and the component until I hit a happy medium. It's also good to have everything running through a grounded surge protector.
I prefer the M-Audio for sound, but these are pretty good too and I like the size of the Audioengines better for my desktop. If I were recording music, I would go for the M-Audio. I am just listening to podcasts and music at my desk with the Audioengine speakers and they are great for that. Hope this helps!
The box says that it shoots video with sound.
Yes, it accepts banana plugs, and they work better than regular speaker wire. Although fastened properly, the speaker wire sometimes comes loose somehow and drops the connection between the speaker and amp. Banana plugs on the other hand, give me a solid connection
Yes.
Yes
I would also like to know if this works on a Mac. In general, I am finding that it is possible to buy electronic items on Amazon that are completely incompatible with OSX and no where do you even see that mentioned. A simple "System Requirement" category would suffice.
It looks like October 31st. I'm all about this Sansa View too. It totally beats the new iPod Nano on both price and featuers.
I found this online and thought of our previous discussion. Figured that I'd pass it along to ya... "Player can be put in UMS/MSC mode via a startup hack: Let it boot up up, put the hold switch on. Hold down the left side of the scroll wheel and plug the usb cable in at the same time. Keep holding it until a drive appears."
Just a generic picture. Merry Christmas.

I beleive the plugs come with 3 filters ranging from 14 to 18 db, but obviously those numbers are only achievable with a proper fit.
The finesse of overwhelming hearing protection in situations with appeal towards the particle storm is one of the most valuable items of zeal.
It does fit good. For the first two days it wont later when the bag is streched to its optimal size it does fit in. I have asus ROG g750 myself. a 17.3" screen.
Yes. The device can play music or books to headphones connected by Bluetooth. I'm not sure if it can handle kindle player app but will store and play any mp3. Not with me to examine.
I have a Samsung YP-T9JBCB (8gb, Bluetooth). The specified battery life is 30 hours w/o but actually run at about 19-25 hrs w/o BT. With BT, it runs at 7-13 hrs. Expect 45% of the non BT life. BT uses less power than WiFi.
You have to hard wire the camera to your modem initially when it is wired you can then set it up using your smart phone. You would have to download the "pixpo" app and then scan the barcode on the side of the camera to link it to your phone. After you have the camera linked and installed you an unplug from modem and move to any location and it will work wirelessly. Hope this helps.
The camera did not work for us according to specifications, so we sent it back. Kay Schauer
battery and ram will not work, it is not the size of the tv that is the issue it is the resolution of the display, should drive any size hdtv but not 4khd
Hi, we do not have any power cord that's 10' or 12", they are all 6' long. Irene
No
Shutter count 147,829. No photos of the actual camera, but the camera has some tiny wear spots where the metal body is showing. Pretty typical of a camera that a person earned their living with. I thought I would be able to use it more, but it is so loaded with features I didn't understand, I gave up trying to figure them out and ended up shooting with my D7000.
I am not sure. I used it in a Kodak Easy Share C743, and it worked fine.
I am using a multifunction gaming mouse myself, and yes you can as long as all connected computers have the software installed and you will want to be sure that all the computers have the same profiles setup so you won't have any confusion.
No, it does not "watch" the keyboards key presses in any way. For my use this is why I selected it. I wanted one that will only switch from the buttons on the front panel. I did not want it to get in the way of my keyboard and since it does not watch keys it also is more of a simple pass through.
It will work ok , I use one on a Q9550 Core 2 . The temperature with no load runs at 105 degrees F and with a full load runs around 125 F. Best Regards, Robert Sink
yes
Yes, this CPU will work in AM2+/AM2 socket types.
Yes
Yes, you can. Any video card is compatible with this processor. If you are installing both items new, just remember to change your Bios Graphics Settings to PCI, before first boot.
No
Is this it? http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/ref=xs_gb_rss_68003/?docId=1000294431&ccmID=380205&tag=rssfeeds-20
Absolutely this product is designed just for that I would refer to the Instructions (Guidelines) as far as how long to keep this device plugged In, this is what your looking for It does weigh a little bit and should be watched the first time you use It I've have been told that you might need an adapter depending on where you travel Thanks Troy
Yes this is a PRO DUO. Exactly what you need It's only the memory stick. Does not come with the adapter
The Sony ZS-S2iP CD toolbox plays only regular cd's. Though it does have a nice interface for an iPod.
I don't know the "watt". Sorry.
It should since its for a standard gm radio,but I had two that did not work. However PAC makes a unversal one that works better.
No speakers come with it. It's only the main head unit. It's sad how cheap zunes became.
Yes it will and does.
According to the product description, it doesn't work with the Zune 120gb. =/
I could be wrong, but I don't think so. It doesn't have the triangle arrow marker to tell which side is up.
I use this product in my Galaxy Note 2 and it works great.
This is not Bluetooth. Its receiver plugs into your mike plugin on the machine
There is a slingplayer app for Logitech revue. It works!
Tom, By this point, you may have already found the info you needed. If not, the below link might be useful to you (enough folks were facing the problem, someone put the material together). Hope it helps! http://placeshiftingenthusiasts.com/slingbox-solo-freezing-stuck-optimizing-losing-connection-check-the-capacitors/
I think it would.
Yes, but 16mb here the spec for your camera:http://imaging.nikon.com/lineup/coolpix/others/990/
Thank you for your question. Konica Minolta Dimage A200 holds Compact Flash (Type I or II) Transcend's 133x CF cards are the perfect match for enthusiast and prosumer level DSLR cameras and camcorders.
I have purchased two of the 750gb drives via Amazon.com (Amazon.com was the direct seller, not a 3rd party seller) and they were both new/sealed. And unless you already know this; I have been told from a Amazon customer service agent (live phone call) that unless the Amazon product page says refurb, then the item is brand new; Amazon "direct sold" items are always supposed to be new. This of course does not have anything to do if you are looking at items sold from one of amazon's many 3rd party sellers.
I found the adapter info on E-bay (follow the link) http://www.ebay.com/itm/US-Western-Digital-WD-1TB-My-Book-Essential-HD-External-Hard-Drive-Adaptor12V/171050533357?_trksid=p2047675.c100005.m1851&_trkparms=aid%3D222003%26algo%3DSIC.FIT%26ao%3D1%26asc%3D20131003132420%26meid%3D7247654651354539816%26pid%3D100005%26prg%3D20131003132420%26rk%3D2%26rkt%3D6%26sd%3D171050533357&rt=nc (you may have to copy the link to your address bar in your browser.) The link above gives you the details about the adapter.
No. Amazon won't release an API for third party developers.
Yeah, it is true. They are not wireless.
It follows a grove in the shaft. So, no it does not rotate in any way. It would be fairly easy to rotate the entire monopod however. The base has a steel tip and could be used to rotate the monopod.
There are a number of programs that will rip dvd's to any format you want - divx,xvid,wmv. Try No. 1 dvdripper
not better than beats. but theyre decent.
You have to contact the company, send them pictures of the damage or issue. They will make a decision and unfortunately will only give you 1/2 the credit towards anything on their web-site with the exception of newly released items. It's not much of a warranty, but in my case I broke the plug off is yours is a manufacturer issue they may give you a complete refund or new set. All you can do is contact them and see what they say. Be nice and maybe you will find favor with them. :0-{) Peace The Ronman
Yes
Doubt it check their homepage put the model into google
yes
It's a Bluetooth keyboard and works well but the touchpad is not that good and would be bad for gaming. he would want to use a regular wired or wireless mouse
yes but you would need to have it in a dry location where the rain wouldn't not get into the system
No, it doesn't.
Yes
I think so. But I would not waste your time & money on this junk. Looks cool...the sound is awful.
I enter the channel numbers and my cable box changes the channel. I do not use the enter button.
It is a region 1(North America)....HDDVD players are region free(To bad this format lost)
No guarantees, but . . . mine works just fine! Unlike my previous Pioneer, Sony and Toshiba units *sigh*
check the wattage on your flat iron. If it's over 200 W, then definitely not, and even if it's approaching 200W I'd be wary of using it for more than a couple minutes at a time. That being said, if it's like 150W or lower, you're probably fine, and if you're closer but not over you're probably still okay as long as you exercise some caution. My experience is, if it overstresses the converter, it trips some thermal switch that just shuts down the device. Once it cools, it'll be good to go again.
No. The X10i model does. The X10 does not.
Trying to copy the dvd that might be corrupt? I don't think it will harm the duplicator. Most likely it will reject the corrupt dvd or produce copies that are not perfect. I would try maybe just one black dvd to see what happens.
I use the silver base CDs, have not heard of any that were not recommended! All the CDs I use work great!
They will but I will tell you that less than a month after purchase they stopped working...no sound nothing. Save you money.
No. This strip is NOT a (voltage) converter so whatever you plug into it must be able to accept the voltage that's coming from the wall socket.
Kevin, u got it wrong..It comes with a USB cable which will charge your player the moment you connect it to your PC :) Same goes for iPod..The charger that you see on the marketplace is IF you want to plug in the Zune to power socket.. :) While you are syncing your player, it will do the charging for you..isnt that just fine?
While hooked to computer, go to Device, music, right click on song, delete from will appear
To turn it off just hold the back and the down button at the same time. This is not the same as sleep mode. To make the zune sleep just hold the play button until the screen turns dark then lock it.
Banana plugs for a better connection and you should be good to install.
Does not work at all
Yes it does. I a using Ubuntu version of Linux.
As long as the scanner has a parallel port, it should be, though I haven't personally tested it.

I have been using this modem with Comcast without issue. I just had to call them and give them the unit's mac address and wait on the line for a few minutes while granted access. After that I returned their modem and reduced my month bill by $5.
I'm sorry David not with this one, cable only. Hope this helps.
Yes. It has a lot of space.
I just went out to the cycle to look at it, and honestly, I don't know. I have never used them, and when I looked for a use for them, I couldn't really see what they would be for. I'd love to know if someone else gives a more definitive answer.
No, I don't think it would fit.
Fits my atv rack 3/4 "
The only console that will work with it is the Mace brand unit it was designed for. You may be able to buy just the unit from Amazon or the Mace company.
I do not have that information. I advise that you contact the manufacturer for the transmitting frequency.
hello michael, good, great answers, but if I change it for the same P1800SX vega gives best shot, and frequencies are better, recommend P1800SX,,
Yes it fits perfectly
Do you have 2 cig lighters in car you can hook this in to? Try the other one. Did you turn the car on when you plugged it in? Radio is on? If so it must be defective. It should light right up. There is no button that needs to be pressed.
you have something plugged in wrong. Probably the component video.
Yes indeed! It worked on mine just fine.
The dimensions of this item are 31.75 x 23.5 x 23.5 inches.
It has held our 52" Sony for the last 5+ months and has remained strong and level. But we don't move it around much... ?
Yes,and it was new no problems.
5th gen w/video, yes. That's what I had before getting upgraded to the 160gb, it fit both.
Just the iPod window. The wheel is completely open.
It does come with a clip, though the clip will break off easily if it gets bumped or snagged.
Nope.
No, its 8 way digital.
No, mine did not.
Shipping rates are all listed under seller profile. Please click on our profile to check. We can ship out your order via Fedex International Priority which is 2-4 business days to Germany. We do have it in stock and ready to ship.
yes, I have the 3G, it's the same.
I am not sure, I only have a imagelink zoomD555 camera and lucked out as it fit my camera! SOrry
Robert, it does not have a factory clip for jogging. Yes, you can manually skip forward on recorded programs. I've not encountered any "traditional" commercials on its programs. It's not light..it weighs about 4 ounces...stacy
Subscription is not included - You'll have to contact Sirius directly and set it up (when you have the radio, the ID number is required). They offer a few different programming options with a few different payment options. Enjoy!
No
That's right. adapter, plugs, antenna are all included.
Yes they will. I use computer speakers with mine, they have to be plugged into the front headphone jack and the internal speakers won't work while the computer speakers are being used:)
Hi. I am using it with a coffe (Keurig) machine. It works fine so far. I understand that it will work well for items that are not dependant of a power source 24/7. Meaning that if you use it for short periods of time and then turn off, this will eork for you. At least that has been my experience.
No, it is not.
I spoke with the philips customer service desk and they confirmed to me that it would work with the Ipod Classic. I wonder who has any experiences with the SJM3151?
It doesn't stick our at all past the round end.tiu have to use a fingernail to slide it out. My adapters did not come with a cap so can't answer that.
What I understand is the PA 130 replaces the PA-3C, and the PA 150 replaces the PA 130. To be certain read the requirements of the PSRE243 adapter to make sure it matches. There is more to it than the 12 V so make sure the mA (marked next to volts) are enough. And for less heat, I understand the larger adapters may run cooler.
If you already have Companion 20 there is no point of returning them unless you need compact speakers for laptop or tablet. Music Monitor are much much smaller and do not produce a lot of bass compared to the Companion 20.
Check to see if your 3.5mm jack is optical out. If so, this will work. Most TVs only have the TOSLINK connector for optical. Otherwise, you'll want to go with that.
Actually, you can put any mp3 bought on iTunes anywhere. There are programs to convert them to non-secure iTunes songs, and then you can right click &gt; convert to mp3. Then drag it to your desktop, and you're ready to put it on your iriver Clix. Try Google-ing "itunes secure to nonsecure converter" (without the quotes).
Im in the same boat. I cant find a store that has them both. Let me know what you decide.
I sent mine back. It would hold the weight of my 23" all-in-one desktop on the wall, but the articulating swivel would not hold it in the correct position. I would slowly sag until it completely dropped forward.
I was not happy with this product. Not sure it will work for your use.
given the weight of most computer monitors, I would probably be up for at least using toggle bolts.but instead would not be necessary.
YES.
3ft is better...heck 4ft is even better than both. The taller the antenna the better the range/reception.
I have my bridge setup right next to my computer modem. The sonos speaker I have linked to it is approximately 20 feet away through 2 walls. It receives perfectly. I have run it outside as far as 30 feet through 3 walls with no problem. Great system.
It can take a while to set it up with your network, but once it's set up it's very easy to use.
No fees. As long as you have an open wi-fi connection, you have endless stations available. You set it up through reciva.com. Very simple. Also will play music files from your computer. Love this radio. I use it every day.
If you use your phone as a wifi hotspot, then you will be billed by Verizon for the data used, via data package
No...get something more reliable anyway...these cut out working because of a software/firmware major malfunction...check out LOOKEE TV...internet radio and tv...
Yes, it does. That's exactly the projector I have. Had the case for a year now, no problems, no damage, no wear and tear, and I take it out a lot for gigs so it gets more use than most.
anytime the antenna is masked in the manner you describe it cannot receive a signal from that side which makes it somewhat directional this is why trucks with antennas that are mounted like yours have a duplicate on the opposite side
It should fit in the gap between the hood and quarter panel. Once inside I just routed it through the firewall and up into my dash.
As I kown, this VideoSecu pc to tv converter don't have user's manual online. You can search 'pc to tv converter manual' on google and download same function item manual as this one.
It does have two DIP switches.
I dont see why not. Im using dvi to vga to rca just fine. I use it for my MAME Arcade Cabinet.
I guess the problem must be with the dipswitch. That is the only configuration problem that might prevent it from displaying the video. Try different combinations of the two switches because only one works in my case. The cable connections are pretty straightforward and do not leave space for error, I think.
This product mounts to the wall underneath the swivel hanger
There are white or creme strips that fit in top of the wires + lay on the wall can hardly be seen
Yes
Yes
Yes...it fit just fine underneath the seat.
It won't damage the dash but it will distroy your adhesive on the disc.
As long as it has a normal VGA hook up, it should work. The monitor also has VESA mounting holes in the back for wall mounting.
yes
It should be able to. I haven't used it for that exact purpose but it does have the inputs.
Doesn't appear to be. See http://www.videosecu.com/side-clamping-speaker-mounting-bracket-with-tilt-and-swivel-for-large-surrounding-sound-speakers-ms56b/.
No. This amp is only 2 channel. The 6004 model, will work for your application. It's 4 channel.
ALL FM stations in the US are on odd multiples of 0.1 MHz. For example, 88.1, 88.3, 88.5, .... 107.9. So a receiver made to work with the US system (such as this one) should not get the even multiples (88.2, 88.4, etc.). Your radio is working exactly as it should.
This item will work on your Vtx. I went from 1.25 to 1.50 bars and the device works fine. I also switched from a tom-tom device to a Garmin and you just have to order the correct cradle to mount on the device. I have a Garmin 2595lmt. As far as wiring I would suggest wiring to an accessory switch that only powers on with key. The device will charge when you are riding so you won't have a slow drain on your battery over time.
I think the only difference is the size/shape and perhaps some inside software changes too. The G2 responds pretty quickly to button presses where the G1 is a tad slower. I started with the G2 and now I have the G1 and am completely satisfied. The G2 is smaller and sleeker looking, but with a $200 price tag versus a $50 price tag, it was easy to make my choice. The G1 is about the size of a large ipod video, but it is still lightweight though.
I have not used any Shure brand headphones, but the bass is quite good
The bass is okay but for that style music the bass is lacking. I wouldn't buy these.
I have not used any Shure brand headphones, but the bass is quite good
Yes, it worked with mine for quite some time. I had a 8GB Sansa, but this is not what would make or not it to work. I had it at my summer house and unfortunately, due lack of use, it didn't work anymore, but has an excellent sound and did wonders for almost two years. I hope you have good time.
So yes, is what I meant to say.
No. I either had my own or purchased them. Can't remember whether I purchased or had them already. But I'm pretty certain it came in its anti-static pack without any extras. And just to add, I use it as an external backup and it hasn't given me any trouble. I hope this helped.
Yes it works perfectly.
Yes it should work no problems. It's parallel ata
I don't know as I have not used it with any apple products. However, if your apple has a USB port this might be compatible.
I read on wikipedia that PCI-E 1.0 and 2.0 were backwards compatable. Only in "very rare cases" would they not work together. I, like you, am planning on getting this as an upgrade from the 8600 GTS.
I really don't know. I would check for you but it's at my winter home and I, unfortunately, am not.

I would be cautious on the software, and check specifically with Nikon. Nikon's specs for it are out of date, so you will need to ask them. I have been unable to get it to even recognise my camera, a D610, despite Nikon saying it will work, but I suspect my computer is too new. Be specific on both your camera, and the operating system, including whether it is 32 or 64 bits. I have Canon colour lasers that are only 5 years old, but will not work with my laptops.
I am sure it will. I use it with a D800 and it works great. I would also mention there is a fully functional trial available through Nikons website. Once you decide to buy, just enter the serial number from the disks and you are set without reinstalling.
Don't waste your time with this one. It loaded but never worked properly. Nikon support was a frustrating waste of time. I love their camera's, but would suggest staying away from this product. There are other similar programs available; and those actually work.
also works with 2nd Gen iTouch; I use it with that and my Cardo S2 headphones.
I use it on my older IPod Classic. It works great! My Sennheisher MM 450 headphones are bluetooth. They sync flawlessly. with the IPod.
It works, but the receiving device has to have a volume control as the it doesn't pass through the volume commands from the nano.
You should check your owners manual. It does state in the manual that you need the SXV100 unit for your make and model of head unit if you want to get satellite radio. Amazon does carry them. Look in the "radio tuner" section of your owners manual.
The one I used was the SCC1 Sirrius connector.
Yes, with all functions, too.
It will work via adapter, but no autofocus.
If you have a USB ac adapter, it should plug in to the wall as well.
I wouldn't recommend this night scope for walking through the woods at night.
No, wish it was.
No
It should come with the necessary driver software. You shouldn't need it though. Windows should recognize it.
Yes it will work for sure
Not I. I'm glad NOT to be tied to a computer.
Yes it comes with the cord and charger base.
Any Linux-based machine (including this one) can open/use MS Office files by using the free-for-download OpenOffice suite (OpenOffice.org). In other words, you can use MS Office files by using that program.
Sorry, but I haven't used the 605. It's worth pointing out, though, that the N810 is completely open. You can install anything you want or write your own software. Most apps on the device are open source and Nokia actively encourages the development of new software. Check out the maemo Garage to see what's available. It's not the best web site, but it should give you an idea of the software that can be installed. https://garage.maemo.org/
According to the manual on Panasonic's site you can set the player's output to 720p on HDMI or Component. It also seems to have an "Auto" setting for HDMI (I gather the TV will tell the player what it supports and it will pick the "best"). I don't own this player (yet... thinking about it) but since my own projector is 720p native yet supports (ie transcodes) 1080i, I'll probably wind up trying the two options (on any player I buy) to see which looks the best... no sense transcoding those bits too many times.
No, it's a scam and a waste of money. You need an actual converter box for that. Don't waste your money on this.
I have not been able to get it to work on anything, I have tried it on. as far as a game I don't know about that.I bought it thinking it would link my computer to a karaoke machine. but,didn't work.....I have not tried a game yet.
It's genuine Canon!

The D-5100 is slightly larger than the D-3100 we have however I don't think you would have any trouble. In addition to the camera we also carried a seperate video camera, battery chargers, cables, etc with space left over. It is a tight fit but that is how we wanted it to keep everything from getting jostled around. We took this backpack to Hawaii for 11 days and loved it.
Yes you can. All its innards can be arranged to your liking.
It would not fit unless you left the top zipper pouch empty and smash it for more room. I measure just shy of 13".
Yes. Charger included.
It broke, it's temperamental, won't turn on after the first 3 month since I bought it. The operating system is slow.
I'm pretty sure you can't. I've tried to set it up for my son and I've been unsuccessful. But I didn't spend much time trying to troubleshoot so maybe you can.
The stand for it is adjustable and could be wall mounted. That would allow the monitor to then be attached to the stand. I don't think it is possible to mount the monitor to the wall without using the stand.
The screen is a matte finish.
I dont believe the Version of OS matters. You treat the touch screen as an input device.
I have it fully extended for a large telescope. About 33 inches per side. Can ease it through a standard width door. Hope this helps!
Yes, you should be able to do that.
John I used a Minolta to Canon converter to use my old Minolta MD Rokkor manual lens on my digital Canon. It worked fine. I'm pretty sure that the converter will work for your sigma lens but caution as to whether the AF will work. It's probably still worth buying the converter and trying it as you have a good lens that would otherwise go to waste. Hope this helps. Neil
I don't know. I had a specific requirement and researched to see if the lens would work. I was lucky it did in my case.
It is compatible with flash but not wireless. The actual tablet plugs into a USB port but the stylus is wireless
Haven't tried Win 7Home to Win7home, but it works perfectly Win 7 Pro to Win XP.

Hello, it does not currently work with Pandora. However, in May we will have a free software release. Choose configurations in the pull down menu, and check for a new software release and it will download automatically. You will then have to plug and unplug the unit for the download to take place.
Yes. I had this bag with me as a carry on during my flight to Asia. Keep in mind, it doesn't fit under the seat. It only can be stowed away on the cabin compartment. This is a great bag. I really like it.
Check here ... but be careful since they might change specs from year to year ... http://store.lowepro.com/backpacks/dslr-video-fastpack-350-aw At the bottom there is Dimensions & Specifications ... it says Notebook Compartment: 30.5 x 3.5 x 41 cm (12.01 x 1.38 x 16.14 in) Hope that helps.
You know I really think it would. I have thought of that myself. The zipper goes all the way up & so all you would have to do is stick the hose up near the top & zip it up to there.
Yes
Yes! My nikon d610 and a 24-70 fits and that is quite a long lens (about 10 inches on the camera , and has more room). Awesome pack!
Yes - there is an lower outside mesh side pocket that is designed for a bottle
I still can not get this one to work so stay away from it.
I am not sure. I was unable to get it to program for the cable ready TV I purchased it for
Make sure that the iPod is in place and in the on/play position. Plug-in the speakers. Press the on button. Press the plus button to raise the volume.
The manufacturers specs say 20 watts max, 10 watts RMS
No you can't
The receiver hooks to the monitor and you might have to go to radio shack to get an adapter so it will fit your monitor. But as far as I know it doesn't hook to a dvr.
Not much., Arrived damage it was returned to the seller some where in China, and later was returned by their postal services as address not found since it has been properly discarded. Regret that can not be of any further help.
It's very simple, you connect the wires where they correspond, turn on t.v. to the video/ game channel. turn tuning dial till you see the picture or what the camera should be picking up. I do not recommend using the camera with a 9v battery, it will not last long. Adjust antenna (on receiver) if needed.
Its a USB connection like on all PC's and end of most adapters.
yes,that is the way I use it at all times.
Not recommended has a very small window of focus.
I don't know. I'm having trouble getting it to fit onto my camera. Will have to get some help and find out what the trouble is.
I don't believe you can. I had 2 of these VCR"s and they never worked properly. They always ate the tapes and sounded watery. I ended up buying a Toshiba and haven't had a problem in years, but it does not record video to DVD. That feature would be in a model costing a few hundred dollars.
Sorry, I don't know. I only use mine to play videos.
It is 1 & 1/8 inch wide and 2 & 7/8" long.
No, this one does not have bedtime tunes programmed in it. Otherwise, I LOVE my iHome!!! It has great volume/balance, small and a large display clock! And this one actually charges my iPod.
Absolutely! That is exactly what I have . I love it. The sound is great and it recharges the MP3 player.
It is actually the same cable...they are just forgetting to put "CX" behind the "MC200F". When you get the cable...the package will say MC200FCX...hope that helps...It's a good cable... I am using it with my satellite setup
Not sure but I assume it is, works well with satellites good but you can go to monstercable.com and check, sorry it doesn't say on it :-(
Yes, they will ONLY fit if you take them out. However, the SD cards do fit nicely in the pockets; they will slide out easily, but pockets slide towards the spine of the case. So unless you're shaking them vigorously, you shouldn't lose any. Hope this helps!
Yes you could, it will fit and will stay in place.
This is a basic kit to start, but they are very good, compact but powerful lights
The kit does include the bulbs, but I'm not sure about the model. It's buried in my basement or I would get it for you. Sorry!
No 120 acv
It's a pen slate. The pen is the input tool. This model isn't touch, (finger) , capable. It has usb ports so you can attach a usb mouse and key board if you want. There is a dock available for this slate as well as a keyboard that uses the motion computing proprietary connection on it's bottom side. There is a version of this slate that is both write and touch but this one isn't that model.
Yes and great wireless
I didn't see anything saying they could receive a signal so I don't believe so. However the sound is amazing.
I would say YES. If I didn't already have "in-ceiling" rear speakers when we moved in to this house, I would have put these in place of those. Especially with the multi directional...this will ROCK for Rear in-ceiling.
yes
Absolutely NO!
Nikon says your D200 is compatible with "Nikon F-Mount compatible with Type D-AF, DX, AF-S, VR and G Nikkor lenses" So this lens "Should' work! It is REALLy a convenient lens to have available, especially for interior shots where you want a wide angle view to get a whole room in view, or a large group of people. The price is great for the conveniet capability of the lens.
The jack is an 1/8 inch plug so any standard headphones will work.
I would mount it underneath rather than sideways because I would think that the weight of it could break off the side of the cabinet
No, it's for 10series only, I think you need TY-FB8HM.
From my experience, yes, they are comfortable with glasses. I do get uncomfortable sometimes from heat build-up over time, however.
No it is not.
You can focus both manually and automatically.
Yes, The Inspiron 6000 laptop uses a standard HDD with a Parallel ATA (PATA, aka IDE) interface with a 2.5" physical configuration. The Hitachi will work just fine. Roman
Yes, it will work on D600
Sigma is the brand of the lens but you can order it for a Nikon , do not buy the one for Sony or other brand because is not going to fit your camera
if its a Kindle Fire HD then yes, the regular kindle fire doesn't have an hdmi port. as long as its the HD version (it is if it has the hdmi port) whatever is displayed on the screen of your kindle would display on the TV, Netflix included :)
Not that I'm aware of, all though you can turn volume to full and shouldn't have a problem hearing. I have ringing in one ear and I have no problem!
It has composite video output (4:3 480p) You can plug into anything that takes a standard component video input. (VCR, DVD Recorder, DVR Recorder, Time Lapse Recorder, computer, etc) Depending on your recorder you will need an "BNC-RCA" adaptor. Radio Shack has them or Amazon.
The weight is mere ounces. MAYBE 8 ounces. It didn't even register on my digital scale. Folding it to a small "package" was no problem.
Yes it does. A full length one and a small one for the pouch on the side. Both work smoothly.
Hi Bill, well, according to another satisfied customer, it fit the V-0554 just fine, so I cannot see why it wouldn't fit the 53. Probably a decent gamble, but I cannot say for 100% certainty.
Mine is a 554 so not sure

Pelican makes this case in Black, Tan and Black. We have ads posted for each color depending on what we have in stock. Please do only use this ad if you are buying a black case or call us direct before placing the order to check stock
It's black. But I can't remember if it was specified when I ordered it
Yes, you can fit a laptop in the lid. You could get away with up to a 15.4" laptop easily, and maybe a 17" laptop. It would be a lot more difficult to do this if you install the Pelican lid organizer. You could probably have a ultrabook with the lid organizer, but the lid organizer could not be filled to the gills. If you put a laptop in the pelican, I would have foam on one side (or sandwich the laptop with foam on both sides) keeping the laptop snug.
They come with one.
I believe I read 12 to 15 min depending on how much amperage is being drawn, we have two power outages a week as we run on generators and need to change oil weekly. Sometimes down 5 min and have had no problems. Its really so you can shut down without any loss of work. Hope this helped you.
yes it can be replaced, to my knowledge, while installing I notices that it would be easy to replace!!
With no load and in idle state, the INTERNET600U and all our Internet Office UPSs shouldn't be drawing more than 1 amp. If you have any additional questions, don't hesitate to reach out to Tripp Lite's Presales Applications Team at (773)869-1773 or presaleshelp@tripplite.com.
No - these are hard-wired speakers. Satellite refers to rear or side location for surround sound systems.
I have no humming with mine at all.
I used it to replace mine and it works fine so far
It is supposed to be compatible - but I'm not 100% certain...
I don't know about the minimum wattage but I know it maxes out at 250 watts (RMS value) when using the BRIDGE connection which has an output impedance of 4 ohms. Obviously you just need to make sure your main power/volume knob is turned up enough to get your 50 watt minimum. If you run the single channels they have an output impedance of 8 ohms.
Yes. I am also visually impaired and I use this for my college classes to read the board. It should work fine.
To be totally honest I bought this Giottos for the purpose of using it on my glidecam HD4000 and it was not ideal. It didn't fit my other manfrotto plates like I was hoping and it was kind of stiff to slide in and out. I ended up returning the product and got the manfrotto version. Hope this helps!

You have to mess with you computers screen resolution settings. Also there is a small cable that plugs in your headphone jack for audio.
First, this is a tuner - not a recorder. The recording option will be provided by software on your computer like Windows Media Center or Myth TV (Linux). Second, it will only tune unencrypted QAM (or Clear QAM) channels.
Yes its relatively easy with any of these kind of devices. But remember you are always going to be converting HD signals with resolutions of 1920x1080i and 1280x720 to DVD format which is 720x480. There is a more complicated method if you have a blu-ray player. You can convert them to AVCHD and get around 2 hours of full HD on a dual layer DVD+R.
Have you received any answers? What have you decided on or tried for your own solutions? I am in the same situation as you and have just received my HDHR and haven't had any luck in finding any posts about this.
You need one that fits your hotshoe. Check to make sure you find they correct fitting puffer.
they have a wire that runs between them and then a single wire/plug from one speaker to the music player

The HF10 is an older 2008 model, considered medium consumer camcorder, While the HF G10 is a newer 2011 high end model. The HF G10 is much better (and more expensive) than The Older HF10
I personally used iMovie on my Mac. I couldn't open it with any other application. I couldn't use the files with windows either. Not very happy with that, but it does take good video. All I can suggest is iMovie.
No. The info I got from Canon is that my Power Shot A590IS & FS100 and all of their newer flash memory cameras will accept any size Memory card. If a 1TB is ever made, they will format to that too.
Yes and it lasts pretty long since this cam has no moving parts.
No
Yes, you'd have to add a Depth of Field Adapter and you can then use Canon or Nikon SLR lenses. I built one for my HV30 here: http://www.youmademedoit.com/diy-35mm-dof-adapter-for-canon-hv20hv30hv40/ -- if you're interested, I'd consider selling it.
IBM USB, the original keyboard. I buy two at a time. The keys are elevated, fit the fingers, you can hear your keystrokes. In short, newer and ergonomic is not necessarily better, go with the IBM USB, cannot go wrong.
I'll have to dig it out of the computer junk pile that my husband keeps to take measurements. For clarification, you want the distance between the specified keys, correct? Also, what do you mean, by "how high are the keys?" High from which point?
If you are buying it from the manufacturer, then no, they come as part of the package. The only time you MAY have to buy the adapter separately is if you purchase it from a previous owner or through auction.
You can download the latest software/drivers from the wacom website and use video connection adapters to connect it to your laptop. VGA to USB or DVI to VGA. It needs at least one free USB port for the tablet portion and then use whatever adapters you need to feed it video.
I only use the one that came with the tablet.

I installed BFG NVIDIA GeForce 9400 GT 1GB. So far it has worked fine.
http://www.intel.com/products/processor/core2duo/specifications.htm
Best ask that question on another site... research the "socket type" and other specs and compare the two components. Example : that server CPU is LGA775 per my research... E8400 is as well so it will most likely work but may void the warranty! Also note the E8400 is my favorite E-Series CPU... can handle 4+GHz overclocks on AIR without much effort. Will match an i3 on the bench.
According to MSI website this board supports this chip.
No. The trigger needs to be held in to track the speed. The gun is really accurate.
YES. This unit can be used to read speed of just about anything that passes within its range.

open panel and see if it is 7.2 volt 1100mah battery pack that contains six AA batteries enclosed in shrink plastic with two wires going to a plug in strip, if so it should fill the bill. Some panels have a tamper alarm that you have to deal with, several options. This is a good source for wireless sensor batteries.
Check this item out on Amazon if your looking for he right power supply. Model :PS2K
I believe so, yes. You need the correct port on your computer too (esata) but I had no problems connecting the hard drive. You'll also need some sort of power supply for the hard drive. I had one from a sata to usb kit.

I have the 880 and the 1000 and three Sony DVD Jukeboxes. I would be surprised if the One supports the Jukebox. If there is no "Media" button, that will be your first clue.
It should, but I would go to crucial.com and download their software which will analyze your computer's system and then it will give you recommendations as to what to use. Hope that helps. Thanks.
just look on the web site for witch ram you need becouse ddr2 ram is the same on mac or pc
I don't know of anyone that relies solely on a digital camera's internal memory.
All the major camera companies camera will work with macs. Take pictures..plug it in to your mac...and iphoto will take over !!! My family ONLY uses macs, and our Sony, Nikons, Canon, and Samsung Xacti all work GREAT with macs.
Yes it does videos, very well outdoors. But indoors or low light they are grainy and slow (fast movement is blurred).
sure will.
Yes. Camera stamps the date and time.
I don't understand your question, if your asking: Does this camera have time as in how long has it been in the market? : I bought mine like 4 or 5 years ago so it's been a while, (and stopped working properly about 6-7 month after buying it; but looks good as a decor element) or Does this camera have time as if this camera has timestamp? yes it has but can't remember where is in the menu sorry..
i am not sure , however i am sure it is still one of the best camera out there. it is one of the best purchase i ve ever made in my life. i would pay 500 for this camera even today. i paid 350 in 2009. D it has a dual time option, but i dont think it has date stamp.
You can hear it but I don't think it sounds that good. There are definitely other cameras out there with better audio on video recording. I guess thats a drawback of having a waterproof camera. http://s19.photobucket.com/albums/b175/bowtiebadboy/?action=view&current=P5260001.flv
In my experience with this device, it would not be compatible with your LG or any other tv. iI was using the device in conjunction with a PC as my "media center". I had a tv tuner hooked up to my computer and from there, used the Logitech diNovo to control the mouse pointer on my television. It's essentially your mouse and keyboard if your computer display was your Tv
by using low light mode, but that will ruin the colors.
No it doesn't record audio but I've had it for many years now and it's never stopped working. Best color video security recorder I've ever bought for the price.
Not sure, my understanding it will connect to any DVD player. Comes with cable connection.
I do not know the answer to your question. I do know it did not work with my Toshiba SDP-2500.
Yes
Yes, it turns the coax cable into rca, s-video, or vga (and 3.5mm for audio)
No, only a play/pause button
I dont Know. It worked fine in my hp notebook hp.
Hi, yes, they're backwards compatible.
Yes
You *can* run them off of your laptop, but they won't sound very good. You will need some kind of amplifier. Fiio makes some good amps for the money. I would suggest something in the $40 to $100 range. You won't be dissapointed though, these headphones are awesome.
If you take a look at the information on this unit (just above the large matrix chart) you'll find a short paragraph entitled "What's in the Box". Here is a direct quote: "What's in the Box nvi 260W, preloaded City Navigator NT for the continental U.S., Hawaii, and Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Canada, vehicle suction cup mount, vehicle power cable, dashboard disk, and set up and go guide."
My 260w, which is a discontinued model and means you're buying an old unit, did have the wonderful voice directions for about 6 months. When voice directions stopped working, I sent the unit back under warranty. Rather than give me a new unit, they "fixed" the voice malfunction. Six months later and now out of warranty, the voice feature stopped working again. I contacted Garmin. They told me tough luck. That's awful customer service. Since this was the 2nd time the voice feature failed, they should have offered me a replacement unit.
Is this line at the very top edge, very bottom edge, or in between? If it's somewhere in between, I haven't noticed this on any of the Garmin models I have used, and I'd exchange it.
You might want to check out Ascent from Montbello Software. Mac native and runs circles around Garmin Training Center for the 205/305. I'm using it for my 405, but only after exporting a file in windows from GTC and importing it into Ascent.
The strap is included when you get this unit with HRM.
as far as I know - they only make it for Apple-products : iPhone, iPod, iPad, etc.

The Garmin box is ~ 6.5 inches high, 6.5 inches wide, 3.25 inches depth
You need the Dell pro2x or pro3x. I dont think the pro1x will work.
It appears to charge for about a 2 hour lifespan. But that's how long most of the 6-lithium ion batteries charge for. Most batteries last me 6-12 months before they overheat if you use your laptop frequently
Your guess as as good as mine. I enjoy mine almost every day, but they are wired up to my audio amp. My guess is that Amazon is so fond of these speakers that they want everybody to notice them, regardless of the section they're browsing.
I've had these on my patio for over 2 years now. There are some instances where they get a little bit of rain on them from time to time but only thing I've noticed is the grills get little brown spots. You can clean those off though. These are great speakers.
I was trying to find out the same thing. Did you ever get an answer? My worry is about the impedence might be different.
No. The "A" just indicates the blue color. I called one of these vendors and asked.
I really want this camera- the manual controls using the touchscreen look great. Has anyone ordered from Amazon and gotten it already? It says it'll ship in "1-2 months," but if it's already out... ?
We do ship internationally.
Yes, it comes with a white colored USB cable for transferring pics from the camera to your computer.
I just bought the blue one for my daughter at Walmart ($139.98) and yes it came with the battery and charger.
Yes you can. There is a file by the name of FF_STAMP on your disc of Finepix that came with the camera. You need to copy this file to your memory card. Then from your camera copy the images to the camera. You can find instructions on pg. 89 of owners manual.
No, sealed lens.
http://reviews.cnet.com/surround-speaker-systems/monoprice-9774/4505-7868_7-35512507.html?ttag=fbwp
They are 8 ohm, check about a third of the way down the amazon page you will see product specifications where it is listed as well. They are amazing speakers for the money.
There is no ceiling box, you just cut the hole and they mount and hold themselves in the ceiling.
Yes, it comes with a template and painting cover. The ceiling hole should be 7-5/8", and they are 2-3/4" deep into the ceiling. The actual cover is 9-1/8", and although it sits flat around the edges, it's curved and hangs down 1/2" from the ceiling in the middle.
Yes. The fittings are for the 4s and older. I didn't find this to be a great transmitter. I ended up sending it back.
Excellent outdoor sound quality. You won't be disappointed. we also live out in the country, excellent reception.
Absolutely not. Unit operates when plugged . Once you unplug ,if turned on ,starts operating using the batteries.
I'm sorry that I can't be of help. The blind Ranger who used the radio was so dissapointed that he gave it away after several hours. He was unable to hear any of his favorite radio stations he used to get on the earlier model.
Start with the model # of the aircard (wireless adaptor) you are using from the internet provider. Then check with Cradlepoint for the model of wifi hotspot that works with the aircard you have.
NO! Just a basic Video Recorder works great and very simple..no frills
There is no microphone jack. The camera has a very useful microphone built in however. I have 3 of these cameras.
I cannot say about the battery but I think it is. The lens may be a problem, the HC9 has a 37mm thread were the HC3 has a 30mm. You can get a step down adapter for dirt cheap but you risk vignetting, granted if it does rather then having a useless lens you have a special effects one :).
No, they're mini. All modern (made within the past few years) full-size players can read them, though.
No, it is not an easy upload. If this is for youtube check out the flip by pure digital.
If you download a free program named Handbrake, you can export the video straight to the Mac using the provided USB cable. Otherwise, you can only transfer the .jpg files. While Sony says it is compatible, it's isn't completely.
Hi Patrick, Sony DCRSR45 Camcorder doesn't support USB live streaming.-Vincent
Yes, very easy to transfer. It comes with software and cables. Haven't had an issues with mine so far. :-)
I believe it can I am not 100% sure it worked with my T3i and I have to say I loved this lens for the price it is a fantastic piece of glass.
Hi David, This part (KTA-MB667K2/4GR) is compatible and recommended for the iMac Mid 2007 system. Thank you for choosing Kingston as your upgrade partner! -Jewel, Kingston US Technical Support
Yes standard remote work fine just point at receiver. Great product
Two in a box.
I'm not sure what model that is, but I have a mid-late 2007 White Macbook (NOT Pro, just regular) and it fits it and works GREAT! Hope that helps!
Perhaps there was 2 versions that the company makes and it was just a default picture showing the detail, however, the version being sold IS the LED one.
The Sansa Clip displays looks like this: (shuffle) 412/729 [ ===] Artist Song/Album |&gt; -----==== 5:12 By line: - mode, song #/total songs, battery status - artist name (scrolls if long) - song name / album name (scrolls if long) - play/pause, play position, play time When searching, you can search by artist, album, song, genre, or playlist. It's *very* handy.
i believe so yes
The Cooler Master requires three 5.25" drive bays, and coverts those slots into four hard disk slots. Any generic tower PC case with 3 DVD/CD-ROM sized drive bays will work. The 12cm, sleeve-bearing cooling fan is located behind the black fascia and is backlit with blue LEDs. It slides in easily from the front. It is very quiet.
It will fit in any case with 3 open 5.25in bays. So it's pretty universal. I love it. Haven't had a single issue out of it and it's very simple to replace the fan inside with a different one if you don't like the blue LED
It is designed to mount on the side of a smaller craft. I guess it would come down to what is the distance between the rail and the water. I do not believe that Hummingbird designed this model with pontoons in mind. V-hual- flat bottom crafts in the 10' foot to 16' range I beliueve would be suitable for this locator. I would think that a look at other Hummingbird products might better serve your purpose. Something with a detachable transducer.
do not know, I have a little v-bottom crabbing boat. I hang it over the side and tighten it up, and it's good, for moving slowly. if you where going to get going I would take it off until I get to where I want to be then slow down and drop it in the carrier and pinpoint my fishing hole / spot.
I would think so, because in the box it said it works with Boss pedals.
Yep
Hi - There is no vertical grip for the A100.
No
I do not believe so. The head is connected to all on the controls. Hope that helps
If your camera has a standard mount Yes, it will fit, I believe you have the same as all cameras
I have a Sony DCR-SR42 and the remote control connects through the A/V Out connection on the camera. I don't know about you camera but if you A/V Out looks like this picture it would be my guess that it would work.
It should. That camera seems to have the "A/V R" outlet on it's right side.
It perfectly works on my D90 and D7000. Bokeh is nice and smooth, pictures are sharp... Examples: https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-nph9X5kn3iU/Ud9EYo128PI/AAAAAAAAEKA/N3NmRmE2Cm4/w1000-h664-no/DSC_0001.jpg https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-84mL1_AkA3Y/Uf72mNrgxPI/AAAAAAAAELk/KbrI7WSrBt0/w1000-h664-no/DSC_0004.jpg https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-7FRFG4lkO88/UTLR_jAID9I/AAAAAAAAC8k/MVM3wm2Nr40/s1000/DSC_0006.jpg
Yes it does. Also I put extra batteries in the case and on the side lockers
Yes
Not sure, I have the HF G10. Great battery.
I got this a few years ago for my Vixia HFS100, and it was original Canon. I would expect at least 40% more runtime than the stock battery.
Yes it is, it mounts on the rear shoe that is covered (directly over the viewfinder).
I just placed my order for the 32 GB and here's why: first of all I knew that 16 wasn't enough memory for me personally so I waited until the next memory upgrade came out. But of course, you don't know how much "stuff" the person you're buying it for will put on there. So think in these terms: with the 32 GB, you're essentially only spending 20% ($100) more for DOUBLE the memory. Economically, you're getting much more bang for your buck with the 32 GB. Hope this helps.
I'm pretty sure these early generation iPods won't run the versions of iOS that have Siri. As far as getting the music on, you can sync this with iTunes just like your current iPod.
of course it does, I I have mac os 10.8.3 right now
I ordered mine on January 15th and haven't heard a peep from Amazon. It used to be that they were good about being able to get new release items out in a competitive manner. It now appears that they have lost whatever edge they might have had. If I see one locally, I will buy it and will cancel my Amazon order.
I don't see why not. Your line runs from audio out into the amplifier which connects to these speakers. I use mine as rear speakers to my HD TV with no problems.
I have 25 devices (PCs, LapTops, Tablets, DirecTV DVRs, HDTV Sets, and Smartphones) and no issues with PepLink Balance 30. However, you should contact the company and talk with them as your traffic load and types of traffic may differ, that could affect your proposed operation.
You can use it with both.
yes as long as its returned on time and back packaged the same way you received it.i think you have to pay shipping and delivery though but im not sure on that one
DLP = Digital Light Processing (the technology your TV uses to process the TV image) Yes, this lamp will work on your set.
I couldn't tell you, for I can't get an answer from them! I'm stuck with a lamp that does not work and had to buy another one from Samsung....sorry! This lamp is not a Samsung product. It carries the same serial and model numbers, but it is not the same!
Just remove the cover plate, disconnect the plug, pull the lamp out and replace. Very simple.
No. This is not a Wifi adapter. It is an adapter for a wired or network cable connection. Your Apple computer will continue to use the Wifi adapter it already has along with this adapter.
You could try asking the seller about any guarantee. I bought one in March. Only problem was a tiny dent on one of the capacitors. But that hasn't affected the functionality of the board. It setup easy and has run great so far.
Yes you can, I am using one dvd sata right now
No, I don't think so. It does not have an infrared focusing beam and I do not think it can shoot infrared photos.
If that camera autofocuses Pentax lenses it will do so with this one.
Sorry we have no idea , we have it installed on a pontoon boat for about a month and are very pleased with its performance so far
The Sony CDXM10 came as a complete unit -- and was easily installable. We purchased it as a replacement unit for a radio that no longer worked. I would add, however, that the CD element started acting up after 12 months -- by not accepting the CD through the slot when we tried to load it. I can get it to work; but only after 5 to 10 minutes of repeated attempts to insert it into the slot.
No
It is a high quality player but limited to NTSC Region 1 playback only.
There is a way to transfer your songs from the old computer to your new computer. I did this successfully a few months ago. I am fairly technically inept, but I was able to do it following Apple's instructions (see link at end of this post). It was a little bit of an ordeal, as I had to use my iPod as an external hard disk to move all my stuff over. However, if you follow the instructions from Apple's help link, you should be able to do it too. Good luck! http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1329
These stereos are junk they do not play well and you cannot get parts for them the belt on my turntable broke and I still cannot find a part to fix it so I would get something else not worth fixing
Yes..it does have..Thanks!
I have a 2003 accord. Can't say it will work the same but before installing this product, my aux button didn't do anything. But after installing it i guess it recognized that I had an aux plugged in so it worked.
No
Yes, all I use it for is plain paper copying of text.
13 in x 7 in. approx. 4 lbs.
The power supply says 100-240 Volts 50/60 Hz. The printer I bought in the US works great in Holland. I imagine most European countries would be fine as long as you have the right adapter (no transformer needed).
Yes, it will work on a 17 inch laptop. In fact, my 17.3 inch laptop is on it right now.
This camera accepts both xD or SD/SDHC memory cards -- few cameras do this. If you buy the bigger one, it will not stick out. This is a great feature.
Yes you can. There is a file by the name of FF_STAMP on your disc of Finepix that came with the camera. You need to copy this file to your memory card. Then from your camera copy the images to the camera. You can find instructions on pg. 89 of owners manual.
The easiest solution (besides NOT taking vertical videos!) is to upgrade your Quicktime player to Quicktime Pro (http://www.apple.com/quicktime/pro/). I assume that since you want to convert to AVI, you're a Mac user, but this is available for Windows folks as well. There are likely some cheaper shareware solutions out there too, but I've found that the upgrade to Quicktime Pro is well worth the 30 bucks, since it allows you to edit, rotate, and export to a variety of formats and file sizes. Hope this helps!
I don't know if it'll work on every motherboard, but it's pretty generic, plug-and-play style ram so it probably will.
To my knowledge, there are no malfunction, or imperfections.
Yes but not HD
Sure. Canon lists the following as compatible remotes: Remote Control RC-6 Remote Switch RS-60E3 Wireless Remote Controller RC-1 Wireless Remote Controller RC-5
yes the on/off switch on the unit will work if on and wont if off,regardless if its pluged in the outlet.by the way its a great unit. i have bought 3 of them.
The A2500 is pretty great! My friend and my sister both have it and they love it! It actually has a lot of features/modes if you search through the camera. At first glance, it doesn't look like it can do much, but there are so many cool settings and functions--a lot like my canon powershot A470
Yes, in fact it has an additional 45 Degree angle to the left so that it is possible to plug it on the top outlet and have an identical or right angle plug on the bottom.
330V. The link provided by another user has a table of info and the "clamping voltage" is listed as "UL 1449 TVSS Rating" which is 330V for this unit.
I would think about the high or low volts not the amps. it should trip with high amps. don't know what its rated for.
8 feet long. I love the length of it.
Hi Jessica, Ive had mine about a year & like it. I believe Pandora is only accessible via a iphone app, it may be possible to access it thru another name channel, but I am not sure. Good luck.
Try this link:
Not sure. I used it for a Celestron NexStar 130 SLT Computerized Telescope.
I bought this case for the 450D and it is great. Truly great. But I have no idea how it would work on a larger camera.
Yes, these are the Steiner 650 binoculars.
I still had the brochure that came with the stands. It says on the back: "Custom designed for Bose speakers in: speaker systems, Lifestyle home entertainment systems, all 3-2-1 DVD home entertainment systems and the CineMate speaker system". Ergo, I think the answer to your question is, "yes".
It does. Both cables are probably about 10ft long.
.if putting in 2GB module in eee pc 1000 you need to restart computer after installing the RAM and keep pressing F2. then press F10 to accept the settings in the BIOS. now your eee pc will recognize the 2 GB module yeah,.. plug and play... right
I ordered this memory direct from Crucial and it arrived in a package just like you described. It worked great. I have only used Crucial memory, it always works great.
Works fine in my small apartment through thick fireproof walls. That is the only basis I can base comments on.
Dear P. Brenna, 120mm is the outer diameter of the actual disk. So no, this does not have anything to do with the actual recording time. 80 minutes of recording a playable CD is what you will get. Hope that helps. Bob
Hey Doug no they are all gold in color...but they dont work on my PC lightscribe...Memorex seems to work best.
It's more like the OP/TECH USA System Connector Uni-Loop. Stitched leather to secure the braided cord, which is more flat than round and a little larger than the Mini QD Loops. I use this with my 5D-Mark III DSLR.
Hi Michelle! Yes it will work. This camera can use A-mount lenses. -Anthony
Our DVD player is now 7 months old and it too has the problem where the screen is black. It still plays through the line out to a TV but nothing is on the screen. We don't know how this happened as it is used at gently at home. I've tried playing with the screen (opening and closing and a bit of swiveling) and it does come back but only for a short time. Does anyone have any other suggestions?
Yes, comes with AC Adaper and 12 v DC Car Cigerette lighter charger.
I think I have to agree with Carl Peluso. The Sam's DVP FX811 boasts an 800x480 resolution. The buttons at the bottom of the screen are identical - they're round and placed exactly the same as the FX820. The FX810 has a chrome hinge for the screen, the FX811 is black. If the manual for the two models is word for word identical and they look identical I'd say they're the same. I may get the FX811 and save the $20.
You don't have to use the built-in speakers if you don't want to. The sound doesn't come through the HDMI cable, it comes from a second audio cable... just like you would use to any external speakers.
Im honestly not sure. There are days when the light from the window forces me to angle the screen sway. But it's really not that bad as previous monitors I've had. It's seriously the best! But if you decide to go with a screen protector, make sure it fits! Very nice sized screen!
Nope, I only got one as well.
I'm not quite sure I understand the question. With the quick release that the tripod comes with on the head, you can attach whatever you want. I usually attach my entire shoulder rig to this tripod.
Yes, it's on the list of compatible printers.
Yes, that's the model of printer we used it on.
This tripod will definitely support the weight of that.
Yes it can tilt towards the Sky --- just not 100 percent straight up. I use it to mount a small catadioptric telescope.
This 60mm Micro-Nikkor would work well for this.
Yes, you can use almost any Nikon lens with that camera. I bought the 16/85 lens to replace my 18/200 as that lens was not sharp above 150mm and the 16/85 is sharp.
I am not sure as I haven't tried, but I doubt it. I would not work with my 2010 iTouch. I think it only works with old iPods.
5) To cancel the alarm completely press the ALARM 1 and/or ALARM 2 buttons until the ALARM mode indicator disappears
The problem is with the whole thing! Do not buy! I have had two of these. It wasn't worth the hassle to return it the 2nd time. Biggest waste of money. Nothing works. Nothing. Sorry! :-(
I need to know this also.
Generally, it should work since the HG Duo HX is a higher speed version of the memory stick. You might check online for your specific camera model's specifications just to make sure.
No
Maybe everyone knows this now. But since iTunes music videos are all now in the iTunes Plus format you can put them on this player. You have to copy and paste them to your videos folder first if you're using Media Manager to put them on your player.
Because the standard shipping is always as $4.99 per item. It may beyond this price.
Yes, it has several options. It has intelligent shuffle (the truly random shuffle you want), it has shuffle & repeat if you want it, or shuffle by year, etc.
What about the Media Manager program it came with? I still use it, it's kinda slow but I'm not tech savvy so it works for me. (I have Vista as well)
germany
Mine came as a pair.
Just a Resistor on each unit.
It does not say if it's 4 or 8 ohms, it lists 4 - 8 on the label.
yes.
According to the instruction, it can tilt 30 degrees (+25 degree to the back and 5 degree to the front). You can turn the base itself for 270 degrees. (Pan range)
They are plug in speaker type connectors.That's the closest i can get to describing them.secured by screws.
Yes
There's a pair of Dayton bookshelf speakers for around $50 on Amazon that get glowing reviews for unbelievable sound at a modest price. And they have a built on keyhole latch to mount the speakers on the wall which is a great consideration.
All you have to do is connect the tv audio out to the audio (aux) input of the power amp and you can adjust the volume as you desire while listening to headphones at the same time :)
Yes, TZe231-2pk will work with the PT-D400AD label maker.
The Mohu Sky is an amplified antenna. Connecting a pre-amp to the Mohu Sky will make it worse, not better, due to noise amplification. I'm using this on a pair of non-amplified antennas (one VHF, one UHF) in my attic, approximately 30 miles from the transmission towers with no issues--but again, if you already have the Mohu Sky, this product won't help and will likely hurt your reception.
It connects via the speaker wire. It has two inputs A and B and you can select which you would like (if you had two amps).
Hi, the unit is approx. 14 1/2W x 12D x 2 3/4 H. Hope this helps, it a nice unit.
Short section about 6"-10" long
I drilled a hole in the roof of the motorhome placed a bead of caulking going inside threading the nut on tight. Installed last year with no leaks and works great.
I don't know. I have a Sony marine stereo with 4 25 watt outputs and I am running 4 JBL's with plenty of power and great sound. If you split 4 channels to 6 speakers, I think you will need and amp.
People are just so ignorant about the reality of toaster ovens. Don't listen to that other guy. The answer is absolutely not. Don't even bother trying this at home. The temperatures achieved inside your average toaster oven aren't nearly high enough to break down the adhesives inside the lens, not to mention the mechanical bits. Ask some plasma physicists if you can rent time on their cold-fusion reactor. They're usually willing to help out.
Yes it will
You can be both a "free to adjust + professional-ish blur sense of composition by the zoom". Brightness and lack of zoom lens, supplemented well the shortcomings of both of the difficulty of making composition of single focus, It is easy-to-use lens.
The lens says 67mm.
It's $399 today!
The lens says 67mm.
My camera works good . The picture is back words but you get used to it
Screen size I am not sure on, as I gave it as a gift, but I do know it comes with a battery and charger.
how is XP Pro working in Boot Camp?
The Mac mini has what is called a mini display port and a HDMI port. This means you have lots of options for connecting a monitor as it does not come with one. Most monitors use VGA or DVI and with an adapter that will work just fine. In my case, I actually use my television as my screen so I use an HDMI cable. It's great for me because it is the only cable of the three which transmits video and audio.
I believe they are being literal in their instructions. Do not place (literally) anything on top of your Mac. - And yes, one can buy a stand that the Mini fits under and your monitor sits on top.
I have installed Maverick client on the mini but not the server. Client runs well
The "Apple iPad 2 MC769LL/A Tablet (16GB, WiFi, Black) 2nd Generation" from TechGiant includes the charger, consisting of the Dock Connector to USB Cable (cord) and the 10W Power Adapter (plug). If you are looking at a different model (32/64GB or +3G) you will need to contact the sellers to ask.
Yes, any movies
Yes it has. I can store on it up to 4 GB.
You can record, but you cannot watch films on it. Also, the browser doesn't actually allow you to browse the internet... It only lets you browse the files that you have on the device.
I am so sorry but I am afraid that I do not know the answer to this question as I am not acquainted with the camcorder and adapter that you are using.
Hi Lieu, the lens can be connected to the camera without the adapter and the Steadyshot function can be turned on. Thanks_Mitch
yes.
Yes but spend a little more and get a name brand they work WAY better jvc is fairly cheap and good
L: 3.5" | W: 2" | H:1
Yes. You will set the sub volume to the level of bass you desire and the sub will volume up and down in accordance with the a5s volume or the volume of the signal being delivered to the a5s as if you had it connected to a PC.
Yes
Pretty easy, I used a cheap box cutter on a wooden surface.
I dont know the exact answer - but I had no issues with a VGA cord, power cord and two cat5's
That would depend on the quality of the analog audio AND the quality of the digitally-encoded audio. Think "garbage-in~garbage-out".
I have a wireless headset and they work if tv is muted
YEA
I would assume any 10" sub will fit. My type r is pretty deep. Check your measurements.
The mount depth is really close, I wouldn't get this box for a sundown x12. The x 12 mount depth is 9.67 inches and you have about 10 inches of usable space. You need more space behind the motor than that but you could make a spacer to make it work but that woul be ghetto. Hit up Starr Mountain Sound for a custom box and you will not regret it! His prices are reasonable.
not sure we installed jl audio 12w3 and they fit if that helps
Idk didn't measure
Sure does
Slim subs will only work they say 5 or something but it's a lie
No
I think it fits up the to year 2008. Not completely sure.
This box is 1.79 ft as indicated in the description. I bet you can find some great information about the air space spec of your sub woofer from Rockford Fosgate. Then you can ascertain for yourself weather or not this will work for your application.
YES, THAT WOULD BE A GREAT MATCH UP.
No. No volume control in headphone.
Yes, I use them with my MacBook Pro and the iMacs in the studio.
I had to take a knife to it and shave it down some more to fit. Also, it doesn't let Mic data pass through.
See how it looks like it can handle extra input, like for a microphone? Total bullcrap. It doesn't let the actual 4 section wires (left/right/mic/ground) pass through, it's the same as a basic stereo plug (left/right/ground).
its very slim and fits into an aux port in any case, but with my iphone there was a lot of static using this cord, I don't recommend it.
I use it with a 6.0 amp sawzall with no issue for extended periods
Don't own that printer. Don't have any idea?
I always use Avery.
Yes I think it should. I'm not a pro in car audio but all you should have to do is bridge the amp.
I dont remember

It has been amazing for home use. We usually shine it on a white wall downstairs. We have also set up a sheet outside and had an awesome movie night.
i'd make sure it's not in zone 4 or in a bypass zone. how far away is it from the control center. i had to use a repeater on my zones that are 50' away.
if you mean, does the alarm siren switch off after motion stops, the answer is no. the alarm will continue to sound for approximately 3-5 minutes or until someone enters the security code.
No
It depends on the monitor, it would have to have a double screen.
This camera is not a IP camera. Therfore cannot be added to a local network. However there is available freeware on the internet (search under 2.4ghz wireless camera viewer freeware) that would allow you to view the video feed directly on your computer if it has wireless network access capability.

As long as you can get the two pieces afforded to the fridge, it should work.
I just use it to control two lamp/bulb switches and a wall switch. There is no reason it would not work for receptacle outlets. As long as it is Zwave.
You just need the zee-wave remote and a zee-wave enabled dimmer- switch. I think most people will only need one remote and a few switches. If you go really overboard you have hundreds of devices and then you might want some central controller or relay.
It will work independently and will associate with your z-wave device(s), but if you do that, then the device won't work on your VeraLite network.
Yes you can have multiple remotes controlling the same light. Simply add node to first controller which will make this as a primary controller. Now , add second remote as secondary to this primary remote and transfer the network information. Instructions are described here: http://www.jascoproducts.com/support/manual-downloads/applications/DocumentLibraryManager/upload/45600-Manual-Eng.pdf . It might get a little confusing at first, but it should be very easy once you try it.
As far as I know, this is a booster for the alarm signal only. So, no.
Does this product have a 3 or 5 cd. Disc player?
This is a generic monitor and so it will fit perfectly 4 sure.. I've had no problem into my Santa Fe
I don't know
YES, IT IS ALL ONE PIECE AND FITS WELL
Sorry, I don't know...that's a different model than mine.
Yes. It is actually thicker and more comfortable than the original.
Sorry, I don't know...that's a different model than mine.
No. It doesn't.
No, it is a DVD player or you can charge your iPod. This is not a tablet
One end with carabiner to safely hook onto a fixture (ceiling or wall). The other end secured to an equipment e.g. a lightning. It is vertical with equipment downward, which counters the gravitational force.
Approximately 36", can't be positive as it is wrapped around my trolling motor and motor mount.
2 eyepieces. One 20mm correct image and One 10mm.
Sure... You must buy the ring adaptar for your dslr body i.e. Nikon, Canon,etc. And an adapter from that ring to the eyepiece diameter..
Sorry - no you can't hear the sound without either the headphones plugged in or the use of external speakers.
If you're buying one listed as new, headphones are included. If a used one, usually seller will say whether headphones included - read selller description of product.
If you're looking to watch 3D Blu-rays on your Samsung 3D-ready DLP, right now you are limited to purchasing a Panasonic 3D Blu-ray player that supports output in the "checkerboard" format (e.g. models bdt100, bdt300, bdt350 etc.) that's all you need besides your glasses and emitter setup. if you want to use other players, watch cable/dish 3D, or play 3D games (i.e. PS3) you will need a "checkerboard" adapter from Mitsubishi and you have to hack the EDID of your TV. do a Google search on that and you'll find what you need to get started.
Any answers? Probably something simple we're missing, but I have the same problem and can't figure it out either.
I got my "used-like-new" TV yesterday. The TV is still wrapped in adhesive plastic, and comes in the original box. As the name says it is like new. The delivery service was also good. Came 2 days before the estimated date. They came and verified that the TV is working. I am satisfied with the pruchase.
It has one. It acts as a headset, and BT audio.
You can go to the pioneer site and check, they have a system to punch in your vehicle and see if the head unit you want will fit. I use the Crutchfield site to see what head unit fits, http://www.crutchfield.com/index.html, then i punch the model number into google to check for prices. Amazons price, with free shipping, is about as good as it gets. Good Luck

I have a related arrrrgh. Was about to pull the trigger last night on the LN46a550 because of the $200 Samusung rebate. Got tied up and this morning it is gone? Is it typical for a rebate to come and go so quickly? As I recall, it was valid through end of October ?
i'm sure u can - look on the back of the TV and check the owner's manual to see - prolly a 15 pin cable - i'm having to use a Sony 26" Bravia TV becoz of Best Buy's expedient and quick (rme) service on my computer monitor.
I called customer support after many frustrating minutes trying to dub home videos to DVD. And it came down to the fact that the manual is incorrect! First, make sure the input is L1, and secondly, skip Step 7 on page 50 - do NOT press DVD after you pause the VCR - go straight to Dub. I assume you must have figured this out by now, but I want to put this on line so people can see the answer to their problem with dubbing.
They are releasing a Matte model, but is only in black has 3 hdmi ports instead of 4. It is model #lnxxa630. It has AMP and 120hz, 40,000 to 1 contrast and so on. I don't think it will have the ability to play videos though.
We just got our 46in Samsung 750 from 6ave without any problems. TV was packaged nicely and delivered timely. I had read their return policy prior to buying, so knew of the risks.
I was also wondering, as I got my tv yesterday and hi def time warner cable today. I also put it on 120hz. So, can anyone tell me when and how to benefit from this feature? Also would appeciate any recs on sound system- not too expensive to add to tv, and what to go with blue-ray or other high def DVD player..thanks.
According to cnet.com, Samsung's 5 Series TVs have a matte screen, unlike the glossy screens on the 6 and 7 Series TVs (not sure about the 8 and 9 Series TVs).
I have a 46" Samsung (previous generation) and it works incredibly well with my Wii thus far. No complaints on my 46" and I would imagine the technology has gotten better since then.
I have mine hooked to my Dish Network receiver, I just put the receiver on the channel I want to record from, I do have to change channels through the receiver for different programs, so I would say YES, you will need an external tuner. I do like this DVD recorder, I purchased another one for my bedroom.
It's the 34mm. I currently have it in my 2007 macbook pro, just remember to install the drivers.
Of course it can be used with Amazon Prime movie streaming. Just feed it a modern device like Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, or any number of modern Blu-Ray players with "Smart" built-in Apps allowing it. Your 2004 Panny Plasma does not have those features built-in to it.
Might drop *after* the Super Bowl. That's what I'm counting on. Prices have been going mostly up since Xmas. I'm waiting till after the game to get the 1080p plasma model. And a blue-ray player.
If your Mac accepts dual monitor output, which I'm not sure of, then it should be able to. Are you planning to connect a notebook or desktop?
have you had the buzzing noise from the beginning ? I have had mine for about 4 days now and i can stand right beside it and i hear no buzzing at all.
Yes it will power a lamp. I don't recommend using a light bulb over 75 watts. Plug the cord into the power inverter & you should have light just as you have in your home.
No. Component and hdmi.
You will need to check if your TV supports Wifi Adapters. If so then you will be able to use this adapter. But remember to check first with Sony. I suggest you go to Sony Web page and ask on the support section.
I would think you can get them through Gemmy? Try Gemmy.com
The MRV3500 is designed to handle up to a 27" TV. Later this month Ready America should introduce the MRV3510 which will handle up to a 37" TV Ready America, Inc. 800-959-4053
what else can use, only amd and intel cpu in the market now. this is the computer memory.
Just got the update and they appear to have fixed lots of stuff. I think they are learning and the ability to update the device without having to attach it to a computer means that it should just get better. If you have issues that are not being fixed, make sure you use the forums online and the report function on the device. The few times I contacted them I got some pretty quick responses.
It's about 13 bucks a month !!! Are you kidding me? I'll stick with my Navigon 7100 with FREE live traffic... and I'll keep doing that for a long long time...
It depends on the DVR system your using and not the camera. If you have this camera you would need a DVR recorder with capable iPhone app. I use a defender DVR with the ASee app and mine works great. Your probably looking for a complete system.
This item is a camera only. You'll need a dvr to hook the camera up to. At least that is my understanding. The plugs on the camera aren't the same kind of plugs that are on any mac I have seen. This camera is 700 tvl, so to take full advantage of the higher resolution, you'll have to spend at least $300 on an Hi Def DVR. I bought a DVR that is not HD, and I can't make out license plates from the cars passing 25 ft in front of my house.
I am pretty sure it will fit. I don't see any significant size changes from the earlier model which I have go for it!
I tested the floating strap in fresh water (a bucket) with an Olympus Stylus Tough 8000 camera. It floated just fine. At least one of the reviews said it floated in a swimming pool. The flotation is not super strong, so I imagine a strong current (like you would find in white water) could pull it under for some period of time. Not sure how it performs with other cameras, but it worked great when I took it to the Virgin Islands recently.
I'm not a technical person but I do know I've hooked up three 12s 1200watt subs and it holds up nicely never whimpers out and I've played all kinds of music....hope this helps in your decision
Ours locks to the window so either your suction cup is defective which could be checked by trying to lock it on a flat window or your windshield is curved or has some kind of coating on it like an antifoging agent.
12" long, 8 1/2" wide , at widest point, 3 3/8" thick, at thickest point
I am sorry Thomas, I do not know the answer to your question. As a side note, I must correct my previous statement regarding the Celestron Skymaster binoculars I purchased. I stated that they didn't open wide enough to be able to view properly through both eyes. I was WRONG! I discovered that they in fact do operate properly, and I am very happy with them. I will say that I should have purchased the tripod stand that was offered with them at the time. All the best, Jim M.
Nothing in the book or on the binoculars that say waterproof.
A little over a foot. But honestly these pads suck, they don't have a good strap down system. Spend more money and get something better.
This system comes with pads AND straps. The one reviewer must have either been confused as to which product he ordered or he received the wrong item. This package includes the FCS Premium tie-down straps with D-ring.
Oops...my green pair has a black band.
The headband on these are adjustable and they use a standard quarter inch headphone jack so they will work with all ipod/android products but there is no in-line remote on the cord.
Does it leak sound.... depends how deaf you are and how loud you listen to music. but for the most part unless its silent in the room and you are cranking the jams there is minimal residual sound.
not better than beats. but theyre decent.
You usually plug in headphones to the TV you have your PS3 connected to. So it depends if you have a place to plug in headphones on your TV/Monitor.
Yes, that is how I have it connected.
I believe so. I think it just goes off of what device is on at the moment. I have a DVD player connected to RCA and my converter box connected to the input coax. I turn on either one, and it works just fine.
That should work.
Yes I think so. There are RCA connections. I use it with the TV and an Ipod adapter.
Just a click when you press one or the other. It does not make any electronic beeps or noises.
No dividers were provided for my purchase.
I'd definitely recommend these sights. If I was going to do it again I would buy these sights again for sure
You only usually require a license (within the US) if you are transmitting. (ie. Amatuer/Ham Radio license license) This radio does not transmit, and the radio is only designed to receive radio broadcasts or transmissions. However, you may require a license to listen if you're within another Country. (ie. North Korea)
No compensation on this filter
Yes, this unit is easy to set up. I'm not sure how easy it is to do it how you have proposed though. I mean, you want to use AV cables into your DVD/VHS combo deck. That should be really easy. I don't believe that this DVD player supports an RF output though. Are you sure your Hitachi DVD just hasn't died? If it freezes, that means the little motor inside for the laser is probably stuck.
I have the nano 5th gen 16g and it works great!
If the cable/coax port in your apartment wall carries a cable tv signal (it works plugged into a tv), it'll work plugged into this card. You will need to get a coax cable if you don't already have one.
i dont recommended this sh... i threw away this sh... that day
This lens doesn't have internal focus motor, nor your camera body, so you wont get autofocus with this lens version. You need the version DX II http://www.amazon.com/dp/B007ORX8ME/ref=cm_sw_su_dp
Yes
By the product description. Second version has built-in focus motor. Physically though there is no difference from 1st version.
I can not answer your question mainly because I never did learn how to operate it successfully. That recorder was the absolute worst and most complecated machine I ever owned. If you have not purchased one yet you should make the store give you at least a two week free trail in your home. You may decide to purchase a different make. Mine still worked, but was so complicated I threw it away and purchased a Panasonic.
Yes! you can record TV when connected properly I got mine hooked to my cable box . cable box to TV . Different TV may have their on way you have to check the owners manual
No
No.
Take a look at the dimensional sketch showing the minimum height required between the mounting holes & the top of the tv. Depending on the position of the mounting holes in relation to the bracket, there may be a little distance between the top of the TV & the underside of the cabinet. The holes are also slotted to allow for some vertical adjustment.
The mount can only be tilt backwards to fold into the cabinet.
Mine came with 2gb ram. But as you know, you can upgrade it to 4gb.
Shouldn't be a problem. I have had everything under the sun hooked up to mine. You won't have any battery backup with this product however, just surge protection and power conditioning. Hope this helps.
Hi Steven. Are you referring to metal-oxide varistor (MOV)?
No it would have to be two MS32 for a seemless Background Sweep, the larger one measures L32" x W32" x H16", the smaller is L20" x W20" x H12", so you'll get a better 4 inch higher background if u go with 2 MS32's. http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/600446-REG/MyStudio_MS32CYC_MS32CYC_Seamless_Tabletop_Background.html
I agree the light is not bright enough for a lot of applications, I moved the subject closer to the light, finally broke down and just started using a speedlite rather than this overhead light bar. You might try using a lens hood on the camera to eliminate the glare. I can't say that I ever got a glare line on the background, and I used many, many combinations of additional lights to get good results.
EX-Series lenses Extended Service Protection is valid for a period of 4 years from the original date of purchase: 1 year America + 3 year U.S.A. extended service = 4 years You should check with Sigma about any geographical coverage questions. P.S. I still love this lens.
Sigma is an aftermarket brand that produces many lenses for assorted manufacturers. You have to buy the lens with the correct mount for your Nikon. Make sure it is the correct one for Nikons.if you do not already know the answer to the question that you asked I highly suggest you do a bit of research before purchasing the lens. if you get onn Sigma's website you can research which lenses are produced for which brand of cameras. I own this lens and use it on a Pentax k3.
To answer your question it does not have voltage control..it does have audio video high current filtration... and something called pure 3 circuitry witch filters the power coming in and prevents potentialy harmful spikes in the power source from getting to your connected equipment... if you want voltage control go with paramax power conditioners... I love this unit and I could tell a difference in sound and video when I set it up...I would buy it again if I needed a power conditioner...very nice unit for under 100 its worth every pinney!
Be sure you have the proper stick, and be sure its clear - i'd suggest formatting it and try again. It should hold hundreds of pics. Also be sure you are taking photos and not videos. They will take up much more space. You could fill it up with 17 videos pretty easily.
Yes it is because of the zoom the pictures come out great and the video setting is excellent as well
yes you can but to use 2 of them you need 2 pcie slots
According to the instructions it has both VESA 75 and VESA 100 mounting patterns
According to the instructions it has both VESA 75 and VESA 100 mounting patterns
Nicola- I would not think it should take that long. I don't see this order in my system so you must have ordered from someone else. Hope this helps. Lori at Polygraphics Products
Not sure what Pyle recommends, but I guess .75 - 1cuft per driver.
Don't think so, these are infrared, not Bluetooth.
I've never had any problems with reliability and stand by my original review.
The CCD-4xs will work with avic z 150bh. This camera is fantastic. It doesn't leak from car wash. Image quality far exceeds my expectations because of ccd sensor vs cmos. Color is vivid.
No it should be on when the car is running , and stay light afterwords for awhile , your not getting a current reading if it's not light up
Depends on your post diameter and distance apart. They are adjustable side to side by a little
The posts used to mount them as head restraint replacements have some adjustability. The specs should give you the adjustability range. If the head restraint supports in your truck are within that range and your head restraints are removable by the posts, then they can be installed in your truck. When I bought them for my wife's Saturn, I had to buy a special tool to remove the Saturn head restraints. After that, it was easy.
Yes , it's not needed if you use the template that comes with the speakers
There are 3 references to the inch/cm diameters. 6.5" is the actual diameter of the speaker, 8.3" is the diameter of the cut and 9.5" is the diameter of the speaker in it's entirety. the cm is the metric equivalent if you're so inclined. as to circumference of the diameters, take the diameter x pi (3.14)=Circumference. I hope this helps you understand the references...
Check the lens to see what size filter they require!
Not with this telescope's optic quality. With better quality telescopes it could be done, filters, clear sky, steady mount and tracking would improve chances.
It should be, because I have a frend who also has this flash and he has a d60. But if you want check Ken Rockwell's website to find out more. That is my source and Google of course.
Sorry, the answer is no. I use my PZ42X with alkaline batteries and have been happy with flash recycle and # of flashes per set of 4 AA batteries. I do not use it professionally. Use it at parties and family get togethers.
The flash does communicate with the camera; if you change settings on the camera, the flash responds. It also changes the angle of the flash coverage when you change the focal length (zoom in or out).
None
This is the canon version, hence the "C" on the end of the model. The nikon version is PZ42XN. The mount is different for Canons and Nikons. In terms of functionality and getting it to work, you simply mount it on and you can leave it in auto mode and you're ready to go. Of course you can experiment with the manual settings if you wish to get more experimental with your photography. This entry-level flash is great to experiment with bouncing since you can tilt and swivel it. Here is the Nikon version: http://www.amazon.com/PZ42X-Flash-Nikon-Digital-Cameras/dp/B0015A70SE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1371489827&sr=8-1&keywords=PZ42XN
Setting the switch to Dolby Pro Logic utilizes the Sub's built-in cross-over were Dolby Digital by-passes it and utilizes your receivers LFE filtering. You choose the mode, based of your receiver and the type of signal you are feeding it.
You need to hook an optical cable from the receiver to the TV. Then your Wii, Cable box, or any audio that runs through the TV will also run through the receiver. The HDMI is input only, not output for audio. Good Luck.
Hi, cover doesn't pop off on this Sony Headphones just like normal earbud type headphones. You may wipe it off by using a clean, dry cloth. -Ely
item us discontinued and no more available from Sony - i got this from retail for a very high price
Hi Jan, These aren't noise cancelling headphones. -Anthony
Some of the reviews say it has to be plugged in for the speakers to work.
Why? I would just use the headphone in the iPod.
I think it depends on the software using it. If the software can control exposure and white balance sure. Other wise no. It is just a dumb camera. I use it for Skype only so far. I do not try to take video pictures with it.
Yes. It installed with no issues on Win7 Pro x64.
For my double din Pioneer unit, It was complete. I installed mine in a 2013 jeep wrangler.
Yes.
I'm not familiar with this use.
Yes, mine was.
Think so , not sure.
You will need an adaptor as the pins are made for US wall outlets.
This is what is printed on the back: Battery Charger CB-2LY Input: 100v-240v AC 50/60Hz Output: 4.2v=0.7A From this it would appear it does.
it depends on the devices you want to charge. my iphone can charge on a 5 watt charger. but my ipad needs a 10 watt charger. the ipad will charge over 5 watts but it takes a lot longer. also, the rating is BETWEEN the two ports, so if you want to charge two iPhones together it will take twice as long over 5 watts. if you are trying to charge two iPads over 5 watts, it will take a LOT longer.
No, I thought the item was far too bulky to carry while travelling. In addition, you would need an international conversion plug and transformer as most overseas locations use 220 volts. Most travel converters say that they will handle upto 1800 watts, but they have only one plug outlet. I doubt that they would supply enough amperage to power three plugs and two USB connectors if you connected the Belkin surge protector into it. I had issues with this accepting power in Atlanta Hartsfield airport--not sure about the 180+ countries using 220 v.
Based on what you're mentioning - I'd go with the 2.1 Amp/10 Watt power strip myself. Many USB devices need at least 1 Amp these days, and 2.1 Amps will allow you to charge two at once. The 'Monster 'Outlet to go' is nice - but underpowered at 500 mA (0.5 Amp). Not sure how much your laptop needs to charge quickly - but many tablets need 10 Watts to properly charge.
Yes the wire covers are paintable and will blend in with the wall
It slips open. It is split along the length, and the two edges are curled to allow them to interlock when pressed together. When sealed, it looks like a tube.
I would say yes, but if they are in direct sun they may get brittle and discolor over time.
The CMK50 is much wider. I would estimate that the CMK50 is twice as wide as the CMK10, thus it allows multiple cables to be used in it.
Yes - go to this web page for more information: http://www.dinolite.us/mobile
I dont know the focal length but have used it succesfully from 2" from the specimen to 14". You should easily work with your hands between the specimen and scope. Focus takes a minute, and make sure you buy the articulating stand. Computer viewing is simple.
It definitely works with Windows XP; I'm not sure what you mean by..."to 9".
no
as far as I know it is not bluetooth compatible
Yes, it works fine. I do it all the time. The battery life is about 3 ot 4 hours
Yes it does.
Normally, the Nuvi series come with 6 TTS (text-to-speech) voices (3 male, 3 female). If yours doesn't have these, you can download them for free on the Garmin website.
No it doesnt,,At this time,,, An in order to get updates you need to buy updates,,, Garmin refuses to recognize old used units being resold for updates,,, I gave mine to my daughter to play with an I use my smartphone for GPS etc
I don't own this series, but since no one has answered your question, I'll try. The Topo maps appear when using 2D mode, not 3D (AFAIK). As far as photos (I've never used this feature on my Garmin), but I suspect you can take any picture you want and load it on your Garmin (just make sure they are small in size). Photo navigation I also haven't used. Check the Garmin manual (on line manual) for more info on this.
Yes, it came with everything, except the SD memory card that have to be buy it separately. Enjoy it!!!
They come with a wiring system. There's a red power and black negative. You have to wire to battery. They suggest to hook to a power source that is on only when keys are on to insure they don't stay on. But since each monitor has a power button I just wired right to battery red to positive and black to negitive. You'll need more wire than is provided. Ps I love them. Took me 15 per head rest to install
They are comparable with any vehicle that you can remove the head rests. I did it on my own. I did have to connect wires on my own. Plenty of videos on you tube to help as well. That's what I did.
Yes they can but each has independent RCA plugs. If you want then to be in sync, you'll need to purchase an RCA 'Y' adapter to connect the two video cables.
There's no need for a separate audio connection with this receiver. For a nonblu ray source it will accept and process any audio signal over HDMI. For blu ray, you'll need a player that decodes the new formats and outputs PCM.
I have a A2 and the DG720 and they work very well together!! TrueHD is amazing!!
S-Air is unique to Sony so, don't expect these to work with Samsung.
It auto syncs once you put the receiver card into the back of the receiver and turn it on.
digital optical cord
the rear speakers have wires connecting to a rear unit BUT the rear unit is not wired to the main system so they call it "wireless" but its really not...
Yes. From the technical details: Built In Decoder: Dolby Pro Logic II, Dolby Digital, DTS decoder
The instruction manual was not in the box when I received it. but my box was heavily damaged from shipping. I understand that can happen so it may be for you. if you decide to buy it feel free to ask me anything and I can help you set it up. it's very simple and I"ll be glad to help in any way I can.
It's nice how politics gets injected into every discussion...
It depends: if glass mounted about 5-6, if cardboard mounted about the double, thats my experience.
yes, the charger was compatible with the unit
The item that I purchased had the suction cup included.
I noticed in a review that it does have a bookmark feature on audio books if you exit directly to the main menu. It didn't say how to do that, but I assume it would be pressing the little button above the wheel. When you exit to the menu, it will ask you if you wish to bookmark.
You can listen to anything your compatible SiriusXM receiver and subscription allows. This is not a receiver. It is a speaker.
The system comes with certain adapters for xm/ Sirius devices. They are listed in the description.It is not a docking station for iPhone. It has a mini jack in the back for audio devices to be played through it . ie MP3 ; and smartphones. Just audio. No charging. System sounds good for size.
what do you mean? when does this happen ? what inputs and what mode are you on?
It's light weight makes it easy to move around, but, the weight of your camera may determine the need a heavier tripod. Pans with a heavy camera may be difficult.
They don't have volume control, plus i would recommend getting different earbuds instead, these earbuds aren't very good
It is one in the same.
Yes, these will fit all Shure SE model earphones (except SE102MPA). These tips are actually sold on the accessories page for the SE846 on Shure.com for a bit more reassurance!
Yes
In Inches: 9 1/4 wide, 7 1/4 tall, 3 3/4 deep.
This item is not available in black at this time. Sorry...
Doubtful. It did not work on my 2001 PC running XP. I bought the SIIG FireWire 2-Port PCIe (NN-E20012-S2) after this one. Works flawlessly on my 2012 PC running Win7.
I would look on line
i need a true slow motion dvd player. i am a dancer and need real slow motion.
It will play if you get a converter box. Those can be had for about $20. I would not recommend, however the HDMI connection on an older TV. You'll be wasting your money on the HDMI cable, where the regular component hookup will work just fine. For the older TV, I'd get the DVP-NS57p.
Yes. the 7-10 inch case will fit the asus t100. It is a tight fit at first but less so after a few uses.
SD or SDHD and yes you could take it walking with you, as long as you're walking where there are streets. I'm not sure how it would work if your talking about a stroll in the woods.
I use velcro to mount the bottom of the unit to the bottom of the instrument cluster. The hood of the instrument cluster will also block the sun. Try it.
Does this question refer to the optional battery? If it does then my experience is that attaching the battery and then plugging the printer into the AC does charge the battery. BTW this printer has done everything that I had hoped, including working wirelessly off of Bluetooth.
Yes it will
Sorry for not answering sooner. My TV has coaxial OUT and my sound system has digital IN. It won't work in your case. The reason I use this one is that TV has terrible sound and I get OTA programming; so I use my home theater to listen to the TVs sound.
I would say NO for the BU30 Bluetooth adapter requires printer adapters be loaded on the device it is using. I have not found this posible with mobile devices.
It does not have wires. But there are ports that you can connect wires to.
it should you will have to keep the button push until the door has been pushed or pulled how ever the door swing
If by motorized lock you mean a motorized door knob, no. It requires a manual door knob.
I'm sorry Larry...I don't know since I bought it as a gift for somebody else &#128559;
You must have gotten a bad speaker. I have exactly the same model bought in 2007. It still work fine even with the FM tuner. I never had a problem with it.
About 100W of continuous power
I don't understand the question !! What do you mean?
The port is on the bottom, and the pre-out SUB is where you would want to connect it. The feet on the sub hold it up plenty high for the bottom port to be functional.. In a small room, this is all the sub you need. our room is 16 x 18 with 2 open doors, still plenty of bass. it isnt the most refined sub, but properly adjusted it is not boomy either.
The listed price is for a single speaker. A pair would cost twice as much. However, having owned these and other speakers from comparable manufacturers, I can safely say that it's a steal.
12"W x 8"H x 5.5"D These were measured at the largest point (front) as there is some slight tapering in height and depth. This includes the grill.
Yes. With a very clean amp. I use a Pioneer Elite THX certified receiver, mod. VSX-09TX. The JBL's sound sweet and are very happy.
Dont know, sorry
Did just fine on the iphone 4s phones we had.
I have no idea, but I would think so. I put one in a lenovo laptop X60 if that's helpful.
No it will not it is a SATA drive you need to search for an IDE drive. That is the connection your computer has to connect to the hard drive, an IDE.
Probably it will. As long as it's a laptop, as in 2.5 inch, hard drive it should work.
Hi Olaf, check our Sony Boomboxes by going to this link,
It should fit it with no problem. My camera is a Canon Rebel T3i and there was plenty of room left over inside the bag for larger cameras. I thought it would be too much room, but I squeezed all of the air I could out of the bag before sealing it and this prevented my camera from moving in the bag at all. I think you'll be fine. Just be sure to do the no-camera test in your bathtub.
I am sorry. I do not know. but the instructions appear in English.
Mine didn't. The i1 pro did, but I already owned the Color Checker Passport and never needed the free charts.
No
Yes. I use it for sporting events and interviees. I believe work for you. It comes with a battery but on my 60d it gets power frim hot shoe.
Nav doesn't make a difference. The only thing that makes a difference is if you car is equipped with DSP. They make one for cars with and one for cars without. Model numbers are the same except for the DSP in the model number
Count me as wondering as well--I'm not going to buy it if it doesn't come with AC adaptor. The picture that someone posted shows it with one, or at least that's what it looks like to me.
CR2025 or CR2032
Yes, but don't buy this. It's garbage.
There is a UK version of the flip that has PAL TV output for Europe. It just started selling a couple of weeks ago. So that one's TV output should work on UK televisions. Check out: http://www.flipvideo.co.uk/index.html For viewing on a computer, any flip (US or UK) will work.
At the top of the camera on the side opposite the on/off button is a little trigger switch that flips up the USB plug-in. Plug this into your computer to recharge the battery. You can also download images into your computer via the USB.
I have owned a Flip Video Camera for about 5 years. It takes wonderful, clear videos. The sound is good also. It fits well on a tri-pod. I have been very pleased with the camera.
Yes, Flip videos are .avi files and they work fine with WMM.
They are three conductor. Stereo headsets with a built in mic such as Apple's EarPods will not have a functional mic.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAj9IUEBpac
Yes, it does.
I'm sorry, our inventory update says it is not available.
Yes, need an amp. This is a passive sub, small and really good.
Yes, instructions are included. It was simple to add two speaker wires across the back of the speaker.
Probably 12-14" ish.
As long as that is the only lens your going to use then yes. I can fit my D7000 w/grip and signs 150mm macro nicely but with any other lense.
Can't say for sure... mine was marked as being shipped and to arrive by Feb 17, 2015 but it still (now Mar 10) has not arrived and no further word on when it will get here.
It fits a pretty wide waist. I am a 38 and it fits fine, with plenty of room.
A class I Bluetooth has a range of 330 feet, were as a class II only has a range of 30 feet. Other then that, they are the same.
I do not know. I have only used it with Windows 7. Works fine.
No, the box is not tapered.
I would recommend standard Bluetooth headphones for the kindle.
Yes they don't get too loud. I've turned them all the way up and put them on. Other brands have been a lot louder. That being said, I still run them at 1/2 volume for my littler kids
you dont fix it - what you must do if you dont want a wide ratio u grab tape and turn the cam sideways. Logitech makes very cheap cameras, so im not surprised. i have the same exact camera as you and i dont have this problem, but since urs is faulty, just make due - not worth customer service headaches.
Mine just caught on fire... It had enough ventilation and an extra cooler...
I just bought this unit, so I can understand the question. It is really quite simple. There are three HDMI inputs and one HDMI output on the Onkyo HT-S5100 (also tons of other RCA, etc. inputs, no problem there!). The HDMI output feeds into the TV, of course. But I found I needed to connect a cable or an optical cable to the back of the TV in order to feed the audio back into the Onkyo amplifier. Now EVERYTHING sounds great!
As long as the jack on your tv is the standard headphone jack, it will.
That isn't this splitters function. One side is audio out. The other side is microphone in. I'm not sure what the Bluetooth input is, but I believe you need a splitter with two audio outputs. The kind that lets two people listen to something such as an iPod.
I actually think it would if I'm not mistaken. But I really don't know.
Normally I'd want to see the ports first but I think that should definitely work as long as the system has the audio in red and white ports
yes you can and to a car stereo too
If the PC speakers have RCA type jacks on them then this cable should work, but most PC speakers already have a cable that will plug directly into your computer. This cable would normally be used to connect the line output of your computer to a stereo amplifier or the output of an audio device such as a mixer or receiver to the line input of your computer.
The leather ones seal out the noise a little bit better, but the heat they (the leather) generate and the comfort of the velour ones more than makes up for it. And the velour ones seal out external noise very very well. To the point where you really need to be careful when walking across the street or out late at night in an unsafe area.
Yes
fixed. Cannot remove or add to the book.
Yes, the AC line cord is attached. No transformer is needed. It's stored in the battery compartment.
I have set up a Google Groups for the Acoustic Research version of the Infinite Radio (Audiovox owns both RCA and AR brands): http://groups.google.com/group/acoustic-research-arirc200-internet-radio
Yes, my Navigator came with a circular case for storage and travel.
this is challenging question if you don't describe what type of User interface you'd need for trading. this 3D mouse can be programmed to scroll screens very fast along 6 axis, so I guess you could handle lots of fast scrolling. it is used in 3D CAD tool to handle 3D objects with high accuracy of positioning.
I hope this one can help you. I've posted 2 products that you might be looking for. Visit: http://Healthtipsandbeyond.blogspot.com. Look for the one that titled electronics.
We apologize for this inconvenience. For assistance, please email support@satechi.com. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
I also wondered about a delay with this remote. I emailed Satechi and heard back from "Arthur". He said there is no ability for a 2-3 second delay. From what reviewers have said about this remote you may be able to hide the remote but take the pictures anyway because of the Radio Frequency.
I have never tried. I have a Samsung smart TV @ home and will let you know ASAP.
7200
Yes I have a pro and it's got a hard case on it, and it fits inside just fine!
Yes. the 7-10 inch case will fit the asus t100. It is a tight fit at first but less so after a few uses.
As many as your sd card will hold
The best way to do this is to purchase the In Wall IR receiver and it will hook up to the terminal block using cat 5 cable. Or you can buy the 20ft extension and put 2 of them together. They are a 3.5 male to 3.5 female ext cables.
Hi, I don't know for 60 Hz, but it's working for 50 Hz in an european country with a small adapter to support the 230 V :-) Otherwise this product is working flawlessly, I'm very happy with it !
This lens won't autofocus with a D3100, it requires an internal focusing motor D90/D7000. It will still operate on the D3100 just as a manual focus lens. No it doesn't have VR.
Correct.
yes because this converts a standard usb style plug to a mini B, though I am not familiar with the equipment you are using but basically you can run a usb power cable to this and then plug in to your mini B input and it should transfer both directions depending on how you are using it, hope that helps
Yes as long as your inputs/usb/sd card etc... fit together and function properly.
I don't think so
it does not...I made the mistake of buying one.
Here in the USA the standard voltage is 120V 60hz. Some other countries have a different standard. If you live in a country with a different standard, you can simply by a converter "plug" for less than $10.
Mike, comes ONLY as one speaker. However, speaker is powerful. I only need one to cover outside area.I also connect speaker to a zone splitter. I use this speaker with an outside 12ft inflatable TV screen in which I run a projection unit. This is great when entertainin watching baseball and football games.
I found that your camera according to the Sony site would be a NB-FG1 So the above battery will not work
It uses non-proprietary bluetooth (regular bluetooth often builtin to laptops.) I use two of them on two Win 7 laptops and have a brand new one still in the packaging for a backup since I did have one go bad within the warranty period but I couldn't wait for it so I bought one. I didn't think they were still available. :-)
No if its program already
I had the same thing happen I went to a auto sound and alarm place for cars and trucks and the guy there fixed it. Several buttons got pushed at once in my purse and turned the function off.. I do not know how to tell you to put it back but the guy at the car alarm place did it in a few seconds.. Good luck..
Yes it does
I believe all the TomTom mounts are the same, but I am not sure. We have 2 different models, and they both fit both mounts.
Yes, but the one I received fit very loose on the XL335. There was some "wiggle" in it. FYI - the rubber suction cup ripped off the first time I attempted to drive with it. Had to send it back...
Hi Cathy, yes there are 20 FM and 10 AM presets. From where I live the reception is good. I hope this helps!
I have my JVC vcr connected to my Sony. The picture isn't great, but then again it wasn't great on my Toshiba which the Sony replaced. I plan on swapping a Panansonic DVD/VCR recorder player for the JVC and using it's hdmi out port with the Sony. The Panasonic can output via hdmi from the vcr player and I assume that is about as good as a vcr can get.
Yes, my granddaughter uses it with an MP 3
Hi, plug is L-Type for this Sony Headphones. -Ely
Nope. And mine blew up after 5 min. in water. I thinks it's just waste
It's probably toast. My first aquabeat quit after a year, and I think the second one is on it's way out after a little over a year, even though I used it far less frequently than the first one.
I like swim with Speedo because my rutine is 60 minutes and is too boring without music
It's big enough for the thinner part of a MacBook charger, the end nearest your computer. If you also use the 3-prong attachment cord that goes from the converter box to the wall, you'll need 1/2 inch (I ordered both in order to cover the entire charger cable and protect it from the depredations of my cat.)
No; It needs a power cable.
Yes it fits in a psp. I believe this question was answered several times.
Yes it does. USB cord and headphones are included.
it uses a mini USB for charging and putting music on the device
it uses a mini USB for charging and putting music on the device
Yes, I have the PS3 Slim as well and have had no issues with this cleaner.
I bought the Naxa compact CD player for my granddaughter and don't remember seeing anywhere to attach a clip. My opinion is that the player is simply too big and clumsy to attach to clothing while your going for a walk. You need something smaller. Hope my answer has helped some . . . Sharon
Yes
Cannot say,...I don't have a T5i. If the T5i has a threaded fitting on its bottom side for the purpose of mounting it to a tripod, as do all other cameras I know of, then it will work fine.
Don't waste your money on this product. Mine stopped working in a couple of months. The company would not respond to me.
I just received mine today (April 30, 2014). It has the cord. This is a discontinued item, and I guess that's what's left. That's what the photo in the general listing shows. For some reason it's not the one in the big picture.
If anything upgrading to newer versions of OSX have made the problem worse for me. Apple has instituted a repair program https://www.apple.com/support/macbookpro-videoissues/ but your mileage will vary with these repairs. My laptop constantly runs with the fans on, even for just web browsing in Safari. Occasionally I work on a metal typewriter table and this laptop gets so hot, it actually warps the table I work on. This was the first and last Apple laptop I will own.
Brand new battery 0-1
It depends on how strong your signal is. In my case I have a booster on my TV and run a cable for 100' feet for my other TV. With one booster. I have a some what of strong signal. It works but I decided put another booster and It work great. Try one you can always buy another.
I have tried that logitech camera with xp , vista and windows 7 and had very poor performance from it and sooo I would not expect anything better with it using windows 8.I fyou can , buy the c-300 logitech camera and try it .I expect it to work with windows 8 as well as it did with all of the older windo versions.
No, I don't have any complaints from neighbors. I also have the ground plane kit which supposedly pushes the radio waves out towards the horizon, and helps with TVI. It also makes a difference in transmit and receive.
close to 11 pounds fully assembled
i think you will need larger u clamps. i think the clamps furnished with this antenna are made for standard 1 1/4" mast.
You will either need the installer code or power-reset the system in order to enter programming mode. Most common factory installer code is 4-1-1-2. You may need to enter 8-0-0 following the installer code to enter programming mode. When enrolling smoke detectors you must use zone 1 and know the *56 programming procedure.
The tweeters are infinity's own design. They have two little ears that allow the tweeter to twist lock into the main housing, of which there are two configurations, solid and swivel/positionable. I doubt it's a drop in for you, but possibly easy to retrofit, maybe even hot glue into place. I love these speakers, so making them fit is worth it to me.
It sure will !!! Good luck ! I hope you love it like we do !
I am not an expert in the light topic but I always play with my lights and flashes, I guess if you move them some way you will get a good result, but what I can tell you is that these are the best $20.00 I have ever spent ... just remember you really need the hot shoe to attach the lightscoop.
Yes when you plug the dc connector it disconnect the batteries. I verified it by inserting batteries and powering the system and playing music, I then insert the dc plug from the AC adapter whitout plugging the AC to the power outlet and the system shutdown until I plug the AC into the outlet.
Be careful here, Ian.... I'm as sure as I can be that this purchase is ONLY the transformer and NOT the hand tool shown with it.... If you buy this box, you will also need to buy the 12 volt handpiece to get the set-up as shown. Maybe you knew that....... Yes, this handpiece will handle 1/8" shanks--- I'd recommend the Proxxon adjustable chuck so you don't have to change chucks when you change shank sizes. Hope this helps.
I sincerely don't understand your question but I absolutely love my ClearStream antenna. I installed it inside and get the best HD picture ever. Get more than sufficient channels, all the basic stations plus movies, sports, pbs, Spanish and many more. Only on ONE TV. Downside: When I turn on the microwave or a plane fly over the home the picture goes away!
I cannot. It receives local channels, not channels which would be pay for view on cable. Although I do get excellent HD reception.
This is a standalone antena and is only a passive antenna. You can hook up a powered gain box to draw more channels if needed.
I have a Canon MKii & it works perfectly in remote mode so I would bet it will as well with Nikon
I had a similar problem trying to use it with a PANASONIC FZ200 (not sure what camera you have). Some reviewers claim it worked okay with their FZ200 but never worked correctly for me. I had to remove batteries to stop the LED flashing. I tried thre different units and gave up.
Sure, but since the impedance may not be matched you may experience muted bass or other distortions. If one computer's volume is turned up really loud you also risk burning out one of the computers' aux ports.
Hi Barbara, Sony KDL40S4100 TV doesn't support DMEx connection. -Vincent
2011
You need an HDMI cable. Here's one for less than $4: HDMI (2 meter) 6 foot cable HQ 1080P 1.3b
The screen is inside the case. Then wrapped in a box.
I'm not sure about transparent but for the money and being a automatic screen, it produces a wonderful picture. I have a Sony VPL-HW10, I have no complaint's for the price.
Just a cover plate that screws to the dash. It has rubber gaskets to seal it from the elements. I'm using it on my golf cart but will work well on a boat too.
It will fit on an attached flash unit on the hot shoe plate~ but not correctly on the pop up flash that is on the camera. This product does produce good images , but it is not made for the long run - plastic belt loops that Velcro straps go through are very easy to come off. I bought it in a time \ money crunch~ it gave me some great images for about 3 shoots including weddings, it paid for itself ~I don't regret the purchase but I am now looking for a more durable one.
No, it is a piece of crap plastic that fits around the end of your speed light. It broke while putting it on and seller did not reply to my email. Don't waste your money, you can make this with a sheer piece of cloth and styrofoam cup, and it's about as sturdy.
My system came with a cd, one camera, plug in battery (charger) for the camera, a plug in for your computer and two difference types of stands. This system runs off your computer or laptop. The monitoring system will hold up to 6 cameras.
Yes it will work on the Nikon D5100 since it has hsm which is the built in af motor. Make sure you order the correct lens mount.
Yes. The one that is labeled in the description as "for Canon" .
The only thing I can think to try is turn off your auto focus to see if that helps. Good luck
It worked with an iPhone 4S, so i can see no reason why it would not work with the ipod touch, 4th generation.
yes it comes with a short piece of coax cable to link it to the dish
The description says 2 meters. That would be 78.74 inches. However I measured mine (twice) and it is only 72.75 inches. Looks like they converted a 6 ft. cable to meters and rounded it off (not very accurately) to 2 meters. Note that this has a male DVI plug, not a VGA which is all many older computers have.
I had the same issue on my Sony TV until I changed the TV output to 'Audio System' rather than front speakers. Have a look in your TV settings
Not this model, the connector is different. However,I do believe there is a Satechi ntervalmeter suited for your rebel.
I have never tried anything beyond 1024x768.
yes, it's as shown in the image
No!
I would say yes. I have my outdoor antenna connected to two tv's with this splitter and they work just fine.
No mount. Has a typical u-bolt/saddle for bolting to a small mast.
Yes it can charge 2 phones at the same time. With some cases you'll need an adapter.
Yes
Yes
Yes it can be continuous but your speakers have a lot to do with it, what's the rating on your speaker watts rms and peak your speakers should always be rated higher than the amp 300watt amp 600watt or higher speaker
Its universal....i think it should...it is adjustable too
I don't thank that you could use this one for what you are trying to do. You would need a splitter that would go from (1) source in and send it to 2,3 or 4 out, as would the # VPHDMI04 is a 4 way for 4 tv. sets from one computer. Using HDMI cables you could see the computer on all 4sets. you would not have control at the 4 sets. The computer would be the only place that you could control all 4. AT Amazon.
I do not think so :(
You can use the little plastic stand that came with your flash. Just screw it to the stud that the clamp comes with.
Yes. There are many uses for this product. Love it and thinking about getting another one.
Not sure what you mean. The stud holds the clamp. The clamp can be moved if it is not tightened onto the stud. If you are at all serious about photography or videography you need at least a few of these. I promise you'll find more uses for them then you could have imagined.
yes. my connection is from a directv setup and I use it to record football games and tv shows. couldn't be easier. I use the component video with a separate digital audio cable from the directv reciever to get high def sound with the video. you can use editing software to remove commercials easily and either burn to dvd or as jr says below replay the files anytime to your tv using a media player -- add a cheap external drive to store and you never have to keep up with DVD again.
**edit** They linked the wrong product sorry; you connect the A/V cables to the TV, and then the USB cable to a PC. The PC stores the video files. You'd have to stream the video from your computer to the television.
Works with my DirecTV/DVR. No reason it won't work with yours. It should work to convert any infra-red signal remote to RF.
Yes if you have a 3.5 microphone jack and have a left & right channel input.
Hi Nancy, Call ISO Pure Water @ 877-541-6603. The replacement bulb is $37.80 US for WUV lamp 12
No it has to be mounted Horizontally and you have to have Three feet clearance on one side to be able to pull the bulb out to change it.
They are wired
These are not wireless speakers.
Yes, the mounting brackets come with the speakers.
These are not wireless speakers.
Barbara, you will need to call Dish, they can tell you what you need.
Tivo 3 should support just about any eSATA drive Tivo HD will only support the WD DVR Expander out of the box. They can be hacked to use any drive, but it voids the warranty. There is supposedly a file limitation with Tivos that doesn't allow them to read more than about 1.2TB of space. Whether this will be updated is unknown. The SA 8300HD supports regular eSATA drives, but there are some models that just don't work.
It is good enough for casual recording and youtube quality. If you want better quality, you need to consider Vado HD which is more expensive.
I had to hunt around on the web because at first I got no audio when playing it on my Macbook. I found out you need to get the free download of Perian so that it will playback in quicktime.
The "Shuffle" option plays the exact same playlist each time the Soundfly is powered on. Mine begins with 1638, 1759, 1829, 0603, 0528, 1537, 1534, etc. Is there any way to change this order? It's sad to have over 2000 songs on a 16GB SD card and hear the same songs over and over (and over, and over). I can't believe a product that is excellent in so many ways could be lacking a way to randomize songs. I wouldn't like this with audio books, but for music I would think it's preferred. Thanks!
I am using this antenna with a GPRS modem (800 mhz and 1800 mhz) so I guess it supported
Those are not included an would need to be purchased separately.
No
it comes with what they describe as shelf mounts according to the box
Not to worry. All modern Audio/Video receivers can handle 4-16 ohm speakers with no degradation in sound quality. The most you will experience is a 1 or 2 DB drop in the cc speaker which is almost inaudible.
Seriously? This place is asking $2382 for a single Tsi500 when their MSRP is only $399? Have two new units, will sell for $500 (pair). You pay shipping.
David, You can create some type of shelf to place the speaker on. Eric C
400w amp just leave the amp on normal. You want more power than less power
Yes ....you can install it your self but locating the crossover is the problem..... Just keep it away from the window motor and you'll be all set!......the next best thing to Bose!....enjoy!:)
I love this TV. It was a purchase of a lifetime for me. However, I NEVER could get the guide working properly. My cable system has it's own guide system, but sometime, I just want to watch just the TV, and use their guide. It keeps telling me that the guide is downloading overnight, but the next day, there is still NO guide information on the screen. If you got yours working, please tell me how you did it. Thanks "Emil"
Yes
The Sigma 50mm f/1,4, as sent from the factory, comes with both caps, a generous hood and a sturdy cubic, or virtually cubic, lens case. IMHO, this lens is excellent value for the money and performs exceptionally well. I own one of these lenses and would recommend this lens to a close friend. Good shooting!
Idk
the one I got Is 6.5x31. I got it in the past two months and am very pleased with it.
Amps x Volts = watts 1000 watts 120 volts = 8.33 Amps
If I had to pick one, it'll be the D2 because of sound quality and how the SD card integrates into the library. Checkout "anythingbutipod" website for reviews on wide variety of MP3 players.
In LINUX (and WIN) it shows-up as a drive. Just drag-and-drop your files, using any file manager. There is no need to install any software/program/drivers. This is the only "serious" player I've found, that works this way. Checkout the manufacturer's web site to be sure that it'll work w/Apple. This is a good quality unit - plays everything (almost) w/50+ hour run time!
I haven't had my lenses fog up at all and had them out in the rain and snow several times so I know they are waterproof. They do amazing for me

These speakers have no amp built in; they are just speakers. They also happen to be great speakers. You can connect them to a computer using a computer sound amplifier system or you can use a stereo receiver, but whatever you use must have connectors for plain speaker wire and can't be hard-wired to its own speakers. I use four of these TSi-100s connected to a Logitech Z-5500 speaker system, and I couldn't be happier.
I'm Not sure but you must not connect items that can overload the circuit. The total amperage of all wall plugs are usually 20 Amps and that includes all plugs connected to the circuit breaker and this includes the wall tap in question. including the connections to this wall tap.
I think SU version also has USB and eSATA and original one has only USB
I haven't actually used the tuner. I have four vintage Norman Lab floor speakers and a new Polk subwoofer attached. The amp is powering them just fine although you will need some high end/heavy duty speaker wire if the speakers are very far from the amp.
It does not have a headphone amp built in so I would not trust it. Asus however has a different model sound card that is basically the exact same as this card but has built in headphone amp. I believe it's the Xonar DGX GX2.5 model, so check that one out.
The warranty on the ASUS PCI-e x1 sound card is: Limited Warranty: 36 months parts; 36 months labor
Hey Brian, when you say continuous do you mean sometimes it will sweep up and down when you hold it and sometimes it won't ? Definitely a strange issue, hard to say if the remote would be at fault or the receiver, try battery change and see if it helps, good luck
on further thought i think patrick and connie are both right with regard to my suggestion. what i might add is run the hdmi to your tv...if your tv has an audio out (audio monitor out) run that to an input on the 3490. i agree that the headphone out on the LT is likely too low of level to drive the 3490
There is no cord :)
With a MAC I would try to get a ready made cable from apple..Customer service can't blame your problem on another manufacturer..It's all their stuff.. I don't like adapters. They introduce another source of resistance , they stick out further {bump into stuff, especially with portable devices], and any device with cable management they may not fit. TV/Monitors with a cable trough and a cover to route cables together..Anyway, I'd get it from AMAZON. You can send it back.
I have not used it for 3D, I would bet that it would support 3D as well
Hi, I looked up the specs on the modem and it should work as it supports DSL/VDSL modems.
Sorry, I have no idea. What is the issue you need to address?
This camera will fit all Olympus lenses. However, an adapter is required for Olympus's old glass, and the characteristics of the lens will change. Old Oly cameras (film) were a 35mm format, of course, and the sensor on this camera is much smaller. And they won't auto-focus. Also, an adapter of a different sort would be required for Olympus's newer lenses for the PEN and OM-D cameras.
Its similair, but doesn't take video..
Got one right here...Looks like 2 3/8" depth. Be aware, the speaker protrudes in the front more than most speakers - especially the tweeter. This may be an issue for you if you are not using the Infinity speaker grilles.
Go to crutchfield and enter your vehicle info
If it's a 6.5" speaker opening with reasonable space then yes. Or, if it's a 6x9 opening and you buy an adapter. I dont' know exactly how much top and bottom mount depth you have but I'd say if it's a shallow mounting area then these are probably best to avoid.
I believe it will. It seems as if the Lumix DMC-TZ5P-K and Lumix DMC-TZ5 is the same camera. And it fits my Lumix DMC-TZ5 nicely :-)
Yes
Yes.
Miss Harper I own these three items and they work on my Sony Walkman just fine, as far as a 32 bit I cannot tell you. I don't know if it will or wont, the set is not very costly If I were you and you can afford it go ahead and buy it you can always send it back and ask amazon what will work. Thank you for your time. If I can be any more help please write me. Mike.
YES IT DOES.
This would depend on how often you open the safe. I charge about once a month just as a routine. The safe will beep to let you know if the charge is getting low. I charge routinely so it doesn't start beeping at 2 AM.
google logic safe 20710 manual. it is on the web
It will fit any camera, but the legs are so short that your lens on the camera must be short also. Otherwise it will tip the tripod over.
Approx 1 1/4" x 1 1/2"
This burner does burn light scribe on a Mac computer
No, it is not. I could not get the Mac computer to recognize it.
Nope. My Vivobook is either 15.4 or 15.6. It doesnt fit in the laptop compartment, but does fit in the main pocket. Get a bigger bag.
I know that mountain lion cannot be installed on this older model.. I do not know for sure on maverick.
Yes, I just upgraded my inspiron 530 to this E8400 processor. It worked well, just make sure after you install it to run "search for new devices option". If it doesn't find the new processor, just delete the driver for the old processor and it will recognize the new one.
mine didnt last a year with only minor usage. warranty is only good if you buy from a certified reseller. Not that durable. I bought mine from Westbiz which is not a reseller. i did not know this at first. when the left ear fell apart, neither Amazon or Wesbiz would not honor the warranty and the manufacturer would not honor the warranty because Westbiz is not a reseller. I would suggest you not buy anything from a non certified reseller or Amazon.
Remember to set the drive on the camera to remote. I have a Canon 60d and I have to set the drive to either 2 or 10 second self timer/remote. Also, make sure you're pointing the remote towards the sensor on the front of the camera, it won't work from behind. Lastly, only the top two buttons work on my Canon. Good luck!
yes but you need to install drivers first
In my opinion No. Will be tight to fit it all in with the adapters and wires
No. It does not work with my 4s and I bet it doesn't work with the 5, or any other iPhone. There is no app to send photos to it. Instead look at the Canon Selphy CP900 or similar printer. A battery pack can be bought for it and the photos are superior in quality (IMO). The CP900 has a native iOS app, though there is some cropping when printing from an iPhone. Also, I found the Zink printers to be streak prone.
no it will not
Mine is connected to a WIFI Router. You can connect up to 4 different things at the same time.
9 volts 0.6 amps
I used it on my unibody macbook (not pro) 2008 13" - I think these have the same body so it's likely it would work. But I can't be 100% sure.
It is not generic. Hitachi/LG are OEM drives for Apple
No, this drive will not work in a Unibody MacBook Pro. This drive is for MBP's up to early 2009 only.
I bought these and CD's/DVD's fit fine. Actual size is 4+7/8's x 4+7/8's
Don't know. What I do know is that ALL of the various Manfrotto/Bogen quick release plates fit ONLY ONE holder. They seem designed to absolutely not fit anything else.
I just tried it and it worked fine with my 2.5inch SS laptop HDD. If you notice on the image it has a gap for a 2.5 inch drive (top left). The larger overall footprint swings in to allow for traditional 3.5 inch drive. Does this answer your question?
Its Auto Switching so you should be fine
I was just about to post the same question. I really don't want to run an ethernet line over to the player. I've looked at wireless access points but they're not much cheaper than a full blown router. I'm starting to think I'll end up with another wireless router (with 4 or more ports) to use as a bridge to my existing wireless lan. I just really don't want to spend upwards of $100 just to get bdlive.
This is an auxiliary card, it does not hook to a cigarette lighter.Both ends are the same. One end goes into the auxiliary and the other into whatever device your hooking to it..
Extremely quiet. If your running stock then switch to this, your ears will fill with golden silence .
I think you should go for the pair! Only one speaker will give you a mono sound, get the pair and listen to your digital piano in stereo, nothing is going to beat that sound!
Definitive Technology's own specs says it's 14.75 x 5 x 5 inches. It's only properly shown here under 'Technical Specifications'. I'll contact Amazon and hope that they fix the numerous errors.
1/4. The more direct the better.
Yes, comes molded into the base with 15 feet of coax and PL-259 connector on the end.
That's a computer question, not camera. The camera will operate as long as the computer keeps it online.
Yes. There is a whole bunch of nice options there, crop, decorate. We printed pics right at our wedding and they came out great. The only set back is the ink doesn't last long, so I would stock up on that.
When I received mine, it was plug n play, pulled old out and the new one was the exact same thing.. So im assuming it does
Considering that it won't fit the tv it is designed for it probably won't fit yours either even if it is supposed to be compatable. I compared this lamp to the one I removed and it looked and measured identical, thought it just needed a little push to slide all the way it, that snapped the electrical connector mount in the tv. Tv ruined !!
I do sell the original philips OEM lamp for $189.99
Yes
No. This is a lot like a Polaroid. It's instant, not digital.
It has the standard photography mounting screw/thread and should work flawlessly.
The beep let's you know when the flash has recharged.
Yes but I will use the sandbag just for safety
Well, since you don't say which receiver or which subwoofer you are talking about, the answer is "No, you can't".
I had the same problem but solution was to by a new 3d blue ray Player (Panasonic) with 2 hdmi OUT. assign 1 for TV out the other for audio out only (this connects to your 876) and you're ready to watch 3d with full audio advantage. no need to upgrade AV-receiver since the 876 sounds amazing. Tarzan
Yes it does. We have owned this receiver for several months now and are very pleased.
The Onkyo TX-8255 has a built-in pre-amp for a dynamic pick-up and should not require an external pre-amp. The phono input is clearly marked and is grounded through the shield in the out put cables from the phono. An external ground is not required unless the phono output cables are compromised.
According to the warranty card, the warranty period is 2 yrs parts and labor from date of purchase. The url for warranty info is www.us.onkyo.com/warranty.cfm, or 800-229-1687
You need a 1/8" stereo to a dual phono (RCA). Plug the two RCA into the back, like in the tape inputs since most people don't use that one. Then change the receiver to the tape and plug the 1/8" stereo into the headphone jack of any phone or iPod or music player. You can get that cable almost anywhere, on Amazon or at radio shack or Walmart
I've bridged the fronts but I haven't tried bi-amping. I think either would be better for 2 channel music, for 5 channel the speakers are level matched with the audyysey which would negate any extra power anyway. I thought I noticed improvements with bridging especially in the bass response, but since my front speakers are rated at 125 watts I thought I better not push it and went back to a regular connection.
yes

Maybe a speaker bar? If not then I wouldn't buy Bose, but rather Infinity or Polk.
I would suggest checking with Onkyo Tech Support. Hope that helps! Good luck!
yes - 2 years....mine is over a year old and I use it daily - excellent
I don't think you can. I did hook up a non-powered subwoofer with an old amp but was never really happy with the sound. This Onkyo receiver has very poor bass response in my opinion. Sorry I am no help.
No, you don't have to disconnect the battery. At least, I didn't, and haven't had any trouble with it. This is on my 2005 BMW 330xi -e46. Good luck!!!

Someone answer please. I want to know too. I'm having a hard time finding one!
Extension tubes are best used with a short fixed lens they go between the camera and the lens giving greater distance from the sensor thus greater magification, they don't work well with longer lenses or telephoto lenses. You also need to have a camera that has the ability to allow you to change lenses. Macro filters work best with longer lenses and telephoto lenses as the longer lenses length intensifies their magnification its best to get fairly good macro lenses I have these and they work well but macro lenses can effect IQ hope this helps you decide
These filters will work with any standard lens as long as you have a step down ring adaptor 58mm down to 50mm to attach to the filters
I got these to fit my Canon Rebel T3i , I do not know what other camera they would fit sorry good luck.
The Pentax has a manual exposure, most film cameras if not all, are manual.
Three pairs of these work great in our 2010 Ford Expedition. My answer for your question is "Highly likely."
Yes, back in that year 2010 Bluetooth integration was starting to be use within automobiles. Your vehicle if came with DVD from factory installed, your DVD player was an IF (infrared). Whether it has A or B Chanel I do not recall, however this headsets are great and they do have option of dual Chanel's, a&b. You are safe with these model of audiovox. Great quality and they do what they are made for. Hope this helps.
Wicked easy. Takes two AAA batteries. You pop open the compartment on one of the headphones and put them in. No screwdriver needed. I keep extra AAA batts on the truck and can change them on the go easily. These headphones are great same as the ones the dealership have for 80$!
Yes it does have an S-video out connection in the back
Hi: What do you mean flat? The book open up to each page that has 2 slots that the pictures go into. The other side also has 2 slots. Did this help you? Please let me know. Thank you
The album itself is about 10.5x11.5
The Audiovox Wireless headset should work with your 2009 Chevy Traverse. These headsets are universal. They work great with my 2007 Honda Odyssey. Plus, no programming is need. Just, add the batteries and turn on. I hope this helps!
It allows you to control how much bass and power you want to push to your subs with out turning up the bass on your head unit. It works great. Best thing I have installed. Saves life on subs.
The sub woofer has a RCA type plug in jack.
They are not pre-wired. You can use existing wire.
I have the packet in front of me. Here are the 12 they say it supports: T-Flash, Micro SD, Micro SDHC, SD, SDHC, mini SD, MMC, MMC Plus, RS-MMC, MMC Mobile, MS, Memory Stick Pro, Memory Stick Duo, MS Pro Duo. I do not see SD XC. But, perhaps that media was invented after the device was and may still work. Have you tried going to Iomega web page to see what devices support the card? www.iogear.com My model number for iogear is GFR209 in case that helps.
I own the Think Pad T430s. It holds it perfectly.
Probably not. The one I bought did not even come close to fitting mine, but the shipping cost to return it was more than the battery was worth. Don't waste your money. This company just reaches into a bin and grabs a battery, whether it is for your device or not. If I could rate the company, it would be minus five stars.
Well, my power supply blew about 1.5 years after I bought it. Had it repaired and no issues since. Local TV repair shop guy said they use crap power supplies.
not really. If you're inputting S-video, you'll have to use another connection port or use an adapter. Otherwise, it has basically everything a television has.
Supply and demand. This fits nicely on most desks and kitchen/bedroom areas. The T260HD maybe too big for those areas and not selling as well, therefore a price drop. Beauty of capitalism
I just purchased one in Best Buy yesterday with no problems.
Firstly, it is not a video soft box, so it is not vented for cooling and would likely shrink wrap itself to your light and or melt. Secondly, for this price you should know automatically that it has no lamp. And third, it's in the description, read. Now as for "what should purchase to go with" , buy a video light kit, or set up regular flood lights bounced off white reflectors or adjacent walls or ceilings.
yes it does.
No, you have to buy those separately
You may need an adapter to securely hold the 4 socket. i am using this one with it "Studiohut L-Bracket Speedlight Flash Mount with adjustable cold shoe for Bowen Style Softboxes", which will give it extra support. I fear that if I screw the softbox directly on the 4 socket, it may not be enough support. Good luck.
About 2 feet! I would not buy it, its not worth $99 perhaps $45 for this quality!
good
Any EF mount camera, so yes. Wouldn't recommend this lens though.
I am sure it can but I am not up on building codes. Seems like the package said it could be used inside. The only comment I have is that the weather proof nature of the cable makes it not quite as flexible as plain indoor cable. Hope that helps!
If the TV supports VGA to HD format go with the straight VGA cable. Worked from my IBM Thinkpad with Ubuntu to my Samsung 32" no problem and no additional hardware to buy.
i use internet explorer 9, google chrome version 12 the latest version as of june 30 2011 and firefox 5 running on windows 7 home premium, service pack 1, back button works fine.
It's just a regular plug and play USB mouse, so it'd be compatible with any major OS.
The service tag represents your original laptop configuration. That configuration stays the same unless you add new hardware you purchased from Dell. If you buy something from someone else, and install it, the service tag info doesn't change. I suggest you go to Dell support, enter the service tag and review your original equipment list. Find the original laptop battery in that list and get the specs from Dell, and then go wherever you want to get a new battery, or simply buy it from Dell.
You can do both. It comes with a adapter that plugs into the MB or you can just run it out side if you want.
From what I read it it 59.1 inches http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/549247-REG/Sigma_728101_120_400mm_f_4_5_5_6_DG_OS.html
yes
Check with the company that sells the backgrounds. I think I remember seeing the green ones.
Hi Orlando, Sony VGPBPS13B/B Battery Pack is compatible with Sony FW100 series VAIO computers. -Vincent
i don't know.
The orange Visible Dust swabs are made for sensors without low pass filters. They cost more but they work.
I'm not an expert, but I'm 99% sure the answer is "no". PAL and NTSC models appear to always be separate and numbered separately and sold in their respective markets. This is a "search the Internet" type question, looking for maybe some kind of converter than takes an NTSC signal and modifies it for PAL playback (if that's possible).
not sure, I would just try to contact them.
No its set and not adjustable. Cant remember what temperature it starts at but I think it was 85
It's just under 9.5 inches long, (or wide), by 4.5 inches high, by 6 inches deep which doesn't include the protruding front dials nor the protruding AC cable, and antenna connections in the back of the cabinet. That's just the dimensions of the cabinet itself.
Pere there site - Will my Zune HD work with this unit? The NS108B will charge and play media content, but since the NS108B was designed before the release of the Zune HD, Radio and Remote Control functions are not compatible with this model.

I didn't try the item outdoors. Frankly, it stopped working after a few times that I used it. Range wasn't all that good to begin with. I would not buy this product.
Order them from Digi customer service. I think shippong is free if you choose standard delivery which is 5-7 days but typically delivery is faster than they say. This company has great customer service!
Yes. Its pretty durable. Mine was actually knocked it to my salt water pool. It was there for a few hours before I discovered it was missing. I pulled out. Let it dry, and its charging away as we speak. The only problem that I had is that there is no indicator as to when your batteries are fully charged.
No batteries come with this charger.
Piece of crap!! Save your money.
no.
On many of them it is Alexander Scorbbie. He is the best there is. Another good reader is a Mr. Johnson. I have Scorbbie on mine. He started the GoBible.

It should work, the board is supposed to support a pentium in the LGA 775 socket. I have run a Celeron and a core 2 duo and it worked fine. Not many expansion slots on this board but it does OK for normal use.
Yes, pci-e 3.0 is backwards compatible to pci-e 1.0, so a pci-e 3.0 video card will work in any pci-e slot. The only caveat is that it will only negotiate the highest bandwidth that the motherboard will support, so a pci-e 3.0 card will not run at 3.0 bandwidth in a 1.0 slot.
it has some cables like a few ATA hard drive cables..
No
You usually plug in headphones to the TV you have your PS3 connected to. So it depends if you have a place to plug in headphones on your TV/Monitor.
Of course you mean 192 kHz. I don't know if Pioneer just forgot to list that mode, or if they were referring to the Blu-ray spec which only supports multi-channel, uncompressed PCM up to 96 kHz. But the PS3 lists all modes which the connected HDMI device reports support for. The last one listed is "Linear PCM 7.1 Ch. 192 kHz", so support is there. Now, just find some content with that level of audio.
I believe it will.
I know nothing about max resolutions, but I don't see why VGA isn't just VGA. And you have to push the button.
My 5" screen fits just right.
You can find quick release plates at http://www.dmkfoto.com/Pair_of_Quick_Release_Plates_WF_p/2160.htm
Yes
unknown. the voltage and amps are correct but I have no info on the g60's connector size or configuration.
I used it for my A500..and I believe it will work in all Sony alpha dslrs..better yet check your Sony dealer.I love this flsh .
Yes
I regret to inform you I have moved on to Nikon. I don't have a good answer for you. My apologize.
http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/259328-28-upgrading-asus-p5bw-board look here probly wont work
I've never heard of a Dell having a Foxconn motherboard, but the E8600 will work fine in the G33M02 board.
It's an 8mm non-tapered smooth shaft. If you're using Elinchrom 7mm then you may want to try photek softlighter II umbrellas.
owning both of them i can tell you that the difference between both is HUGE, if you are a pro and really make your living out of photography i say go for it- the controls are a bit different since now you have a wheel to move thru the menus but you will love it once you get used to, it comes with its own stofen-like diffuser and color gel holder since the latest nikon cameras can detect the color of the gel used and then modify the white balance
I don't have *10 but It works good with my Nikon D610
The price is incorrect ,yes not right
It should not be. MSRP of the 550G is 69.99 and the MSRP of the 450G is 49.99. I would go with the BE550G if it's cheaper.
Yes it will.
As near as I can tell it is the same. Note: Canon came out with a new version of the same 55-250 lens with an STM motor so the older IS II version can be found for a good price. I am happy with my 55-250 IS II.
Of course it will work with Canon EOS Rebel t3i. I do have a t3i and use it on a regular basis. Very good lense for day time but poor in low light.
Yes, if you buy the camera in the retail box, you will get the recharger.
Not on mine, it is an older model But with a newer one it might
Not sure of question=
Did everyone try charging the unit while it is powered off? It seems to make a different to me. I bought three(3) and so far all battery seemed to be decently averaged out around 2.5 hours or so (mainly net surfing and video conferencing) after few months of usage. Power on while charging seems like charges don't hold too well even it shows 100% charged. Try it out...it may make some different.
I have a related question. My primary use for it would be to read technical PDF files (with equations and color figures). The screen size at 10.1 " and 1000x600 resolution seems quite good, but I would like to know if anyone has compared it to the HP Mini-Note which has a 1280x768 resolution, but at a 8.9" screen size.
My guess is Microsoft is subsidizing it. They don't want people leaving Windows for any reason. In the long run controlling the market is more important to them, so if they have to they will pay people to use Windows. This is a guess though. I'd be interested to hear from somebody at Amazon why the pricing is going this way.
Open Office can read MS Office documents (to some extent, they sometimes dont render/save perfectly). MS Office has plugins for Open Office formats as well which I would recommend using.
Try this. I have no idea how well it works, though. http://www.linux.com/base/ldp/howto/Chinese-HOWTO-4.html

I used with poweshot s750 and worked great
I am sorry I can't help you with this one. However, the battery I did purchase is still doing its job.
i don t know. not working for mine: vgn ar51m
Mine fit perfectly in my VGN 630/W ... Had do research a lot of cross-references....
Actually, these drives are pre-formated for NTFS. If you use the WD Data Lifeguard Tools software, you can quick format the disk in 60 seconds. And you can format it as either as bootable or as a secondary drive. I don't "think" you got a reused drive.
I found that the drives are several years old. I bought a bunch of them (10+) it was a mistake. I tried to get warranty from WD and they did not honor the 5 year warranty and in fact when I returned the drive, they claimed it wasn't manufactured by them. I ended up returning the drive to the seller for a replacement. Don't count on the 5 year warranty, better yet buy it from another manufacturer. I've had too many failures of WD drives in the last year or two. I have switched to Seagate.
from some quick googling I guess it looks like it is, I don't remember mind being called that though
I've been installing car audio for over 20years and in that time listened to many component speakers. The Polk MM series is astounding in the clarity and bass response. I just got this set for my personal truck. I suggest using a 75-100RMS watt per channel amp.
If you do not already know the answer to that question, then please immediately put your equipment back in the box and run to your local stereo installer
Yes these speakers come with a crossover. The speaker is a coaxial, and the main driver and tweeter have separate connections. The crossover has a single input from the stereo amp, and two outputs to go to the main driver and tweeter.
Comes as one item .
HDMI is digital so it's not susceptible to interference. After a few installations I have had no trouble at all, love mine.
No
The way your question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. The warranty has nothing to do with whether or not you can "return it", either to Amazon or the manufacturer. Amazon offers a 30 day return policy for most return reasons, including defective items -- This is a not a "warranty", but its return policy. The manufacturer is who typically offers the "warranty" (at least for a mouse). A warranty does not often offer any type of "return" (the word you use), but the manufacturer (or warranty provider) will repair or replace the defective item during that warranty period.
No
I have never used Toontrack that way because I'm not a drummer like yourself so I can't say yes, but I can not believe they don't have a very simple implementation given that triggers have been used on electronic. Drums for some. 30 years!
It depends on how well you take care of it. If its damp and you roll it up into a ball and throw it onto the bottom of your closet for 5 months, when you take it out, ya. I will tell you though, that the sellers are very concerned about their customers satisfaction. I would not hesitate to buy here again.
Not sure really. Maybe those large thumbtacks or duck tape? They're very thin and lightweight so it shouldn't be hard to find a way to do it.
It measures the shrinkage size listed in the description. I just received it last week so I haven't washed it. It's a little thin but it gets the job done and it's affordable.
6ft wide and 10 ft tall.
Yes
Light orange with bright coronal loops
I still have mine and it is working fine! But I guess you will have to open it to find out if it is the case or the hard drive.
The Canon Rebel XS is fine for learning photography. If you're more serious about your photography, however, I might recommend a model with more features and a little better performance like the Rebel T1i or T2i or maybe even a semi-pro 50D or perhaps the new 60D. But also leave some funds available for more lenses, an external flash, a spare battery and a case. If you only plan on taking the one course and then just using the camera for casual photography afterwards, the XS will do the job.
I am just graduating to DSLR photgraphy and just ordered my camera - I went through extensive research and boiled down to Canon Xs and Nikon D3000, finally decided to go with Canon. Nikon's guide mode is really good but I feel Canon is a superior machine.
If you mean OS X Mavericks, I doubt it very much. It hardly worked with Windows XP but hey, give it a shot and then let everyone else know.
Hello, I bought this converter in combination with a 110V pyrographic tool. After two days use, the tool had a short circuit and also the converter was burned through. I dont know if it was the tool or the converter that has caused the malfunction. That was my experience; I cannot advise you. The only thing I can say is that I would not buy this converter again. Wish you luck with your purchase!!! Hans Melissant
I am not sure. It doesn't work for me. But I am not sure whether I got a broken converter or the converter doesn't work in US. you can have a try.
I would love to hear about a review of this sigma vs the canon flashes. as i have a sx20 and i need a large flash for large dim rooms.
It comes pre-applied. It does not come with a tube.
If the original cpu fan is snap-in, yes you have to remove the MLB. With this unit, a plate is placed beneath the MLB (main logic board) that allows you to attach the cpu fan with a screw driver. Once this plate is installed, you no longer have to remove the MLB to replace the cpu cooling fan.
"If" you have the same processor it is supposed to work with I would assume so. But, you should check how your original fan connects to the motherboard. If the holes/latches match up go for it.
Yes, it's aluminum.
Some refurbuished products may have been repaired and some may just have been returned for no functional reason. There's no real way of knowing. But, in general, I'd say the extra warranty period is worth the small price difference. Now if the refurb cost 50% less, that might be a differnt story.
Check the panasonic website they make a telephoto lens and loads of filters. Amazon sells most of the items. I feel like this camera can adapt to many more situations than many other brands in this catagory or price range.
I also use SONY NI-MH batteries and I haven't experienced any problems. I think what they meant to emphasize was to use NiMH type of rechargeable batteries. Here is what Olympus recommends: Ni-MH Quick Charger and Battery Set (B-90SU) http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/product.asp?product=1393&fl=5 "What is the difference between Nickel Cadmium (NiCad) and Nickel Metal Hydride (NIMH) batteries? Both NiCad and NiMH batteries are rechargeable. The main difference between the two is the fact that NIMH batteries offer higher energy densities than NiCads. In other words, pound for pound, NIMH delivers approximately 30% more capacity than its NiCad counterpart. " Reference: http://www.batterymart.com/c-battery-facts-faqs.html#lith-alk
what i have read is that the olympus is more compact to tote (but not a compact size) than the panasonic. the panasonic has some higher marks than the olympus but averaged out the olympus is the editors choice. the x-d card may be a factor too. no camera is the right choice...but i'm on my way to place an order for the olympus. also, i've owned both brands and have been happy with both. tl
I don't see why it would not work on the Canon 70D. It works on my Canon 60D.
I have a T3i but it should work.
Yes, you can use zoom in video mode but not flash.
We've had the t77 for 3 months. Picture is horrible. Sent in for repairs per Sony, but I think the camera is junk. hoping for credit.
I agree, I was thinking of purchasing this model myself and the price went up as you clearly stated overnight. Amazon's loss! Jason, have you heard when the "B" model will be available?
Good calibration does save electrical costs. That's often shown in CNET HDTV reviews. But $250? Do they get a cut? I don't know about 6 months, but from time to time it probably doesn't hurt to use a calibration DVD (Digital Video Essentials: HD Basics [HD DVD]) or one of those THX calibration ones that come with some movies.
Yes, they are the same form factor and interface.
it has a 5 year limited waranty
yes.
Yes, the unit comes with a VGA-to-VGA cable, an S-Video to S-Video cable, an RCA cable for simple video, and a power cable which is terminated with a USB connector to receive power from the computer.
If you want the sound from the TV then you have to buy the headphone jack that fit your computer and splits into an RCA red and white to go into the back of the television. It works really well from my computer with this configuration. But to answer your question is it provided, it is not.
It Outputs on both analog & Digital, but only accepts one input.. So you could output component & HDMI if you really wanted to, but you can not have more then one input type at a time.
This is a notebook/laptop 2.5" drive! For desktops you should be looking at 3.5", unless your desktop is different and requires a 2.5" drive (like an iMac).
No virus. Mine is still working great!
Hi Rob I can do it $105.00 each set, please let me know so I can fix the unit price. Thank you
You'd need the cheaper Sonos Connect, which has "RCA out" plugs. Those plugs can be connected to your powered PC speakers with a cheap RCA male to 3.5mm female adapter cable.
I dont think it is caused by color wheel, it could be dirt on your projection lense. The wheel spins so fast that it will not generate any spots.
Yes
I used it on a 2008 tundra
As long as it is th we factory Toyota radio assembly, the system is compatible and will work. GROM connects to the back of the radio using factory pins and connections. You casn also check out GROM's website for installation instructions and model compatibility.
No. To use these speakers with your iPod, you would need some sort of power amplification. You can find small portable amps, perfect for what i think your looking for, here on amazon for 20 bucks and up. Just search the term "portable power amp". Hope this helps.
Just tried it in my Ubuntu 13.10 box and it works. I've also attached it directly to various flavors of linux in VMs.
I put it in my boat. Its amazing :)
Mine was the 1620. I don't know about the "M". Don't know if that is a different model. But mine has a retractable handle.
I really don't know. I'd contact the mfg. Sorry I can't be of more help.
17mm Ball Connection for GARMIN GPS Cradle.
I'm not sure if that's a question or a statement. I will just answer to say that I used it on a 2003 Jetta Wagon and it fit the Garmin securely. Once I attached it to the vent, there was little reason to remove it. I attached/detached the GPS daily and the mount held tight to the vent without any problems.
email support@viotekusa.com, or rma@viotekusa.com...they were very friendly and helpful with my failing keyboard
For me I can only use the mouse. The keyboard never sync up for me.
Yes you can. Go to the music or whatever folder.
The question raised by Robert Jordan is also of interest to me. How can one transfer DVDs to Archos 7? What problems are we likely to encounter and how should we resolve them? What is the best software to load DVDs and Blu ray disks? Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.
Yes through clone dvd mobile. You can download a free trial. You need sly soft and clone dvd mobile.
No
Yes, it has that feature ;)
Yes, I dont stay in a hotel without it!
I bought two. My doors were too high and went over them. My husband added hight to them and moved the rubbery bottom to the new bottom. Now when the doors open, the alarms just slide with the door and don't go off... I'm thinking it won't work for you either... Sorry.
9V This is a good deal...NRA sells the same product for $15.
It has HDMI. But you can use regular cable that screws on too.
I don't if it does or not. I would call dish to find out.
the machine works very well and has given me no problems
Sorry I am not sure but would think there would have to some limit to the distance you can run with a small gauge wire only say this because I know there are limitations to gauge size when it comes to electrical. I can tell you this for a fact that I see no difference in my short runs 25' compared to my long runs 150' sorry couldnt help more
Unscrew the cap that holds the hook on the bottom.
I think you're asking if it's possible to rotate the camera for vertical shots, the answer is yes.
A larger one. A backpack that has fasteners sturdy enough to hold a tripod of this weight. The tripod comes with a carry case, but I recommend not using the case and just strapping the tripod to the outside of a backpack.
The binocular has a tripod mount, so you should be able to use it. This tripod has the standard mount.
I doubt it would. It never worked with my iPhone. It was a waste of my money.
My 5 burner does not. Right after I placed my order I saw other ones that said they would attach to a computer, how ever I believe only one of the 5 burners will actually do this. Using this copy as a master you then make more in the regular way.
I own the 1 TB model and also noticed the heat buildup. I keep my unit off unless I'm backing up data. Had it a year and so far, so good.
USB, no AC mains needed. Needs a powered USB port, not an unpowered port. Many laptops have one or two of each.
Drives shouldn't have a problem functioning with either 32 bit or 64 bit. Programs are what cause incompatibility. If it doesn't work, reformat it (I'd recommend NTFS for Windows) and it should be fine.
Everyone is wrong to a degree. OS X can READ NTFS, it can't write to it, at least not natively. FAT32 is not really suitable for backups, so I wouldn't do that. Your two options are to either partition off the drive to have an NTFS partition and an HFS+ partition (Windows and Mac respectively), or you could make it NTFS and then download MacFUSE and NTFS-3G (google it) which will give the Mac the ability to write to windows drives (Abiet, very very slowly).
I use it for my 13" Pro Retina....and I like it but it is a little loose but fine. My guess is it would be a little loose on a Air...so if you don't mind the extra room it will be fine. If you want a snug fit, this is probably too big.
White
No. You have to buy the power supply separately.
If you are not familiar with Ed Mika, he engineers and makes customized adapters for old Canon lenses and is the only on-line vendor that I would trust with FD-EF converters. However, Ed Mika's website currently does not show an adapter for the FL 50 1.4.
It fit "All" my FD lens from my AE-1 and F1 Canon lens.
Strange issue. It fitted on all my FD lenses, including a Vivitar lense. I recomend you to consult the instructions manual or ask online to the manufacturer.
You should be able to since it's an online game..not 100% sure but hope that helps. We don't have it on ours
I included the paper covers in the sleeves. And a few CD's had thicker 'booklets' with all the songs' lyrics, etc. Those fit, also. A few of them were a little too big, but if I just trimmed 1/4 inch with a scissor, no problem.
Yes, they will fit M165. That is what I am using.
I think it depends on the weight of the thing that you are sticking it to. I got this for a cell phone holder and it did not hold up in the So Cal weather. I ended up using the windshield
I don't believe it does. I could be wrong though. I got it over a year ago and can't remember. Sorry, wish I could give you a better answer!
2.0
yep
no
On the back
Yes it doea
No i believe the garmin 396 uses the mini usb! This one is the standard usb!
It depends mostly on your sky conditions. I have been able to see realy wonderful details of globular and open clusters even just through my 15 x 70 Celestron binoculars as long as I went out to the desert skies of Arizona. However, if I bring out my telescopes in the DC area where I live, I am lucky to be able to see Messier objects at all.
The tube is very light. Most of the weight is in the mount. You still can carry the assembled tube and mount with one hand and walk short distance from/to your backyard. This telescope is not table top because the eyepiece is at the top end of the tube about 1 meter above the mount bottom.
Yes. I have it connected to a Win 8 laptop.
Yes! It does record in 1080 hi def. http://www.hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hvr850.html
USB
The mounting plate that attaches to the wall is 26 inches long and 10 inches wide The arms extend 30 inches.
NO -- there are 2 solid arms that come out bout 13" and then the next arms are the ones that swivel and then the attachment to the T.V. will swivel too. I needed something that came out 33" because of the depth of my built -in cabinet's older design so I only utilize the swivel on the actual T.V. I can tell you it is very well made and was installed professionally into the studs etc.... No slacking or drooping for this 55" T.V. in the year + I have had it..
No
Hi, Sorry I just bought it for a third party.
It it's my understanding that you do not need to program the remote. It's comes pre-programmed. It either works or doesn't.
It is adjustable in an arch of 90 degrees by loosening a bolt which allows the mast to swing. It can then be locked into position by tightening the same bolt.
i do not believe so
Sorry, I don't know. I don't even remember how I figured out what keys would work in my car. Good Luck.
It depends on the windload of the antenna you are putting on it. You could use guy wires for more strength.
No, it does not include a pole. Lowes and Home Depot have them.
It depends what you use as the mast. This does not come with the center mast so you can make it as tough as you want.
No, Max. mast diameter is 1 1/2".
Yes. As long as the channel is in your area, and as long as you have a digital tv tuner you will get the channel 4.1
I don't know. I am in the South.
This one comes with an amp. I believe the model 2001 does not. Not sure. The amp that is supplied is sufficient for my application on a tower at 60ft I receive locals at about 60 miles with good HD. Now there are some days the reception is iffy, sunspots!!
Works fine for both.
I don't remember seeing one, although I bought and installed this product in my TV about a year and a half ago in July,2012, and so far so good- despite the heavy use!
It turns very loosely, with a vague clicking sensation. It is P and P.
Yes, and its been working excellent.
No instructions because it just plugs in. We had a repairman from Best Buy put it in. Right away it started making a noise, although at first it worked. We left the tv on for awhile and the tv went out and the fan didn't work. Waste of my money. Best Buy put one they had in and it has been working ever since.
Not really sure. The metal points on the kit line up with the metal pads on the walkie talkie. I guess if your radios are configured that way it might work. I would be uneasy buying them with the little info I've given
Dobsons have the viewfinder up top. Depending on how it's angled, you may want a chair to sit in.
It is not designed to be mounted on a tripod.
I don't understand the question about assigning key functions to the mouse. If you mean keyboard key functions, I don't know as I have no need to do this. If you mean can you assign different functions that the mouse can do, yes. This is done after you have installed the program for the mouse through the device and printers settings. Right click on the mouse icon and then click on the mouse settings. Now you can tell your mouse how to act.
Obviously, the desk back must be away from a wall other obstruction, and you should experiment with the arm extension, and its reach and flexibility before drilling holes in the desk back.
No
Hi There They are not available through BBE, but I'm sure you can get something. These jacks are very standard sized, so you may be able to find something at radioshack or online that will work for you.
Yes, the trickle charge kicks in after they are charged
It is not. It has no battery. It needs to be connected all the time.
Mine is in a detached garage window about 75' from my router and works fine.
I am not sure
Yours will use the EN-EL5 Rechargeable battery
I doubt it. This charger is for a camera battery, not a smartphone battery.
I am not sure if it fits
When you go to the page to order it will give you model numbers that this bulb will fit. Yes it comes with instructions. Pretty simple to install.
I don't know - as my purchase was an exact replica of my "dead" one for my TV. Sorry.....
I'm not sure however it does work just as the original did with my tv. I would assume yes
Yes
No no no no
NO , NOT SAME , THANKS.......................
NO , NOT SAME , THANKS...................
I can only tell you that mine worked flawlessly with the unit I had...I think that Toshiba remotes will work all Toshiba products...Hope this helps...Besides amazon will refund you with no hastle if it doe'snt work...
Worked good for me. Seems very adaptable.
No
Unfortunately, form my experience there is no way around it during recording. However, this camera has built-in editing functionality. You can stitch the snippets together into one continuous piece. It's quite easy. Then there is also the video editing software included with the camera.
No, this not a permanent mount. You can use either suction grip or Velcro. I have taken mine off several times. It is a good mounting system.....no complaints at all.
120Hz is a different picture, some like it, some don't. You can always turn it off though. Contrast, however, EVERYONE likes better contrast. Go with the 55" Samsung. I own a 5271F Samsung and I love it. I am waiting for Samsung to pump out a 60 incher before I upgrade.
It does not record to 5.1 Surround only Stereo. But you can re-output to 5.1 Surround using Pinnacle Studio 11/12, Sony Vegas or Ulead Video 11 video editing software.
Sorry I can't help--I don't have a video camera.
Yes you can on the Gunnar website.
I would assume so . . but I don't wear glasses.
I do webdesign and I can not wear the amber nor the crystallines if I am trying to view true colors. It is always a few shades off.
Yes you can on the Gunnar website.
I would assume so . . but I don't wear glasses.
Yes
This makes no sense to me, especially with all the LED's coming out and the 52B750
i paid 2100 for mine from Electronics Expo. The price has actually gone up in the last 2 months. Just keep checking Amazon and you can find it for 2097.00 from Electronics Expo. I got mine last week but I spent about 2 weeks checking online 3-4 times a day until i got the right price. It may be a while before it drops below 2000! Good Luck
Yes. It allows you to change the channel on the digital box while you are away. I still record things with a VCR by going from antenna to converter box to VCR to TV. It works great for that. Be certain to get this model though.
I'm not sure, you will need to go to Denon and find out I know not all IPods work. I have had nothing but trouble with this unit and the one I had prior to this one. If you google this model you will see it is an ongoing issue and the fixes they recommend did not work for us. My suggestion is save your money and go another route.
Very good
Not really, I think it's personal preference. For me the medium size tips were the best since they were nice and snug. My girlfriend had to use the small ones since that's what felt comfortable for her.
I really cannot compare lenses since I use a Canon T5i but I started using the Tamron 18-270 lens with a Canon XTI. It was the only lens I took on my trip to Alaska and it did the job. Pictures were fantastic. Later using a Canon T3i I took it to Minnesota and captured amazing shots of bald eagles. The zoom worked like it should and all pictures were crisp and clean with great color. The focus is fast and accurate even in video mode. Hope this helps.
I just saw that the new model (pzd) is just 20 dollars more and its lighter. The old version is a great all around lens. I highly recommend it. Recently i bought the 17-50 2.8 VC which way sharper and brighter, but the zoom range of this one is amazing. Good luck
Do a quick google search for your model. Navigate right on over to canon website and under your model there will be a tab called supplies and accessories have a look there to see what it list as optional batteries
Yes, they come with a base so they can be free standing and they are gloss black. I very much like mine Ken
Hi Megan, I am a proud owner of 6 and I can hang them horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
Yes I have lots of blue ray movies. I center them, and have mixed with DVDs
I'm unfamiliar with the size and shape of game cube games/ ps3. But our son keeps his xbox games on it. The xbox cases fit in the slots but with a decent amount of wiggle room both lengthwise and width wise. I would say any case that's close to the xbox cases, with 2cm or so, would fit.
they normally comes with a phillips adapter or call it banana adapter if you look carefull at the bottom ends in picture you see the connectors hope ths helps you
I have both of these items and the do work together.
No
No, it does not. Also, I had two, one lasted 13 months, the other 18.
I don't know what PWM fans are but as far as I know as long as your fans have the right # of pins all you do is plug them in to the control box and your are set..to set them the way you want then is easy, just follow the directions..i have had mine for a few months and no issues.. love this thing !!
Perhaps for smaller tools, like screwdrivers and pliers, etc. Definitely would not hold any small hand tools. The 8 inch length would be a limiting factor. Try using a piece of 8 inch string as a guide which may help you decide. Also, the velcro strips are only about 3/8-1/2 wide. Good luck.
Are you asking because you are concerned about power surges? If so, Belkin may not provide enough information for and answer. A simplistic calculation uses the relationship that 1 watt = 1 joule/second. But I do not think that that calculation addresses your implicit question about surges.
If you're using Media Center with Windows 7 or 8 it should work. The limit I think is four of each type of tuner (analog, QAM, ATSC, etc.). With two 2250s Media Center should show as having four analog and four digital tuners. I have a Hauppauge 1250 and a 2250 installed in my PC and they show up as having three analog and three digital tuners in Media Center.
It can be connected if the tv has composite audio outputs. Some older ones however, only have inputs in which case you can't. If that is your situation though, you can always connect the video (yellow) output from the dvd player to the video input of the tv while the audio outputs (red and white) go to to the audio receiver.
Yes - this receiver can power woofers on normal house speakers fine. However, it is a little underpowered for large tower speakers unless you have a seperate amplifier. Since there is a seperate output for a subwoofer - you may want to add a stand alone woofer (like you would have in a home theater system) since they have their own power supply.
I don't think this'll be long enough for your lens, though I don't have a 70-200 f/4 to check. I have a 28-300mm which is listed as 4.5" long and only has a little room to spare (height-wise). The 70-200mm is listed as 7" long, and I don't see how another 2.5" would fit. An alternative may be: http://www.amazon.com/Tamrac-M-A-S-Medium-Lens-Black/dp/B00009UTQL/ref=pd_bxgy_p_text_y I bought the Large for my lens (which is a perfect fit, without any attachments), and the Extra Large may be a good option for you.
One year
If the sonos has a female screw hole to accept one of the variety of screws include then yes. There is a variety of sizes of screws so as long as it accepts screws I believe it will work.
Craig, Thanks so much for your question. If you don't want to do home theater, you only require two speakers for proper stereophonic listening. You could pair your speakers with a Marantz SR4023 Stereo Receiver. It is a wonderful sounding receiver that will lend your speakers rich tone and the system will draw you into the music listening experience.
Go to Polk audio .Com and look up this speaker. On the specs it will tell how big the hole needs to be.
I don't see why they wouldn't. These do have a crossover network and should sound good. Keep me posted. Good luck.
If you are listening to a song, and then shut the mp3 off, and then turn it back on, you'll end up back at the main menu. But if you click Music, it will go right back to where you were (same song, same place within the song).
Yes
This DVD player plays all regions. It gives you a crisp, clear perfect picture. I am very happy with it, I have this DVD on all three of my 55" LED TV's. Though it does play all regions, it will only play one at a time. Perhaps they sell multiple DVD players, I'm sure Amazon will let you know. Debra
I'm sorry I don't know the answer to this. I'm British and my wife lives in Arizona, so I got the DVD player so that we can watch Region 2 DVDs as well as Region 1 when I visit. We have never used it to play music on.
I believe the 94u and the SE (Special Edition) has a Leather Bezel, it's a fancy special edition model, but same display wise.
Yes it does, but Sharp told me that it does not transmit content that comes into the TV from any of the HMDI inputs.
Yes, I have the same camera and purchased this battery for the camera.
I could not tell because I used it for another model
Yes.
This device is designed to eliminate noise in your music from your attached mp3 device, noise which is generated by the ignition system of a running car motor. For that it works great. You would need to supply more info as to why you are getting noise from an external mic hooked up to your camcorder. Sounds more like a mismatch in impedance between your mic and your camcorder. Check the specs for your camcorder mic input and make sure your external mic matches those specs.
No, a Dell laptop. The lock fits, but stopped locking (i.e. mechanism broke) after a few uses.
You have to go to the Manufacturers website & look for specific compatibility. This I think requires a CD changer outlet in the back of the head unit, but a SPECIFIC changer plug. Do you research.
Yes
I used two ..one for each channel ..front and rear..
will it fit a panasonic 40z zoom
YES, just put them in between the rows, which is what I like abiut this box.
Mine Did!
Yes I do think you can because this laptop does have the minimum processing power required to play Minecraft but I must warn you that this laptop's processor is right at the minimum required so you may run into some problems playing Minecraft.
Yes, I bought it and installed it in my M1330 after my stock card went bad. It works so much better than the stock one.
I just bought this item from a local store. It does not have a programmable timer option. It only has a sleep timer and an auto shutoff timer, but not for changing the channels.
You need composite out of the box to composite in on the TV if you have a composite device on the switch. If you have a mix of component and composite items plugged intot he box it'll get really hairy in terms of cable routing.
Call the garmin customer service the phone number is on their web site. The help is free
I'm not really sure if it will fit directly, I used a spacer and adapter ring to make it fit my Nikon. You can buy adapters for multiple sizes. Hope that helps. Cheers
Yes, I use one on my video camera and my still camera.
No, it does not, but you can plug a computer to it.
Compatible with all Canon dslr cameras. Per the Canon website.
As trivial as it may seem, don't skimp on a filter. You have a nice camera, so get a MULTI-COATED filter from someone like B&W, Heliopan, or Hoya. The multi-coatings reduce flare and reflections, just like your multi-coated Nikon lens -- again, don't skimp, it'll truly reduce the quality of your photo's especially in sunlight. The size of the filter should be imprinted on the lens, and yes, it's 67mm. A good filter is somewhere in the $50 neighborhood.
The 35mm (or FX digital) equivalent is approximately 27 to 158 mm.
As long as the olympus has a microphone input, yes. This is just a 1/8" standard mic jack.
it can be used, but in M mode can shoot full strength unless you know how to manual set the flash. do some research online and it will explain this better. seems that the flash works well in all other modes, but if you use manual you might have some problems.
My parents bought this for me for Xmas. I put the batteries in and it fired right up. I'm still using it and it works awesome. I suggest contacting the seller and getting an exchange!
I have not had any problems with the cable and seems to be made of a fine quality. It depends on how large you camera bag is. I keep my bracket outside my bag.
Yes you can.
this is female on both ends so you can extend the length of an HDMI cable ... it does not plug into a computer, I hope this helps.
I have no idea. I only have a TomTom. You could probably ask the manufacturer.
I just ordered this camera and plan to try using the photo software that came with my EOS Rebel XS. It's not bad, but actually the only thing I use it for is transferring images from the memory card to my computer's hard drive. I've gone this route ever since Vista destroyed another of my digicams' memory card, losing hundreds of images. I don't like Vista. So anyway, I still prefer using Photoshop or Paint Shop Pro for editing tasks.
Try looking here: http://www.zune.net/en-US/support/usersguide/gettingstarted/default.htm
I use software to reduce the image file size without reducing the quality of the photo too much. It can be done in PhotoShop. A free software is JPEGmini that can be downloaded from www.download.com. They also have other freeware that can be used to reduce the file size.
Try looking on Canon's website www.canonusa.com and search "PowerShot A 1000IS". You might find software download files, Firmware Updates, Manuals.
China
Magnets. Just like most consumer headphones.
Player sounds great, but I lost the adapters.
Not sure, it does have VC anti shake
I don't see why not. The jack is the same size as the one in my headphones.
It was designed for a wired network, so yes, it definitely works that way. You would need some sort of ethernet to wireless bridge if you actually did want it wireless. However, for the second question, it can only be accessed by 1 device at a time. When one tv/computer logs into it, the device is "locked" and no other device can log in, unfortunately.
They are ok for regular use. Putting your phone in your pocket, in your backpack etc...
My assumption is that some earphones include a microphone and these do not. They are simply headsets. Good ones, that I would recommend highly for the price. I recently bought another set.
I think you will find a size that works for you. It comes with three sizes of inserts.And one of the leads is longer than the other. So it goes around the back of your head and this helps to it from bouncing around during physical activity. .I hope this is helpful. ..Rob L.
They're the same, "B" is the designation for black (the other color available at one point was silver).
Noise camcelling is a commonly misused term. Noise "cancelation" would imply that the headphones had a built in external mictophone to read ambient noises or tones and then would use "anti-noise" to counteract them. These are not noise cancelling. HOWEVER they are great for noise isolation, (the headphones create a seal that physically blocks out external noise)
this is 2 pieces just like the original one that came with my HP laptop
I don't know about that. I personally would not exceed the manufacturers specs. I did a search on line for a replacement for my original. Then I did a search on Amazon to find the suggested part by model #.
Yes
It is the short arm, "RAM MOUNT, RAM MOUNT W/ 3" X 11" BASE SHORT ARM"
Works with full IPhone functiionality
It actually is a coaxial digital audio jack. The connector looks just like a regular RCA plug. You might be confused by the placement. I missed it at first, too. Right next to the "digital audio out" label is a plug you can pull out with some strange-looking connector. Not sure what that is, but it's not the digital audio. The digital audio is actually to the left of the label, a black RCA-type next to a red-white RCA combo.
NO ..no speaker included but it will work with any speaker i believe.
A built in battery that can not be owner replaced. With normal use, the battery should last four or five years, longer than most people keep a Walkman.
No clip. Carry in your pocket or check for arm band case etc.
Yes, you can in the radio option.
Works fine on PS3.
The controller conects with cat5 cables to the wall port, and then from the wall port to the keypads with cat5 and again from the wall port to the speakers with speaker cable
Yes
Worked well with my D7000. You'd have to check the manual that comes with your camera. This corded remote is much smaller physically than the knock offs.
No, only the card, hope my answer helps
You've probably already figured it out....nevertheless. You can't transfer your music from i-tunes to your new computer. You have to transfer the music files from your old computer to new one. Then you can launch i-tunes in your new computer and transfer the music from the computer into i-tunes. Depending on how you set up the preferences in i-tunes, you can program it to look for music files and then it will do it automatically. Good luck, if you haven't done it already.
I believe 90 days. But even during the warranty period, Apple is difficult, if not impossible to deal with. But to be honest, although I love the amount of music I can put on the ipod classic, there are some "bugs" that cause duplications and triplications of music. Apple "help" is not helpful. They don't know why it does it...they only want to charge for the discussion. So, I like the product, hate the "non-support".
Which docking stations do you have? I bought a Belkin wall plug thing from amazon. Three outlets and two USB chargers.
If you leave your trailer you can mark the spot and go riding . As you ride you can check your distance from your starting point .That will give you the distance.
I dropped my phone in a bathtub full of water, my sd card still works fine
Shipping via Air Mail. The item is expected to arrive in 10 to 20 business days.

I gave it as a gift and never got feedback. sorry
yes they work great with smartphones, but only if youre listening to music, but it doesnt have micro so you cant take calls with it, but for evrything else works perfec!!
I've used my GPS quite a bit and the battery is still going strong. I turn it on just before I head into the woods to mark my starting point and then turn it off. When I'm ready to head back to my truck or camo I turn it back on and follow the arrow home.. so it's not like the unit is on the entire time I'm in the woods. Hope this helps you out.
The range is good. It depends on satellites. Sometimes it takes a bit of time to acquire a signal. And it can have trouble in low lying areas, or places where signal interference may be an issue. But I have never had an issue with eventually getting a signal in my area, although it can be slow at times.
Another question, Will this work for Sony NP-F330?
no
I just spoke with an Apple rep as I am also frustrated with Cover Flow. He said to: (1) plug my ipod into my computer / iTunes (2) go to my nano's Summary page (where you can see the storage space or refresh the unit, etc) (3) click on the Music tab (4) uncheck Display Artwork -- I hope that helps!
I highly recommend using Apple's support site (http://www.apple.com/support/ipod/) rather than asking Amazon users. Most don't actually know what they're talking about. You can easily back up, transfer, switch computers, etc (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1329) Also, you can switch to manually sync your iPod which will allow you to sync with many computers. The purpose of auto-syncing is to ensure that the changes you make on your computer are mirrored on your iPod. However, there are many other easy ways to manage your iPod such as dragging-and-dropping playlists straight to the iPod. (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1351)
You have to download iTunes from the Apple website. Then, you should take your songs from Limewire and put them into a folder on your desktop or elsewhere. (If you create a folder, you can drag and drop the music from your limewire library into it) Then, you can go to the import file option under File in iTunes and bring in your Limewire music. It works better to put it into a folder first because if you get rid of Limewire or change the file, you will have to find and re-upload all of your music.
The iHome iP99 will. It's designed for iPhone but will work for iPod Nano 4th Gen.
Sure... if your songs are sync'ed with your computer, when you plug in your new iPod, just re-sync with iTunes to the new iPod and it will copy everything over (depending on how you've configured it). I have three different iPods connected to my Mac, two of them are hard drive based, and so they both are mirror images of each other.

Apple iPod shuffle 2 GB Blue (4th Generation) NEWEST MODEL Matheus Weber, The newest iPod Shuffle is the Fourth Generation. It looks a lot like the iPod Shuffle Second Generation, but it's slightly smaller. If you were to base shuffles off of design and size then the iPod Nano Sixth Generation would be considered the newest shuffle. Also Apple has put buttons back onto the shuffle itself. We are no longer required to buy six or seven replacement headphones to control that terribly small device known as the iPod Shuffle Third Generation. Godspeed! ~SWWPD
On the Go playlist anyone? I'm pretty sure that counts as making a playlist, seeing as it asks you to click which songs you want in said playlist.
try going on her pc and connect the new ipod to it, and open itunes, then try syncing her songs to it.
The iPod shuffle comes with the docking station and the headphones included in the box. Everything you would need to start using it, and perfect for a 9 year old girl. They are very tough and durable, though somewhat small (might be easy to loose).
I buy the cheap ear buds from a Fred Meyers ,here in Oregon,its like 7.00 dollars works great. For Christmas daughter bought and Bose ear bud I still prefer the cheaper one . I hope this help you.
it has an on off button no lock button
try going on her pc and connect the new ipod to it, and open itunes, then try syncing her songs to it.
Yes, any mp3 can be put on the iPod line, you use iTunes fir the connection to the iPod, iTunes will also let you buy music from the apple owned iTunes store but you need nit do that if you already have the cd, it will put the songs in iTunes and then let you add to an iPod.
That's a lot of junk for no reason. The 4th generation charges from your USB serial port. You just need a basic 2 Gb model for $45.
Amazon music app
I turned mine off. It works but on mine it some times caused shimmer in play back, if you're moving the camera following action. If you're using telephoto and not moving camera or slowly moving camera, then ok. If you want to capture a frame to save a photo then you need it on.
yes you can delete them right from the camera
It comes with the cables to play video on your TV. You can burn DVDs using the included software. This camera is NOT HD, but it can record in 16:9 so it will fill your HD TV screen.
no
What is the question? Does it have an fm radio? No.
No, sorry. It would be a great feature, though
You can use it with both.
Probably, because the Samsung MX20 shutter can be (and has to be) operated manually (a big plus on saving electricity), and you can screw your lens accessories into the 30.5 mm threadings. If I recall correctly, the Canon FS100 doesn't have any threadings. The only way to get threadings on a Canon camera, is to buy something a little bit fancier, and invest in the Canon Vixia series.
No and mine was broken when I receieved it
Sharon, before you sent it back I hope you followed the return procedure on the website. As long as you did, you will get your refund once they have recieved and processed the item. That usually takes about 1 week (based upon past experience with my own returns). Depending on your reason for returning it, they may deduct a restocking charge. Was something wrong with the item or did you just not like it? Either way, sorry for your negative experience and I hope your return is processed soon. Best wishes to you.

In the product description where is has some pictures it says "Scroll Wheel with Tilt Better feel and response with detents for precise control." So it looks like it has detents.

You will connect the RCA plugs or S Video to your source (VCR), the USB will connect to the CPU. I bought this a couple years ago to transfer my VCR tapes. it worked great. I then edited them with a editing program, then burned them to DVD. After a couple practice runs, you will get the adjustment down. Then start the process of recording and walk away, or watch your recording if you are not going to copy the entire tape. Good luck, it is pretty simple to use.
check it again
Where does it say this keyboard is Bluetooth? All I see is that it is 2.4ghz wireless. I think you may be mistaken.
It will work it just has to be programmed to work w d unit.
According to here: http://www.remotesandkeys.com/product-p/z2062b.htm It will work fine with that alarm.
No it does not work with iphone 4
I was lobbying customer support to add the capability to upload PDF files :) I just got this idea - you can read email attachments, so could you send yourself a PDF and read it?????
Haven't tried it as I no longer use my Mac for faxes. If you would like one I'd be happy to let you have mine for free if you pay for shipping.
It does not, but maybe Olympus has come out with a driver update ... I am not sure on that.
Yes. It is WAY better in every aspect. Although it costs a bit more, the image quality is much higher with the Sony lens. The Sigma is very soft, especially above 300mm. I tried the Sigma and was not satisfied with the images. My Sony 70-400 never disappoints.
NO, I bought it thinking it would, but "All-in-1" is not what it says. I returned it. Buy instead from OEMPCWorld.com Item # 025702, OMB USB 2.0 to SmartMedia Card Reader, SanDisk, BYR, 80-90-00055. Cost 9.99, shipped free USPS First Class Mail, No sales tax. Select Equivalence (required). Accept equivalent brand to expedite shipment. Enter Computer Make and Model (required) Worked fine!
Yes it with a large array of different sized bolts and slots on the bottom half allow for all hole distances
...no, the G1 was the first G series camera from around 2009 or so...so no GPS on the G1
You will only get the advertised resolution at the native aspect ratio. Unfortunately I am not sure what ratio is native to the 40D, but it may also have had a reduced resolution for the 16:9 aspect. The difference in 12 to 10 megapixels should not have a big effect on your prints, you can also crop from the 4:3 images to get what you would like - with of course the the same loss of pixels, but you may feel more in control of what you lose this way.
According to the Panasonic lens chart for the 14-45 lens, the minimum focus distance is 1 foot or 12 inches. I haven't tested the G1 in the more traditional macro/close-up type approach. I didn't get the impression that the camera likes getting closer than 12". From @2-3', I was able to engage the Extended Zoom (2x) + 4x digital + a Tcon 1.7 teleconverter (1200mm) and got surprisingly good results. I'm not suggesting you do it, but it worked.
Yes. It's clear acrylic plastic that is easily removable. I take mine off when using throughout an evening. It lets the turntable really show off its good looks.
Hi Adam, I am using Music Hall PA1.2 MM/MC Phono Pre Amp, paired with Audio Space Preamp Line 3.1 and AS9M-MARK III mono block amplifier and a pair of Thiel 2.7 speakers.

The FreeAgent go has a "5 year limited warranty" - unfortunately, I don't know what the "limited" part of it is.
It maybe if you partition it right. I use a desktop 1tb partitioned for 500gig fat32 just fine to watch movies on my xbox.
PS3 (last i checked) only reads flash drives and hard drives formated in FAT32, not NTSC. Large hard drives come formatted in NTSC, and windows XP and vista will not format large hard drives into NTSC, so you have to download other software on your comp in order to format your hard drive to fat32. Then it will read music, video, pics that are the correct file types that PS3 can read. Also system update your ps3 so it can read as many files as possible. Download this program to format: http://www.compuapps.com/download/Swissknife/swissknife.htm
I wouldn't count on getting "expert" advice for this from a "Staples expert". You'll need to install an email client in Windows 7 since it does not come with one, unlike previous versions of Windows which came with Outlook Express or, in the case of Windows Vista, Windows Mail. For Windows 7, I suggest downloading and installing Windows Live Mail. Then, follow the procedure at http://www.pcdon.com/080113OutlookExpress-WindowsLiveMail.html to import your OE messages into Windows Live Mail.
It will keep your hand in a vertical position, but you will still need to use the left mouse button, perhaps with a different finger. This is designed for wrist relief, so I don't know about finger issues. Take your regular mouse, turn it on its side and try pressing the buttons and using the scroll wheel. That should answer your question.
Hi, I bought this mouse as a gift for my husband and it was broken 2 months later. I am not sure if I recommend you to buy that!
My brother is more knowledgeable about this than me and he said: "The last several units I have installed all had muvee software on them. After using muvee I chose not to use it and use the old Seagate backup software." Hope this helps.
The FreeAgent go has a "5 year limited warranty" - unfortunately, I don't know what the "limited" part of it is.
It's a standard USB cable. While the connection to the computer is a standard (Type A), the fitting on devices are varied, as there are at least 5 different types. The best solution is to take the drive to an electronics store and show them the connection on the device. Additionally, you are not restricted to length, so you can actually get a longer cord if you wish.
Mine came with 4 GB, battery was good for 4 months, now dies pretty fast and came with a display driver issue. Got what i pay for

looks like price did just drop about $50. I had this in my cart at $525 just a few days ago. still deciding amongst a few I've shortlisted. Happy to see price is down to $479
I have used it with an Android phone. I use the white cable that came with my IPod (to use it in the car). I plug one end into the phone, and the other into the dock, and it works perfectly.
When you buy the Logitech dock, it comes with the adapter piece for different size iPods. If you want to just get the adapter, you should contact Logitech customer service.
This unit was designed before there was an iPhone 5! The dock connector is on top of the unit and an after market adaptor might result it a less than structurally sound mounting. Use a 3.5mm audio cable to Aux in...
all you need to do is open any browser type http://tplinklogin.net/ user :admin pass :admin press quick setup next next finish done
As far as I know, it should. Just run a hard line from the primary router to one of the LAN ports on this unit. Also make sure to shut off DHCP and set the ip address of the unit manually. Also setting the units to use different channels will make using your devices a bit easier. If you're setting this up at home, consider unchecking ip isolation on both units. That shoud get you done.
I agree with you, someone shoud be making a product that uses batteries that can be replaced, like the old analog battery T.V. Living in Miami 100 minutes is not enuf if the electricitiy is off for days as it is in a hurricane!
Yes use the menu button on the front and the round selector to move from screen to screen
The set has a "normal" antenna that folds down across its top that can be used for normal portable use if the signal is strong enough. The other antenna has a mag mount and an extension cord, and can be positioned away from the set (perhaps near a window) if more signal is needed. The set can also be plugged into an outside antenna or cable, if desired.
No, it does not with any TV. Car / TV must be static, perform a new scan, then watch.
Otterbox makes an armband!
Actually yes. If you read the small print in the listing itself, it says it is also used in cable TV systems in a passive mode. So if purchased it will work fine. Mine is used in a antenna TV setup and I am very pleased.
Yes
No
I don't have any experience with Samsung lenses but I suppose you can, as this step up or step down rings are standard.
The aperture must be set manually, as well as the focus.The focus by the way, will be an extremely delicate affair because of being so close to the subject. I set my f-stop with the lens on the camera normally; then reversed it. you can leave the ring attached if you think you'll be using it a lot.
No it does not work with FD lenses as this is an M42 screw mount. Which is compatible with lenses like the Pentax Takumar screw mount lenses and other M42 screw mount lenses. Ypu will nred to buy an FD adapter with glass in order for FD lenses to work.
Yes, due to the longer flange distance of the Nikon F mount, you can use this adapter to use your wife's lenses on your Canon. If her lenses don't have an iris ring, you will have to adjust the aperture of the lens on her camera first, then mount to your camera.
You can share your lenses with your wife with this adapter, but not the other way around. You'll need to get a canon lens to nikon body adapter. This particular adapter allows you to use Nikkor manual lenses or AF lenses (in manual mode) that have an aperture rings.
Any eos mount
No
Don't know I have had mine for about 1 now and they are still good
I don't know, you should ask the seller
yes, just do a search on amazon for powershot g10 lenses. pick what you want !
This is partly a function of the speed of the RAM on the SD card and the time these pocket digicams take to acquire focus. You need to have the fastest possible SD card to minimize this. Personally I can't stand it, my old Canon F-1 film SLR has instant response to the shutter!
Yes it sure does. I go to a lot of rock concerts and I love this camera for it.
Please dont buy a camera. You need more education on the products.
I just bought it at digitalelectronics4less.com for $180. I'm confused since it is listed for about $260 everywhere else (and sometimes much more!)...but it appears to be new and have all accessories. Score!
Yes. The predecessor SD950 IS movies are recorded as AVI files, which are compatible with Windows Movie Maker. The SD990 IS movies are recorded as MOV files, the Apple QuickTime format. I purchased QuickTime Pro ($29.95) to convert the MOV files to AVI files.
The above having been said, if you really need compactness, and if you can get reasonably close to the action, the Canon SD 990 may be one of the better choices. The sensor is supposed to be the same as the G10. While it is noisy at ISO 800, it is reputed to be above average for small sensor cameras, as seen at http://www.cameralabs.com/reviews/Canon_PowerShot_G10/noise.shtml I have not done my own experiments with this.
I have a Lumix DMC-FZ18 and a Canon SX10. I wanted to buy a camera that was a little better than the FZ18 and wait a little longer for a DSLR. Picture quality on the Canon is not as good as the Lumix. Image stabalization on the Lumix is also noticably better. I have already taken over 300 photos of the same scene with both cameras for comparison. I should have upgraded to the Panasonic DMC-FZ28 as it is getting great reviews from everyone on the web.
Yes, but you need a handset lifter. http://www.amazon.com/Jabra-GN1000-Remote-Handset-Deskphone/dp/B00008UAIO On my second headset, first lasted over a decade, but oringal handset lifter. Middle button on headset lifts and replaces the handset. Super units. Work on the phone 8 hours a day. Headset is comfortable and can be used on the right or left ear.
I don't know. I sent it back to the seller and I got my money back.
The Polaroid makes a negative when you peel apart the images. After the chemicals dry you can scan the image (s).
yeah, should work. http://www.rwhirled.com/landlist/landdcam-pack.htm#101 this site tells you everything you need to know about land cameras.
It will work for iPad, but I don't think your piano teacher will see her hands on the keyboard with this strapped on.
I bought it for a Nikon lens... but is sold as a filter for any lens needing a 55mm filter
No a 55mm lens protector won't fit on a 67mm lens. Look for the 67mm UV protector if your lens is a 67mm one.
My Hoya filter box was not sealed. The filter is wonderful... my photos are clearer than they were with the cheaper filter from another manufacturer that I bought with the lens. I am happy with the Hoya filter.
Google "Hoya HD Filter packaging" and you will see the black box packaging that I have. Also, there is an article about how to spot the fake filters at ePHOTOzine dot com.

No. Look at the end of the lens that is not attached to your camera and it will have writen 72mm for the 28-135mm lens. This number is the size of the filter that you will need for this lens. You can also look up your lens on the canon site and look at the specifications for each canon lens that you own. If you have the same canon 28-135mm lens I own, then you need a 72mm filter.
I bought it for a Nikon lens... but is sold as a filter for any lens needing a 55mm filter
You have to check the lens that you are using with your T4i. If you look straight at it, it should say X mm somewhere. For example, the one I have is 58mm so a 55mm filter will not fit it. Also, make sure you don't confuse that number with the zoom length, which is probably also in mm (for example, 18-55mm).
Yes, nuts, bolts and washers
Know that one cannot be use The 60 D using the same one as a rebel T3 i
This remote shutter release cord works really well with my Nikon D600, especially conducting a very long exposure shooting..Handy and very affordable helpful accessory which I ordered from Amazon..
If credible = lossless HD audio tracks, then YES via the BD55's 7.1 analog outs. NO via the digital coax or optical outs - you'll only get the fallback lossy DD and DTS tracks (higher bitrate than DVD, but still NOT HD) to be decoded by your Yamaha AVR. BTW, wait for the DMP-BD80 coming in March '09, as current pricing for the now discontinued BD55 is completely ridiculous...
Only 1 for friends or 3 for family. We were getting 10 robo calls per day. Now none. Only took a while to train our friends and family to remember to press 1 or 3. I suppose this may also chase off a few live callers, but just getting rid of the robo-calls was well worth it.
If it is wired to the wall (straight to Ma Bell's lines) it will ring irrespective of what the Telebouncer does. If it is after the Telebouncer it will only ring after the number is pressed. The Telebouncer needs to be between Ma Bell's lines and your phone(s) for it to block calls. It also will NOT block a 2nd line if you have one. My 2nd line is for FAXes and is NOT blocked.
It should, it works with Comcast and I think the technology is the same. Connect it to any phone jack on phone side of the cable modem. Only downfall we found on our Comcast setup is the caller ID stops working, but well worth the benefit. Not one telemarketer has made our phone ring since we got this.
Yes
No
No, it is the Composer with the 50mm optic
It comes with Xandros, Linux distribution especially made for Asus Eee PC
I don't know why not. It's a Nikon mount.
Absolutely
2 poles
Yes, I have the same problem and I feel like throwing the thing through a window. I think I may sell it and get a 1.4d
Yes
I do not know. If the dialer produces digital signals..ok, if it is an analog signal, I doubt it. Try gooling that question, and see what kind of response you get. I got rid of mine because it went bad,and AT@T SAID THEY ARE NOT MAKING THEM ANYMORE. So I went to Linksys model #N300, a year ago, and still have it,and I have no problems down loading NETFLIX or AMAZON PRIME, on my APPLE 27 inch iMac. ruben
Up to 10 feet
Only you can answer that question. I purchased and used my receiver in a motorhome. The area we were in uses cable TV connections that were very snowy and had lot's of broken signals. I placed the RCA in the front windshield, ran an auto-scan and loaded channels. Of the 21 channels only two were less than very good signal. Different area's will give you different results.
I do not have the clock speed of the Acer AOA150 Noebook at hand, but from my practical experience, the upload and download speed of the Acer is more than adequate for my requirements for a portable computer that I use in my work for electronic communication and for upgrading my website. The Acer is excellent for finding and using Wi-Fi while on the road.
I think so...We have a 70" flat screen on this wall mount. My recollection when we purchased it 3 years ago was it held up to a 70" TV which was why we purchased it. At that time, there weren't lots of options for a 70". Have been very happy with it from the day it went up.
It should work
not sure about mygo I sent it to Puerto Rico it was too flimsy for me.
There is NO dvd/CD drive.I have one and love it,but WAY to small to have the DVD You would have to buy an external one.You can get one for around $75.
It is very easy to upgrade ram. I just did it and did not even look at a guide. Note that there is only one SO_DIMM slot, so you cannot buy a 1 gb stick and add on. I swapped out the 1 gb stick mine came with, with onee of two 2 gb sticks on my thinkpad. better value all round. also, i just read online that asus changed their policy of treating ram upgrade as voiding warranty. not sure though.
Copy the software from the CD to a flash drive and the plug the flash drive into the ASUS and youre good to go. Works for me. I also purchase a little slim CD/DVD burner on ebay for about 46 bux. it plugs into two of the usb points, one for data and one for power. It's about 1/2" thick and just a little bigger the a CD.
I am very sorry but I cannot advise you on what is legal and what is not legal.
Yes. You have to shoot in manual and only adjustment is shutter speed. This is not a zoom lens, but can be preset to many focal lengths. I wear an over the shoulder sling and it connects to the lens. The camera is light and just hangs by it's F connector. Anything over 650mm must be on a good heavy duty fluid tripod, but I have taken some great shots at 2400mm.
If it is ordered with the canon mount it will. Your camera will have to be in full manual mode and will record all metadata as a 50mm lens but it does work.
I used it to photograph the moon and it was great. I bought it for long shots at wildlife but the sky shots are great.
I have used it on my d5000, but I see no reason why it would not work on a d3200. The lens is robust, compact, and of good optical quality. Perfect as a general lens for travels etc. Only draw back is the bokeh. It is not a good lens for portraits
I have a sony a300 and not sure it fits your sony. When I purchased mine it came from 47th street photo. They were a great resource for questions that I had. Their phone number is 800-998-2066. Hope that helps.
No, the SoundDock remote will not operate the Solo system. You can order the correct remote for the Solo system by calling our Parts Dept.
Yes it does. I have the same setup and the hood screws inside the lens lip. I have mine on after a lens filter.
Yes, mine does that. I've had mine for over a year and been very happy with it.
Just radio mode doesn't work? If yes, I don't know. If no & you are on battery, check battery polarity& age. If one is weak, radio will stop working. Hope this helpd
Yes. It works well on a 650d.
I really enjoyed my Sigma 30mm, but the 24L is something different. $1100 is worth different things to different people. I found it to be a better focal length on a crop sensor (7D) for general indoor low light shooting.
One is a newer release of the olderversion. I couldn't firgure out the changes. The older was a lot cheaper. I bought it and love it. Of course I've got a great Yamaha receiver.
No - It did not include the cables. I purchased them seperate
The Moxi only works with cable or FIOS Moxi is compatible with any coaxial cable provider in the United States. This includes the largest cable providers: Comcast, Charter, Time Warner, and others.* The Moxi HD DVR works just fine with the Standard Definition programming you have and is ready for the day you add the HD content package and corresponding HDTV.
WD's website is the correct one @ 5 yrs. I purchased two caviar black 1TB drives a little over a week ago, and the warranty check on WD's website shows both are valid until 12/24/2014
I am sorry to tell you that I cannot answer that question! When I bought it, I made sure that it would work with a Canon SLR, and that it does wonderfully. There probably is a version of this flash unit that works with the fuji x cameras. Fuji support or Sunpak support could tell you that. All I know is that this flash on my Canon 5D works like a built-in flash; it's that synchronized! God bless and have a good day and a happy new year!
The C is for Canon cameras, the N is for Nikon cameras.
Hey Hun about 30cm long and yes it can work with your samsung but honestly I would recommend you go for the j5 instead of the j2 reason being is that it holds in your ear much better and it sound better but it is a little more then than the j2.hope you find this info helpful.

As of yet I have not had a problem with them, but it hasn't yet been a year.
They won't prevent you from hearing loud noises like say a motorcycle or truck when your out jogging,walking, etc (which may be a good thing) but they do a decent job of letting you hear the music with minimum interference. I think they are worth the price. You can spend more for better earbuds but if your looking for decent sound without high price they are worth the money.
I don't have a Samsung tablet but they do work with my wifi only Ipad2

I would say try to call them. My JBuds were great then one day they just stopped working.... O_o I called in, explained that they don't work and they shipped out new headphones the same day. I've never dealt with better customer service, no dumb questions were asked like "Did I cut the wire or chew it" (Sony customer service lol) they just sent it out. I could have gotten lucky but who knows, call them at 1.866.358.6640 and good luck.
It works with my iPod Touch, iPhone 4S, just as the same plug size as Apple earbuds.
David, it should hold over 60 lbs.
LaDonna, There is enough space for your socket for the power cord from your TV. My socket is located under the second cross bar and centered between the two verticle bars. My HDMI runs behind the wall. No wires can be seen when watching the TV. It's nice.
Yes
Yes it will
it is a little wider than a usb plug (about the size of a quarter) I would guess that you would be able to mount it in a panel that is up to 3/4 in thick
Well, I do have the one that came with the speakers...its an ac-dc outlet, build over a unique connector, and the dc output is 16 volts, 1,5 A.
The units we received were in sealed, factory boxes. I have no doubt they were new and unused.
I have a I3 quad-core cpu with the 3" tall cooler on it and it doesn't over heat at all - weird! you may wanna get ya a template for a 4" square vent holes above the cpu fan ...it may help. or add a fan above the CPU over the vent holes you drill into it, would be an option too. Hope I helped ya some. :)
Rima, You should not have to install XP on a new U100 -- it should be pre-installed. I suggest contacting the folks where you bought it and ask for a new machine. Regards, Joe

Night vision is usually associated with restrictions when hunting. As long as you do not have a rifle or pistol with you when using the night vision, you should be OK.
Yes, this will work with your GPS and this mount is way better than the TomTom one.
yes...but it is not solid fit. it will wovel/move L & R. The suction cup works better.
Leica makes one and Voigtlander and Dpreview.com has a lot of info about this Leica camera. Hope this helps:)
Yes! They are not attached at all, they just sit in the case.
Did you try replacing the fuse? It is underneath where the plug connects on the amp. Call BK customer support if that doesn't work. They are terrific.
I have exactly this same setup and problem. No ideas. Samsung mentioned that they don't support PiP, which seems like a ridiculous ideas since we can see video but just not get the audio. Jake

What are you trying to use it for?
You're not alone with this issue. When I first installed the ebook library software it did the same thing however, i just left it completely alone for a while and it resolved itself. I have also noticed however that the ebook library software slows down my computer pretty significantly for something that should use less resources than i tunes...maybe there's something else to this...
Yes. I use mine for mics and harmonicas, and have had no problems with the lid staying open while I'm setting up and tearing down.
About 30" or 32" yes centered
The headunit you have can definitely push them. But in order to achieve the maximum potential you should hook them up to a separate amp.
No John, there is no software of any kind included. This is just the "environment" for creating pictures. You will need a separate software to do what you need to do. Best regards. Felipe
Yes it is intended for 110V. I use a 220V to 110V trafo because I live outside the U.S.
It's 1.5 inches wide & can fit around a circumference of 12 inches (it's actual length is 13 inches)
Probably too big for that.
It works for playing and controlling and charging in older Mercedes and bmw ( only cars I've tried it in ). 2008 R Series Mercedes and 2009 5 series BMW.
Power adapter is 12VDC center post is positive (+), outer negative (-) DeX
You should be good to go. I don't keep it up all the time, but I have left it connected for weeks at a time. The hard drive is out in the open so it won't really overheat, and there is a power switch on it, so you can turn it off but leave it all setup when the drive is not in use.
I'm not sure what you are asking. You plug it in to a normal power plug for power and connect to a computer via USB. Then you plug either a 3.5" sata internal drive or a 2.5" sata internal drive into the dock. the 3.5" drives normally are used by desktop computers and the smaller by laptop or notebook computers. They do have to be sata drives and NOT IDE which are pin drives. Hope this helps
The remote works just fine, thanks.
OldAmazonian doesn't know what s/he's talking about. Yes yes and yes. It's seen as a mass storage device, just open the folder and drag the .avi files to your hard drive. Same on Win and Mac, the included software for those OSes is just bloatware in my opinion, don't need to install it.
The instructions don't mention computers by specific brand but do offer additional notes for cleaning a computer CD-ROM drive in the event that the Lens Cleaner doesn't automatically start the cleaning process (i.e., click on the the computer icon on the main screen, select CD-ROM drive or CD-Player option and press "Play.") Tech support is 800-377-5887 or techsupport@maxell.com.
Hi, It doesn't have a separate padded area but it does have a different area for the cables. The fact that it has a hard base that is sort of rounded at the sides, and you can separate the cable from the device, means it is nearly as good as having a padded area. Cheers!
You can install ACID Pro 7 on as many computers as you want.
You can but it's likely you'll need either an audio interface or mixing board for your mic. If you ready have either connected to your PC you should be fine.
It's all black.
I would say that this bag is way too big to be attached at the waist. It isn't set up for that either.

I thought the rebate reduced the price to ~$760. according to some comments
If you have vista on pc, on your pc: Open explorer -&gt; right click -&gt; share You might have to go to control panel -&gt; network -&gt;file sharing -&gt; to enable file sharing, etc On your netbook, Do a network scan on your netbook, find the hard drive, -&gt; then I think you can add the hardware as mapped drive. I make the assumption you know how to put both pc and netbook on the same network.
The HP Mini 311, Swirl Black is a new model netbook and has an HDMI port. Available soon on Amazon with Windows 7. Available now at Costco.
If you look directly at it, yes they are visible.

You have to purchase a DVR with an AV hard drive. I'm using zmodo's DVR and it works great with these, I just open my second order of these cams 5 minutes ago.
not as far as I can tell. there are a couple of hacks, but none are working for us so far. Deeply regret buying at this point.
I think so. I don't have the DVD player anymore. I bought a blue ray player. You are better off getting a blue ray player because you can play blue rays and DVDs in them. Plus for blue ray the picture is better. Anyway blue rays are becoming more popular.
I do not know! It works great in the western USA!
I bought Ni-MH AAA HHR-4DPA which replaces HHR-4MPA. It's the batteries required for my Panasonic phone, per manual.
I bought this and it's been working really great on a Apple Cinema 30" display @ 2560x1600 with a Macbook Pro & a Microsoft Surface Pro 3. Since I've had no compatibility problems with it, I think it should work fine on the Shimian 27 too. Only thing I'd point out with this device is that it gets its power from USB (that's the 2nd plug you see in the image) and it draws quite a bit of power. If you need to plug in a lot of additional usb devices with it it'll need a powered usb hub.
Hi, if I recall correctly USB 2 was problematic on the G3 PowerMacs. So try to find an used "Orange Micro USB 1.1 / firewire" card (perhaps eBay) and install it in your computer. Then connect your printer to the USB port. I'm assuming that you are using an older version of OS X, so the driver for your printer may not exist for your configuration.
It does not transfer sound. Only video signal.
no idea. sorry!
My hard drive was not packed well. Air bag underneath and on top but no sides so the packing had slipped to the side of it and the hard drive was touching bare box. I was very concerned when I opened the box but the drive appears to be ok.
If you have a Black and Green mirrored together, it will handle writes at only the speed of the slower drive - both drives must be written. Reads should be shared between the drives - I dunno if the OS would be smart enough to do more reads from the Black than the Green - I wouldn't count on it. Overall, not recommended. Best to use two of the same drives for a mirror.
Yep - excellent product. A must for all shoots. We use it all the time - the blimp that is. The muff (dead cat) is included and works miracles outdoors.
It is not really designed for the blimp. I tried to use My At875R with my blimp, but found I ended up with too contact noise. It works best with the windscreen designed for it.
They have the am key switches
Hi, Sorry I have no idea how to answer you question. I bought this product because it was highly recommended for transferring cassettes to CD's. It did not dissapoint. I am selling it now, in great condition if you are interested.
You need to download and install the software from the manufacturers website. The software included in the package is obsolete.
There are several options to charging a USB device other than a computer. Many stores carry car adapters that plug into your car's power point and converts it to 5V USB. There are also home devices that do the same. See links below. http://www.amazon.com/Cigarette-Lighter-Adapter-Players-Charger/dp/B000CC6I5W/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1291143231&sr=1-1http://www.amazon.com/Eforcity-Charger-Adapter-PalmOne-Tungsten/dp/B000FAVYHS/ref=sr_1_18?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1291143288&sr=1-18
Charger works very well, I am happy with it.
The reflector must be plugged into a ballast; the ballast then plugs into the wall. You cannot plug a reflector directly into an outlet (need a ballast equivalent to bulb size)
It will not work with Bluetooth and the size is 17.3 x 6.1 x 0.6 inches ; 1.8 pounds
Yes, it works with Macs. Not all functions, but the basic stuff does. These are my favorite keyboards, nice soft, quiet feel. I even prefer them over the thin mac bluetooth keyboards.
You could try eBay, or the hp site? Maybe someone is selling a used or broken keyboard and you can use for spare parts...
Nope only for SATA drives.
Didn't work for me... it probably depends on WHY the PC isn't seeing it.
It will work with any sata drives. I assume that the barracuda is a sata drive. So if this is true, it will work.
No
It would probably be easier/cheaper to just use Over The Air digital TV signals if you are fine with only the networks and independent stations. FTA is harder to use if you're moving this trailer around, and cheaper either way as an antenna is much cheaper than a dish and receiver.
I think it is for adapting four third lenses to micro four third body, cannot work with Canon lenses.
I am not sure. It worked for me in Germany but not in Italy.
I used it in Spain with my laptop charger and it worked fine so I think it should be good!
mine came as a small square box
I wouldn't recommend this product. Very poorly made. Purchase the hard wire cable that's made by garmin. That's what I did after I received this one.
If it is a micro 4/3 specification it will
Yes, go to http://panasonic.jp/support/global/cs/dsc/download/fts/index.html
Yes
It won't work upside down a the tension spring is built to hold one way.
The clamp included is the only option unless you go with a grommet mount
It's not an Apple-friendly device. The DisplayLink software clogs my Apple CPU. Don't know about pre-Intel.
Yes. It does access FM stations and amplify the sound a bit, but it doesn't have great reception, and it does draw heavily from the battery.
I am using the Actiontec GT701D with Century Link right now and it works perfectly. Here is the link to the Century Link modem compatibility chart: http://internethelp.centurylink.com/internethelp/modem-compatibility-table-q.html
Yes, worked fine for us with centurylink, was specific reason we sought it out (recommended for centurylink).
MP3 audio at a decent bit rate is about 1 MB per minute. A typical pop song takes about 3 or 4 MB. If this is the case for your music collection, 1 GB will hold approximately 250 songs.
Took someone long enough to respond, but yes.
I would have have to say yes. I am using it for all my digital photos. Seems to work fine.
I used the hx2303 driver from the chipset manufacturer, prolific's website.
No.
I have a Cisco PLK300 connected to a NETGEAR router on my windows 7 home premium edtion pc and I am using the PLK300 for my game systems (360/PS3) and other media/netflix streaming devices on the other side of the house where the wireless signal is not as great as it is on the other side of the house and I haven't had any problems for several months now.
Not entirely sure what you mean, but, they have a clearly marked mute switch on the cord - but they do not indicate if your computer sound is muted, only the headphones.
Snug and would work in RV. you can make it snug by tightening the bolts.
NO It is a wall mount only.
It measures 1 3/4 inches wide by 6 3/4 inches tall. Very small footprint.
Yes, it does.
In theory you can have ship to shore communications on some channels but under very limited circumstances. It should involve necessary communications that are germane to water navigation, not grocery lists or where you want to eat that evening. You can always tune in and listen anywhere.
I doubt it's waterproof, it's an inexpensive bag. I wouldn't trust it in a thunderstorm
I am not sure Jia.... I bought it for Canon 7d and it is working fine
Invert them
Any 12 inch grill will work
Jacketed diameter is 1mm. Stripped is about 0.55 mm.
1-year limited Warranty
It is ready to use. I'm not sure if it will fit your HP touchmaster. I bought a 6TB for my computer, installed, plugged the cable and Win recognized it!
It says, "The Dedicated Power Zoom Shoe-Mount is an autofocus TTL power zoom lens for digital Olympus SLR cameras." Is the E600 a digital Olympus SLR? If so (it is) then the product description says it works on that camera. You could always contact Bower to see if the E600 is an exception.
It does not, and like most cameras of this type, low light will result in grainy footage.
I don't know. Personally, if I want slow-mo I alter the speed in Premiere Pro..
Speakers don't make 7.1. The receiver amp is the key.
You will need to run COAxial cable, from the antenna to the television. You can use splitters to send it to several televisions. We have 7 televisions attached from basement and 2 floors of our home. All get great reception. There is a wireless remote to control direction of the antenna. We get at least 20 stations with the directional control in one position. Once in a while a small tweek is needed to receive some outlying stations.
I think so. You can use a splitter to divide the signal between multiple televisions. However, the antenna can only point in one direction at a time; so if one TV needs the Antenna pointed North, and the other South, only one TV will be happy.
No it will not. You can call our tech and he will explain it to you. His number is 1-502-815-0370
I returned this remote because it was completely defective and did not program my dvd player that was on the list of options.....
They do work.
The mounting hardware is included, but no rotator cable. You just need outdoor doorbell cable (three conductor) unless the rotator is going in the attic. Also, make sure your mast isn't too large in diameter.
This " turns" the antenna , in the direction of the channel stations. Yes "I" , get UHF & VHF HDTV , I'm using a Winegard antenna.
I think that 90 lbs is too much weight .It might work for awhile but you need to check with the manufacturer to be sure.
didn't work for me,but I was able to use some parts to make it work.
The manufacturer says 2000 watts which is 500 watts over the allowed 1500 watts allowed in amateur radio. But, it doesn't say for how long a period of time, assuming SSB operation NOT AM which would be continuous. From what I've heard on the air you can 'melt' the inside of the antenna if you push it too much for too long.
Yes, it is rugged enough to take a reasonable amount of abuse! :) Surely it is not intended for game playing. The processor, memory and display card are not suitable for that. It serves as a platform for communicating over the Internet, word processing and data show presentations.
Sure. (With a reciprocating saw you can make anything fit)
No it does not. But I wish I had spent A little more money and got a better one.
No. This is a manual, single play turntable
I have the same problem and I would love to know the reason for this.
No software. Used for speakers and stereo. Normal coaxial audio connect. Red and white for audio. If this one can be used on a computer, it's news to me.
There is a great forum for all kinds of WDTV information and help. They also have an area for hacking the player and using to play additional formats - including network support! Its at WDTVforum.com
No.
It has glue attached, so you stick it directly onto the camera's screen. I have them on all my cameras, from small Panasonic Lumix travel zooms, to my Canon DLSRs. I've never had one pop off.
I don't know about the particulars of the Olympus XZ-2 but the measurements of the Giotto's SP8300 are for the outside edge 6.6cm x 4.9cm (2 19/32" by 1 15/16") including black rim. Just the view screen dimensions are 6.0cm by 4.4cm (2 3/8" by 1 23/32"). No obscuring lettering at all on the clear screen (i.e. smaller dimensions). Hope that helps. (Note: measurements are accurate to the mm and the 32nd of an inch).
Yes, The unit plugs directly into an AC receptacle and the battery slides into the charger.
Yes.
It goes into power saving mode automatically when not in use. Alternatively you can put it upside down to avoid accidentally activating the optical sensor.
Not sure, I use mine as a computer storage backup, but I don't see why not
Yes. On the batteries I purchased it is stamped CR17345 under Lithium.
I believe the AE-1 used fd lens mount. So yes it will fit. I have used this adapter on many of my fd lens with no problem.
No
No, just the 3 filters shown.
Yes. It screws on nicely to the lens.
The same thing. 18% grey is generally considered the benchmark for setting white balance, but some cameras and some photo editing software prefer or work better with white or black cards. Likewise, in certain situations, you may find they provide a better measurement for white balance than the gray card.
Connectors (total 10): One (1) ATX 2.03 connector (24-pin) One (1) 12V connector for P4 motherboards Five (5) IDE 4 PIN connectors One (1) Floppy 4 PIN connector Two (2) SATA connectors
Yes, this mount will fit vesa 100x100mm.
This item does not work with a great deal of Dell computers. The inspiron series is one such model. The only model I could get it to work with, is the Latitude. This model is so old that there are not many working ones out there. If you are a Dell owner, be very careful.120W Universal Laptop AC Power Supply for IBM DELL HP/Compaq SAMSUNG SONY TOSHIBA ACER FUJITSU ASUS AMS AVERATEC Compaq Gateway HP NEC Panasonic Sharp Dynabook Winbook laptops (output support:15 Volts,16 Volts,18 Volts, 19 Volts,
Question is "what do you need". These are multi use lenses, and you can use them in many different configurations, either individually or you can stack them on top of each other. They screw into each other. So really they're good for whatever you need. Check if 52mm is the diameter that fits the thread of your lens though, they come in different diameters.
Yes. If your camera supports a SD card, then this one should fit. You want to look for at least a class 10 of SD card to accommodate a faster camera speed. This one is...
I don't know about the model number. I use it on a Garmin Nuvi 360A.
That is a question?
Yes
Yes, it has velcro to properly hold it to the flash
It will work on any flash, its just a matter of fitting the lip of the diffuser to the tip of the flash and securing it there. I use the sb600, and its a little bit loose, I had to use stronger velcro ties to make sure it stays in place.
No. You'd need the adapter to go to a 30 pin apple connector. This doesn't come with an iphone 5 adapter.
No only iphone 4
I think you could, as long as your pants/spandex/whatever were tight enough. My jersey style gym shorts would bounce a bit on the elastic waist. It's fine to wear everyday and fits snugly on a belt.
Get separate speakers, onboard audio is never good, people need to be more realistic.
Yes it does ! Most of my walks/runs are on a treadmill :)
You do not have to have the shoe. I have Nike frees shoes n I bought one of those pocket sleeve things you can put the sensor in and lace it up to you shoe. Works great.
unfortunately it CAN'T be charged ,so you could say that it doesn't need to charge at all
It works. Are you military? If so, go to militarycac.com and follow instructions for Apple users.
Im not sure we have windows.
no viene con dongle, no lo necesita ya que tiene dos entradas para las dos antenas.
I suspect that it won't be shipped in the original package, not that it matters, so long as it works. Chances are that the original owner has bought the newer version of the card or maybe it was sold with a system to get money. Though I don't speak for the seller, I have one of these cards and it is awesome.
Yes. You just have to order the one with Cannon mount. Excellent lens with very good reviews. I haven't had a chance to use a lot but I really like it and it's very well constructed. One nice feature is the push/pull ring going from Auto to Manual. Mine has increased in price since I purchased it. It got good reviews on several well respected review sites. I do extensive research before I purchase any electronics and this was no exception. I did my homework.
Works brilliantly with all things Apple. Didn't work with a Nokia Lumia 920 so if your kindle's on the same kind of Bluetooth as the Nokia Lumia 920, it won't work.
240VAC @ 1A or 30VDC @ 2A
I would think that the best answer to this question could come from an actual iMac repair person, there are times when the seller can tell you what systems the memory sticks are compatible with. If they can't provide this info drop in to your nearest BestBuy or call and ask, I'm sure you do not want to waste cash or cause damage to you computer to find it's not compatible. Also check they packaged disc or information for your Mac system online, it might point you in the right direction...best of luck!
one
You can use it for anything. It is just pre marked with some items for convenience. You can plug anything into any of the outlets. It comes with other tabs so you can cover up the ones if you put another device in that socket.
yes
Yes, the kind that you put a screw in the wall and insert the head into the slot on the back and slide it slightly to secure it. There are two holes so you could mount it vertically or horizontally. I know this because I used them to mount mine. Hope this helps. BTW, this is a great unit. It is larger than you would expect though. Check the dimensions in the specs. It has a nice long cord also.
It's only for 110v.
Left mine playing its games until it was "Dead" flat. Rapid charged it via usb until it said it was full and then reset the time and date. Its behaved perfectly since!!! Odd but it seems to have worked! Good luck to all :0)
Hey D. Scoma, Try this... After you copy all your clips from your Vado HD, you can add those files to this program (Free trial) http://www.avidvdburner.com/ and it'll automatically burn it onto a DVD that can be played on any DVD.
I've had the same problem, its winamp. The file plays fine in Nero and Windows Movie Maker
That's actually a good point. Where would you put the tri-pod and can the product stand upright?
490mm (19")
If I remember correctly the bolts tightened the bracket to the bar so there was no room for sliding...we have never tilted the tv to the side though so it's never been a problem.
No, if you need digital audio inputs, look into the 550HSD or 575HSD. Much larger, so they may not be in your budget/space requirements.
Unfortunately, we can only ship to the 48 contiguous states and not to other countries.
My headphone broken after 2 months. Left speaker wasn't work... And I couldn't get the new one because of the policy and I will NEVER get anything like that...
Yes. It's a powerfull amp.
4 channel
If I am not mistaken the alpha-numerical designation for a 2 line phone cord is RJ-11 6P4C. The 4C stands for 4 contacts which handles 2 lines. Green & red to line 1, black & yellow to line 2. I know this doesn't help you with this particular cord, but if you search for the aforementioned phone cord designation you should be able to find a cost effective cord. A better explanation can be found here: http://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/50559/rj-11. Hope this helps.
I bought it for the same thing and it was too long to even have any connection. I also tried it on my radar detector and it didn't transfer that signal either. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this for anything.....it's entirely way too long. It may work for a telephone, but I didn't have one so I can't say that'll work either
No, only if they are 12"
No low-priced telescopes are made in the US. This is imported from China, like most telescopes.
If your battery has the same 9 slots that will match up then it should charge it. Otherwise no it would not work.
YeS
I don't know this one just put my GPS in data mode no charge. It useless because Mt garmin will not work.
The battery I have says 7800
yes
I agree with Joe B. Too small.
The shelf-life of Li-ion battery "should not" affect the storage capacity as long as it's never been used. I said "should not" because I can't guarantee it. However, I bought this battery and the capacity was never as much as it claims, and starts to weaken after only about 6 months of use.
Yes it can. In fact, we've never used it with headphones. I was concerned about headphones in a child so young.
3 1/2 years old - he still likes it now that he is 4 1/2 years old
yes, believe it takes 4 c size. i prefer to plug in, seems much better transmission and reception. mine are in baja mexico, outside around the pool for several years and still work great. i finally had sailcloth covers made since the sun down here is brutal
From what I hear this is the last keyboard for Mac computers that Logitech will make. There will be some gaming keyboards but that's it.
I bought this for my grandson who is "technology wise" It broke within a week. He states poor quality.
It operates and functions for all intents and purposes as a wireless keyboard / mouse combination. If you can run a USB mouse / keyboard on the DVR, it should work. I have used this now on 3 machines and have never had to install a driver as it is just seen as a standard input device.
Yes
I don't know for sure but I know that it will not work on the standard Kindle Fire. I just looked at my kid's and the ports are too small for the cable to fit in.
well i don't use regular dvd cases i use the single sleeves and i get about 600 dvd's in it.
Yes
Yes it can be flush mounted, or on an angle through a straight hole on a flat surface.
I cannot answer how it performs vs a license plate camera, but it does have a great field of view, and worked excellent at night. I had taken rubber trailer hitch cover and drilled a hole it it and mounted the camera in there so I did not have to drill holes in the bumper or body. This was a great solution for my Chevy Avalanche.
I googled the answer... I'll look for the answer after the bears v packers game
I also bought a radio with the rear backup camera option so a separate monitor is not needed. The radio video screen is the monitor. If you don't have a compatible radio or rear view mirror then you will need a separate monitor.
no that is NOT supposed to look like that.
I suggest you see the westone's official web, and I remember this one belongs to the different product line from UM3X.
The C drive has a round eject button. It looks like the only other difference, according to the Samsung website, is the US-RW write speed is limited to 16x on the C drive. The B drive can burn US-RW at 24x.
What issues are you having? Does the unit power up? It can be tricky to find the right station to tune to. I had to switch from the default before I could hear my player.
Sometimes you have to swap old then new batteries over and over several times before the laptop will recognize the new battery. That about all I know. Ron
Yes. That means that they send you a power supply charger and an electrical cord to attach a power unit for an electrical outlet.
It didn't work on mine and then when I paid to mail it back I was never rein-burst. I would not buy it. I am still waiting on being paid back and then for the mailing that I paid for....
I use the one it came with, same adapter and power cord.
I can't say for sure but as long as the charger fits and the Voltage and Amperes are the same it should work since the laptop chargers are the same brand. This charger has 18.5V and 6.5A output, and inputs of 100-240V and 50-60Hz. Check on your charger to see if the input and output values match (aside from the watts W). If they do then this charger should work.
I purchased this part for E1505 which is same as the E6400 model. I did look up 6000 model online and it looks pretty much like the E1505. Therefore I believe your chances that it will work is good. I would buy it to try it. It doesn't cost all that much. I've had my keyboard for over a year now and it works pretty close to the original OEM keyboard from Dell.
Hello from Mediabridge, These cables are fulfilled by Amazon so the shipping cost would follow their cost structure. They have "Free shipping on orders of $25 or more" so if you bundle 2 of these with other things you could take advantage of that. Otherwise the standard cost is $4.99+$.59/lb. and then it goes up from there for expedited shipping unless they are running promotions at the time. Here is the link to their shipping rates and policies:
Hello Lynette, I would contact that manufacturer to see if you have the correct port for this cable. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@mediabridgeproducts.com
Have connected a Nikon D5100, a Sony Camcorder and various items with a mini-HDMI port. Before I buy any cables I check to see if Mediabridge has it first. Great quality; if the Mediabridge cable does not work for your camera than there is something wrong with the camera.
Not sure of the exact specs on this cable,but I get no bottleneck,even on 3D.The Mediabridge Ultra(red/black) IS speced out to provide 10.2 Gbps.I would suggest you look at that one.I hope this helps,the cost of the Ultra is negligable as compared to the Flex.
The floppy included does not list win 7. I plugged it in the usb and Win 7 64n bit recognized it immediately. I was able to view photos as well as format disk. Slower than having it built into the machine, but don't know if that is just the nature of the beast... works fine so far. It is recognized a drive A: in the My Computer section
I'm using it on Vista. Certain image formats seem to have difficulty copying, but .JPG is no problem. I haven't tested it with all audio/video formats but have incurred no problems.
Kensington hosts them on their website. Directions on insert in box or google it.
Let me know if you figure out what happened. Mine is doing the same thing.
It will work for power not for traffic
Yes I believe it will.
Yes if it fits
Yes
Nope ! It is a light weight tripod for cameras . You could fine attachment to use with this. I got one for my HTC phone but the attachment does not fit my new larger phone
its very light and comes in a case with strap for shoulder
Should be a screw on top of the tripod and an opening on the bottom of the camera. :-)
I don't know about canon, I have an Olympia and it works great, looks like it fits most cameras as long as you have a hole in bottom of the camera for the holder to screw into. Sorry I could not be more help. I do like the tripod. Carol
I am running a late '08 15" 2.4GHz and am running 8GB, so yes it is possible to run 8GB of memory. Apple came out with a firmware update after release, but never updated the specs to reflect the new maximum memory capability.
I figured out which type my computer needed from this site http://www.crucial.com/apple/. You just plug in your computer specs and it should point you in the right direction. I attempted to check this for you, but I was not sure if your computer is quad, 6, or 12 core.
First, the hood is made of a stiff rubber material. So, it will flex slightly and makes an exact measurement difficult. However, the interior dimensions are 2-17/32" x 1-15/16" with approximately a 1/8" fillet in the corners.
yes, i have a lenova touchscreen with windows 8 and have no problem with it.
no it will not work with the 5000 GPS
Use a laptop universal.
It will recognize both voices. Unlike some older or lower end cell phones, you don't have to program or "teach" it recognize a voice. It comes out of the box doing so.
I would wait,new units with live traffic coming soon
Fairly elastic material. They are not madefor 17 inch, and you can tell one the laptop is inside. But these people want te sell thses so ad says 17", but you are right, it is not perfect fit.
I return to Amazon because did not work
No
Punched out, includes a clear sticker.
Sorry to say we worked on this laptop for two days and in no way could we even connect it to the internet less more the blue tooth.
Probably not.
Go directly to the SquareTrade website to purchase a warranty for your eBay purchased laptop. It will give you a spot to enter the eBay item number.
First 30 days anything and any place u buy from
Probably, if it is new. Best way to be sure is call Square Trade direct and ask. There number is 1-877-927-7268. Hope this helps.
Yes
Everything I have seen suggests that, as long as you save the receipt, and it shows a purchase within 90 days (and the item is new), that you can buy this warranty for an item purchased at Staples.
I don't understand the question. The experience I have had with this company they refunded my money for the device that was warrantied after I had owed it for over 1 year.
In all cases the warranty must be purchased prior to the expiration of the manufacturer's warranty. In addition, the warranty must be purchased within a certain time period after purchase; but I can't recall if that's 30 days or 90 days etc.
The pages are not plastic, slip photo into open frame
I'm not 100% sure but I believe it's 5/16th

I believe there is a bushing in there so you can use a smaller gauge wire. I will check when I get home to be sure. They make adapters to go up or down in gauge size if you want to do that.
Hello, to change the keyboard settings, if you are using Windows, go to the Start Menu select Control Panel then Ease of access. Scroll to bottom you will see small hypertext saying keyboard settings. You would want to select for a Slow rate of speed. There is a line dial that you can adjust. Good Luck
yes
Yes mine it came with a remote. Be sure to check the seller descriptions if you're buying used though.
No you can not. I am looking for one now that is Internet ready.
Beautiful and functional !
I had no problems at all; pull the leads off the old battery, remove it and put in the new battery, and the leads went right on. No drama :)
It's not made for the keyboard. It is made for the screen. I suppose you could use it for the keyboard, but probably a damp cloth with a tiny bit of gentle soap would be just fine for the keyboard. It wouldn't hurt it, though.
Yes, this kit is suitable with an IPS monitor.
I assume your question is: Does it work with an iPod touch first generation? Not familiar with that particular iPod..BUT...it is a 30 pin unit. If the Ipod touch first generation is a 30 pin unit as well...then YES...it will work. If, however, the iPod touch first generation is not a 30 pin unit, you will have to get an adapter AND this unit to make it work.
By a few included brackets and a backplate
All APC Back-UPS systems use F2 terminals.
No, it doesn't fit retina Macbooks
Yes! I have stickers on mine that I can see just fine. :)
Yes!its pink same color as the cover :-)
It fits my June 2012 Macbook Pro perfectly. I don't know if the dimensions have changed.
This model has a Zone A left and right as well as a Zone B left and right. So its set up for 4 speakers direct without any special wiring.
No you can not use it for that its a input for mp3 players
I really don't know if it will work for your Satellite. I had someone help me with mine. Sorry Musicman.
yes
It definitely does. I use it on my ARM Chromebook, and it's great for hotel rooms that has poor wifi connectivity.
No, this is designed for a computer. Perhaps you are looking for a USB memory stick rather than a network adapter?
The camera has a self timer and its really easy to use
No only 35mm by the way the camera itself is not working properly. Don't know if I am able to get money back.
35mm is size of the film, is not related to the distance of the lense.
what happened to the price? it was 999 a week ago
6GB, the same as when new. The memory tests fine. The battery and charger are functioning properly.
It does. FN+Space turns the back light on and off.
The arms and monitor connectors are movable. I'm a programmer, so I sit on my butt all day. My top three monitors are angled down toward me, and my bottom three are at eye level so they aren't angled. The side arms are angled toward where I sit, so similar to a turret fashion as you would prefer. As a programmer, 6 monitors is a little overkill,.. but it's great bragging rights.
I'm applied this. http://www.amazon.com/SilverStone-CP05-Convenient-Hot-Swap-Supports/dp/B001NPEBG0/ref=sr_1_8?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1407982745&sr=1-8&keywords=silverstone Thank you.
Yes it does
It mostly works with Windows 7 as a client now, but there is better compatibility coming with Power Pack 3. This should be released "soon"...
No. This is a chip reader. If you want to extract data from your kindle, use the USB cord provided by amazon. If you want to load images from your camera's data card onto your kindle, you'd have to first load the images to a computer and transfer them via the provided USB. Kindle Fire has a micro USB port, and the Transcend has a full size USB connector.
I don't see why it would not work. It works with my Surface 1
Not sure if this is possible but I have used it to transfer 8 gb worth to files from sd card to sd by creating a folder on my desktop and copying all data from one card and then switching cards and pasting the data in a new folder on the new card. There is only one micro sd card slot and one mini sd card slot so if you are trying to transfer from micro to micro it would have to be one at a time.
Yes it does, i have 64gb micro sd
Yes, cracked case,pulled 512 card and added new 1gig card and swapped the wireless card with a wireless n intel card. Cracking the case is not for the feight of heart. You tube has several AAO instruction videos. Go slow, keep screws organized and use a new mini screwdriver. Vista (did that upgrade last month) fired up as before; aerthos wireless card drops are gone.
Yes, the G9X uses the same Logitech Gaming Software as the G13. I'm currently running a G13 game pad, G9X mouse and G930 headset on LGS 8.46.27.
They don't cover it. By definition (their definition), a cracked screen means abuse, which is not covered. Google Acer Aspire One cracked screen, and you see that others had cracked screen for no obvious reasons.
Yes, it will replace it and it lasts forever. And because it is so much bigger it tilts the keyboard slightly and makes it much better to type on.
yes
No, but this size similar
No, it just takes two pictures. To get to a 3D printer you'd need to reconstruct the depth from stereo, a very difficult problem from just two views.
No windows 7, however it has the graphics card. I find it getting slower with the newer software and would look into a windows ten model. Nvidia GeForce 6150 SE graphics (up to 1343 MB total) Pre-installed with Windows Vista Home Premium (32-bit, SP1)
Fine. This is a pass through device only. Can't even tell it's there.
I bought my PK from a catalog and not the directly from the company. Mine also did not work properly when I tried to use it. I called the company and they suggested that it was possibly because it had been on a shelf somewhere for awhile and the software was out of date. The company emailed me updated software and it worked perfectly. It was very simple to use and I had no further problems with it. I hope you get it working.
I've never tried it but it is set up in the same files as on your computer.
I'm on my 2nd pair and even after taking extreme caution in handling, the same exact piece has started to crack again. Do yourself a favor, if you buy ANY headsets, make sure the frame from ear to ear is 100% metal. This plastic pivot clamp design is just dumb.
Yes
You could use them for that but the headset isn't that great for music editing IMO, I wouldn't use this headset for that, better off buying good headphones and a mic
It'll probably get pretty tight with liner notes and discs in both sides of the pages, especially if the notes are more than a few pages thick.
That I cannot answer. This was the flash that was recommended when I search for A390 flashes. From looking at other flashes it appear shoes should be universal
Bulbs never usualy fail on flash make sure there's power at flash first. Bulbs are not replaceable and if they are it's cheaper to buy a new flash.
It is great.
Yes
Yes you can. It will work perfectly!
On the manual it says it will
yes, 1
Hard to say for sure, but in our house we have 1 room that gets 2 bars the the built in WiFi adapter - with the Alfa we get 4 bars. Seems to me like it's definitely worth a shot!
The one I received has the Realtek 8187 chipset.
Nope. No backlight I have seen.
Mine never heated up at all. Some heat won't hurt it if it's slighty warm if it's very hot so it burns you I would stop using it contact Kodak see what they can do for you.
QVC says you get 20 minutes recording time for each gig. 4 gigs equals 80 minutes.
make sure you clear your memory and try a new SD Card
Though my memory is a bit hazy regarding this specific product because I bought it 4 years ago, I do not remember this coming with a remote control.
It does not work with Adobe Premier Elements in its raw (MOV) format. This is because it is in High Definition. Once it has been converted by the included ArcSoft or other software to a standard format, it works fine. My review discusses this issue.
BUMP. Same question. I've been waiting awhile to get even a tiny camcorder b/c I figure wait as long as you can, then buy what's current. Some stuff I'll want to do, not sure if I can wait any longer than mid April. Anyone from Amazon please comment...
For me, zero. Didn't work
yes, but be aware that since the adapter is running Java, it needs the external HD formatted to FAT32. If the external drive uses NTFS, the adapter will tell you it needs formatting because it can't read it. This has max-size implications too.
I think because if it's used it's less and if it's new it's NOT.
Kodak no longer offers any support or downloads for this camera's software but Google "Easyshare Camera ( model #) Software" and you will find some alternate links. As I recall I think I found mine on cnet; as I was in the same boat as you.
What
If you connect via a standard audio cable it should work. Not sure if the data/charging cable will work, unless it's compatible with the old (pre 5) iPhone form factor.
The connector for charging is iPhone format. But otherwise there's a separate audio input which is standard 3.5mm cable input. Probably not optimum for Android/Galaxy since you would need a separate charger.
Jacqueline, Search SDCopy. It is a free piece of software that will convert the .MOD files to mpg, and also set the flag for 16:9 aspect ratio which is widescreen, then it will play correctly. Mark
I have the original DSC-H20, and we gave the DSC-H20/B to my father-in-law for Christmas. His looks and is almost exactly the same as mine, but it has a few more options in the manual and program modes. Specifically I recall that he had more shutter speeds and focus distances to choose from. Edit: Sorry, I was mislead! My camera was missing some ISO speeds, etc. in the menus for some reason (stopped at 800 instead of 3200). But they just appeared. Must have been a firmware glitch!? :(
Hi Joe, For instruction on how to use the PMB pls see this link: https://docs.sony.com/release/DSCH20_EN_ES.pdf and navigate to page 42. Thanks. -Anthony
No
I'd like an answer to Juan's question.
It is normal, that is the lens cover rattling.
Yes, it does.
Yes we have this too...plus a ticking noise! My husband just noticed it, and was like what the heck? You can actually hear it on the video while playing back if we are recording in absolute silence. When he shuts off the auto focus the ticking noise stops. I would be interested in others with this camcorder to comment on the noise.....I mean is this a defect or something that is just the way the camcorder is?
No
Don't wast your money!!! There garbage! I hard wired them!! Very cheap. You will be disappointed if you purchase these!!
HDMI requires every pin to handle the high definition processing. Putting an HDMI end on a VGA cable doesn't make it an HDMI cable. If you need HDMI on both ends search for an HDMI cable and you're bound to find pages of them and what works for you. In order for the HDMI to VGA to successfully work you need a powered electronic converter. That would cost more than the real HDMI cable that you need.
I've read several posts/reviews that confirm that it has image stabilizer, but if it does, it is modest in effect; and, I suppose it should be, otherwise like YouTube's strong image stabilizer, the video can become very distorted looking with significant image stabilization.
Yes
Apparently you cannot create multiple disc on this Sony Express DVD writer. You can only create one disc at a time. -Ely
Every DVD I've burnt with it has played on all DVD players I've encountered so far. I dont know what NTCS format is, but it works great for north american dvd players.
It did for me.
No, the adapter itself won't make any appreciable difference to sound.
They are made in Germany best headphone in the world apart from the stax 009 but even than their is not much between these 2 headphones
Cayin HA-1A Eddie Current Zana Deux HeadAmp GS-X MK II All winners.
Yes
No, it will not work in a laptop. It is designed for a spacious desktop/tower with lots of room for an attached cooling fan. You need to search for the Intel (or AMD) CPU that mates to your laptop's specific motherboard.
You need to know what motherboard your using then go to the manufactures Web site look for downloads and drivers then look for bios updates
That was a good question. I took the stand off the back of the unit, slid it in backwards and it works. What you will need to do is drill some holes in the stand ring, so you can put in some wood screws to mount it. It will work, just be a little creative.
Yes. This is the same power supply.
It should work. I think that the power supply is the standard one for most of the older receivers. Good luck!
It comes with a battery and a charger
Thank you for your inquiry. This product is for 58mm, it is impossible. Thank you.
According to the Olympus technical manager, this model does not have the Perfect Shot Preview feature. The technical information provided at the Olympus website is in error.
The unit I received overheated and smoked. I wouldn't suggest using it for anything.
No the neighbors cannot piggyback on it. It needs to be plugged into your machine and it is password protected.
Your only limit is the amount of memory your backup drive has. We have three computers, and we back all three up with the same Clickfree and the same backup drive.
I called tech support and the rep, after a few seconds hesitation when I mentioned "64", said yes, click-free does support Win7 64bit
Its only USB 2, I recommend checking their website-Clickfree.com they have newer items with USB 3 & Windows 8 on down. Hope this helps.
A DVD player and a power inverter, unless you already have a indash DVD player for your radio, then you could just hook the monitor up to that.
It does cover a very wide space on the ceiling. I had no problems installing it. You may want to check the wiring you have factory. I had a multidisc CD player in a explorer and it was only compatible with a factory oem multidisc player from ford. The screen has a positive and negative for power then a standard av 3 wire hock up.
Hi Alcides, yes, the camcorder does have S-video input. Thanks_Mitch
Dan is right, it won't work.
No
Yea it should. you may want to have small blocks under the box to raise it up off the floor for more room for your sub cone to have full excursion. but that only depends on the subs you are planning on using in it.
I use the YCam app and it works fine for me for sound and live video. I think there are several others that work with it as well, maybe some others can chime in too
If you contact the company they are very helpful. Just email them and they response quickly. Anytime I had a question like that all I did was email their support.
Hi K. Gross, I have been using Live Cams Pro for my iPhone as a way to monitor my Sharx IP cameras. I highly recommend Live Cams Pro as the interface is clean and intuitive with the ability to easily go from multi-camera to single camera view. You can also quickly grab screens or initiate a recording by simply tapping on an icon. I also use FTP Client Pro on my iPhone to access my FTP server where I have the Sharx camera video going to. Another easy interface into videos created from my Sharx Security cameras.
that is hard to answer. I have used no-ip to view over the internet and we have done multible user with no slow down but only 2 people. I have 4 cameras at a site and they look at them on there 3 systems in house also with me over the net with no slow down. but it depends on if your talking in house or over the net. Then it would depend on your router and internet speed. hopefully that will help you
a netbook is a smaller sized laptop basically.
I'm eager to hear what they say, please post when you find out! I hadn't realized this could be a problem, I just assumed they all had the extra slot. good thinking =)
I bought a MSI 120 this past March for my grandson and the charger died in September. I've tried to purchase a new charger from the MSI site and have it sent directly to my grandson but they refused to send it unless I added his address to my charge card. I told them I was not going to do that so they canceled my order. I've not been able to find a reputable online site for a replacement. Can you provide the URL of the site you bought your replacement? Thanks.
It looks to me that the only difference between 024us and 020us is 020us comes with 1)Bluetooth and 2) 802.11n, while 024us has no bluetooth and only 802.11b/g. Check this out: http://www.msimobile.com/nblist.aspx?series=U120

This is not an amp, so it only minimally enhances. At either end of the dial, when reducing or enhancing, you get static.
I would recommend having at least 500w-800 for a good pound, if u want a comp system it'll hold up to 3500 watt amp. But that's professional hook ups for that, I run these 2 12s with a SSL 1500 watt amp only pishing 700 and it rattle my car!
Itll push it. But if you want it to hit hard id recommend a better amp. Wire the sub to 2 ohms for the amps full potential.
I wouldn't recommend it. It is a plastic that would probably crack. They have cable covers that would suit your need./cb
i have these subs hooked up with two infinity kappas 225w, and i have a 500w kenwood amp. The sound is powerful and crisp. If i could lead someone to a two channel amp with these subs, alongside speakers; I would go for a 600-700w amp. With the subs Alone, I would use a 400w amp and turn the amps output down.
We got 2
im not for shure not much though. they come with spacer plates and are a little bit bigger in diameter than the standard 5 1/4. im playing them on a 480 watt 4 channel amp and they are still clean sounding after a year. they also played fine on the head unit with out a amp. i would recomend to any one wanting crisp sound. look on rockfords website to be sure
Does your amp have a built in cross over? These are full range speakers. But they won't handle a lot of bass, so base blockers is an option. Or you can buy an active crossover and adjust the frequency. Also, make sure your amp is putting out enough to avoid clipping or you will could damage the speakers. Steve Meade makes a tool to adjust your amp properly. And be aware, if the amp is cheap, it may not put out the power it says it does.
They do not come with grills
I am quite sure it does. But get the dimensions of the back of the truck. It sounds great coming from the trunk of my challenger. So I know it would sound great under your seat of your truck
Rockford Fosgate P400X1 since the system requires 300w RMS, thank you.
The r type sub's, are a step down from the p type.. They're cheaper however they don't pack the punch like a p type.
As far as I can tell it is the same tape used for the DCR - HC46. the DVM60 is a standard mini DV size.
Get the 830D; use Win7 64 bit and try to get 4 gig ram... Runs fast and cool.
all i can tell you is that i bought that coby stereo because of the price. i regret it. its a pos. i bought a sony one at walmart its waaaaayyy better
Does this have a zoom function on the remote and a headphone Jack?
The AVH-P3100DVD's 5.8" LCD touchscreen *compatible with most factory steering wheel audio controls (adapter required) PAC SWI-PS Steering wheel control interface for Dual, Jensen, Pioneer, and Sony Item #: 127SWIPS Hope this helps...........Best, Jerry
About 5-8 pounds
I have 3 but I am sure it can take 2 more
If there is a master input somewhere on the "system" which allows piped-in audio to all available lines, then YES. Look for an RCA or 1/8" stereo or mono input labeled "MOH" or "Music on Hold" or similar. Chances are, if you DON'T have a master control box where all the lines come together and they all just plug into 2-line jacks, (directly) the answer is no.
You can use 5 separate pins. This includes the master pin and four other pins. There's also a duress pin which I didn't include that will allow you to send a silent signal to the monitoring service if someone just happens to come in and make you disarm the system. The police will be automatically notified. So actually there are 6 pins. If you use the interactive monitoring you can easily add and change them online.
It's two speakers. Front or rear depends on your vehicle, most vehicles have 6x9s in the back, and smaller speakers in the front.
its not fireproof I learned that the hard way
PS: I meant to also add that you should scroll down to Page 7 of 17 in the Sabrent PDF manual; the pics will show how to install the SATA drive using the port on the Sabrent HD enclosure. The old saying... a picture is worth a thousand words applies!! (&lt;;
Don't know size but you can view picture of the accessories on Amazon's webpage.
I'm not sure about your specific Antenna, but the antenna goes in one of the top two ports. One of the top ports is for the plug in power cord, and the other is the input from the Antenna. The bottom four ports distribute the signal from the input side.
It is a CON. The battery is used for other Nikon cameras with good results. Remember that these batteries take a couple of discharge cycles to reach their full potential. You can but extra chargers and batteries on the web which is the first thing I do. Then I always have a backup.
It has a full manual, in both English and Spanish. I returned a Canon SX20 because it didn't have a printed manual. I bought this Nikon instead because it had a printed manual. I use the my camera for mainly close-up, still-life, macro shots for an eBay business. Gotta say, I'm a bit worried by some of the reviews on here. Haven't used the camera yet. We'll see. Either way, it's gotta be better than the Canon with no manual.
Try looking into a Canon PowerShot A1000 IS. Has a viewfinder...under $150..Also uses AA batteries...another plus..
Thanks for your question, Invoices can only be printed online through Your Account:
I can only report my own experience: I have at least half a dozon Transcend SDHC cards, used in three different cameras over the past 3 years or so. Never had any failures.
Insert card into camera.w/ camera set to view pictures, press menu button. arrow down to the icon of the little wrench (that's setup). Arrow down/thru 5 pages til you see format. it will say "delete all data?" (make sure there are no pictures on the card you want to keep or they will be gone once you hit yes. Hope that helps. If you have any ?? lmk As I also have this camera.
Yes. However you would need to attah the speaker system via the headphone jack. Hope this helps. These speakers are amazing!
Here's the answer to your statement - http://www.amazon.com/C2G-Cables-27411-Stereo-Meters/dp/B000234HVS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1406321697&sr=8-3&keywords=amazon+audio+cable .
I use them on EV live X 12's with no issues.
I can't speak to Lepai but I am very happy with this basic little amplifier.
They run cool. It is a digital design, so wastes very little power in the form of waste heat.
No you can't. They're already internally bridged, so you can't bridge the channels together. It would fry the amp. Just buy a more powerful amp if 15W isn't enough.
No
it's 5x3 inches it does however fit the camera well.
I see there isn't great info for what this fits. I found my info for the cord. it says it will fit: 200,200W,205,205W,215T,250,250W,255,255W,260,260W,265T,265W,265WT,270,275T,300,310,350,360,370,500,510,550 Hope this will help everyone.
Yes, it will. MacBook 5,1 Late 2008 (also known as MacBook 13" Aluminum Late 2008) definitely uses: PC3-8500 (1066 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM &gt;&gt; http://support.apple.com/kb/SP500 Apple Originally stated that MacBook 5,1 only supports 2x2GB (4GB total), but now acknowledges that 2x4GB works (8GB total) Watch out, many people confuse your aluminum "MacBook" with the different "MacBook Pro" when you inquire about parts
Yes, this is a spec. compliant injector that you can place between your switch and Sony in order to power the Sony.
Yes. You can get a PoE switch, but they are more expensive.
5 feet
Yes, an Ethernet cable (short) is included.
I don't want to tell you something that might not be true, but when I ordered it came in one roll. Approx. 4' x 8' it sure didn't come in separate pieces. good luck.
So far as i know it will fit your PD model..
yes it does come with an antenna that is a soft rubber style about 6" long. The radio works very well and we are very happy with our purchase.
There is no item number, because the item did not sell, so I pulled the item.
One of the easiest to use and good for web posting is Google's Picasa, which is also free.
No, is does not have a microphone jack, but the microphone is very good and picks up clear sound from a good distance. I have never used it in a crowded or noisy situation. It's a good camera, I have been happy with it. I've used it for many recordings.
Yes
I don't know. Maybe, give it a try...
It would be 1920 by 1080.. Same as the video..
Yes it does
Yes, I have the iMac from mid 2007 and these worked perfectly. Make sure your iMac model is the right one.
The individual specs for the laptop and the individual specs for this RAM seem to be compatible. Mixing this with existing memory may fail. Not because what you have is bad, or this is bad, but because mixed memory sometimes does not play well together.
I think, but that's all, that it's for PC's. Don't know for sure. Look on the label.
Yes it works fine on windows machine. Gets confusing with the mac layout but it is really good.
I expect it will work but seems like overkill and very expensive for a phone keyboard. It has worked with every bluetooth device I've connected it to, but the SII wasn't good for much so I don't have it any more!
the battery charger is 100-240V so you are OK. You just need a plug adapter (no need for a power converter).
Yes, this does take batteries! We used batteries during our cross-country move.
I think it will pretty much work on any car that has a radio with a normal antennae outlet . You do need a power source of some kind either through fuse panel or straight wired to the battery.
This will work with ANY FM radio that has an antenna connection on the back but you will need the correct adaptors to convert the antenna to and from the factory connector. Do a quick search on amazon for antenna adaptors for your car and you should find them.
Yes we have them in stock
No it does not. The ball must be purchased separately. I used this RAM-B-238 RAM 2.43" x 1.31" Diamond Base with 1" ball http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002KO5XVU/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Here is what someone on newegg.com said about the drivers: "Other Thoughts: If your accustom to reinstalling windows, booting from a flash thumb drive is a bit more tricky then a CD. There's plenty of advice and step-by-steps out there. Acer made a hidden driver folder under the C:\ if you unhide all your folder view options and want to reinstall windows I recommend you backup that "Acer" driver directory, it contains the Sata hdd drivers which are really hard to find on the web since this is a new machine."
Yes. Look at the quick start guide that came with the computer. It has pictures of where everything is located, including the SD card slot. It takes several different types of cards too. Have fun!
Go to: My Computer (or Windows Explorer). Go to C:Drive/Program Files/Synaptics. There you'll find a folder with all the touchpad files(settings, tutorial, etc.) Hope that helps...
Avoid extra digital zoom. The brighter the light the better. In lower light try evening setting. Do what you can to hold still. I can't remember if there is a setting for stabilization method you can check.
Never got that message
hey Jeff, It loses all of everything u recorded if batteries die while recording! Recommend you purchase the a.c. power adapter to alleviate this issue. Harley
It doesn't have any special bolts at the bottom. Only a pike with a rubber foot. What mechanism is on your dolly? I might be able to tell you what bolt diameter is on the leg of this monopod but I don't think it was built to fit any other mechanisms. Using monopod with dolly is not stable enough in my opinion, I would go with standard tripod solution.
Yes. This monopod will be able to withstand the weight of most entry and midrange level SLRs, however I'm not sure of what the recommended weight of the monopod is, so please take that into consideration. You will be holding the monopod as well if it's in use so that should hopefully give you some peace of mind. My only recommendation is that you be mindful of the weight of the lens you attach to the camera and how much it effects the cameras center of gravity.
You may want to research the keyboard size for a 13" MacBook Air and see if it's is the same as a 11" MacBook Air. If the keyboards are the same size then yes it will work.
Just took another look at mine and yes. Each of the adaptors can be used with or without the other
The answer is rather complicated. No, you cannot record DirecTV signals directly from the dish. If you have a DirecTV DVR, record them on it and then transfer them to the Magnavox. That is how I save select programs (without the commercials). I do the same for movies and specials. Hope this helps.
Watching, requires a Tuner and a Display. Recording, requires a Tuner. Since this VCR only has 1 Tuner, you can only record and or watch one single channel at the same time.
Paul, check in your owners manual the charging procedure. It is rather complicated. You start it when G3 is turned off, switch charging with F7 button, then select the charging time with tuning knob. If you do all this magic with no effort - check your NiMh batteries. Very old batteries may function just one hour.
No. As a matter of fact, since broadcast TV went to digital a few years ago, there are no radios that can pick up television audio.
yes you can
Yes it does. It has a headphone jack and an aux input.
It's the same radio, just as you thought. Besides the logo--and I imagine this is the reason for the difference in popularity--is that the manufacturer donates a portion of the price of the Red Cross model to the Red Cross emergency relief fund.
I bought mine from jr.com (cheaper), and when I called they said from the 16th they'll be getting small groups to ship out to early pre-orders, and starting the 23rd they'll ship out mass amounts. Glad I ordered mine right away; I'm impatient as well. :)
You can check your BIOS and/or System Settings.
The answer is what does the cord you use to charge your phone have at either end look like? If the end which connects to the charging source is a USB connection then it should work because the other end of the cord attaches to the phone I hope this helps. In other words, if you can charge your phone off of your computers' USB connection, the radio will charge your phone as well.
Yozy please forget. It's very crappy. Reception is terrible and audio quality abominable. Quite unlike Grundig. Waste of time.
According to this: http://www.dz-tech.com/asus-eee-pc-1000he-blue-netbook-intel-atom-n280166ghz-10-led-wide-svga-1gb-memory-160gb-hdd-win-xp-p-1115.html?zenid=025ecdd977bf8b366d57ef250c7e3ffb They will be shipping the 16th. According to the Asus rep on the facebook group - Their US distribution company will be receiving them on the 13th, and they should be in retailers hands by the next week - so the 16th through the 20th would be reasonable... Amazon usually gets stuff early so I'm crossing my fingers for next Monday/Tuesday.
Sorry, don't have a Jitterbug phone, so can't answer that question. But I found this on google:Samsung Jitterbug SPH-a310 USB Data Cable Item# X1106UAUML, Regular price: $19.99, Sale price: $5.99 Hope that helps.
I have XM radio. However we used to it in some pretty remote areas of the Northwoods. The weather band was already used. There were a couple that came in pretty clear the rest were pretty staticky but I could still hear the forecast and I could still prepare for any income at weather. They work great for 18 bucks.
Yes it will! I put it on mine....but I also upgraded to 2gigs of memory before installing it. The hard drive on this puppy is 160 gigs...plenty of room and speed too!
The radio comes with ear-buds, not a headset. The audio quality is, of course, better with the buds than the speaker. But your question is confusing because you would normally listen through the speaker, not with the buds. That's how you usually listen, without the buds. Hope this helps.
I'm using 2 ft jumpers to connect from a Patch Panel to the TrendNet switch . . . I didn't see anything in the manual about min. 5 feet cable, but I wasn't reading word-for-word -- I'm guessing that is the length needed for the Switch to detect a short cable and lower transmission to be more power "green."
50 feet shouldn't be too long. In general, about 300 feet is the maximum for an Ethernet cable.
Yes it does. It takes a little more power than the smaller models. Just make sure its the right one or it performs slower.
I bought a WET610N to connect my Sony Blu-ray player to the internet. The set-up using the supplied CD in my Mac laptop was a fiasco, nothing worked. I finally got the bridge to work by using the Blu-ray player interface, but as far as compatibility with Macintosh goes, forget it. This is true of all Linksys products; the company does not assign any resources to Mac support.
Sorry... I've given up on this piece of junk. I could look up again on Google or their site about how to update it but it didn't help me fix the unit's problems. Get it hard wired into your WiFi unit if you do attempt to update it. DiecTV upgraded me to their Genie units thus removing any further need I would have for the WET610N.
Yes, it includes a power cord and one fairly good cable. I know longer have a use for mine as DirTV upgraded my system to their Genie box and it connects all by itself.
Hi, Sony uses the SteadyShot technology for camera's image stabilization and BIONZ technology for recording movies. This Sony Webbie HD doesn't have that feature or mode. -Ely
i do not know if this camera has that option due to returning the camera because Amazon sold me a discontinued model and i could not buy accessories for it.
If you have this computer HP PAVILION DV6T-1300 NOTEBOOK PC. This battery fits just like the one it came with. NEW Li-ion Battery for HP/Compaq HSTNN-LB73 hstnn-db73 462889-761 484170-001 485041-002 HSTNN-LB79 ev06047 ev06055 hstnn-c51c hstnn-ib72 hstnn-ub72 hstnn-ub73 hstnn-w50c (Electronics) I ordered it on Thursday and got it on Saturday. I was told it would not be here until Monday. The battery works like the one that the computer came with. We are very happy for right now with the product
Yes it does - Here is a Youtube link on the installation process. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akcceaBDSMo
No it does not. I had to use my recovery discs from the hard drive I was replacing.
Don't see it on the list, but if you type in your battery model Amazon does have them available. Good luck.
Yes, it works very well with my HP Pavilion.
Under "Product Description", "Compatible Models", "HP Pavilion". you will see an entry for "DV4-1400". This means that the replacement battery is compatible with the dv4-1400 series, therefore the answer is probably yes. I have a dv6 laptop. As a result I am not 100% certain about your situation.
honestly i dont know ...but my 3500 watt amp...gets dam hott ...the speakers sound really good
Best way is to wire subs together and get a good 2 channel amp that can handle a 1 ohm load. If you call power acoustik they can help but you'll be wiring positive to positive and negative to negative making the subs run at 1 ohm. you're going to have to get one hell of an amplifier to pushall four of those subs. I had a BAMF4000/1D just to push one sub
Hell no these subs suck
So long as you connect to you parking brake the tv works. You have be in park, its a safety thing.
has gps
It's NOT navigation ready
Yes it does.
I guess I really can't say since I don't have that type of battery. Maybe you could check the physical dimensions of the battery as well as its voltage rating and see if it might be compatible with the LI-50B. If they were the same I'd say it would work okay.
Does the alarm clock come with a weekday/weekend function so that it does not wake you up on weekends?
From the pictures that I have seen on Google it looks like it would fit perfectly. But you can go to any audio store &'d they can inform you much better.
Hi I installed it to my Toyota Wish (Japan model), but not very sure about other vehicle. There is a gap on both side so I have to get plastic sheet to fill up. But later found the ready made available at amazon for $9.90. So bought it and replace with my handmade one for better look. Look out for the size and with some patient, this can be fixed to any double din housing. Good Luck
yes
Yes
Just a note.. the "diameter" of the round part of the fan is 12 inches; not the circumference- which is the distance around the circle.
It's a great white noise maker on the lowest setting. Pretty quiet for the most part. Works great.
Black or Red
I bought this for my macbook 2011 2.7 Ghz Intel core i7 mid 2011. Hope this helps, I love this cover!
No
Yes
I don't know about that, but the one I wanted it to work for did not, so I had to buy a new DVD player.
Yes
I don't think so Wilson may have a better antenna but I think they are matched to the unit.
No internet connection needed. It simply boosts your phone (or data device) signal out to existing cell towers, that it wasn't able to reach on it's own antenna and power. I think I read it doesn't boost a 4GLTE data signal, though. It is powered by a 6vdc, 2.5amp wall jack, plugged into 100-240vac. I guess if you wanted, you could modify it to run off a 6vdc battery.
USB should be enough
I have a 55' Vizio. It probably could swing to 90* if the TV wasn't so wide. In other words the arm doesn't extend far enough to make the 90 with a 55' TV. Fully extended from the wall to the back of the TV is about 20 inches. I can get about 65*. You can adjust the mounts on the back of the TV to be off center which adds about 6" and could be enough. I tried it out of curiosity. It gives me about 80*. Be happy to send pics if I new how.
I have the 201 plus use with my Mac. Love it. Feels like a keyboard.
30 inches.
Yes, this model does. Pink for the microphone and blue and green jacks for the speakers. Why do you care about these details on a nearly 10 year-old PC?
yes PC3200 DDR Memory
My hard drive was not packed well. Air bag underneath and on top but no sides so the packing had slipped to the side of it and the hard drive was touching bare box. I was very concerned when I opened the box but the drive appears to be ok.
This recorder accepts nearly any analog audio device through two standard 1/8" jacks (one for input, one for output). Most headsets will have two 1/8" plugs, one for the earphones and one for the microphone. Given your expected use, you will likely not need a headset at all. This recorder has a built-in microphone. But, a standard analog headset may be a better option if your work makes handling the recorder too difficult.
Yes there are 4 individual speakers. Each one can be placed wherever you want, they don't have to be stacked on top of one another.
yes I think so its my sons Im just trying to help its been sitting for 5 mounth now.
Worked for me. Also works with iPhone 5 with the 30-pin to Lightning adaptor. Now waiting for a Lightning clock radio. As an aside, the display is too bright for a bedroom for my taste, and the usual Sony and other manufacturers kludgy button arrangement.
Technical specifications on site give detail-unbuffered
The only answer I have gotten is that low demand has resulted in intermittent, and thus more expensive, production runs. PC2 and PC3 are not interchangeable. It seems that PC3 gets a little cheaper while PC2 does not. Jim
Hi, this Sony EPEX10A/BLK works only on Sony Heaphones MDR EX series. -Ely
I have made recordings with those wonderful Sony DVDirect (various models) of many live performances and duplicated the DVD afterward with duplicator (faster than via computer) for those who are interested. The footage can be captured and edited in the computer by Adobe Primier Element and Sony Vegas Movie Studio. I am not sure the footage can just be copied as a file into computer and expected it is editable.
Only if your TV Has Audio and Video outputs. Most New TV's don't. You can record from DVR or Cable box outputs Video R and L audio. That's what I do. Some still have Svideo outputs use this first Peter better Video. Peter
Supports SD, MMC, and Memory Stick memory cards. Source for answer: http://www.amazon.com/Axion-9-Inch-16-Widescreen-AXN-9900/dp/B000KNP62Y Info on memory cards: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_card
No
8 ohms
No that is a Windows setting. If you have a ATI card there is a separate driver that helps with 5.1 over HDMI. The other setting is to force 5.1 but you loose Windows volume control. There is not a way to have windows volume control from a 5.1 Bitstream on a dchp. Video stream. Set settings for Windows first. Then set settings in windows media center if that is your package.
Unlimited. The one transmitter sends a signal out that can be received by an unlimited number of receivers. This is the same as a radio station broadcasting to the thousands of radios as long as they are in range of the transmitter.
No idea. I'm waiting for it too. Amazon had a price up for a while, but they just took it down.
And why is it so hard to find a good netbook with a matte screen in general? You'd think that the better brands would give consumers a choice of glossy vs. matte.
It had RCA in puts
Yes put small piece off play wood on top of the headliner
My odyssey was negative trigger. You need to buy a relay kit to switch it from a positive to negative. Most auto part stores have them.
It works great with my T3i, and the mounting/eletronics haven't changed generations yet so it should work the T5i.
Hi, iPhone 5 is not compatible with this Car Stereo. Compatible Apple device are: iPod Nano 1st generation, iPod Nano 2nd generation (aluminum), iPod Nano 3rd generation (video), iPod 5th generation (video), iPod Classic, iPod Touch. -Ely
I've got this radio for my boat in Egypt The radio is working fine with our am ,fm stations I think it will work with European radio channels
It did before it failed. I now use a Daul BT 600. More complex to use, however, the bluetooth feature makes my life much easier.
did you buy already?? or yes if not but i would need your order # so i can chage it around.. make sure you buy from Sound Distributors
Yes it does. It fits perfectly in the laptop. Since its a 9 cell batt, this will be bigger than the old one, but it works perfect. I have about 4.5 hours of usage with full charge. Fully recommended product, its cheap and reliable.
Hello, the dimensions are as follows: 8.125" long x " 2.5wide x approximately .5" high. All dimensions are within 1/6" of an inch. The width is the standard size to fit the battery opening. It will just stick out the back maybe 1/8". Hope this helps.
They don't stay on very well. All I have to do is look down and they slide off my head. You probably want the Koss PortaPro (very comfortable, sounds better than the HD218, and they never fall off). IEMs are good also, since they'll stay in and won't interfere with a hat/helmet, but they do shut out outside noise so you might want to think twice before using them on the slopes. Hearing that scream of "Watch out, you idiot!" might actually save your life.
Just the adapter
We will need a little more information like what are you inserting this into? Also does the system board that you are using this on expand to 32GB? Maybe 16 is its max.
No
No
me too. I am tempted to just get an iphone and use View Ti Golf. I do know that Golf Caddie's are now OS X compatible, but I hate the subscription fees.
Hi Willy, I will answer categorically YES. But, here is a great article from MacWorld http://www.macworld.com/article/1143511/unibody_macbook_review.html where it confirms that 8Gb can be installed. On thing for sure, Kingston makes great quality products. So, after reading the mac-Article, I'm would get the memory. 4Gb won't take you too far. My macMini (with the same processor as your laptop) came with 4Gb once I ran PhotoShop I was swimming in glue!
It doesn't cone with a remote unfortunately. I still have it and it works great alongside my Logitech harmony remote
Yes it does. The 30 pin fits perfectly. I use my 1st generation iPod on it. Also, the iPhone 4 works on it too.
Yes it does. The 30 pin fits perfectly. I use my 1st generation iPod on it. Also, the iPhone 4 works on it too.
If you purchase the 30 pin to lighting wire adapter it will. Otherwise no.
I'm sorry, I don't know as I purchased item as a gift.
Yes, elevations can easily be observed for anywhere you can see on the map.
No. The Garmin GPSmap 62 (NOT the "s" model) is what I have and is really not worth the investment. You have to download the topo maps from a DVD. Since the 62 has limited memory, you can only download a VERY SMALL portion of the topo. The "s" model uses a a memory card that you load internally (which I was told my model did). I think that you might have better luck using the PC and GPSmap device in tandem if you have the "s" model. Best of luck.
It dosen't. But you can get an AmazonBasics HDMI cable for 5 bucks.
Yes. I only use it that way; I've never bothered to put batteries in it, as the sound is so good, we use it in the living room.
No it does not
Yes.
Yes. Any new USB product should work with Windows 7 providing no random errors.
It should work with Flight Simulator X. Flight Simulator X is compatible with joysticks, yokes, game pads, and other controllers supported by Microsoft Windows and the DirectInput device standard. Many products feature different configurations, so refer to your controller's documentation for its button assignments. Before you fly, make sure your joystick or other controller is plugged into your computer, enabled in the Windows Control Panel, and calibrated properly. Also make sure you have the latest device drivers. If in doubt, download and install them from the manufacturer's Web site.
It is not a wireless speakers device so there are cables back to the small speakers from woofer. If you want to extend the speakers away from the regular distance you need to buy. Other than that it should be okay.. In picture you are seeing a Volume control knob with a cable - its a decent size cable. it is pretty much enough. As long as if you keep your woofer near to the device you are good.
Yes, it fits well
Hi, I added two of them to my Lorex system, I would say they are better then the cameras that come with the system but not a great camera
They wired together with about 6 ft apart. They come all set up for a computer with a line fitted with a jack to hooks to the sound card of computer..
Yes, I believe it does.
none of my information shows it being able to take an XD.
Only 4x6 and 4x6 postcard -- no 5x7 -- no 8x10
I use this on my work computer with Windows 8 with No problems.
No
The way your question is phrased is a bit ambiguous. The warranty has nothing to do with whether or not you can "return it", either to Amazon or the manufacturer. Amazon offers a 30 day return policy for most return reasons, including defective items -- This is a not a "warranty", but its return policy. The manufacturer is who typically offers the "warranty" (at least for a mouse). A warranty does not often offer any type of "return" (the word you use), but the manufacturer (or warranty provider) will repair or replace the defective item during that warranty period.
No
We use it successfully with Lenovo Monitors, but I believe it will work with the Dell as well.
Not familiar with gtx 970 but if it has a female DP port on its side and your monitor has a male HDMI jack on the end, you should be all set.
It comes with 52mm snap-on front lens cap LC-52, Rear lens cap LF-1, Bayonet hood HB-46, Flexible lens pouch CL-0913.
My is located in my boat glove box but I can see it well
The headset does not have noise cancellation so background noises are picked up, but I didn't notice much in the way of the device adding sound or noises to recordings. Please note - I am using teh headset for telephone communication and recording phone messages are not very high fidelity.
Connect the 3D Bluray player w/HDMI direct to TV, and the sound through optical from BD player to receiver.
Larry, Did You ever work this out? I have the same issue. Dave
It is a 5400 rpm drive. I don't have the other specs on the drive but should be easy to find on the manufacturer's website. The size is pretty standard. It replaced the 120Gb drive in my 13 in 2007 White MacBook and fit easily. I did replace the HDD in a 2009 13in, unibody MacBook Pro 5.5 with an SSD. The SSD was slimmer but fit with no problems. You will need the special tools for a MacBook Pro.
I'm sure they'll work on anything. HOWEVER, ours are less than one year old and a lot of the green paint has flaked off. Because they are over 60 days old, Amazon won't let me exchange them even though they are defective - I'm not trying to return them, I just want new ones. So, I got in touch with OSD directly and it appears that they will stand behind them - I just had to send them some photos and a copy of my Amazon receipt. I may never buy from Amazon again.
They are hardwired but they sound really good
The VESA mounting standard has multiple sizes (distance between the mounting holes). This mount supports 50/75/100/200x100/200mm(2"/3"/4"/8"x4"/8"x8"). If these match your TV then it will work (given you are within the weight limit).
It is probably one of the thinnest mounts around and works well as long as you don't need any tilt adjustment. I use it with a 32" touchscreen and it supports the weight with no problem.
+1 I would like to see results too.
I don't think so..It takes 150 pics then I have to download that to take anymore. I have to go and get more memory card that should fix it. Great camera just my card doesn't hold a lot and I need more.good luck
I use these while training in an Adobe virtual classroom.It blocks out noise from outdoors including jets and my voice quality I'm told is clear and crisp. An excellent product and great price. I would have paid more if I had to.
I am not aware the iPhone4 has a real USB port, and this device is USB-based. I have used it with the HP Chromebook without drivers. I'm not sure the iPhone4 is appropriate for conference calls.
Yes, it comes with the user guide.
Works perfectly!
http://www.manualowl.com/p/Canon/PowerShot-A1100-IS/Manual/67648
It uses a USB port, so yes, it will work well with MAC.
No mine does not look like the one pictured. Mine is a rolling bag not a backpack
I had the same question so I spoke with a Canon rep today. He recommended SanDisk but noted that the sd780is only writes up to 18-19 MB/sec. So it's essentially a waste of money to purchase a card that writes any faster than 20 MB/sec. Check this one out: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018M256G/ref=cm_cd_asin_lnk However, faster cards are likely to write and read faster through a card reader or on your computer.
HI, I believe you push it in and it comes out.
Absolutely right!! I'm looking for a new camera now, and DO want the convenience of AA batteries! Please let me know if you find out which camera(s) do take AA batteries...
Dave Kaminski just did a post at http://webvideouniversity.com/podcast addressing your very issue. It might be worth a peek.
Dave Kaminski just did a post at http://webvideouniversity.com/podcast addressing your very issue. It might be worth a peek.
Yes
Go to a good camera store and try out a few different models. I like a case that slides onto my belt, has some padding or cushioning, and a pocket for an extra battery, an extra SD card, and a cleaning kit. If a case is too tight, and the lens accidentally opens inside the case, the lens drive can be damaged. A loose fitting case with padding and cushioning is the safest.
I don't believe that it will have sufficient power. I built nothing but 350 to 400 watt computers up until the time I finished that machine. Since then, to be safe and not sorry, I have installed Thermaltake 700's and one Coolermaster 600 80% guaranteed unit in my newer builds. When the prices come down with rebates, there is no need to under power these machines. More IS better and simplifies things a lot.
IF you are leaving the HD attached to the system all the time, it is quite possible that you are saving all incoming data/media to the Seagate. The easiest way to check this out is by going to FileManager and then checking the contents of the Seagate. Even if it is full, it doesnt matter- Just select all (using the Shift the the Up/Down Arrows) and copy/paste it in the 'C' of Computer. That should free up almost 490 of the 500GB- as a few basic programs given by Seagate will remain. All the best.
Sorry I don't own any type of gaming device so I don't know the answer but good luck with it.
I placed my order on the 26th and Amazon still tells me it has not shipped yet. I don't want to cancel the order, so I don't know what to do. Seems ridiculous that they charge almost $20 for one day shipping and it been three days without it even shipping.
Yes, the shelves will work with this mount, please have a look, http://www.amazon.com/VideoSecu-Bracket-Component-Receiver-MDVD04B/dp/B003G0MS9M/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1414473013&sr=8-2&keywords=dvd+mount
Hi Tyler, That's correct. It does swivel up and down and sideways. It a good softbox. I have gotten a lot of use out of it, but be aware it's a low budget softbox. Nevertheless, it does an awesome job and I plan on buying another one soon.
I wish I could help, I put it in and it worked fine The old battery that was NO GOOD was not recognized by computer! Sorry not much help here!!!
I think I've got it at home. Have you tried pressing the Reset button just below the Big Green Arrow button? If some of the paint rubbed off it might not be labeled. It's sort of inline with the raised border that circles the rest of the buttons. Holding it down for a minute should wipe out all pairings.
yeah
You probably could since it has a standard 1/4th inch threaded stud on the end, but it's not really meant for mounting a camera. It's made for mounting a speedlight or studio strobe, and would give you limited options for positioning a camera.
Yes
Yours is only ddr not ddr2 so that will NOT work.
It fits my MacBook Pro 13 inch from April 13 very well.
There is no RF input, so it will not record off the cable. You could record with another device that included a tuner, such as an old VCR, but it would be cumbersome.
Not that I am aware of. Your best bet would be to buy a female 110 to male 220 adapter. Just a few dollars/euros/pesos/rupees &#128516;
It has a limited amount of elastic which I've found to be difficult at times. If you forget one step, you have to disassemble to get to the step you need to adjust. That's not to say they aren't good performing lights -- this is a great "startup" set. I've personally made these a backup set, and since moved to LEDs.
28 pounds and was 13" x 18" x 34".
64GB USB Flash Drive doesn't work with the MacBook. Instructions how to format a flash drive to work with a Mac. 1/ Right-click on the "Start" button 2/ Click "Open Windows Explorer" 3/ Right-click on the flash drive in the Windows Explorer window, then click "Format." 4/ Type in a "Volume Label," check the "Quick Format" option and then click "Start" to perform the format
Don't know
Sorry I have no clue. I just use it to put pictures from my computer on it.
I have watched it practically every night for five years and its still going strong. I bought it new and was given the option of purchasing extended warranty, which i did. I believe it was five years but i would have to dig out the paperwork on it to be sure. Since its given me no problem i've never had a reason to worry about the warranty. I bought mine at Target. If you have any other questions i will do my best to answer. Thanks!
Nope, no headphone jack.
What I know is that it is really a SanDisk 16GB SD card - it works great. SanDisk are the best SD's I have found and I have tried others. As far as the class 2 sdhc, it really was not a consideration of mine when I purchased it.
They are standard size SD/SDHC memory cards.The instructions with your camera of electronic device should say which type of memory card the device uses.The actual SD/SDHC card measures about 1.250" X .900",all this type of memory cards are the same size,but the capacity is different.
It has plenty of room for my Nikon L820 and all accessories. Hope this helps.
My User Guide, page 27 (Frequently Asked Questions) says: "The power adapter may not be securely connected to the DPF - Digital Photo Frame - or the power switch (on the side of the DPF) may not be in the ON position." If that doesn't solve the problem, I'd contact PanDigital, particularly if the DPF is under warranty. If it's out of warranty, it may still be worth contacting them.
The box says up to 6400, but it obviously depends on file size of your photos.
Have two Amazon Basic HDMI cables with no problems to date.
No, you would not be able to control or use the speedlights focus assist beam like that. The hot shoe on the Mini TT1 is for either the Pockwizard AC3 or for a speedlight.
Size is the only reason. The TT5 is a transmitter/receiver. The mini is only a transmitter. You cannot trip the shutter with the mini.
TT1 can control a plus X using a standard channel. This means no wireless TTL.
Hi, Yes, frequency range 340.00-354.00Mhz is for USA market and this item uses this range.
Despite what the manual says and implies, NO - this will not work. You need hook the MONITOR OUT to your TV. When you change input you will have to change the input selector on the receiver AND on the TV.
We played regular dvd's on ours, only a couple, and it gave out! If you are looking at a used one, don't buy it! The replacement battery is too expensive.
Yes, you have to plug it in.
38 hz
There is enough room in your monte carlo to fit 2 of these boxs
Not via dock but through mini cord plug, yes.
Only with a USB cord. It doesn't sit in the device like shown. I bought it for the same device and was disappointed that it wasnt a docking station for that device.
No. This is not a coax cable.
No, I don't think so. The one end of the cable has HDMI plug. The other is C2G connector which has like 5 to 7 pins. It is DIN connector not a coaxial connector.
Yes , That is the only way you can see what you recorded. Will need to by a storage disc for the glasses when you get them it does not come with any storage
I have charged it 3 times so far. The video quality is good. The audio quality is very bad. Very bad in the best of conditions, so any noise from the background or from a small breeze will not make you happy. In fact as I checked out in a grocery store I had to strain to understand what the cashier was saying only a yard (3 ft.) away. That is why I do not use it much. I classify this item as a "toy" and not for serious recording. Nice sun-glasses though.
If you really mean a one meter cable (That's about 3.X feet long) and not a 6.X meter cable (That's about a 20.X foot cable) like Amazon was selling, the answer is yes it will work. You can by a ten or twelve foot regular USB 2.0 cable at most electronics stores that work fine as well.
Yes, the AmazonBasic RJ45 Cat5e Ehernet cable will work.
No that will only enable them to share a network connection. You can connect them to the same network and transfer information using file sharing.
No, Thunderbolt is all together different. Your old Macbook likely supports firewire 400 which again is different. The cable does not support firewire 400 or thunderbolt however, =there are adapters and likely cables available that support the conversion.
no
Yes it will work. It works with any USB, and it does not matter what it is hook up to.
Hi Marla Not being around kvm much but it stands for keyboard video mouse. Unless there is a usb connection of A or B for a usb cable as such is here.
No
I'm not sure what you're asking here. The cable not is powered; it simply connects directly from my HDMI device(PS3), to a monitor, both of which are powered themselves.
It works in the Cessna 172 that I fly, so I would assume that it works in the 152 as well. I'm nearly certain the connections on these headsets are pretty much universal among *most* airplanes. I'm not sure about helicopters, however.
Yes therexcellent is a video cord to connect both screen,but you could also play to seperatation DVDs if you wanted.
I have a Canon Powershot ELPH 110 HS digital camera & it fits mine to a 'T': meaning no room for anything else. My camera's dimension: Product Dimensions: 0.8 x 3.7 x 2.2 inches ; 4.8 ounces Your camera's dimension: Product Dimensions: 3.8 x 0.9 x 2.2 inches ; 5.1 ounces I asked my husband & he said this case might not fits your camera because yours is bigger than mine (LOL!). Like I said this case doesn't have any extra room. It fits my camera's dimension like a glove. Merry Christmas & Happy New Year!
Mine only sits 3"; that is from the wall to the back of the television. Hope this helps.
Yes, no problem
No, Dish network only And it doesn't work well in extreme cold
Can;t say for sure, but my unit is only a couple months old and the volume knob is giving problems, sometimes when you try to raise or lower the volume, the unit goes silent and the the volume comes in. The tuner is also very poorly designed, next time i think i;ll go for a digital tuner
hi they are like in ear do you know about bose earphones bud? they are of the same shape.
I get about an hour or two as well. It's very annoying...
Your flash drive must be formatted in FAT32 to be read by this extremely disappointing dvd player.
Yes and yes. Speakercraft has specifications on how to paint the grill, being careful to not clog the grill openings. Check with them....I believe the spec is listed on their site.
Yes.
We had the same problem, the remote wouldn't work and we couldn't play BRs. Power the blu-ray unit down and then disconnect the power cord. Reconnect the power cord and power the unit on. Hold the FF button on the unit down for 10 seconds. These steps will reset the blu-ray unit. If you are still having problems with the remote, remove the batteries, reinsert the batteries and hold the Power button on the remote down for 30 seconds. Good luck!
I have the Samsung Blu Ray model 3600 and was a breeze to setup. I am very satisfied with the service that I am getting through this machine.
From my recollection they were a faint red.
According to http://www.lcd-tv-ratings.net/lcd/sony-kdl-32xbr9-review its response time is 4 ms
My Sony is an LCD model with virtually no glare. Supposedly the Plazma models have one of the better pictures, but because they do have glare issues - you need them in a darker room. We have our Sony LCD model in a room with lots of windows and sunlight and have no glare problems and we think the picture is great!
No
It is the USA FCC Part 15.247, IC RS210 compliant.
Yes
Perhaps you should ask the Bose support folks. I had to call them once to reset our bose system and the tech I spoke with was very helpful.
Yes
I don't know. I've been using these for many years and they still work. I imagine you have to replace batteries in remote controls from time to time, but boxes are brilliant. I use them exclusivelly for over-the-air reception and they've never let me down. You have to get a good antenna, not that Clear TV. I use Winegard flat waves purchased from Costco (good for only urban). If you're in fringe area, you need an external fringe antenna.
I found a solution that seems to fix the erratic clock. Turn the Auto setting to "off". Then turn Daylight Savings to "off".
Prof. Whitebread: Yes, you can hook up a VCR and record VHS tapes to DVD with this recorder. I transferred all my VHS movies (all that were not copy-protected) to DVD using this recorder. You can apparently do some editing too, although I have not tried this. You can read all about it on the downloadable owner's manual in PDF, available at this URL: http://www.tacp.toshiba.com/tacpassets-images/models/dr570/docs/dr570_om_e.pdf
So this recorder does not have a PAUSE while record function? That means that you have to record commercials while recording. I had a SONY GX-300 that had that feature.
I'm not sure what system your operating - I'm using Windows 8.1 - no problems what so ever - USB powered plug and play - was recognized immediately and has worked fine.
http://www.digitalfaq.com/reviews/dvd-media.htm Go to the above link and you will see that UME is in the Third class rating. I have used this site and find them to be very reliable in their report research. Stay with the First class section in bold print and you should have no trouble. The time, effort & money wasted on inferior product to save $ usually cost you more in the end. I have 65 years of experience!
I do not use Apple,I have watched these dvd's repeatedly with no noticeable degredation,HD yes,I swear by these for all my recording needs
i don't think so , the best way is you better use double layer dvd
Yes
No, there is no optical cable input.
Yes, it will work.
Yes, as long as you get a Intuos 3 or and Intuos 4 tablet. You will need to download driver 6.3.2-4 from our legacy page for it to work. The driver that comes with the tablet, will not work with your Mac OS.
Yes
The included link should take you to Olympus' website to download the manual. Hopefully this will be helpful. http://www.olympusamerica.com/cpg_section/cpg_support_manuals.asp?id=1452
Yes the squelch feature works fine but the range is quite limited when compared to the stronger/larger 25 watt version. That said, I purchased the HX280 5 watt for use in my 16' Carolina Skiff which I won't take far off shore, so this hand held is perfect for my needs and space considerations.
Yes it does using the rechargeable battery pack. I have not tried it with the replaceable (AA batteries).
No I don't think so. I have a car air compressor/tire inflater and it wouldn't work with it.
was a waste of money, it never worked......
Yep, I have the D5200 with the 18-140mm lens and it comfortably fits in the case with a couple of inches to spare in the bottom, even with two filters and the lens cap attached.
I have the canon 55-250 usm and it has about an inch extra, the 70-200 looks pretty big so I am not sure
An external DVD drive cannot output directly to a television, there's no video output of any kind.
You can download VLC and set it to run from that instead. http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
I honestly don't know. I am using mine with an Asus netbook. I have not tried it with anything else.
Yes, it will power 10 BitFountain BE V2 Blades. However, you will need a BitFountain backpane to use this power supply with a block erupter blade.
Yes it will and if you have windows 7 or later installed no driver needed
Technically don't. I will bundle it.
Yes, absolutely it does run Mountain Lion, my mini at work (this model) does. When new, it came with the operating system Leopard. It needs to be running Snow Leopard (download from itunes store) before it can be upgraded to Mountain Lion.
No. This is a hard wired, stand alone desktop itself. You can replace your fathers old one. Or better yet, just upgrade your fathers and clean it up.
If your car already has an integrated bluetooth system, you don't need this feature in a GPS.
Yes, it is possible, but you need to install a new software to the GPS.
Yes. I have 8GB in mine. I have 2 banks of 4GB 1067 MHz DDR3.
Yes, but you'll need a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter which is around $10.00.
No, it is not.
No touch screen but a great computer
Those are good reasons. It's lighter too.
Yes
I can't say that it doesn't have a learning curve. It does but it is quite manageable. On the whole, I've found it quite preferable to Windows.
No touch screen but a great computer
Not all sellers include the same items. One seller is selling his with no power cord, no keyboard and no mouse. Another seller is selling their with the Mighty Mouse but a DIFFERENT keyboard than the one listed above. Each seller is different. Read their item descriptions closely when making your purchases.
It uses standard 3-prong. 120v.
They fit... not easily, but they fit. On mine, there is an velcro-ed sleeve for the end of the rod which can open. It makes it easier to work with the rest of the box. With the rod in the open/closed velcro-ed slot (in the open position so the rod goes through it), I work with the rest of the rods, working from outside-in. There is no easy way to do it. But, once you do it once, it seems easier.
I doubt it, did not work with my Nikon which it was advertised to do so. Save your money.
Of course, look at the spec closer, pc input for PIP. A couple of ways to do it. Also most computers/ laptop have DVI and HDMI. And there are cable with one side is DVI and the other side is HDMI. Again there is the regular PC monitor input out for older computers/laptops.
I have the same problem. The TV is about 3.5 years old
Sales are done competitively, whenever Best Buy's have sales. Sometimes Amazon matches the prices of the same merchandise. Basically, find the best sale and dive in. If you want more support, then local stores are just better. Don't know anything about the sale, just pay attention to the ads.
The seller was no doubt very bi-polar )
No it does not have a cable card slot.
It is only $698 at Fry's Electronics in case you have one nearby...
20-1/2" wide x 10" deep
Yes

I bought two. Both of them came with AC adapters (I assume you are referring to the cord and plug that allows you to plug them into a wall outlet). I assume they all do since you need to recharge the battery; however, to be sure, you should check the description of the one you are considering buying, or you should ask the seller.
Yes. I've never connected an external antenna to it so I can't vouch for the performance but the remote has a "Tuner" button, a "Band" button to select between FM Stereo, FM Mono, & AM, a "Tuner Edit Tools" button to configure presets, and four buttons to flip up and down through the frequencies and preset channels.
Yes up to 80 inch
Depends on what you are connecting up too there's different plug types the camera ends are BNC, type
No
APM7008 I got mine from newremotecontrol dot com, just look up apm7008 setup microphone on google a bit pricey at 39.99 but it works like it should.
Yes I have this too what is the solution ?
G10 is done. New 2010 models are arriving soon.
Not sure, but for the price I pay it has been very satisfactory. It catches a few signals--like cell towers or others' radar detetors, but overall I've been very pleased
Had to program. All in.
It comes with a battery and charger.
No
I buy the ihome speaker system but this never works. I wrote my claim to amazon but never received response. I dont recommend buy this product very bad desicion. Sorry I dont know if your iphone 5 works in these speakers.
Yes.
Yes..It will ,and also play Blue-ray disscs
I've had no problems with WIN7 and this small DVD/CD drive. My concern is that those who could not get it to work might have failed to read the info provided in the Amazon listing. This device does require the use of 2 USB 2 ports. Plugging it into one USB port does not provide enough power. If you don't have such a USB cord, look around for multiple listings for an A-B Y cable with two regular USB plugs.
No, unfortunately this is not compatible with Chromebook yet. We are working on it.
Watching sports on this tv sucks for me. But that is just my opinion. I think that the 120HZ would be prolly be better.
I am not sure I understand what you are asking... the camera should focus, but only manually.
Not directly through the tv, you need roku, Apple tv, or some streaming device, there's no built in WiFi
It has a digital audio out (optical). You need to get an optical cord and connect it to your receiver. http://www.monoprice.com/products/subdepartment.asp?c_id=102&cp_id=10229 Need a toslink to toslink cable
I do not see any reason it would not! Mine even worked with an old e-mac (since retired), an old power book that runs OS 10.4 as well as a newer PowerBook, MacMini. My Nexus7 tablet, iPod touch all work great. Guests and visitors have always been able to get on my guest network with anything the had! Get it! Set it! Forget it (because it never gives me any trouble)!
Mine came with one, and I assume all would, but on a used one, the seller should list that in the product description.
Not sure what model you have. The HDTVI is not omni-directional. I can tell you that you won't get as many channels without an amplifier. And I have found that these "omni-directional" antennae still need to be pointed in a certain direction to better pick up a signal.
TV signals are more or less transmitted via line of sight. Reception distance will depend on the elevation of the transmission tower and the receiver and any buildings, hills, etc, in between. I was able to pull in signals from Oakland to Millbrae, CA.
The bass is heard when the speakers are extended. The amount that it is extended by does not effect the bass. When the speakers is tightened down then the bass is ineffective.
yup
I've had it few a months now and no problem with it to date. I use it almost everyday at work. I have even got a few co-works to pick one up. Oh and the battery life is great on it.
The speaker charges via a micro-USB port. You can plug it into a laptop or standard phone charger.
Hafele does not sell to the public, their sales are made thru distributors, such as ourselves. in addition to the US they have a presence in Canada, the UK, and many other countries. You may find the following internet address helpful: www.hafele.co.uk/shop/distributor-network Hope is info is helpful.
U have to purchase the mm size to fit your lens. So if its a 52mm hood then it will fit on 52mm lens. Its by size. So it should fit the 52mm lens filter in theory. Lol wish i could give u a definate answer but if i had to say yes or no, i would say yes if u attach it to the filter.
It does rotate completely around, one of the reasons I bought it in the first place.
Yes
You need to purchase a Samsung wireless LAN adapter, model #WIS09ABGN. I bought one from Amazon for $58.99.
this tv does not support those internet apps directly, unfortunately.
I found this review on cnet... it doesn't call out every LED/LCD TV.. but lists quite a few. I feel the reader can extrapolate how their TV model should stack up. But according to CNET; the Samsung 46" LED TVs are about 40% more efficient than the Samsung 46" LCD TVs. some highlights Samsung UN46B7000 107W Samsung LN46A950 146W http://reviews.cnet.com/green-tech/tv-consumption-chart/?tag=contentBody;nextPage
Yes. You can download the Netflix app directly on the TV from Samsung App Store or use one of the other connected boxes (Chromecast, Apple TV, Roku,...).
If your computer has an HDMI port to connect to the TV. I found the VGA connection to be rather poor. But when i connected through the HDMI it was flawless.
Need a little bit more information. If you have this device installed on your Tivo and you disconnect it, you can recover your programs by rebooting the system
I've had this monitor for almost three years and have not experienced any issues.
TY for this post. Looked everywhere for the answer to the cables Q&A.
it uses a dvi and vga cables, so as long as your macbook/desktop have the proper jacks, I don't see any reason as to why you couldn't.
BJ, they were asking for routers and your answer was a modem.
The antenna has 1 cable, the standard 75 ohm. But yes, it does get digital signals.
No tips. I have same problem.
Yes. Press the 45 and 33 at the same time to get the 78 speed.
Unsure
This listing is for the standard 5828 without the voice feature. We are not aware of a limit on the number of 5828/5828V which can be on a single system.
You will need a tripod mount to attach to the roof with a mast to attach the antenna to.
it could...it does the same thing. These are used mostly in doors, with the window sensors having a larger surface size, but these are actually less noticeable, in my opinion. They will contact within about a 1/2 inch from the magnetic side, so pretty sensitive
I'm right with you, buddy. Just waiting for it to drop again. Not cool, Amazon....not cool.
the 1999 price was from 6th Ave and maybe also from Amazon itself, I noticed this as well. The other sellers had it marked higher, so when 6th ave and or amazon sold out the only ones available were higher. (Amazon did not change the price).
I don't think so....
No. You may be able to go the Garman website and down load those maps
No its Flat to the wall no tilt..
If the antenna connection is the standard1/8 inch plug, I would think it would work with no problems. If I am not mistaken it is 75 ohms.
1. I bet you can since the sync info maintain at the device itself but only 1 device can be played at 1 time. 2. USB micro charger 3. Never tried that but mine still working after so many days without charging.
all the gold deals they had today were mysteriously sold out seconds after they went online. very fishy...
No, it's not 3d. Try looking up the "Sony BDP-S5100 3D Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi"
I don't know.
Yes
Yes
yes it does work with the 27" thunderbolt display and the 30" dvi cinema displays.
I've used it for TV, gaming, and internet browsing with my computer.
No. For installation instructions I looked for a video in Youtube.
To be honest I have heard a lot of people having problems with the broadband working with Windows 8. I no longer use mine.
Not sure I understand the question, but yes. A flat surface is best because the back side with the mounting screws is flat. If you are asking if it can be placed in the position of having the lens on top, rather than being on the underside, that answer is also yes.
The package does not indicate anywhere that it is. The cable is thin compared to in-wall cables I have purchased. Just based on the fact that it is white (to blend in or be less noticeable than the black/grey/charcoal cables) it leads me to assume it is not. Hope that helps.
Yes. HDMI on your desktop (or laptop) plugged into your HDTV HDMI port, your TV will recognize something plugged in when it's turned on and you select that port by changing your SOURCE. Now your desktop and TV will display the same image.
Mine uses channel "B".Had mine for a year or so.Works great.I have mine hung on the bed post for my wife to turn on her light should she need it in the middle of the night.Believe mine came preset to channel"B".
I've had mine for a while and it has two prongs.
Blows air up, under laptop. And it is quite, u will not even know it's there
I am not sure about this case, but I can recommend the case logic DCB-302 Compact camera case for the SX260 HS. It fits the camera perfectly along with an SD Card. I think it could hold a spare battery as well.
Yes
Approx. Internal Dimensions are 1" x 4 3/8" x 2 5/8" , my camera (Nikon S9200) dimensions are 1 1/4" x 4 3/8" x 2 3/8" . After much manipulation I was able to force the case's zipper closed, but is is much too tight and risk scratching the camera with the zipper slider. This case should not be recommended for the Nikon S9200 camwera.
Not sure. I think all Powershots are the same size but would hate to tell you the wrong info. Try Googling it? Good luck. It did work the camera I got but it was snug and fine after we figured it out.
What if I have an old Naiamichi analog receiver (pre-surround sound). Is it worth it to go for the BD80, over the BD60, because of the "high clarity audio" feature? I do have an HDTV. In theory, with the BD80, you can connect HDMI to the HDTV and then audio to the analog receiver and have better sound quality, but I don't know if the difference is noticeable. What do you think?
It's only three feet there bud.
no it does not, only driver available is for Linux that will let you use 7
Would need to know the roll bar I.D. I have a 2007 ranger 500. It did not come with mounting bracket. I ordered the supposed correct ones bu still came up short. Ended up flattening out the ends to barely reach center of bar on each side. This was a top mount. Sounds good but base is week.
It should fit and you will need to order mounting brackets as well. I didn't have much luck with mine. It would work fine one minute and when I'd try to play music again it wouldn't work.
No camera is not wireless
Mine is a 128GB Model.
Yes it has a backlit keyboard.
No other parts needed. The lens comes with the same connector as the Canon cameras, in one of the pictures it's labeled as a 'T-Mount'. I have this Lens and I also have the T4i works well together. The lens will mount on your tripod and the camera will just hang, just make sure you have a sturdy tripod.
No
If you are planning to connect this antenna to your wireless card, make sure the connectors are the correct size. You will only have to replace one of your current antennas with this device. This is a great antenna. It is serving me very well. Very good signal through two exterior walls, across a driveway and into another room. Wow!
If you are asking whether you can stream audio from your phone/tablet/computer to the receiver using Bluetooth, you can do this by using a BT adapter. I found the Homespot BTADP-233 to be perfect for this. Ileave it on all the time. In my case, it remembers being paired with four different devices.
Depends on what speakers you buy.
just set up a free Pandora account...enter your e-mail and pass word from your receiver..and you are good to go...been doing that for 2 years now. KB
I don't think this is the case. Magellan just released another update firmware and map update for the older Maestro series, so it appears they are going to support the Maestros going forward. There are also new Maestro models soon to be released.
Onkyo by far. Buy a Rocketfish Rear Wireless kit for about $100.00 if you need wireless rear.
They sell refill pages on Amazon. If you cannot find them, contact the company.
Yes, and it works great. I have a 32" 720 and it automatically upconverts very well.
yes. It's the same as what is shown on th site.
It is not a smart TV. I had a Roku but later on I just hooked it up to my Wii.
Hold the reset button for 30 seconds. That should factory default it. Default user and pass is "admin".
How about a power adapter?
No
A single USB wireless transmitter comes with each receiver. I was unable to locate any Transmitters sold separately. However, I bought three of these over time and one transmitter will support all three receivers running simultaneously.
Yes ... it will operate your system.
Yes. Standard mini plug
Yea those should be perfect for these stands
I am not aware of a wireless camera that would work with this system. I bought a stand-alone wireless camera that works over the internet. Fosam.
No, you don't need a phone line unless you are going to use the remote calling feature.
This player does not have WiFi capabilities.The wired ethernet connector is to connect to a LAN. The LAN connection enables access of several Internet services via Viera Cast (You Tube, Picassa. Fox Sports, weather, Twitter. Amazon Instant Video, Pandora, and Tagesschau (German programming). It also allows you to use BD-Live and Bonusview. It also lets you update the firmware directly over the Internet.
Yes. When I first got it I wanted to test it out before I committed to a roof install. I put it into the loft area of my house and it picked up a few channels. It worked a lot better when I put it outside (since the higher the better). Note it still requires some tweaking as it isn't perfectly omnidirectional.
Connect everything (PS3, Directv, surround sound receiver) to your television via HDMI, then run an optical cable from your tv to the surround receiver. Presto.
As long as it has an Ethernet port -- which it almost certainly does.
Check antena connection, move device to different location, and check auto channel at each location until get it.
Scroll down to the product description and you will find your answer.
Clamp light? As in a cheap metal reflector with a spring clamp on the back? Then no, simply clamp it to the vertical post.
No. It's the wrong size. This stand is not meant to be a tripod.
The Acer should be able to handle that kind of load fairly easily. I have it at home and have been streaming media, installing an app, and transferring files over all at the same time without any noticeable lag. The atom processor may not be a beast but it will be able to handle the kind of load you are talking about.
It should be able to communicate with your old radio, if you are on the same channel/frequency, example is we hear others talking on other channels don't quote me on this but you might want to google search your midland radio and see if it is able to.
Yes it is.
Yup! This will for sure work in a Holga 120 camera- it's 120 film, so it'll work in any 120 camera. I would recommend using it outdoors, as it needs a lot of light, or with a flash. Have fun!
If they have a receiver on the same channel and are within your signal strength, they will see what you see.
1G
yes it does.
No...and don't try it. Unfortunately, these things require 3 ohm speakers.
I do not know. Sorry.
Not sure, I actually used this for a friend and no longer have this item. I will say that I've used this item several times with a couple different manufacturers (WD, Seagate, etc.) and have not had an issue with any of the HDD not fitting. Hope this helps.
Yes it accommodated my Toshiba MK1059GSM, 1TB drive - which is 12.5 mm thick. The case is really quite nice. If you plan to use the eSATA connector you should also know that an eSATA cable was not included (there's just the standard Y-type USB cable)
Yes, until you open the door. No vol control
I do not have a 1610 but have one that's 35 years old that it works in, Yes to white letters on black tape.
Nope! You get full access to the codes from the vehicle selector on their website.
Yes, that is what I'm doing. Many devices plugged into the switch, switch plugged into the MoCA adapter. On the other end is another MoCA adapter plugged into the router.
It's a defective chip. I had the same thing happen. My TV was out of warranty. I found that this is a known problem, and Mitsubishi is willing to cover the cost of the part. I had to pay for the house call/ labor which came to $200.00. Contact Mitsubishi customer service. They should offer the same deal. You can Google this problem, and you'll see that it's pretty common.
Not the ones I have. It is set up 110V.
Yes the lens is removeable, they make several different lenses for this camera
The SanDisk reserves about 500 Mgb for its own setup, etc., leaving you about 7.5 Gb. The size of individual photos depends on your camera and on the settings you choose; it ranges from 3 to 10 Mgb. If you store only still shots on the drive, that would mean you can store from 750 to nearly 2000 pics. Of course, once you start adding videos with sound, you're using hundreds of Mgb for a minute of video, so....
I add and delete pictures, game files, and word files from mine all the time.
It is a flat surface.
This battery works great in my DSC-HX9V/B and in looking around a bit...the sony H-90 is a different model than the one I have...so I cant say for sure it would
I bought it for my daughter for a Christmas present last year. She hasn't told me anything negative about it. Sorry I couldn't answer in more detail.
The shell does a great job of protecting my MAC Book Pro from scratches, so under that those conditions, it's very good for traveling. However, if you are a little rough with your computers ( dropping, hitting the edge of the computers against hard surfaces), these cases may not fully protect the computer from damage.
my tv looks wonderful with HDMI passing through the receiver, i have the strdh800
Sorry I can't answer this question because I sent the headphones as a gift to a friend with a hearing problem who has trouble watching TV with his wife, who needs a much lower volume setting on the TV itself. However, he loves it, and, judging from another brand that I bought for the same reason two yeras ago, they seem to hold a charge easily for a whole day's watching. I suspect they they can all do the same thing with two inner AA rechargeable batteries .
yes, but the sound quality is tinny with little or no bass and the counter light is nice but not so bright.
The radio has a jack you can plug into your I phone 4 head phone jack and your music will play through the radio. At that point you will control using your I phone.
Absolutely. The base is detachable and the hole patterns are specific for like branded dual monitor stands as well as AIO bases.
The monitor is DVI-D. I'm not sure what the difference is between single and dual links, but the description of the cable I use says it's dual link and it works great. Hopefully this helps. This is the cable I use:
Yes, with an Ethernet cable. Plug the Slinglink in the wall outlet closest to the Blu-ray player for convenience. While the other end is connected to your router or modem.
Did you receive our email response with instructions?
I can't answer you question with any degree of certainty but I can tell you the box they come in is stamped 2014 on the bottom flap.
Smaller than full-sized. We vacationed in Maui this past week and brought them with us. They have amazing quality for the price. Would not give it a second thought. We bought the 10x36 and 10x42, ended up keeping the 10x36 as they were the better of the two, lighter and similar optics.
I would try the Bushnell Web site
According to http://www.photozone.de/nikon--nikkor-aps-c-lens-tests/481-tamron_60_20_nikon : The lens features an integrated AF drive, so it is compatible and provides AF with all current Nikon DSLRs, including the motor-free entry level cameras.
Mine was and is free of scratches. Did you receive a scratched lens, and if so, return it for a new one. The 60mm macro is great.
Yes, the R51 has onboard wireless that works reasonably well (assuming it all still works)
If is too light they have different on for your camera. You need to see how have is your camera. And the glidecam comes with the weights to balance. Look for videos on you tube how to balance the glidecam.
yes it should
I have the Magnavox MDR535H if you think I can help let me know. Call 1-800-605-8610 for support or for on line support go to www.magnavox.com/support
No
Flashes and cameras are finicky. I had the bowew sfd720 and it did not work well with my canon. I took it to the local camera shop and he explained that the camera and flash were not communicating. Once I bought a canon flash, I had no problems. I also tried the bower on my Sony and it did not communicate with it at all. If I were you and you have a serious passion for photography, I would spend the money and buy a sony flash to work on your sony camera.
I don't know. I would think it does, but I'm not sure, since I only have a Rebel T3, which I think is the same as an 1100D?
The box says 7 years or more. No one will know for sure until time passes.
Yes. The manual says: "Your Smoke Alarm requires one standard 9V battery. The following batteries are acceptable as replacements: Duracell #MN1604, (Ultra) #MX1604; Eveready (Energizer) #522. You may also use a Lithium battery like the Ultralife U9VL-J, U9VL-J-P for longer service life between battery changes. These batteries are available at many local retail stores."
I don't think it will fit. If you go to Camerasize.com and compare your camera to my Panasonic Gf1, you'll see that your camera is a bit larger than mine. Mine fits comfortably with the 20mm pancake lens, but has to be wrestled with to make it fit with the 14-45mm zoom. I'd see if DiCAPac has a larger size available, or look at similar products from another manufacturer like Aquapac or Outex.
I'm not sure, I bought mine for a sony, it didn't work well and sent it back.
It works with a Coolpix L820. I think it would work with an L830.
No, I believe that is an option you can add on but it does not come with a dedicated port to stack the switch. Of course you can still just connect it to other switches using the regular switch ports for a 1GB connection but if you are looking to manage a stacked switch using a dedicated IP then you would need to look for the optional card. I have 3 connected this way and with the 1GB connection I really don't think its a problem unless you need the throughput for a lot of bandwidth.
Yes
It weighs about 3 lbs ish. And no carrying case unfortunately.
Hi, Yes it does. should have enough weights to match weight for minimal lens setup and a little more. Thanks O
The camera platform has many holes in order to position your camera exactly where you want it, so the answer is yes.
The back of the unit is very well labelled. Are you referring to an HDMI cord? If so, that's what I hooked into the back of mine. And like I said, look at the back of the unit; you can determine where to hook into it.
You can still get it from Newegg for $330. Tiger Direct has it for $350. If you want to consider the other models, Newegg has a good comparison feature, as well, though Samsung does not provide consistent data for their PCs, which limits effectiveness.
How about this. It snaps in very gently, but you can't shake it out of the case. For my use, it is perfect. I've also had this thing for several years, and China changes their specs about once a week. Today's device could be very different.

Does anyone installed Office 2007 Word program without macro error message?
Be careful-Dont be satisfied with the Starter version of Windows 7. I hear you then just have to upgrade and pay another $75, or more
Yes.
I don't think it will matter. Try it and see if it sounds okay.
Not sure. It sticks out past bottom of seat about 4 inches at the most.
The USB device that you plug into your computer that looks like a memory stick..... Pull it out of the computer and insert it into the slot on the bottom side of your mouse.
yes, it has plenty of surface space to work with a laptop that big.
R u switching the the placement of the fuse to the appropriate slot
Your cell phone charger should accept 110v to 220v, that's a standard. What you need is only a plug adapter, that's all.
Definitely not, this has only about 200W output where a hair dryes has 800-1000W. Hope this helps.
There was no warranty information included in package...not even a phone number, website, or email address. I could not find support from anyone when my converter stopped working. Now, I am trying to find a converter from a company that doesn't hide from their customers.
Yes it will. Ultra, butterfly, panasonic etc. etc. Making dosas ? Jus kidding. Enjoy
yes, just make sure that you set the voltage correctly at the back of the machine.
Independently of how many watts your appliance has, this trafo makes always this kind of buzzing sound. it seems that this is also normal. If you have only one appliance(s) with less than 3000W, you should think about buying a less powerful trafo.
yes thank you
Hello. Sorry I only have this lens . Thank you
I realize this is a few months old, but came up on my screen, and maybe will help others... YES! Sigma's HSM (which this lens has) is essentially equivalent to nikon's AF-S/SWM (and also canon's USM), meaning there is a focusing motor in the lens, so will focus even on cameras that do not have a built in focus motor, such as the D40, D40X, D60, D3000 and D5000
No, I tested it with a SLR film camera (full frame) and at 18mm you can see a dark circle around the image, over 24mm the circle disappears. This lens works well in APS-C cameras.
I don't really know. I'd try any reputable camera repair shop.
Yes
no
It has bluetooth, so it will work with anything else that is bluetooth capable.
It's an affordable Smart Phone manufactured by Motorola
Hello, If you purchase this item from our company, CableForge/ReadyPlug, it will be shipped from Smithfield, Utah, USA. Thanks, and please let us know if we can help you with anything else. Have a fantastic day! Lance
It might but there's a slight chance it wont properly power it. Try this http://www.amazon.com/Power-Supply-Samsung-SyncMaster-LCD/dp/B001MQ4NJU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1394387347&sr=8-2&keywords=samsung+syncmaster+sa300+monitor, practically the same price and also with Prime shipping :D Customer comments on it show it being compatible with your monitor as well.
yes I use it with my kindle and it works great
7ft
Sure it can
About 3 feet
no.
Not sure what you mean by kit but the price is for 1 access point.
If your question is the physical size of the power brick itself, then 4 1/4th in x 1 15/16ths x 1 3/8ths. 112 mm x 50mm x 31mm. Harry
If you can connect to the output rca port of your tv tuner. Since the dvd recorder does not have a tuner it cannot record directly.
I have the single cup mount. Mine is 5 inches from the suction cup to the threaded top where the camera mounts. It works real well.
If your talking about the 4 pin molex connectors they attach to your power supply. A suggestion get rid of the stock fans they don't move very much air
Yea
This is a bona fide 23" monitor. I like the brightness and sharpness very much, it works well for me for watching movies while lounging on my bed, when connected to my Asus UL30A laptop via the included VGA cable. The HDMI setup has been cumbersome and I may scrap it altogether. Sound via the UL30A' s built in speakers is good/loud enough, that it may not be worthwhile to waste a 1/2 hour figuring it out. Anyway, I got the 15' cable for ~6 bucks, so no big deal.
Nope.
I'm not 100% sure about the Z800 but it came out of a Z600
Not a problem! These speakers can be easily over driven with a clean signal.I had them on a Sony 4 channel x 50 watt rms head unit with no issues as they are a 70 watt rmv speaker. I then added a kenwood 300 watt per channel rmv amp and again, no problems or even any significant distortion. They blow away any coaxial or triax type speakers I have ever heard. ENJOY!!!!
less than a pound. It is a very nice netbook, although mine has gotten some age on it.
It came with the some disk but I don't remember with one and no manuals
this model does not have an HDMI port, it only has a VGA/ RGB connection. And even if it did, it doesn't have the processor speed to handle that kind of video. You can video at 360 at best on youtube. Hope this helps.
Yes, some internet games
My A1 was from Amazon warehouse as an used item. It came with two RCA connector (line level) cables.
I could not get it to work with my Toshiba laptop.
I returned mine. Was not functional. Sorry I cant help more.
Guide to antenna colors: http://www.antennaweb.org/info/AntennaInfo.aspx There is a label on the box. This antenna should receive green, light green, yellow, red and possibly blue. You may get some purple with an amp but it might screw with your stronger signals.
Mine goes to a 3 way splitter, two TV's were within 6 feet of splitter and were good, the third was 30 feet of coax away from splitter and no signal was getting to that TV so I put a pre amp between splitter and that 30 feet of coax and then that TV worked perfectly
There are 2 labels 1.) Hp 9C4LYO0, and 2.) MT36JSZF51272PZ-1G4F1DD 1027, Product of Puerto Rico DDAAM04004. This ram didn't work with my Asus A55M-A/USB3 mobo.
Yes, it fits on Nikon D3100, but since this lens was made for FX formats (such as Nikon D600, D700, D800, D3, D4...), it will have an actual focal length of 127.5mm on DX formats such as the D3100.
I'm not too familiar with the FM 10 - it will mount on the body and I think the auto exposure settings will work. It also will cover the full 35mm frame.
Sorry, i'm not familiar with the Canon T5i camera. My curent setup with the Rokinon 85mm lens doesn't allow me to Auto Focus, but manual focus is easily achieved with a feature within my Sony Alpha camera. Depending on what camera you use, some Rokinon lenses come with a Focus chip built into the lens to achieve Auto focus.
Yes
This does not give the digital data out. You can chip the mount of the lens and put in a standard answer that you can use for micro-adjustment.
yes
Rokinon 85mm f/1.4 for Pentax (K-mount) will work with a K-50. Set the aperture ring to A and you can set the aperture from the camera. It is a manual focus lens no matter what camera it is used on.
IN my case I got all the green channels listed when I gave my zip code for the DTV maps listed at this site. http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/engineering/dtvmaps/ Note that each call sign may have multiple channels.
I don't know. You should be able to see a list of compatible models from the product description on the Amazon site. Sorry I wasn't more helpful.
I don't know about that. Beware though, I will say that I have purchased 3 of these since September. The first one worked for 4 months and then developed a short and it would randomly stop charging. The other two I purchased did not work at all. The 2nd one would sporadically make a connection and the 3rd one never did. Each time I plugged them in I received a message saying that it was non-compatible with my laptop and to purchase a Dell 90watt power cord which is what this one is.
You cannot plug an iPhone 5 into this model unless you have the apple adapter. This model does not have a USB port.
Yes
I'm sure you could.
Yes
No, it's a GPS watch, not a pedometer. You could theoretically leave it running all day, and it'll tell you how many miles you've walked. But it's not just a step-counter; it tracks distance covered and time/pace.
It will work with any device that has a headphone jack for audio output. I have a set connected to a LG HDTV.
Not sure... If the turntables output is equivalent to a cd player it would work... Not sure of the output of the turntable.
I personally think it is quite big and heavy. Sometimes I have to take it off my wrist and put it in my pocket but I cannot train without so I deal with it.
You have to check the options on the one you pick, but this one apparently comes with it. If you have had other Forerunners, the heart rate monitor strap seems to work well with any of them. It is another reason I like the 310 - the heart rate monitor is usually pretty good. But there is one big thing I have found and that is that if you wear clothes that have static or some certain fabrics, it won't work well, so you have to figure out what clothes don't interfere with it.
120v and the power cable attaches to the sub. (There's no info on the cable, only the sub. On the sub it says: 120v 60Hz 300W)
No -- it's not a headphone jack, it's an auxiliary sound input. These speakers do not have a headphone jack, unlike the earlier model, which does.
Not a good question. Rephrase.
4.72441 inches or like we said here in the U.S.A. "almost 5 inches."
Yes
I am not too sure, actually. On my T2i the lens fit but the macro was useless. No matter what I did, I couldn't focus on the subject. When I contacted the seller I was told that "sometimes there are compatibility issues". Hope that helps.
yes that is what i am using
It fits on my T3i Canon EOS without any adapter. Works quite well.
Yes this mouse is compatible with windows 7.
A touch under 6 feet - I've been using this keyboard for about 8 months and the only complaint I have is that the volume control buttons go: up, down, mute where I'm used to the placement being the other way around. Not really a big deal ;)
Yes they are.
4x6 is what the "slots" are for. I have put larger postcards in it, but it requires breaking the separation between the slots.
All HP machines use a two wire fax connection. I know this works on my 5600 and 6500. I would assume it would work on your 6300. Sorry I can't be more definitive than that.
I had the same dilemma. I used this on an HP product. I can verify that it worked fine.
The ones that allow the legs to swing are metal with a metal push button. The leg extension locks are metal except for the little arm to lock them in place. That part is plastic.
yes, they work with mac. I used it for net chatting,
Not sure other than to say you might have to get a new headset.
I haven't tried to use it for that, so I don't know. I use it to record local sports reports for a radio station.
No, it is for making one input available to four devices. You would probably need to get an HDMI switch to make multiple devices output to one recorder/tv/monitor. You would still need a splitter to remove HDCP or you won't be able to record PS4.
Yes. That is what I use it with. I have boxes and boxes of slides my dad gave me, this was the best thing I ever bought! It is so simple to use, I was able to share family history with all my relatives
yep! works perfectly with siri and everything.
Mine only does that when i fail to connect it to the power because it wont transmit signal without electricity
Yes laptop has all equiptment to power up, recharge right out of the box.
Probably if there is a usb port and if the tv has internet connection. I went through my Samsung blueray. Hope I helped. Can't tell you for sure though. Sorry.
Yes it does
no they do not. they are regular controllers
It's been my experience most LG remotes are interchangeable, when I broke mine I used the remote from the bedroom.
Im not sure. I received an 8 cell battery for a toshiba laptop and had to return it.
Yes, the battery is compatible; since it is larger the battery does raise the back of the laptop slightly bu this tilt makes the keyboard easier to use.
I believe it will...I use mine with a Google Chromecast and a PS2
I haven't bought any filters, just some pressured-air cleaning every once in a while. Have had it for 2 years now.
The numbers/information on the capacitors must match. After that I don't know.
I did not look if there is any warranty because I think the replace one might be the same. It takes time and cost on shipping. The battery is heavy. I could not wait. I need the computer for my work. I had to run to the store to get the replace battery. T
I would not buy this now as much of the internet radio service went away (such as the BBC) when they discontinued it. I would suggest you look at the Grace unit - it has mono out. That is the unit I bought to replace the VTech.
I don't know.
Yes it does.
I went online to support today and they scheduled a technician to update the TV with what they referred to as the "lip sync patch". Hopefully that will fix it.
Yes, it should work fine.
It does. However, the USB device is a piece of c... And I had problems with the mouese for both sets purchased. It turns out others had the same issue. One was destroyed and one was returned. Not recommended.
Hello there, you can try some alkaline, however I do believe there are rechargeable Lithium Ion batteries that will fit. They would be fairly expensive, but they would last a long time. They would really pay for themselves, and would have a better charge life. Be careful which brands, there are tons of rip-off brands. Go with duracell, or another company that is well known.
Helllo JB My Onkyo receiver is the HTR990 So it has a special plug for the iPod dock Its not RCA or hdmi , you have to have a receiver that's iPod direct . Or what I used to do is plug into headphone jack and then use RCA cable But you have to operate iPod with hand You don't get picture on your tv and of course the fancy matching base
I got this for my MacBook based on the specs and it worked fine. However, I have an older MacBook and the most RAM it will accept is 3GB (2GB + 1GB). My MacBook has two slots for RAM so I just needed up swap out one of the cards. Check your MacBook specs online to confirm.
According to Samsung datasheet this F7 RAM performs up to CL-6 (800mbps) http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/file/2011/product/2008/9/16/844089ds_ddr2_1gb_e-die_based_sodimm_rev10.pdf
Per industry standards DDR2 is by definition 1.8V. But the only things that matter are what types of memory your laptop is compatible with - ie. "PC2-6400, DDR2, 800MHz". Most computers/laptops can take a small range of memory types, but you have to refer to your manual or manufacturer's website.
No, I wouldn't recommend it. I thought I had a strong, direct signal outdoors and am disappointed with my reception. I haven't reached a final decision yet, but have purchased a powered signal amplifier. I live in an apartment and bought this antenna because it could be mounted discretely outdoors. It's certainly good looking.
I think it can be either or. I'm currently using it as exhaust and is working great, even for hard gaming.
Go youtube and search for Adel fingerprint ,it will show you better than paper manual.
I don't know if it is steel but it is metal and heavy.
Technically, "yes" if you turn the fingerprint reading upside down. In that way the water is not coming directly to the reader so make sure you clean your finger when scanning.
Yes it is true unless you kept a back up that you could fall back on. Once you delete and confirm the deletion it is gone. Sorry to here the bad news.
Yes, the box has one coax cable that run from antenna to the TV, and also a power cable.
Like Nicco said, the ear pieces themselves are fine. The headrest can cause a bit of discomfort after a while, but slightly shifting the angle helps with that.
There are two 41/2 inch drivers plus 1 inch silk/polymer dome.
Hi Lynda, You download the update program to your home computer. It will tell you when updates are available. Plug your Nuvi into your computer and follow the prompts. It will update automatically. I must warn you though, the updates take hours. I do mine overnight. You might have to add a memory chip to your Nuvi to get a complete update. I did, but it all works well. Good luck.
Single Unit
I use the OM5 as the center channel in my setup. It is powered by a Pioneer Elite 60. I have OM3's filling out the rest of the 7.2 system. The sound of the Polk's powered by the Pioneer is very clear with out sounding too bright, I have 4 sub's, two ported 12inch in front and two sealed 10 inch in the rear. Because of the design of the speaker, you will need bass assistance. But bass wasn't the selling point, clarity was, and they are very clear.
I don't know about lenovo but I've been able to xonnect it to an HP and a Dell without any trouble so my guess is yes...
No
tara, I got curious about your questin and was able to e-mail the company thru amazon and this is what the tech had to say! I hope this helps! I have tested these on the MacBook Pro running Mac OSX 10.6 and it was fine - in the event you have problem with the drive with the Mac you are running - you can contact us for support or return item for refund I hope this helps you!!!
I am sorry that I am no help. Mine didn't even work... So I guess you're lucky that yours does something rather than nothing, right? Lol
No. Not unless the movie is on a CD. This is not a DVD player.
CD-ROM Drive can use for installation is just like downloading and I think CD-RW/DVD Drive is a rewritable like a burn CD/DVD which can be recorder
I've used it with Win 8 on an HP laptop. It doesn't work very well. I have to unplug it and plug it back and sometimes it picks it, and sometimes it doesn't.
I have less than no idea...sorry hunny bun!
yes it will
I have a gateway and purchased this universal adapter and has a tip that fits perfect and I have been using this for over a year with my laptop.
These adaptors are for a laptop, any model but not a netbook
This adapter has multiple voltage settings including 19v. According to that it should work if used at that setting.
Buffalo, NY is about 40 miles from here, not all station came in clear. Toronto is 30 miles across the lake, all stations came in fine.
I have no idea as for Win 8 as I use Win 7 Pro and this item works fine with aspire. Didn't install 8.1 because I felt it cannot handle that.
Yes it does
I not have a tablet. It connects to a usb port. I assume you will need an adaptor
I keep mine at 33 inches. It is adjustable.
It should.. I put a Kodak in there
The inside of the case measures 2 7/8" W X 4 1/2" L. x 1 1/8" deep. My Kodak camera measures. 3 3/4" L x 2 1/2" W x 3/4" thick so it fits. With camera stap attaced and extra memory card in pocket. Hope this helps
The ones I get are within 35 miles - but depends greatly on what surrounds you (open water extends signals, heavy forest or buildings would reduce them). Go online and search for tv station antennas so you know how far they are away from you.
I can get a station 35 miles away.
NO ES NESESARIO MANTENER ENCHUFADO SI SE PUEDE
No
It's duel so it comes with 2. One controls both of them that's why there are only buttons on one.
2 & 3/4" high x 1 & 7/8" wide x 1 & 1/2" deep. I can't believe how good the sound is coming out of these tiny speakers. I love them. Margaret
Yes the charge came with mine I charge the lap top and the battery lasts 6 plus hours with a full charge
it is 2 x 2 gig ram modules to make a total of 4 gigs
Read your owner's manual. If it supports &gt;=4GB of PC2-6400 800mhz 5-5-5 DDR2 SDRAM then yes it will.
I use it on my old Sager laptop and it does not run hot. The two outlets on this card are usb 2.0. There is also a small round connection to use with the included cable that plugs into and existing usb port on your computer to increase the power available to this card. There are no sata, or esata connections.
3 and 11/32 inches long. 2 and 1/8 inches wide. 3/16 inches thick. it fits perfectly flush in my laptop. it works perfectly.
Yes, run the CD to install the driver first before ploughing in the device.
It comes with crossovers that you attach to the wiring
Yes they come in a set n they are very good worth buying
They sound really good and I dont if they will fit but I love mine
I had the same problem. Was able to buy the adapters cheaply at Radio Shack. I still had issues though with the signal/picture quality coming through the connection being significantly degraded (lots of static).
You can contact seller directly through your order. They would help you ASAP.
Costa Rica would require the purchase of additional maps unless you purchase one with Central American maps. Personally, I wouldn't buy another Magellan anyway. Not good customer service. Tom Tom or Garmin are both better choices in my opinion.
no
yes,micro g2 card works on 3210 with good data
Yes it does. This is a micro card however it comes with a SD adapter that will fit into your 421s.
It was current when I bought it last summer. They usually provide updates. Free for certain packages.
The vision card is from Garmin you can research it on their website.
YUP, you just need to remove the normal iMac stand and get the VESA mount kit from Apple. It's like $100. I actually have my Thunderbolt display on it.
There is a very small tag at the bottom of the main compartment that states the product is made in Vietnam.
Not sure this will help, but here are the codes for the Roku streaming media devices included in the product instructions: 4395 and 4355. Hope this helps!
Hi Dennis, Try pressing the test tone button on the remote, and see if your getting sound from all speakers. Also, did you use the RCA cables from the BD player to the Onkyo? ( one for each speaker ) Don't forget to choose the right format from the Blu-ray disk ( Dolby truehd / DTS HD master audio ) If your still having a problem, let me know..I can probably walk you through a little more detail. Tom
It sure would buddy boy! This sub is perfect
IDK they are in a box. should tell you on sales listing. You will enjoy if you get, they are AMAZING.
Well infinity subwoofers are good with any amp. They are really great subs.
Caps are junk they dont work at all and alot of pros will tell you that a cap will hurt your electrical system. I would look up big 3 upgrade and or a powercell but with 3000 rms u will need to upgrade your starter battery and run a 2nd powercell battery u can get them on here for like 100 bucks good luck man
infinity hands down
I do not know? However if you go to remote.com they should help locate remote you need.
They're sized for "standard" (E27) lights. I had intended to use this with 4x 100W equivalent CFL bulbs, and found it to actually be too bright for my space and went down to 4x 60W equivalent bulbs.
i purchased it and within 4 minutes of unboxing and pluging it in i heard 2 loud pops and the charger stopped working. Very cheap dont buy
It requires an available PCI slot on your computer and only works with the following Operating Systems. * Windows XP, * Windows Vista (32 and 64-bit) * Windows 7 (32 and 64-bit)
It requires a standard AC outlet. It does not plug into USB at all, it gets the audio from a headphone outlet.
A wall wart transformer is provided to power the internal amp.
What software you're running shouldn't matter. If your PC has a 3.5mm speaker output jack you can hook them up.
Yes
Can't record at all purely for listening
I live 15-25 miles from tv stations in hilly country. I have to use a digital conerter box plus an antenna.
Honestly, don't know, I'm Windows user. But I do not see why it wouldn't, after all it's just a reader that is compatible with USB 2 port.
i guess you know by now it was replaced with the Sony HTCT350, has later audio compatibility and 3d tv passthrough
I have AT&T so I have aimed it at the closest AT&T tower and it works great. Before the external antenna we only got about 1 to 2 bars with just the Z-boost inside antenna. Since the external antenna we have a full 5 bars. My tower is within eye sight but not sure on the distance. If I had to guess, I would say 3 or 4 miles maybe more. I would think it will work with your carrier as well.
In my opinion, enclosure is a better option if you plan to "set it and forget it"
Hi there dan here it`s 6 inches long ta da!
3.56 inches long
I've used it with XP & Windows 8 so I'm pretty certain it will work with Windows 7. It's USB so it should work with any operating system as long as you have a USB port
If you are referring to the physical mute button on the mic, when the mic button is pushed into the stand, it is on, when you click it again and the button is sticking out of the stand it is off.
Yes. Yes, if you have a Mac Pro 13" or a MacBook Air you will have to change your headphone jack to be an audio input in settings however.
I assume it can but I didn't keep it long enough to test it. CD playing wasn't stable.
I would recommend to you Panasonic LUMIX G 20mm f/1.7 and even more Panasonic 25mm f/1.4 Leica DG Summilux - I use both for more than 5 years and they are excellent, sharp and fast. Nowadays, more fast lenses are coming but I don't have them so can't recommend.
You just have to avoid exposing the front of the lens to rain etc..just ordinary care quite simply. Its a wonderful lens anyhow and I use it very often as my only lens together with 20/1.7 when traveling
It has "Made in Japan" stamped on it.
yes and it worked great!
This cable did not work with my xbox one chat adapter. I used it with Astro A40's and I believe the issue was that the 3.5mm end only had two black rings/connections where it needs 3; one for left, right, and mic audio.
No, this isn't the same battery--this one doesn't even fit the 1440!
Mine did
Hello Steve, this is not a good choice for low-light conditions. It only works in daytime, or indoors with good lighting.
I just got mine. I fully charged the battery and put in a 32GB chip and only got 105 minutes worth of video. I'm going to charge again and try one more time..but I'm pretty sure the results will be the same.
Three inches long by 3/4" . Hope this helps.
Just videos.
5ft
Yes--works very well.
Sorry I have only tried it with Windows 7.
Check the specs if it has Bluetooth no.if not yes.range is a little spotty between rooms
Yes, works great & room for IPad, cords & other paperwork/books, sewn strongly re-enforced straps & corners.
Yes
Your investment being a tablet or laptop, maybe not. It's got some padding inside, but not enough all around. What you could do is drop your device into a sleeve and then pack that into this messenger bag. The handle/strap is very sturdy. My kid carries at least 10 to 12 pounds in it daily. He has also used it to lug his Xbox system back and forth to visit family.
You can trans straight to your PC. The unit appears as a drive.
this is a very accurate unit. you can buy detailed map grids from Garmin or get them free just google free downloads for Garmin 200. Bought one for my son who hikes in N.Y. and N.J. He downloads specific maps from google easily.
Yes you can....mark a waypoint then "save and edit"...you can change the one you marked with the one you want...pretty easy...Good luck...Also, check Google or the manual as to how to :enter a waypoint:..
yes it comes with everything you need. except software
Officially you can by sending it to the nearest Asus service center. Whatever that means. It is doable but only for the hard-core geeks. It requires a complete stripdown of the computer to access the RAM module on the bottom side of the motherboard. It probably also voids your warranty. For more information see the following http://forum.eeeuser.com/viewtopic.php?id=68951
No, they don't come with any mounting plates. Just the speakers.
It's up to you. I don't have these anymore because I got a new car but still love infinity using the 6 1/2 with the tweeters. I use all the speakers both ways with and without the amp. They will hit hard either way you go.
I received my lens about a month ago and yes it comes with a lens hood. The 18-55 mm lens does not so I purchased that separately. Also the 35mm f1.8 comes with a hood. Hope that helps.
You can buy it as a camera body only or with a lens. I bought it with a sony 18-55 mm lens
Yes this lens will work well on the A300. Something to consider though is what you are going to use it for. The 35MM 1.8 seems to be a bit sharper and is better for portraits. We have both and find ourselves reaching for the 35MM much more often than the 50MM because of the extra width it offers. The 35MM is a few dollars more but offers more versatility :D
No
I have the Sony a300, not a3000. It fits the a300, and I am very happy with it.
Dry.
the difference is the size, type 3 is for FX sensor and type 2 for DX, which is what you need.
it is black I think if not u can spray paint it :-)
The hold up in the rain!! a friend of mine has a set on his boat
bass is fantastic. at times a little too much
the bass is actually very good, loudness was ok for me I never tried it to max but at about 3/4 was plenty loud
No mine has no headphone jack
No, it doesn
HP G60 has AMD processor. Compaq CQ60-410US has Intel Celeron 2.1ghz processor, per HP.
Yes, I bought them for exactly that reason, I bought some longer cords to connect cameras that were a longer distance than the 60 foot cables that come with them, so I bought these to connect to 60 footers I had left over, work perfect, the power connects without any adapters (found this out the hard way, bought the connectors that did not work, then discovered they just plug in to each other!)
I would be very surprised if they did not, this is highly adjustable. mounting holes (spacing) are generally standard. I wouldn't worry too much about it.
It is supposed to be mounted on 16"enters but it has slots that range from 12 to 14 to 16 and 18".
the knob on the rear plate mount on the tv back is the adjustment loosen to allow the tilt function to work best to do with a person on each corner of the set
You just put a little water in the bottom, and add a few drops of cleaner (comes with it) if you want, and lower in whatever you want to clean. Plug it in. Hit the "on" button - it runs on a timer.
The bracket doesn't have much to do vertical shooting on tripod. As long was the tripod is durable or if you have sandbags to hold the tripod down, there wouldn't be a problem. It has to do with the weight of the camera in addition to the bracket. If the tripod isn't durable, the camera weight will tilt the entire tripod and possibly damage your dslr. Best, TechNeek
They don't have volume control, plus i would recommend getting different earbuds instead, these earbuds aren't very good
They come with a earpiece for each walkie talkie.
No. Mine were very basic. No volume control, just earbuds.
This pair does not. It has a volume control instead. The ones that do, say "with mic" somewhere in the title or description.
HP Pavilion DV2000-DV9000 fits a laptop or notebook or something small. Look up the LG BH12LS38 12xBLURAY BURNER, it will show you what fits the desktop
I don't know about the DV9000, but I bought it for my DV6000 (DV6450) and it worked fine from about 6-8 months ago and still does.
Yes everything ok
Sorry Ken I can't answer your questions. The item I bought was defective and I had to send it back. What it was supposed to do: My older model Ipod's headphone jack stopped working and I wanted to be able to use the plug located on the bottom of the unit to plug in a set of headphones.
The slot in the flip-down face is made for only iPods and some iPhones. You can buy a bluetooth adapter to use for other external devices.
Yes, I leave my ipod inside the radio for months, it keeps it protected and the only time I take it out is to update it with new music from mp3rocket.com and so far, it has not caused any problems that I am aware of. I have the Ipod classic.
No
Yes. As answered below it had 5 boxes of 20 exp. each
09/2014
I really do not know. I finally went to Batteries Plus to purchase a battery and the battery works very well.
Panasonic DMW-BCG10PP Battery Charger - for Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS7, DMC-ZS6, DMC-ZS10, DMC-ZS5, DMC-ZS3, DMC-ZS8, DMC-ZS1, DMC-ZR3, DMC-ZR1, DMC-TZ10, DMC-TZ7, DMC-TZ20, DMW-BCG10, DMC-TZ8, DMC-ZX3, DMC-TZ6, DMC-ZX1, DMC-TZ18, DMW-BCG10E, DMC-TZ19
Thank you for contacting Parts Express. We do not ship our products internationally through Amazon. Please accept our apologies. Sincerely, Customer Service Team
Yes that is what we bought it for
No, it would not. This case is way to big for the nano.
No, not according to the online research that was done when I was looking. Google Vizio gv42I if you have not already.
Yes. I have had that same model TV for several years and the remote works fine with it. The original that came with the set broke when I sat on it and the VUR9 is the replacement I bought a couple of years after I bought the TV. It looks and operates exactly the same as the original. -
have no clue for the code for verizon remote i have a vizio remote
No. It will boot off of a CD in a CD Reader hooked up by a usb cable. (Not included)
there is a plug in on the side of the black square housing that supplies power from a ac adapter to power your 7 usb squid. if you didn't have a ac adapter to power these 7 usb squids it would drain your motherboard resources the usb ports on the motherboard only have so much power that's why you need a wall 110v ac adapter to power usb devices
Hi, you can try to plug it into a different usb port inside your computer. I had my computer and the same thing happened...but I changed it and it works although sometimes it doesnt recognize cards.
You can, I used 3 slots at once before. I used the MS slot, USB slot, and the TF slot all at once and they all functioned correctly. I haven't tested the others though, simply because I have nothing to test them with.
Get a viewsonic if it's on a school budget. They have educator discount codes available.
I couldn't focus this no matter what I tried. It's a waste of time and money.
I have no clue. i I own the devive but have not had to replace the battery.
no
I only have two speakers and two sending units. I can use two sources by setting the sending units to different channels. I don't see why you couldn't use 4 or more speakers with one sending unit. Just set the speakers so that either 2 are "left" and 2 "right" or you could set all four to mono or any combination. Turn the source- sending unit on and set its channel. Then go to each speaker and press auto scan. Each speaker should find the sender.
it may work intermittently. I dont think it would be reliable. The walls will definitely cause problems at that distance.
I'm using 1.0, but it should work with the latest version
Does not work at all!!
Nope!
Yes, it works with the 4S. Reception varies depending upon the area though.
Well I'm starting to have problems with the cable to be honest. I use it beside my bed with my iPad. It usually doesn't get moved around much, but it's beginning to cut out and make strange buzzing sounds.
Yes
Is this iphone 4 compatible?
I could not. It would only work with the alarm. Unless I'm doing something wrong. I tried it with the radio and my ipod and it only worked with the alarm
no it doesn't
Yes, it will work on a computer that has a tower.
If the computer is not recognizing the device, you may need to check the cable. If it is, then I suggest bypassing your music program to add/remove music. Since Expresso Latte works as a storage device, you can use it as a drive to manage music files.
Yes
Assign one of the buttons to do so, then hold it down and roll down, or set the button to scroll down one line or one screen each touch of it.
In iTunes, go to Help, Index Tab, MP3, and select "Saving a copy of a song in a new file format" and follow the directions (by selecting MP3 as your format). Note: this is not just for importing new music as it may appear in the description. You have to change the Import Settings in Edit, Preferences, General Tab before you can change the format in your Library. The entire collection can be reformatted by Selecting All, Advanced, Create MP3 Version. Good Luck!
I never tried Amazon Prime with this unit, but I bet it will work if you use your computer for Amazon Prime. I used to listen to YouTube videos with this until I got a new computer last year.
I used to get that message (until I turned it off) on my old IBM/Lenova when I slightly moved the laptop too. I found it was nothing to be concerned about. I selected the do not display option on the Toshiba.
Get an external drive.
I'm using this one -&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-10-1-Inch-Netbook-Sleeve-Black/dp/B002CM3MXQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1254439771&sr=8-1 It's made by Toshiba especially made for NB205. It's perfect fit...
I currently have a Toshiba NB205-230 and the keys feel good, soft, and very quiet. My only complaint with the one a bought is Win7starter, but that is easily fixed. Even for what I used it for, which was long distance communication and holding data it was a great help to me.
sorry,never heard of this. but i would try contacting creative labs and asking them. they have been really helpful.

Quick answer: No. Maximum playable resolution is DVD 720x576. Anything larger must be resized/recencoded. AVI support varies with encoder used (divx, etc). MPG is fine. Plenty of good free transcoder programs will do the job. Physical resolution of screen is 480x234.
Nope you don't need this. This converter is only useful for SSDs in desktop PCs. Your laptop uses standard 2.5 inch drives so you should be fine.
Absolutely not. This thing is sturdy and super solid.
I am not home at the moment, am out of town, so I cannot look at documentation. But from experience from buying ram, I would say this ram is unbuffered because of it's price point. Buffered ram is much more expensive than unbuffered ram. I've never been able to justify the cost. I have never had any problems with unbuffered ram. That being said, I don't run mission critical software. I run financial, music and photo editing software mostly. Donna
This pair does not. It has a volume control instead. The ones that do, say "with mic" somewhere in the title or description.
It does come with a remotely powered head but it does not come with wired remote. The two options you have are the KCA-RC107MR or KCA-RC60MR.
These speaker push more wattage due to their resistance of 3 ohms. I have two of these with 1 12" solo Baric in my suv. Mid's and highs keep up. At times I have to clock down the highs depending on music played.
yes, your factory radio has a built in cross over. Try it and if you dont like the sound, then install the cross over that came with the speakers. I personally would never do that. "you should use the cross over that come with your speakers."
Only if your amp offers a 2 and 4 ohm settings. Otherwise if your amp is 4ohm only, you can potentially damage your amp!!
Yes
A lens that is included with the camera when you buy it. It's usually not that great of a lens although Pentax is better than some.
I have not owned a gold one but if you adjust your brightness on the black one it is very hard to see. Plus you have the shiny and matte finish to the black one so you could flip it and play with it to see what works.
Main purpose of this privacy screen is to protect your information displayed on the screen from the person who is setting beside you. I may reduce the glare from the screen when you are seeing it directly but not sure that this is the best product that I am aware of for reducing eye strain from laptop use.
yeah works fine if you format it right. Fat32 works good unless files are over 4gigs in size. also ntsf with macfuze installed is a good bet too..
Yes, it is bootable. You need to format it appropriately though. Intel Mac: GUID partition. PPC: HFS+
Connect your external hard drive. Open itunes. Go file, then add to library and select the music files from your external hard drive. This should then add them into your itunes. Hope this helps. I haven't done it from the external hard drive, but I done this similar process from a flash drive.
yeah works fine if you format it right. Fat32 works good unless files are over 4gigs in size. also ntsf with macfuze installed is a good bet too..
For your ps3, ps4,laptop, or pc, you do not need a bracket. One should be supplied with your hard drive that is currently installed. However, to use your old hold drive as a backup, buy a hard drive enclosure. Don't forgot to buy the right screwdriver too!
It should work just fine.
yes
Yes, the Serene Innovations TV 95 operates on a 2.3 mHz so two identical headset will both pick up this signal. Additional headset are available from Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/Serene-TV-Direct-95-Receiver-TV95RX/dp/B009CIYUR0/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1429646614&sr=8-3&keywords=serene+innovations+tv+95
What you want to do is what this amp accommodates. You can use both inputs at the same time. I love mine.
Probably not. The USB over IP driver on Windows is a User Mode driver. Most HASP implementations detect that a user mode driver is in the stack as a way of preventing violations of the copy protection intended by the HASP mechanisms.
Do you mean the release lever? If so, yes, the item is defective. I have not noticed any free moving parts on my TC.
It ought to. You mount the Kenko converter on the camera just like a lens. Then you mount your lens on the converter in the same way as if it was the camera. The Kenko converter extends all the electrical connections from the camera to the lens, thus assuring automatic focus, etc.
Yes
Yes. This thing can turn a stereo source(2 channels) into an 8 channel source. You can actually have all speakers produce the exact same thing, or have a pseudo surround sound effect.
Yes the onkyo has a headphone output with a volume control
A slot. I bought my own mounting brackets and put very small screws in when I attached them to the speakers. Has worked great for the past 1.5 years I have had them.
Yes it has a single rca input !
No! To be honest I feel like I wasted money on these. The speakers are okay at best. The sub is nice, but it does just like someone else mentioned. When watching a movie, if sound dips or there's a lull. The sub cuts off and back on when sound picks up. So you'll get that blue light off and on flicker. Sometimes even a little thump when the sub comes back on. I do like the size of them if you're tight on space. If you aren't go with some bigger front and center speakers. Hope that helps.
Yes it will
Should be 8 ohms...not going to see lower then that unless you get the really high end audio stuff. Typically...even still 8 ohms is about the standard.
No, OX 10 Yosemite only.
did you ever decide which one? whats the differences?
only difference is that you can store more movies, music and pictures, if you are a downloading geek and want to store an extensive library of stuff on your device + gazillions of apps, go for 32GB, I am OK with 16GB
Yes, has WiFi.
No it does not.
I'll propose five reasons: 1. Circular plastic media is on the way out. Streaming is the future. 2. Blu-ray's draconian DRM requires changes (that will reduce performance) in every part of the system hardware and software the video passes through 3. As a storage medium, it's way too expensive. 4. The 27" iMac has DisplayPort input so (with an adapter) a Blu-Ray player can be attached externally and play through the display. 5. It isn't part of Apples game plan which involves selling movies through the iTunes Store.
If it is a recent printer, you should have no problem at all! Recent meaning in the last few years. If it has USB, it will work for sure. Enjoy your new Mac!
Yes... But some USB devices will not work well or at all when plugged into the keyboard. Read your tech info concerning the device you will be connecting. Good luck.
To the Low Profile mount? Nope
I don't think you can. I believe it only works on Optoma Projectors.
No adjustment, they are self bias.
klipsch speakers are usually very high efficent (&gt; 95dB). The I-30 is about 35 watts per channel, so it may over kill. You do not need that much power for Klipsch, unless your listening room is huge and you listen to very laud music. I do not know who is using Klipsch, I will assume many do, though. For Klipsch spk, however, people usually go with MP-2A3C or VP-300B SET (single-end-triode) amp.
That would be a good option but I do not believe that there are any such grips.
Yes they should fit, I put them in a 97 f250 and if there too small go with the 6x9 but if round hole go with a 6in
Yes
It connects to the television via the AV jacks. As long as your tv has the video input (yellow) it should work fine.
Polk. I have to change the infinity just 4 months ago.
I can't answer that. If you go to Crutchfield.com you can find a fit chart by vehicle.
NO I DONT THINK SO, UNLESS YOU CUT AND SPLICE
They have standard Positive and Negative jacks on them, if you can fit em, you can wire em !
It has component, HDMI, optical, and s video. I used the HDMI input, but the picture is terrible...can't get a good video no matter what settings I use. Not real happy with the unit because of this... if I were you I'd look for a Sony...hope this helps....
As long as the bar isn't too big around you can.
The mount works with just the iphone. Won't work with a case or bumper on the phone. I just take my bumper off when i want to mount the phone. But you will love not having to dig into your pocket for your phone when riding your bike.
No, it is a display port output to a HDMI input. there is no USB connector on this cable.
This cable only works from display port to hdmi in. I tried to use it with my xbox360 hdmi out to display port on my monitor and it didn't work. It worked fine from the display port out on my laptop to my hdmi port on my TV.
Yes, this should work. My lenovo laptop has displayport and the other end goes to back of tv to hdmi port, so as long as your external harddrive has display port, it should work.
This Male end DVI cable, will plug into the Female DVI outlet of your video card, and the other end, will plug into the Female plug of a DisplayPort on your monitor. (M)DVI to (M)DP adapter cable.
Not personally, but at my work agents plug in their laptop to a docking station and then have the display shown on two monitors.
Sorry can't answer about that motherboard, but I'm running it on a Gigabyte M61PME-S2 motherboard which supports AMD Socket AM2+ CPU's (Athlon X2 6000 processor) and a thermaltake 800W power supply which I upgraded from a 400W power supply
You need a HDMI port on your computer.
No, doesn't seem it is designed for that radical a turn.
I mounted a 70 inch sony smart tv...almost positive it would work.
Yes
No. I would not recommend this.
No
Mine are Canon batteries and it works great with them!
According to the picture showing the back of the device, it will accept input of 110-240v, 50-60hz. By adding a simple adapter to make the plug match the type of outlet in whatever country you're visiting, the charger should work just about anywhere in the world. (See voltage/frequency table at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mains_electricity_by_country; every country listed has electricity that will work with this device.)
I don't know - maybe you can find a user manual or sec sheet at Nikon.com
I bought a cheap battery charger for these and they charge fine.
3 3/4 Long X 2 1/4 Wide X 3/4 High
Will it fit? Yes... But opening it up past 13 - 14 mm will create dark rings on the edges of the picture. I ended up giving mine away after getting a full frame body (6D)
I don't believe it will . . . but please double check me on that.
I have a Nikon D7000. Also not a full frame. I love this lens. It should be fine for you.
Will it fit? Yes... But opening it up past 13 - 14 mm will create dark rings on the edges of the picture. I ended up giving mine away after getting a full frame body (6D)
The Alpha accepts A-Mount lenses. if your 1650 is an A-Mount style it should work, but don't be surprised if special features become unavaailable. I bought the Alpha mainly to be able to use my old Maxim lenses which are A-mount.
Ambient = ambient noise = The noises around you, such as people talking, a radio, a tv that's on etc...
The Samsung P2370HD has a VESA 75mm mount configuration which is supported by almost all VESA wallmounts. Just verify that the model of the wallmount that you're interested in has 75mm mounting points and can support at least 13 lbs (weight of the P2370HD).
That I'm not sure about. There's a 4.1 in my identifier. But why not try it for the price. They are good about returns. I wasn't satisfied with original and sent it back for a replacement thats working much better.
Yes, you can search the text. Also, the tech support is really direct. It's really possible that they're reading off a script, but if there is a genuine problem with your pen, and you are persistent, they will repair or replace it.
Yes you can .
On the top. Left side as you are facing the face. It says something like "time" then on the buttons on the front are the hour/minute buttons. Hope that helps
I'm a trucker, and use the PC Miler Navigator. Tell your Dad this GPS is made for truckers altho not perfect. I've used it for 2 years now and it's only had me on a road once that was posted no trucks. Can be bought in Loves or Pilot truck stops or can be ordered online. I dont think he will be disappointed.
I haven't tried cutting it but a sharp utility knife could probably get the job done. The plastic is quite stiff and makes it difficult to insert and remove wires.
One piece
I don't see any issues... it is made of plastic (hence waterproof). The only concerns would be (i) the adhesive (you could reinforce it with a waterproof or more resistent glue) and (ii) the cables. Assuming your cables are waterproof I don't see any problem.
No it will not, the weight of the camera will cause the leg extension locks to break. Don't bother with this cheap tripod, it's not even good for one use.
The headphones give excellent sound quality--no argument! Lovely sound quality! However, they are heavy and the band would start irritating the top of my head if I wore them for more than an hour or so. Even when I tried to adjust them, they would still start hurting the top of my head. I ended up giving them away because i couldn't figure out how to use them for long periods of time. If you need them only for short periods they should be great. If for long periods, you might do better with something else.
unfortunately, i had a little water spill not long after buying this power supply and fried my laptop. i couldn't tell ya what model i had. BUT i think it should fit just about any of them.
I don't recommend this replacement cord at all! Mine only lasted 2 months and it stopped working because it started melting and smoking where the cord and small rectangular box meet. Just spend the extra money and get a universal cord at an office supply! If I hadn't been home when this happened, who knows if a fire would've started!
definitely
As others have said, it will only pair with the same type of transceiver.
They are pretty thick, I wouldn't put them through my computer. I printed my logo on a sticker and put them on the front. Good luck.
It doesn't make any difference what camera the battery is used in, as long as it is an en-el 12 battery, it would work in this charger.
I don't know, but I'm doing it the other way around --- from 110v to 220v
As much as I know its going to work's fine.
Not sure of the exact dimensions, it fit within the ceiling joist cavity. I would suggest that you reference the actual product website. http://www.dynamat.com/products_architectural_dynabox.html
It's very small - this is a very light weight tripod - it won't hold my full size camera, only my pocket camera.
~6 ft
Yeah absolutely! I wear glasses with mine all the time. Doesn't affect anything.
Its standard.
They pivot a little but no, they do not lay flat against your shoulders.
I own this receiver. It has been a great performer for me . However I am aware of message boards that talk about hdmi board failures for this unit.
It says in the specs it WILL connect via almost every router out there. Also, a couple of the reviewers mentioned that as well
I don't have Win 8 or 8.1, but it works very well with Win 7. Suggest that the Logitech site be contacted to see if there is a software download for Win 8 or 8.1 listed. If not, it probably is not supported.
It does, that's what I use it with.
Yes - we used it for an RCA connection - but it has an s-video connection as well. You also need a stereo mini male to dual male rca cable to connect the audio. That is not included.
Yes, my 99' malibu has that function and it works just fine
The DDR2-667 module you have is compatible and will work fine. CT1001597 is a Crucial internal p/n for the DDR2-800 module which Amazon has listed here: http://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Technology-CT25664AC800-200-pin-PC2-6400/dp/B001342KM8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1246994487&sr=8-1 The 800MHz module offers more headroom and will step down to the native 667MHz FSB for the N280 cpu. The Asus Super Hybrid Engine will effectively overclock the FSB past 667MHz when you set it to Super Performance mode.
on the "eee docking touch tool bar" (the thing you want to get rid of) select "EEE Tools". From "EEE Tools" select "Docking Setting" On "Docking Setting" popup go to the "Anchor" tab On the "Anchor" tab uncheck "Automatically Launches"
There is definitely a problem with the audio jack. Mine was working OK for about 2-3 weeks. I'm now having the same problem as you. When rotating the headphone jack (on the headphones) - the audio comes in and out.
Yes, it has an electric cord for your household use, and also runs on 6 "D" batteries as an alternative. Hope this answers your question.
hello from eric dont buy this item i went throo three radeos like this one and other reterns that had no head phone jacks or aulx jacks and why i reternd some of the items thay didnot have and mettal antenna thay wer all lined no good reseption so befor you buy any radeos from amazon read all the infomation be for you buy ok thats all thanks from eric johnson 7/20/2014
No
No belt clip nor a headset jack
If it does, I am unaware of that feature!
Yes, the base is for charging the battery inside the handset.
NO.
You can use the antenna without a seperate UHF antenna if the UHF stations are withing about 35 miles. The antenna comes with a device that can bring together the inputs of two antennas.. I'm using mine without a seperate UHF antenna joined the C5 .. Works great because I'm about 32 miles from the transmitting stations
Bernd, the 1650 case that we own has a small handle like shown in the first & third photos. Hope this helps?
Andrew ... same problem I had, along with many others. This product sucks. The USB port should work, but I don't think there really is much you can do about the other devices. Better to spend the money for a new one while you are in France than burn up your appliances.
Your machine has a faster processor than mine and mine works fine with XP so you should be good to go. I'd be filling up the RAM slots to the full 2GB if you have not done so already.
This device does not burn DVDs.
Yes slide it on and tighten the screw. The cap on mine is removable so i could slide it all the way down.The screw just pushes against the peg to secure it. Be careful though. I stripped mine relatively easy
Any flash Diffuser is mainly intended to be used for indoor shooting. However, sometimes you may use it for direct outdoor shooting. At the very end, it will depend on how far/close is/are the subject(s) to be shot. Don't forget to get a better answer from your own shooting experience!
Hi Sylvia Skype will work on your Mifi. Just make sure you have the right APN settings for the prepaid card you use in Europe. I would not recommend to use an USA simcard on a EU network. You will get a roaming surprise when you are back home.
hi, yes, thansk
I'm not sure we had direct tv
Yes.
You can view your head and the GPS location on the same screen but not sure what is mgrs. sorry.
It will amplify the signal but will also amplify the noise. It won't 'clean up' the signal per se. Some T.V.s won't program a station if the signal is too weak. It will help with that.
Yes?
I think it's PC. Only.
A one hour and ten minute tape transfer to this, or any DVD recorder, will take one hour and ten minutes plus Initializing and Finalizing. Audio tapes can be copied at high speed but not video. Even in the old days when factories duplicated motion pictures to consumer VHS tapes it was done in "real time."
I am not really sure. I ordered it because it was listed as the replacement cord for our Sansa Fuze Mp3 player but it looks like it would fit yours as well. The best I can tell you is that it is pretty inexpensive to order so if it doesn't work you can always send it back with out to much financial distress. Wish I could have been of more help. sorry
Not sure using it on 7.
It's 5V, at least for the one I got.
I am not sure of the answer
I do. It works without a hitch.
It says it is supposed to but from my use of the product I am doubtful it will function properly. I found it to be very cheaply made. There are much better alternatives for the same price.
Not sure what constitutes a large purse, but it should be able to fit, might need to bend the legs. This does hold its shape very well, it hold a DSLR and good size lens very well (in my case a Canon 60D w/ a 18-200 lens). This was the smallest flexible tripod that would do the job well.
No. A carrying case is not included.
The more expensive package is probably from another distributor and is a discontinued package from Jobi. You want the bubble level.
The entire part is about 21" from one end to the other, counting the box. The cord itself is about 18". Mine worked like a charm no issues at all!! I have 3 monitors plugged into a laptop docking station.
I am close to saying 'I don't know' but my judgement would be if the drive fits the unit it will work. Nothing will be harmed if you try.
Per the FAQ area of the website, it only appears to support AVIs with DivX compression - so be careful there! They do have a link to a free video converter if needed.
No. Only cosmetic
Input shown in the back of the subwoofer says 120 V ~ 60 Hz, not extended to 220 V. I have 220 V at home and will use a 110 V transformer allways for my speakers.
Yes, Its a very nice system at a very decent price.
See if your TV has audio outputs. You can then connect the speakers to the tv.
No it does not
Cables, of fixed length (~6ft. ea.), are included & hardwired to both speakers. This will limit setup options but if you're using them as PC speakers, it shouldn't be a problem. Cable length may be an issue for multimedia use.
4*8 inches * 9.1 inches * 6.5 inches
This should be easy enough for you to self check by hooking up the speakers to another device. Hook them up to you phone, ipod or any other device. If the clicking sound remains, you have a problem with the speakers. If there is no clicking sound, the problem is with the TV output.
Yes you will
Yes, down the middle. This is one of the reasons I bought it. I had previously had same kind of album however, no place to write. This solves the problem.
The only place that you can write a memo of your pic is in the middle of the page. There's not a lot of space to write.
No, I don't think so. This only helps you align to the Dish/Direct TV satellites. My husband spent a lot of time searching for the over-the-air broadcast channels, then marked them accordingly on our rotor antenna. Hope this helps
Look here. http://stevenengineering.com/tech_support/PDFs/45SECS.pdf Amazon lists it as Product Dimensions 3.6 x 6.9 x 14.1 inches
This drive seems to come into stock and sell out quickly. I waited months to order mine last week. TigerDirect dot com is where I purchased mine. They apprear to still be in stock, and there's a $15 rebate. I received mine in just a few days. Good luck!
Had to make an adapter for my sons camera to the slide. I believe it was 5/16" to 3/8".
Most projectors don't. Its simply more efficient/logical to run HDMI/Coax/Optical to your sound receiver from the source, then video signal from receiver to projector. This completes the setup in one shot.
Don't know what that is but if it has a coaxial connector you can connect it to the TV...........I have used the small antenna that comes with it, a outdoor antenna and now have it on cable.
This device can function as an access point/router. So if your friends house lacks wireless you can create a wireless network. Then if you have devices which can connect to said network you should be able to use his internet connection. Now if he already has an wireless access point/router you could also use this as a wireless client/wireless Ethernet bridge to connect to said network. I would consider the hootoo tripmate as a second option. http://www.amazon.com/Arrival-HooToo%C2%AE-TripMate-Wireless-Powered/dp/B00HZWOQZ6/
this power supply works well with your PC, however, I'm not sure you fix the problem of orange light, many forums suggest that is the problem, I recommend you try first with another power supply to see if the problem is the PSU
I used mine for both car and city skating today. Also use it for jogging and XC skiing.
The Dakota (and Oregon) models do NOT provide for recharging batteries while in the unit. A DC power supply may provide supplementary power while you're in your vehicle possibly extending internal battery power somewhat, but I get 6-12 hours pers use on one set of fully charged NiMH. Personally, I carry a spare pair of charged AA's AND a pair of alkalines just in case.
Yes you can punch in Coordinates to find your requested location.
When I purchased the price was for 2 spearkers
I had an HP bluetooth mouse that worked quite well. Did try a Targus for awhile but it seemed to disconnect when left idle for any amount of time, but would reconnect when you move it but if your playing a game that get frustrating. The HP mouse just didn't live through the 8 foot drop I put it through by accident. OOPS.
Yes, I used it with no problems, even when I was upgraded to Windows 8.1.
Probably, depending on how far your ears are from your head. They are adjustable to a degree and since they hook over the ear they stay for the most part. I wouldn't worry so much about them falling off but just not staying flush to your ear so you may need to crank the music louder than you normally would to make up for the air cushion in between your ear and the pad of the headphone.
yes I think it will all the antennas I have come across it works well with
I'm sorry to hear you received the wrong charger! According to their details this seller aligns with Amazon's return policy. You can read more abput our policy here:
I also got a T2i. A word of warning. My first SD Card failed after less than a week. Make sure you buy only good quality SD cards. And by good quality I mean brand not speed. A cheap fast card is not worth the savings when it dies and takes all your pics with it. I am sticking to SanDisk from now on. They appear to be the best.
It'll work great with Win 7 and will support an attached monitor. As for supporting 4 you'd need to confirm capabilities of all your video hardware. This does work great to add an extra monitor.
I haven't tested this, but I don't see why not.
Yes - they are physically the same size - just more storage. The main thing to make sure is just that you have the right type of card - as long as your camera takes the 'xD' size then you are good to go. Think of it like buying a usb stick / thumb drive - same physical size / designed to same specs but can come in different storage sizes.
It depends on how many megapixels per picture, but usually a few hundred minimum.
Sorry, I don't know what this means. I am satisfied with this product, however.
GlobalSat datasheet says power consumption is 44mA at 4.5~6.5V (DC) but Sparkfun site says power consumption is 70mA at 4.5-6.5V. In my application 4 D-cell batteries will power a GPS unit taking continuous 1-second positional data attached to an old Sparkfun GPS datalogger for 5 to 6 days. Hope this helps.
Windows 8 support has been added. http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/5869?section=downloads&crid=405&osid=14&bit=32
The cable is around 3 feet long.
No. The connector is not L-shaped.
The Flipper website says so in the code list at this URL. Check it out. http://support.flipperremote.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/200101954/CodeList_US.pdf
Sounds like it isn't working at all, and your device is recording from its own internal microphone. If you are trying to record to an iPhone or something similar, the microphone's 3.5mm connector is only making contact with the headphone out so you are only recording the phone's microphone. You will need an adapter. AT recommends a 3-ring 3.5mm TRRS adapter, but that didn't work for my iPhone 5 and iPad 4. Others recommend a mono adapter. It does work fine with my computer and Roland recorder.
I found it doesn't have a lot of distortion. Is it pro-level? Not even close, but for a budget and for most people that might listen to recordings done with it, it will be fine. I've recorded performances with it, and as a shotgun mic, it filters out external noise nicely.
It is NOT a self contained unit. But it is versatile in that you can connect to your computer or to your stereo system to play records.
No. It can be operated old school by using the up/down lever or 1 click to play from the beginning and then return to it's cradle when the side is over. Overall a pretty handy rig
Try charging it before you turn it on
Yes
It will definitely be too tough to push the remote buttons with ski gloves on. The face of the remote is slightly larger than a typical watch face with all the controls. Made for non-gloves hands for sure. Sorry to disappoint.
I have a i pod nano generation 4. As far as my i pod goes, it is compatible.
I 'm sorry I can't answer that question but I can tell you that it works well with my D60 with no problem. Just turn off the auto focus and it performs well. I always used a doubler with my conventional film cameras with great success. I'm sorry I couldn't give ou the answer you needed. Sincerely, AE Quilico I'm American living in France.
Hi Lamy, yes, it will autofocus, but keep in mind that isnt the same that without the converter, i mean, all the functions work, but at 200mm the autofocus becomes rather slow, going back and forth, until finally get in focus (sometimes y keep the shutter pressed for at least a second until fires). All the same, i really recommendit , but keep in mid that, for moving things autofocus is not good @ 200, i hope i made myself clear, regards from argentina!
none they are both 7 element converters
It works with the new one I just purchased, it's a 7th generation 160gb. I know it wouldn't work with my old one which was a 5th generation 80gb.
I bought this one for my 46" Samsung. It's compatible with the 55". I paid $69.00 total, including shipping (looks like the price has gone up a bit). It's very nice and sturdy. I'm very happy with it: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WXH1Z2/ref=oss_product Also, it was extremely easy to mount. All you really need is a drill, a drill bit, and a level. That's all... Took me about 30 minutes to mount it...
It works great with my Panasonic wireless landline phone. Came with a 2.5mm to 3.5mm adapter which was good because my panasonic phones use the 2.5mm plug. No mute with the inline switch though just volume.
STP
yes the connectors are on amazon type into amazon : B00DR4HN1U
I think so, but I'm not certain. Simple to find out by calling customer support at 1-800-800-1020 (assuming you're in the USA). If you are planning a trip to Australia, here are two pieces of advice: 1. Take plenty of money. Everything is extremely expensive. 2. If you're driving (I assume so, since you are in the market for Australia GPS maps), watch out for traffic cameras. They are everywhere. You'll get a ticket if you drive 5km/hr over the speed limit.
YES, It plays DVD / CD .
They are not compatible. I have an older DVD player that plays all.
If your device has a 30-pin connector (as opposed to a lightning connector) it should work. You can always connect the speakers to any music device via a 3.5 mm auxiliary line.
I have charged a device that requires 2.1A, and several that required 1A. They all charged fine. Are you charging with USB 2, USB 3, or using an AC adapter?
YES! it comes with the cord, nicely wraped! even the mount comes with the screws. very nice thin and USEFULL! RECOMENDED 5 stars!
We just picked up our 2nd monitor after 7-8 years of use. All considered, being used daily, constantly being poked, it lasted a long time.
I got a replacement USB cable for it on Amazon, so I'm sure you can find the AV cable for your television on Amazon. It also has an HDMI jack, looks like it might be a mini-HDMI because its smaller than a regular HDMI cable but it is labeled HDMI on the unit. The camera does not come with an HDMI cable at least when I bought it didnt. Hope that helps.
I ordered the Transcend 16 GB SDHC Class 6 Flash Memory Card TS16GSDHC6 from Amazon and have great videos with my new Zi8. Amazon has a good price on this size Memory and free shipping.
My charger stopped working recently as well. But I doubt its a warranty
250hours
Yes, for safety reason , they all require. to have Overdraw protection by UL standard. So better buy with UL approved product.
No. It has an internal smart card if you like to name it that way. Dish receivers do not use smart cards anymore like in the past. It has an on screen smart card number which you should tell dish network to activate.
Yes.
Yes it comes with two remotes. A ir number one remote and a uhf number 2 remote.
I have tree different sizes and all ordered at different times. I can't find any indication as to what is in them, however, I am very pleased with all of mind. They are very sturdy and would be difficult to bend. Without cutting into it I doubt if you would know. If it is cardboard then it is a very strong cardboard. Hope this helps.
I don't have much experience with the nexus but I can tell you that I can fit my 2 Terabyte external hard drive in the grid with no issue. The elastic bands will stretch to fit most anything.
It should, my mac is a little bit older but I still needed a port that would allow it to connected with a computer. We just needed a standard port to let it connect to our TV as if it was any other computer. You need to check to make sure that your flat screen has a computer connection option. If it does, you will still need another cord (VGA cable in my case) my mac is older and my tv is newer so your experience could be different.
They do not appear to be the same thing although they have the same plug. Here's is what Apple has to say: 16. Can I connect a Mini DisplayPort display to my Apple Thunderbolt Display for computers that support using more than one display? Mini DisplayPort displays will not function if connected to the Thunderbolt port of an Apple Thunderbolt Display. Displays connected via Mini DisplayPort video adapter or cable to the Thunderbolt port of an Apple Thunderbolt Display will not work. This is from http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5219#1
I have 2012 pro n it works
No issues with functioning with my iPhone. One thing, there is no volume control typically common to high end headsets or earbuds.
Its squarish at 8" by 8.5" and 2 inches thick, with rounded corners. It's rigid but flexible, should be good protection during travel. The earcups twist so the headphones can lie flat but they don't fold anymore than than. (Thats why they need the 8" by 8.5" case). Constant droning background sounds are very well supressed however random noises and voices not so much. Good for airline travel, just OK for the coffee shop.
H: 63 mm (2.48 inch), L: 90.5 mm (3.56 inch), H: 34.5 mm (1.36 inch) great mouse, btw
no they are default windows drivers you should be fine you can always check with your it guy though
This is an average sized mouse. It fills my hand and I am an average sized woman. Very comfortable to use actually. Love mine!
Probably no, but I haven't tried. I say that because is only has coax input ans it is a digital only tuner. I suspect that your VCR puts out an analog signal. Look for a hybrid card, or one with RCA inputs.
YES, include rechargeable nichel mh AA battery. It is able to replace.
The Quintet system that I purchased has two R&L rear channels, 2 R&L front channels and a front center channel. A sub woofer is extra and is not part of the package. If you want a sub there are better ones on the market than the Klipsch that is sold as an accessory to The Quintet. Depends what your room is like as to whether it's a good choice for you or not.
Yes! I have mine wall mounted also, think its just 3 screws need removed
Root Mean Square (RMS) measures the average power of the waveform in the subwoofer. It is a measure of average power and a much more reliable metrics than the pure peak power people usually refers too. In this case, 350W is the peak power - meaning the subwoofer is rated to withstand this power for a limited time. The average-like RMS (150W in this case) is usually considered a better criteria to evaluate the power of a subwoofer.
thats what made me nervous too. I've been trying to research... klipsch lists them as an authorized dealer on their site i tried calling but haven't had a call back from klipsch to verify authenticity and refund policy incase there is some tom foolery going on.
It works from my mid 2010 MacBook Pro laptop to my 2007 Samsung DLP TV.
I am not sure, I used it for a MacBook Pro. But it stopped working after about 2 weeks. No Video or Audio, I returned it.
it was two weeks over the Christmas and New Year holidays.
I am not sure but they do have provisions for a British office. I would call at 1-877-WARRANTY to ask further questions about that. :o)
Yes. I purchased my camcorder at Amazon and added Square Trade Accident Protection Plan. So, yes, it covers camcorders also.
Square Trade has a toll free customer service line. Call them and they could give you that information. The number is 1-877-WARRANTY or email www.squaretrade.com I would recommend Square Trade to anyone who is looking to purchase a warranty.
I really don't know if you can. I would advice you to stay off this company. They are fraudulent!!!!!!!!!! They don't even honor agreement with a new computer less than 3 months old not to talk of a refurbished one!
The coverage looks the same to me. But i'm not a lawyer. Ask squaretrade. It may be an Amazon discount.
Yes
yes, anytime before manufacturers warranty expires
For the camera I bought it dose however, it named the camera
I don't know. Email Square Trade to get the correct information.
Im not sure of what is covered. I purchased the coverage for a digital camera. Not sure about that either. I have yet to recieve paperwork on my coverage...
The camera which I covered was bought at Target in Texas. I am not sure about purchases in Canada. You can contact Square Trade directly via the Internet. I was extremely pleased with the way the claim was handled.
sorry - not sure
If you go on the square trade website they have this method of "registering" your chromebook with the warranty. That way it'll be there and ready whenever you need to use it. They have a nifty chat feature as well, if you have any questions while you do that. Else you can always call the company. Good luck!
Got this answer directly from SquareTrade's Twitter team: "We're so sorry but our plans on Amazon are only meant for Amazon devices."
You will have to register the device to the warranty. You will go to the squaretrade website, create a login, find your warranty plan and register your device to it.
I don't think it would work on refurbished electronics. My suggestion is to contact them, or look on their website to make 100% sure.
They gave me the total price of what I paid for it,,,$699.00 ,almost 3 years later.
"Square trade bought on amazon are for amazon items only." That is completely false. I called Square Trade today and the representative verified Amazon is simply a reseller of these warranties. They apply to ANY retailer you purchase your item from as long as it is within 30 days of purchase! Just make sure to purchase the proper warranty for your item. Type in "Square Trade Hard Drive or Square Trade Laptop, etc." and it will give you the warranty you should purchase! :)
As far as I know the warranty covers what product you brought under the warranty. If it was a APPLE IMAC then it's covered.
Go to www.squaretrade.com and all will be revealed to you.
I don't remember but it work perfect for my macbook
Internal.
no not compatible
Yes
I do not know as I have an Inspiron 1300 and not the model you have.
I wear glasses also. These ear-peaces swivel to fit you easily. I can wear these for hours at a time (and I do) when I am gaming with no discomfort or problems.
This is not compatible with the iPod touch 5, it will only work with the older iPod 4 and earlier versions. This device connects to the iPod by way of the older 30 pin connector. It does not have the smaller "Lightning" connector that the newer iPods such as the iPod 5 have.
If it has a lightning port it is not compatible but if it has the regular 30 pin it will charge

T-Power has some power supplies for OTHER Altec Lansing products, but I found nothing for the IMT800 or IMT810. See
Yes
It only attaches on flat wall but you can move the tv to the corner if you set the mount nearby the corner.
No it wont, you beed the ine that takes two PCT slots ans us connected by wire.
It has a line in and a mike input
I have not used them on any United flights, sorry.
That doesn't matter. The remote will control any subset of devices that you may have. As long as it supports your device which it probably does. It supports nearly everything. It won't have any issues with the device that you listed.
Yes.....but the clip on the igadgitz case is very substandard. Mine broke in just over 2 afternoons of use.
I'm not sure of the dimensions of my iPod exactly but I have the 6th Gen 160 GB. I would double check the dimensions. Mine is somewhat of a tight fit but its perfect so it won't fall out just randomly while in use.
Yes, as long as you don't have the clip on it. As for the bulk a you have a little, the snap might get in the way - but good for the price.
It does appear to be too small but it does fit. You need to kinda screw it on in a left/right motion. It will fit. I like the tips. However they do wear down quickly and will rip after a couple of months. I store them in my workout bag and it rips. I've gone through a few of them already. I guess you need to carefully store the ear buds. Hope this helps...
I think the medium tips would work. I use the large tips and they block out all outside sound. I only hear the music and in between songs I hear myself breathing.
sorry...use mine on bluejay buds
It can. May require special device or special transducer. See page 52 of owners manual.
and I could not put it to work completely sub- wofer mean't
The speakers connect to your computer using several color coded speaker jacks one for sub woofer, and two others one for the front and back speakers, and one for the center speakers. Hope this helps.
Honestly I have never tried but I do not see how you could. The Bluetooth usually connects to one device.
Ignacio, the new Lumix cameras are pretty amazing. I have the ZS3 which shares some features with the FZ35. Primarily, the Venus HD chip with the AVCHD video compression, is amazing and the key advantage in my opinion. Take a look at www.panasonic.NET/lumix for more details. The panasonic.COM website hardly tells you anything for some reason.
Yes. I have it for my AF 100. It looks great as long as you have enough light.
Yes, the lens works fine with a GF1
I only have import so I cannot do a side by side, but when I researched I believe it was only warranty and cost
Would you or someone please explain how to download podcasts. Thanks.
I realize you asked this question awhile ago, but I've been having this problem. Certain songs for some reason suddenly disappear. This has happened more than one time. Also I've had a couple of songs on a second disc from a two-disc set not show up under the Artist name, but it will show up under Albums. The disappearing songs is really making me crazy, because I'm constantly re-syncing the same songs to the walkman. Please let me know if you figured out what the problem is.
Yes, it does have a speaker but no connection to bluetooth. In all it's a very good device
This enclosure is only compatible with internal DVD drive from laptop.
The speaker is paired with a transmitter, which also acts as the cradle that the iPod rests in. The transmitter uses a standard minijack cable to connect to the earphone/headphone jack of the iPod. As such, this will work with any normal audio device that you can plug a pair of earphones/headphones into. I sometimes connect the transmitter to my computer speakers.
It doesn't appear so. We recently got the new iPod Touch 5th generation. We used the official adapter that Apple makes but it refused to recognize the iPod at all. Works fine with older ones though for us.
CD. Manual as a text file. Horrible. Better ones online. Google it.
China but for the price they can't be beat
Yes it does and please make sure that you clean the area very good before using it, otherwise it will come off in a couple of days/hours.
It should work on any of the Sirius "Dock and Play" models.
Susan, it works with my 3rd Gen iPod, it would work with any iPod with the wide connector at the bottom. Pretty much any iProduct except the new 5 phones!
this actually has 5 sets of speaker ins so you would just connect all 5 to a 5.1 receiver.
Its there but it doens't thump I bought a 12 inch self powered sub to fill out the low end.
These transformers only convert the Voltage. Frequency remains the same as the input frequency. Usually not a problem. See other answers regarding equipent people use with it.
The laptop stand measures 15" wide. A 17" laptop measures about 16 inches wide. So the stand may not be wide enough to support the feet on the bottom of a 17" laptop.
Yes
No. VGA is video only.
No
40 inches
Yes, the two vertical mounts are basically light stands with 1/4" or 3/8" studs. You may need to purchase an adapter for your particular light but they can be found cheap and plentiful right here on Amazon. If you already own two spare light stands you could build your own crossbar and save some money.
Get the larger clip rings that are a little more than an inch. I got the 1 inch ones and it will not go over the larger part if the extension. This was a great buy for the money. I use it to hang quilts to photograph
We used this on a banner messuring 4X8 and lifted it about 6 or 7 feet, and it was not fully extended. I would say it could go up as high as 8ft and as wide as 10.
Yes!
I don't think it would be a good idea but haven't tried it
Hard to measure because of the bumps of wheels, feet, and handles, but it easily fits in overhead bins of airplanes (even the small ones on Super 80 planes), and under every airplane seat I have tried. So far the bag has about 80,000 miles and is still going strong.
Sorry no pocket to receive the extended handle of a suitcase.
under the middle seat it does; might work sideways for the other seats, as the space is narrower, not much space left for feet though. works great in overhead bins.
The zoom ring works just fine in mine, does it turn at all? There is also a zoom feature on the remote
Just the one that connects in the back. You will either need to splice into your factory harness or buy a wire kit made for your car.
I am installing this Item in the cabin of my sport fishing boat. I hope that answered your question thanks John
I have an extra wiring from my old stereo includding the remote if you are welling to pay the cost to sent it to you it is all yours
no. And doesn't work on newer PCs with newer windows. Avoid at all cost.
I did put mine in a speed wash cycle and delicate dry cycle once I received it. It was fine.
It is padded but for me, I don't feel it's "well enough" padded. But if you care for every time you put your laptop, you'll be fine. I'm fine with it so far, got it in September. Still okay, no sign of damage on my laptop due to it.
Yes
It extends 28" inches from the wall
No, it doesn't have auto shut off. There's a button behind that you need on and off.
Yes
Magnetic fields do not affect LCDS the way they would a CRT display. I have copied an article to help explain. "LCD's, Plasma's and Magnets" Magnetic fields do not affect these types of sets since they do not use a beam or phosphors but static liquid crystals, which are solid-state unmoving cells. Therefore, you should not worry about placing speakers next to LCD and plasma TV's or about placing a television near any other kind of appliance with a magnet in it, since magnets do not harm them.
Not very well at all.
It has a zoom in and a zoom out key. They are located above the F11 and F12 keys. Hope this helps.
I have no idea. What kind of speakers work with it?
Speakers should be attached to their designated position on receiver & not attached to themselves....
They do stand firm
No there are no holes to mount them on the wall. They have a stand/base on the bottom and are made to be floor speakers. They have a slim design and look very nice...sound great too!
It is an AF-S lens, yes. :)
The reviews I've seen on Pyle don't look too good. Haven't purchased yet but am looking seriously at the QSC GX5 1400-Watt Power Amplifier.
I do not believe wire gauge has anything to do with it, i would check the settings on the AVR or the source
That will do fine, particularly if you bi-wire. However, you wont be able to drive the speakers up to (or near) full volume. I initially had a 100WPC amp driving mine, and the speaker would clip at high volumes. Only when I upped my power source could I open them up without blowing a fuse. But if you plan on moderate listening you will be fine. Any more and you might find the cops at your door anyways.
The TV ears need to be in the charger overnight, so I would assume that it uses low voltage. Although they were fully charged, they were only operable for a few hours.
I don't know about the analo. There should be no change. The ears are made for flat screen & newer HH sets these ears are awesome!
Mine came with both the battery and the charger. It does have WiFi installed already. Just need to type in password (if applicable).
Sorry but I do not use the depth sounding feature.
Yes
This flash has NO cord and must be attached to camera's hot shoe.
I'm not sure i had this MP3 for a very short time and the sold it sorry
I truly do not know how many songs it holds as it was picked for a gift as a donation for the Holidays. I am sorry I cannot give you anymore information.
My husband put it together. I asked him and he said no
First night out of the box saw Jupiter and four moons IMG_0085.JPG. It takes a couple of hours to set up initially. We saw the moon last night and were very glad we have the moon filter. We since have bought the soft carrying case.
This is a great telescope for the moon. Very close and detailed. The laser finder makes it real easy.
I carry mine around in the box, as it is plain white, sturdy, and protects the telescope pretty well. The telescope's box is useful and I'd advise keeping it around. When you pick it up with the box, it is comparable to carrying a sack of groceries against your chest. 1.5 ft tall. About half that in width. Maybe google this product in the box. Someone is bound to be carrying it in its original box. About 6lbs.
It comes with a built in FM radio but I never used it because I returned it, I couldn't make the thing work
Sorry but I lost my ZONE a couple years ago. Didn't own it long.
Yes but depending on the original remote configuration some functions might not work. I still need the original remote to use some functions in the menu.
This is not exactly like my original in size but all the functions are there. Very happy with this remote. Is the 3rd remote I am on for my Vizio. The second one was exact but no longer available. This one is just as good. So glad to be able to replace them when they wear out. David in Beaverton Oregon
Here are the steps to get to set the record mode ("Rec Mode"): 1. Press & hold for 3 seconds the "OK/Menu" key to get to the settings menu 2. Toggle down the the microphone symbol with the minus "-" key 3. Toggle right using the "&gt;&gt;|" key then down using the minus key to the "Rec Mode" & press OK Here you can select PCM, MP3, or WMA as your recording mode. Good luck.
The amazon site has a tab that showed the specific model numbers that it would work on. It's very comprehensive. My box was on it and it worked fine. If it isn't I wouldn't chance it. Good luck!
Sorry I don't know.... one thing to keep in mind is that you HAVE to update teh firmware when you get it. My one had lock-up several times a week until I upgraded. Now it works liek a champ.... good luck!
I do not know. I had the same issue when I bought the replacement remote. I decided to go ahead and purchase and would have returned it if it didn't work. I tried to match the remote with the TV model, but it isn't clear. Mine works very well with my TV and cable box.
Not trying to be flipped, but did you make sure the batteries are in correctly and making contact? It has happened to me before that I misread or just assumed how the batteries went in. I bought 2 of these remotes and had no problems with them at all... Could also be you got a DOA remote... Sorry...
It's not the camera body that makes a difference it is what mm the lens is. So match the "mm" number on the hood with the "mm" number on your lense(s) to find out if it will fit and yes, you can have filters on the lens with a hood on. :)
Mine screws over my filter as well as in reversed position for storage. I have both 52 mm and 67 mm versions.
The EZ Bridge is an all inclusive unit that is POE. So the network access comes right out of the network connection. So guess you could connect it directly to a repeater. Hope this helps?
Yes, it does. I am not sure the wattage.
Yes, all in this series have close up (macro) for capturing images close up. The latest in this series actually has a "fill light" which has a light to fill in shadows or for low or no light situations. All of the cameras are nice. this model has a smaller LCD but is well built and overall a nice investment now that these sell for far less than when first manufactured.
It is hard to say because the languages are written in the particular Countries alphabet. It looks like it though. Maybe someone else out there knows?
dont know?
dont know?
Dual voltage as in 110 or 220?
Yeah on the top of the tower, there is a slot of USB 3.0. The other two USB are USB 2.0 and also includes a SATA slot.
I also own a Canon t5 and this is what I use. Works well with this camera
That's the camera I use it on. I've had no issues with it.
Yes
I have tried this on the following olympus cameras, EPL3, EP3, EPL5, OMD, E520, E620, E30 and it worked on all of them as best as I can recall.
I'm really not sure, but be very careful. Some are actually different locations of the power source hook up. I actually bought 2 of the same, through amazon, and the power attachment was different on each one, and they were the same DV 5000. You can return if by chance they send the wrong one. But it's still a lot cheaper through Amazon. Good luck and sorry I want more help.
I don't see why not they work with any camera.
No
No it is not programed right.
It may, if the bluery has a usb port and has wifi capability.
contact seller and they will give you the right answer
Yes everything is included
Wifi uses allot of battery power therefore there aren't any cameras that do not require an outlet power source. The amount of work to change batteries and the lack of strength in power to create a strong reliable signal makes battery powered security cameras a bad idea.
It scans all the cameras. I never had any issues with mine.
Very easy!!! Mount the camera where you want it, taking into consideration the distance from a power outlet. The video is wireless, so the camera only has 1 wire, the power cord. Once powered you pair the camera to the base unit and your done.
It is a USB adapter so it should work if you have the camera USB cable
Yes, you can pause at any time. Until you intentionally create a new recording it will continue to record on the same file.
I'm not exactly sure what you are asking. It will certainly record the sound of one side of a phone call--both sides if on a speakerphone. A more direct telephone connection would require an accessory phone interface; the PCM-M10 is no different from other recorders in that.
Amazon is pretty good about displaying the product color in the graphic and as text in the description. Do careful searches of the Amazon product pages and you should see this Sony unit available in several colors, each displayed on its own order page.
Yes they do.
Using PlayOn from mediamall, you can srream netflix & hulu to the WD TV Live.
Left click, right click and center wheel. I guess you could say that it has three buttons. I like it because it fills up my palm.
Yes it will transfer data as well as charging
It will not unless you have a mini USB to micro adapter. It is a little slow but works great once you have the adapter.
Only if they are self powered. The mike itself has no amplification. Jim
Nope! All you need to do is plug it in to your microphone jack on your computer! :D
No, find a 14mm
it should fit
I used it at 130 feet and no leakage
It depends on what you are mounting it to. I mounted it to a dense plastic material, and used 3 inch wood screws.
Not any that I have gotten. They come as one piece, the base with the ball attached.
You will receive the item the picture shown. There is no backing plate. This is meant to use with RAM mounts and RAM mount includes a diamond shaped adapter which corresponds to this ball mount.
6.5 inch speakers will not fit in the rear deck of your car. They require 6 inch by 9 inch (6X9) speakers.
You'll have two 6X9 speakers in the back and two 5 1/2 speakers in the front
No this part number does not. The SDDVR35-HSL does have the SD card function. Thanks. Chris
The jack is straight.
Horizontal. We have had them for years, had to replace one as it broke. Sticks on to the glass and is very hard to come off. Sliding door doesn't go past where Burglabar is placed. Very effective!
I used a sharp pocket knife to cut through the adhesive and pry off the old one, then cleaned the area with mineral spirits.
Hello, No it does not because it does not need it. If someone is trying to sell you a anti virus program for macs, its a scam. All the anti virus programs will do is make your mac run slower. Thanks, Chris Betamacs
I don't have any issues with the internet.
Yes
No
I had a 17" laptop and it did fit but it was a tight fit. The only way to make it fit was to pull the top part of the pack forward over the top of the laptop and then zip it up, and even then you could see the zipper deform a bit. However, it did just fit.
It could swivel, but only up to +-90 degrees.
So. I got one. Arrived last night. Was able to raid with it for one night and it worked flawlessly. One of the most comfortable headsets I've ever owned. Then the USB dongle quit out on me. I pop the USB dongle in and it keeps popping up "USB Device Not Recognized". Windows isn't recognizing the transmitter anymore, so now I've got a really comfy pair of really expensive earmuffs. That light up.
Yes
This headset is working wirelessly through the USB device. So the answer to your question then is no.
Depends on where you're buying it, if it is a friend I think theres no problem. If it is from a seller here at Amazon the best thing you can do is check his reputation.
Yes- the one I ordered was the older generation but brand new in factory packaging
Yes
You can indeed add the Nano to your existing Itunes account. It will recognize it as a new Ipod and you just have to answer a few set up questions and you will be good to go.
I think the reason that Amazon is selling the 5th Generation iPod Nanos for $20 less than list is that there are newer (6th Generation) ones. (Note product titles which clearly indicate product generation.) On Apple's site, the only new iPod Nanos for sale are the 6th Generation ones. Any 5th Generation Nanos that you see there are refurbished ones.
It froze on you. You have to press both center and up arrow buttons together and hold for about 10-12 seconds. Once done, it will reset and work fine afterward. Hope this helps you, and that you still have the ipod.

Yes, but I thought I was just going deaf--I'm older probably, at 68, and enjoy listening to my iPodTouch for audiobooks, and it is frustrating to have the sound only periodically when you are listening to a good story. I am sorry to hear that the problem isn't me, but the product.
Yes, it does and works very well.
it wont fall off the clip is strong and u can disable the shake to shuffle feature so if ur running thats not a issue

First, make sure you have iTunes on your computer. Open it up and insert your CD of music. iTunes should pop up a little window asking you if you want to import the songs. Once you tell it to go ahead, it will take the songs from the CD, convert them into the format the iPod uses and save to your computer. Then, you can hook up your iPod and sync your music to it. Hope this helps.
Yes as long as you have itunes downloaded then you can sync to pc.

Yes
Yes and yes! You can use both the DVI and VGA monitor outputs to hook up two monitors. According to Dell's website, this can be used for the Latitude E5410.
If you can't find a code after doing a code search, use the Learning feature to program the remote to the box.
Yes
Yes you can connect a traditional line, a softphone (Skype), and a cell (bluetooth). There are also driver for digital phones such as Cisco or Avaya etc.
No
that's a pretty open question I suggest do research this keyboard is very rugged mine is the year old and works fine the keys are etched not stickers so you never lose your identification its bright enough to be seen but not so bright eyes to cause a problem playing in the dark I play online games a lot this keyboard is performed flawless other keyboards cost much more for the same performance
One has an aluminum back and the other is plastic from what i hacve gathered.
I am running Windows 7 Professional and haven't had any issues with using this device since I installed it I gave it its own IP address 50
I have it mounted on the top of the receiver hitch pointed at the trailer ball. That way I can use it to align the ball with the hitch. When the trailer isn't on the truck I can see behind the truck without any obstruction. It's velcrow'd to the ball and I used a couple of heavy duty tie wraps. 2 years+ and 40,000 miles later and it hasn't moved. Hope this helps.
Yes this camera can be set either way with a clip of a wire.
The end of the camera cable has a red power cord a black ground cord and a video rca. The power cords will need to be wired into a switch or ignition power source. As long as your stereo head has a video in rca cable it should work fine
There is a button on the monitor and remote that lets you switch cameras.
yes you should be able to
I don't know, I don't think it matters. It's not a cheap fan that would have problems starting up. Then again it might in a few thousands of hours of usage.
Press and hold down the Function key (Fn) then press the F8 key to toggle the sound on and off. To increase/decrease volume, press and hold the Fn key then press the up/down arrow keys repeatedly.

For output you should be fine, as this is also 20VA and 12VAC, that said, it won't fit in a recessed outlet, it is surface mount compatible and has screw to hold it the outlet for long term plug in use.
Yes, screw terminals are for 12 VAC output. The 120VAC input is through the plug on the back of the unit.
One is 8 inches and the other is 7. You could probably pull it away from the wall about a foot though. I wouldn't extend it all the way.
The limited range has been the most disappointing part. As long as you have direct line of site you can get ~20', but I have problems making it 4' when the coffee table sits in between the keyboard and the receiver.
no link speed.. It always gave me an issue linking up
Why would you want to attempt to change the MAC, as far as I know that is hardcoded in all machines and is unique. If you mean can you change it's IP address, then the answer is yes. Yes it can be used as a repeater. To be honest, given your question regarding changing MAC address, I think you may want to do more research on what you are trying to do. IIRC the Zyxel website has diagrams of various network configurations you can use.
sorry, i really dont know. i use mac osx 10.6.8. from what i've read on it you can get drivers/format it for windows, but i'm not sure which.
I'm using my USB connection to successfully power mine. I have not encountered any issues with this.
I have two G-Drives, one 3 TB and one 4 TB. I've had them for 3 years. If you own a Mac Computer, you can't go wrong. They are fast and I haven't had any trouble at all. BUY IT.
Yes, when you stop the car.
sorry no
No i was very unhappy with this item..would not purchase again
The width is only for the television; only the upright bar mounts to the wall, and pretty securely on one stud, so you'd likely want to center the assembly on a stud. Also, lots of options for fitting various television configurations. i'd be surprised if a TV didn't fit one of the options.
Yes, the metal rail that mounts to the wall has a channel on each side that you can run the cables and wires through. This rail ends at the bottom shelf and we use a quilt rack that hides the wires the rest of the way down to the outlets. This is well made and we use it for a 39" Samsung TV, cable box, dvd and video game console on the shelves.
I do not know, the one I got was damaged and it was returned. Instead I got a Sony that it can use a remote.
I am a Canon fan but Ive seen the Sony in action and it beats Canon. The downside is the battery and the memory, it does not work with AA and it only uses memory stick. Canon works with AA which you can get anywhere and beleive me, you will run out your battery when you least expect it and you can work an SD card with other electronics. If you are fine with these issues then Saony is your choice.
It has one DVI port and one VGA port.
try B and H Photo in NYC. http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=cr2-3v&N=0&InitialSearch=yes&sts=ta
Yes
Yes
I don't know for sure, but I do know that the sound I get is as good as a good stereo with surround sound, so I can play songs off my PC with good speakers and I get good results. I hope this helps.
The cord is 7 cm. Tip to tip is 11.5 cm.
You must make some adjustment to your ISO. if you use this lens indoor on D50 u must a tripod to avoid camera shake, and you can use lower speed. or you set your camera`s ISO to the higher. just experiment first. try not to stopped down the lens as this will give your photo vignetting...dark edges. its really trick to use but once you get the hang of it it`ll be a doddle to use...you've got to be patient otherwise switch to Nikkor Fishye lens or Tamron or Sigma.
The 1690 doesn't do stock quotes. You can check the weather, find fuel prices, movie times, exchange rates, local events, but no stock quotes. I don't really have a need for that feature, but I don't think it would be too hard for them to add it, if they wanted to.
The matching guide is wrong for most Tamron APS-C lenses - I have 2 D7100's and this lens works perfectly on both, has a reliable fast focus mechanism, and delivers above average picture quality. I strongly recommend it for all newer DX series cameras.
Included in purchase. Look at description, and you should see that headset and transmitter are included.
Yes- the one I ordered was the older generation but brand new in factory packaging
No.
I have the exact same problem, my 2nd Gen just broke and the new shuffle appear to be worthless. Some people recommend buying a reconditioned 2nd Gen from Apple but they appear to be out of stock. Not sure where to turn! Ipod Nano is popular but heavier than I'd prefer. Bring back the 2nd Gen Apple!
Sorry, Zikar, I don't know. I don't use my Shuffle any more because it is inferior to other iPods.
Depends on where you're buying it, if it is a friend I think theres no problem. If it is from a seller here at Amazon the best thing you can do is check his reputation.
Yep. This iPod nano has it.
I do and I don't think that will shorten battery life and you can turn it on and off instantly and it's looks great. Mine is silver nano with a black watchband and i really love it Just buy a iWatch on Amazon you wont regret
No it functions through the auxiliary port.
That question doesn't entirely make sense but both are DOCSIS 2.0 compatible so either should be able to work on the same service.
Sorry, Zikar, I don't know. I don't use my Shuffle any more because it is inferior to other iPods.
I no longer own this lens.
no it is not a phone but connects to net
I am not certain as I didn't use the shuffle for that purpose. I found the shuffle to be inferior...spotty performance, headphones not working properly. The shuffle is currently collecting dust while I use an older but more reliable iPod. I would not recommend you purchase this model shuffle. Best of luck to you.
no, the only speaker is the one built inside, just like a cell phone
The classic 160GB. Huge capacity, great screen, easy to use. Wish is was available in other colors, but that's my only complaint. It's also quite a bit cheaper than the largest touch model, which can't touch it for capacity.

Hi Kyle, No. The NWZ-A17 is not compatible with this dock. -Anthony
There are screws in the top, sides and the back at the top border. Just take them out and lift the case from the sides. It should come right off. I did it to remove a disc that was jammed.
Android OS: Pause and mute work but not volume up and down
Yes it does.
Yes it does.
The entry system requires 12-24 volt AC or DC to power the AK-11 unit. There are two output form "C" (N.O. & N.C.) relays. So, AK-11 entry system should work with all gate operators.
I don't think so.
I've never even heard of a Traeger pellet grill model 070, but if it has a conventional grate for supporting the food over the heat, then it's likely the GrillGrate will be suitable if it will fit on the Traeger grill.
I would suggest that you visit their website. They provide a thorough answer for that question with Ghermal Images to demonstrate. It's not a grill, they are heat moderating baffles and raised rails FOR any grill. Best of luck, I love them and have a set on my grills and smoker!
About 1 14 inch
Yes but, I never use it. Way too loud for me
The former: the USB charges it whenever plugged into a PC
No
I have not tried the audio part, BUT on the music part, if I pause it and turn it off, it will go right back to the same song and start from the pause.
Yes it should... do not worry if it is the wrong dvi i comes with more adapter than you will need
Have no idea unless you down load it through your computer on to a micro chip.
Did you change the audio settings to HDMI OUT? You will need to in order for the audio to go to HDMI.
Not that i am aware of. I have my DVR/Cable box on one shelf and its been holding it with no issue.
No. Only those made for the USA.
1500 watts peak if the SWR is less than 3:1 and 30 MHz or less. As in all such cables the cable must be de-rated at progressively higher frequencies due to increased cable losses
24 inches or so. The same length of original mike cord. Will stretch to maybe 4 feet at most.
It is built to prevent wear on the surface of the trackpad. Keep any sort of moisture away from your computer as a rule.
Content of detail that FF camera sensor is capable of resolving is very good. Basic 24mm f/2.8 lens is very wide on FF camera. All Sony FF cameras: A900 and A850, A99 and A7 and A7r are compatible with inexpensive Minolta Maxxum AF lenses - that were made for 35mm film cameras.
I think it is 100,000 cycles, but it can last longer. That number is quite conservative.
Mine did, it had everything, I just had to call dish
yes, the smart card is included. But be aware of this: Dish will make you pay $7 or $14 monthly depending if you are hooking 1 or 2 rooms eventhough you bought this with your own money. I returned their own box, bought this one here thinking i was going to save money only to find out from Dish that i still have to pay them. If you are ok with that, go ahead and buy it, card is included. I just wanted you to be aware of this.
Small- 24 lines. Medium- 18 lines. Large- 13 lines. Personally I use the small setting and find it quite similar to a paperback book size.
This monitor is a lemon. The parts to repair it cost more than a new one. Check out the Dell 25 or 27 inch monitors (you'll need the soundbar attachment).
don't know. it doesn't work with windows 7
Yes it does turn 360 it is made good to but the cranck in all plastic and breaks easy.
As long as it has a little hole on the bottom for the quick release plate to screw into it should work great. This tripod works great for my handheld that is the same size as yours as well as my Canon T3i. The plate mount should be universal. Hope that answers your question! Good luck.
You'll have to have an extrenal CD/or DVD drive to do the installation. You can buy one on Amazon for a very small price. After that, you will NOT need to have the external optical drive plugged in.
Does the same thing happen when you close the lid? I'm thinking that you might have your computer set up to turn off or sleep when the lid is closed. Otherwise, I would suspect that your battery connectors lose contact when jarred and shut the machine down. That is definately not normal, and should be fixed ASAP. The abrupt shutdowns can cause problems.

Sure.. The Netbook will run any software that would run on Windows 7 It has three USB ports to plug the tablet into.
Upgrading mine was extremely easy. It took all of 3 minutes.
No
You should have no problem plugging in an SSD or SSHD since they all have the same end connection, however, am not sure about the 4TB.
Yes you can, its like having two hard drives connected independently only via the same cable.
set it up in your house, hold the antenna and press the button. why? you don't know how to find the stations? if you are not into this electronics stuff it is very frustrating I know. you need a tv or converterbox that has memory in it. do a channel scan and hold the rotate button and let it go back and forth to find stations 2 or 3 times. then you can fine tune with the antenna strength meter. good luck.
Antenna, rotor motor, 20 feet of cable, rotor remote.
The face is about an inch. The hole that needs to be cut is slightly smaller, due to the lip.
I bought it today at Best Buy. Not available on their website, but they have it in store.
Dennis, There are two methods to hook up devices. The best would be the Optical input. From your TV or other device you use a TosLink Optical Cable. The second option would be the standard Red/White (L/R) audio cable that almost all stereo equipment has. So Yes, you can hook up a CD changer directly to the Bose CineMate GS Series II system as long as it has one of those two outputs.
Yes, it did with mine.
If you purchased 2 and installed them one on top of the other then yes, I suppose they could be stacked. The channel on the back runs the full length. It may look strange though as the spacing would be off.
The mounts meet a variety of screw patterns and the LG will use one of the approved patterns - I have no doubt it will fit. This was the easiest mount I've used yet but make sure you hit the studs in the wall you're mounting it too. I wouldn't feel comfortable using the drywall mounts with the weight of this mount and the TV combined.
no
Yes, however; it's not a good media player as it cannot play lot of video format well. I would rather get WD TV Live Streaming Media Player. It will play everything you throw at it really well.
Look for the geomate loader that will get it going again for ya
All that is included is a audio cable that plugs into your audio device. No mounting equipment is provided. I kept my iPod in my pocket, but if you got saddlebags you could put it in there. I do believe an iPod mount arm is sold online. That is another option.
No chest strap.
I got this bag for my husband, and he doesn't think it's waterproof.
They come out with a new model every year. Just get the one that's being sold now. The vsx 31 or 32
you have to go to stereo?
One disc at a time. It is not multi-disc. I you have a disc with a lot of songs, I believe you can program the disc to play a number of songs out of order.
I can't answer that, but I use mine on a monopod and it's great for that because of it's relatively small size
Not sure,I have Dish Network with mine.
Wireless genie mini is needed for every additional reception. I did not try it. You can ask your seller to inform you. I think it should be possible. Which does not mean that you or me we would be able to do it without help. Digital is becoming so complex, that you can not imply any general rule of use. I would advise you to be prudent.
It will run on any device that can handle a PC compatible eSata or USB 2.0 drive.
Only by recording them one at a time, transferring to music files, and renaming, in my experience. Maybe someone else is smarter or more persistent.
It does. I connect my computer to it frequently and stream radio stations or Pandora.
yes, it can be inserted in the hot shoe slot
I have a MBP 2,1 late 2006 so it should fit your A1151. I have the 15in but that is just screen size so everything should be same size.
Well, it does have the same voltage requirements of the power supply meant for the N5110, however it has a higher output capacity. I'll be honest and say that I'm not sure how it's circuitry might change the charge rate and possibly damage your battery. When it comes to the power supply, I've been hesitant to swap. But if you could contact Dell, maybe they could give you some reassurance. You might try: http://www.amazon.com/Power-Adapter-Charger-Inspiron-Supply/dp/B007S0X9YE
I can't say sorry
No, and you don't really need it because Windows Home Server can maintain copies of all files on disparate drives so you can easily recover from single drive failures.
Unfortunately I can't give you an exact measurement. I have a 27 inch monitor hanging off it flanked by two other monitors so I can't really get to it to measure. The dimensions given are just under 4 inches and the holes are about 1/8 inch in from the sides. I secured two of the wholes directly into studs and used heavy duty anchors for the other two. That seems to work just fine for me. Sorry I can't be more exact.
Yes; it hangs on the wall mount.
No. I bought an alpine mono m500 works great good quality not bad price
You do need an amp but they are great subs for the money
Closest usable focus distance is about 5.5 inches from the lens. What that means in practice is that an item one-half of an inch across will fill about half the frame (at least on my 50D).
Image Stabilization (IS) is a feature associated with lenses. When looking at the Canon lenses if it has IS, it has image stabilization. The 7D does work with IS enabled lenses.
This lens is manufactured in Taiwan.
Yes absolutely. See my sample videos and pics with this lens on my YouTube channel, under the name of 'Vikingdescendent'.
Dev; When using the Opteka remote, the on/off switch should be the shutter button. As with any battery, power does fall off over time. A good idea is to have a spare on hand, especially if you use the remote a lot. John
no. I don't have that camera
Hey Duffer: My first answer is," I don't know" The receptacle on the front of the player is a USB. You might check with apple to see if they make a connector with a USB end on it. Another thought, if you are talking to the Apple guys, would be to look into Apple Airport. But -- the connector would probably be the least expensive. JD
the one i received was packaged in normal retail packaging
I've used it on Macs, PCs, iPad, and iPhone, but never on an android device but I'd say there is a 95% chance it will b/c of the Bluetooth interface which should support all devices. It's a great keyboard and battery life is awesome
Mostly likely they are real. I watched reviews on YouTube and the packaging was the same thing. But I don't know if the seller is secretly selling used ones and listing them as new.
No
The 15.6" should fit it easily.
I've had a problem with usb devices too ( thumb drives and cables ) ... I've had to use needle nose pliers to crush the top and bottom of the plug back to "tight" ( make it just a little smaller so it feels tighter when it's installed). I've also cleaned the contacts with alcohol. It's always worked for me.
The 15.6" should fit it easily.
Yes
The light has button access to 3 backlight levels AND off. There are also buttons that you can select either the frequency or the clock but both aren't on together. I usually have light off as I use it at night. hope this helps - I like it. Ron
hi, the Filter Diameter: 67mm
I use the color checker for everything from macro ring lights. Studio lighting, etc and combinations of any two sources. There's no way of knowing accurate colors otherwise. I see huge differences - to me.
It's a case, which completely covers a laptop, with a zipper closure. It will handle a pretty good sized laptop
According to the description of this case on Amazon, it appears to be water resistant. To me this seems to be similar to a water resistant coat or jacket that will keep you dry in a light rain but not a torrential downpour. I have an A7 16" laptop case which is constructed in a similar manner but which has a rubberized bottom. My Targus case is awesome. I feel confident you will be happy with yours, that it will protect your laptop or documents, but use a little caution in a torrential down pour. Hope this is helpfull.
Yes, this is why it is called and instant camera and requires film. Once you press the button your photo prints out through the top. You just have to wait for it to develop, put it in a cool & shady area for first 5 minutes. Colors will also get richer over time.
If your desktop usb plug is within 2 feet of your keypad, then it will work. I used this for my tower desktop at work which is positioned under my desk and had difficulties with the range when I used the keypad on top of my desk. I would not recommend this unless the keypad is within 2 feet of the usb plug.
I would spend a couple more dollars and get one of better quality but, I believe it will work for your camera. It just won't last long.
No.
1/4" x 1" x 1&17/32"(just over 1 1/2")
yes 10.6 10.7 10.8
I have used this with linux CentOS, so it should work with Debians Ubuntu.
What you see is what you get - the batter and the charger. There is not a connection for power wheeled vehicles although I'm sure there's a separate adapter you could purchase.
I looked over the specs and they appear to be the same. I'd recommend going with the lower price is this is the same deal I got on these. I love these headphones and feel they are a best value in this category based on the performance vs value. The Bluetooth connectivity is amazing and I use it all the time. You can use a cable as well which 90% of this style units do not offer. The Boses still have better noise canceling but no Bluetooth model is available.
yes. I use a Galaxy SIII with mine
I'm sorry. I don't know.
I also have a 7d and it works just fine. The speed is great and it holds a fair amount of photos if you shoot in RAW.
Yes it works!
Depending on you internet connection and how well you keep the system running, the videos should stream like a normal full-sized desktop does.
three to four feet.
Yes it does, however lenses can be very expensive.
Any 35mm film, color or black and white. The difference between the films is the ISO number. Usually the 400 film is a better choice overall. Most camera shops are willing to help you with your purchase. The Kodak TMAX is my first choice. Enjoy it!
Hi JESUSH23, This unit is with 6 ohm loads both channels driven, from 150 Hz -10,000 Hz; rated 3 watts per channel minimum RMS power - Jerome
The speaker system only reflects what is on the iPod. If Pandora is on the iPod, which I don't think it is, it won't. If it is, it will.
I'm not sure about that feature, but am having problems setting my alarm to wake up to my ipod. i followed the exact instructions, and it still fails everytime. help please! thanks!
Hi there, With 6 ohm loads both channels driven, from 150 Hz -10,000 Hz; rated 3 watts per channel minimum RMS power. -Anthony
This console will receive data from the Davis Vantage Pro2 station. Just be sure the ID link numbers match for the console and station. I have 3 of these consoles and have never had a problem. One unit had water damage and when it dried out it worked good as new.
Why can't you give a price of what it would cost for a carrier for this device. Do you have a certain carrier with each MiFi or can you pick the carrier of you choice?
It will work anywhere you can purchase a pre-paid sim card that allows you to access cellular data
It comes with a 120mm LED fan intake on the side of the case. Also has a regular 120mm exhaust fan on the rear of the case. There is one empty 120mm fan spot in the front of the case and two empty 120/140mm fan spots on the top of the case which you can buy fans for.
Yes. Most SSDs come with compatible mounting brackets.
140mm or 120mm only, but you can mount 2 of them on top (depending on the size of your cpu cooler).
That is the only way I use it and it is doing fine. It is full of heavy camera equipment, weighing about 25 pounds.
I only know the Windows XP device manager shows the description of (Standard IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers) for one of my Primary IDE Channels driven by that Syba device. And it works well for me. I understand the ATAPI Standard also addresses SCSI drives but this device does not provide for a SCSI interface. I also have connected to my computer several SATA drives none of which interfere with the others.
I maybe partial since I own a Pentax DSLR but IMAO, I would get the Pentax. I think being able to use almost every lens ever made for a Pentax Camera is a big plus. And any lens mounted on a Pentax will benefit from the in body stabilization. For these 2 reasons, older Pentax lenses have become popular the last few years. A few other things I like, great noise control, the option to capture RAW images as DNG files, simultaneously capturing JPG and RAW files and built well...
Yes it does.
I know what you mean. This is the best mouse I've ever used, and I can't believe how expensive and scarce it is now. Have they stopped making this model? I don't like most of the other Logitech mice compared to this one, for one reason or another.
I think it is on the back, M325...or maybe it is the model #....but open up the battery area and there are several numbers underneath the battery. I cannot believe I paid so much for a mouse as they sell for $5 at I-Rocks.....I do nothing special with my mouse, so a cheap one works for me...I must have gotten this Logitech when I bought a laptop...discounted...it works no better than the $5 mouse.
From their website: This product is class compliant; it's immediately compatible with every current and future version of Mac OS X and iOS and with Windows (98SE and up) operating systems. Follow this link for iPod compatibility: http://www.ionaudio.com/downloads/iProfile_iPod_Chart.pdf
Sorry, I don't know. It was a gift to my dad. He hasn't even opened it yet. Wish I could be more help.
I do not have measurements of the mounting screw hole pattern on the heatsink. I assume you are referring to a screw hole pattern?
It doesn't, but it does stand nicely.
If you are talking about 340TM unit (Lifetime Maps and Traffic), it does not have the Live services capability. The traffic on the 340TM unit comes through an RDS/FM receiver which is built into the car power supply. According to my experience, the traffic information is quite useful, e.g., it avoided closed roads in Boston. I have seen slow traffic reported only on highways but never on local roads (however, I've only used the unit for 2 days).
Yes, it does. You can see Canon's website for confirmation (http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/sna/consumer/digital_cameras/powershot_g_series/powershot_s95#SuppliesAndAccessories). By the way, adorama.com had it for $25.49 (free shipping).
Yes, you can hook up a WIRED Roku through this router. But is has to be a wired Ethernet Roku. Not the wireless only Roku, because this is a Cable/DSL router, not a wireless router.
I googled to see if it was compatible and it stated that the HP pavilion charger was compatible with the 15t-200N. I would research it a little further. Hope this helps.
I purchased this keyboard previously for $52. I suspect that it is no longer being manufactured.
I can't tell either. I ordered the DV61354 in Espresso and it's a very shiny black. I'm curious if the black is a matte black. The pictures don't make it clear. :( Edit: I just went up to HP's site and according to the pages on the Pavilion DV4 and DV6, it's either espresso black or white.
FYI - I've got an HP with an AMD chip and that sucker runs hot (running Vista). Cooling fan runs all the time. Another HP I recently bought has the Intel chip and it runs significanlt cooler (Win 7). Can't tell if it the chip or OS but all I can report is what I'm experiencing. The guy at Best Buy had the same comment on AMD chips.
You don't need a converter if you still care;-).
Yes it has input for mics. Any good suggestion on the mic?
It is a little over 4ft long.
Scrolling feels pretty smooth to me. There is some friction but its scrolling is smoother than the Kensington expert that I got a few years ago where you can feel bumps as you scroll.
That tends to happen to me after a year of constant use--usually rebooting solves it temporarily. Some of the other Wacom tablets are wireless-compatible, maybe for this reason. I use the tablets for everything, to reduce wrist movement, so I don't mind replacing them; but if yours is new, replace it (belated advice).
yep. here's the link to the sourceforge drivers to get you started. http://sourceforge.net/projects/linuxwacom/files/xf86-input-wacom/input-wacom/
I have owned my wacom tablet for over 2 years and it is still working. I believe with great care and proper handling a wacom tablet could last for sometime.
NO the hole that you need to make is just barely big enough to get the magnet through!!! 3.5 inches any bigger than that you have nothing left for the screws to grab hold!!!! Literally the hole is the outside of the black ring 3.5 any bigger than that your screwed!!!!!
Each...
I believe it is one year. We have had it for several years and had no issues. We have had surges with park electrical posts. The unit will shut off to protect your rig. It will then automatically reset after a few minutes. The power will come back on. We purchased this because our rig was hit with a surge that took out our onboard surge protector and converter. Would never plug in our rig without it. Even tho we have an onboard surge protector.
I would think you could retrive files from the hard drive to your laptop so long as the hard drive itself is not corrupted. There is a difference between a corrupted Windows system and a corrupted drive. But this kind of apparatus is so inexpensive that would make it a good bet to try. That's what I did and it worked fine.
Funny you should ask that I had the same idea with a LG DVD RW with lightscribe that I removed from a my computer that the power supply went out of, so I tried it and sure enough it works great so I do not foresee any problem with yours.
I believe the tabs are simply handles to assist with plugging and unplugging the connections. They could also be used to hang the surge protector when storing it.
I don't knpw, I use it with my HDR-XR150 Handycam. Sorry.
I installed it two years ago, and has been in constant use since then, 24/7. It is in the atic, so no every-day supervision. No problems at all. Capable of starting up after shut downs in electricity. I recommend a UPS though.
They are about 4 1/2 to 5 inches square.
The card is UDMA-7 (160MB/s)
It was meant for media stuff (even has the Media Center button built in near the power button), but last time I tried, I think the super HD videos (like 1080p) do slightly lag, and other resolutions under that should play fine. Also consider the fact that the max memory supported by the motherboard is 2gb.
The weight restriction would be better answered by your ceiling or mounting surface. Mine is holding 3 12' aluminum conduit pipes with 10' x 20' vinyl backdrops. I don't have any problems at all with the plastic chains. If yours are breaking every time you use them, the you need to lighten the resistance clamp on the left side.This product is worth the money and will support whatever you through at it.
Yes, according to all the information that I found before I ordered it, the VFO624 is a 3rd generation. I've been very happy with mine.
I experimented with another Phillips antenna I had lying around MANT510 that I purchased from Walmart some time ago. It works well but the TV antenna connection will only accept the coax cable that you just slide in and the connection is very short. You need to find a coax that doesn't have plastic around the connection. I suspect any indoor antenna would work. Hope this helps
Yes
Definitely. I am using this Laptop for work, also to design webpages and play some current 3D shooters, which it does nicely when plugged in. Of note, you can get this laptop without the annoying smudgy gloss black encasement at BB for 200 less, in matte-darkbrown, without the annoying fingerprints all over your laptop.
I dunno about ASUS, but it seems you almost always see Norton preloaded on things... I guess I've seen McAffee sometimes too, but eh. I tend to uninstall it and install ESET NOD32 first thing when I get it, because I greatly prefer it to either of those.
15.6
that has to be it...more demand...higher price on the blue version...
Most laptop power adapter has AC auto-range support. Simply check label on power adapter, if INPUT says 100-240V, then it supports worldwide AC input. The INPUT range must be specified on power adapter by regulation, so you can/should ALWAYS find this info on label. The actual plug type is whole different story, you may need to purchase plug converter for specific countries(Most hotel will provide free adapter rental though)
It has dividers in it which velcro to the inside of the bag. I suggest taking your Lumix to bestbuy and (check it in, so they wont think its stolen) then try it; that is what i did. They had the bag there and I was able to fit it to the correct bag and then ordered it thru Amazon.
It should,it holds well a Leica M D9,plus125mm,25mm,50mm lenses.Nice case,you will enjoy,good quality.
Can't say. It has a mini USB end to go to the Canon camera. My camera is an Elph 115 IS
it is the correct plug for SX40HD which I have. I believe it is USB mini. RCA plugs go into TV
No LeBron no phones!
I know it was 549 a few hours ago...
Good question. I don't know. Supposedly Monster/Beats has a way you can verify the authenticity of the item. I got the Lady Gaga Heatbeats and I though they were terrible. The sound quality was not good and they fell out of my ears constantly. I also got some Beats Tour headphones and I'm not sure if they were legit or what but they were supposedly factory recertified and they sound aweful.

The packaging doesn't mention Windows 7 since it came out prior to its release, but in answer to your question yes it is fully compatible. Generally speaking, if an application works on Vista then it should also work under Windows 7. Robert
The D3000 that Cameta Camera is selling on this listing is a refurbished camera. These are the details: $189.00 & FREE Shipping Refurbished Mint. Direct From The Factory. 100% Up To MFR Specs. Full 1 YR Cameta Camera Warranty. A real deal from a real camera store.
Mine came with the DK-5 Eyepiece Cap, bf-1b body cap and the en-el battery,
No
Dino: I just weighed the UL20a on my digital scale. It came out as 3.4 pounds. Given that there is a possibility that the scale is not 100 percent precise, I'd say the manufacturer's quoted weight listing (3.3 pounds) is accurate. Diplomacy and collegiality among Amazon customers dictates that I not comment on your age or physical capabilities.:-) Mitch
i am ilike you , i need to now how much battry life
I'm not sure. However, The Windows Easy Transfer program gives you the option to transfer files to an external drive without the use of the Belkin Easy Transfer cable. However, it doesn't support the transfer of applications or programs. They would have to be reinstalled separately.
Actually you cannot use it as this will only transfer from Windows (Any Windows) to Windows 7 sadly.
Yes, it's 63 inches before inserting the mic which should add another 7 inches. Good luck!
Thank you for contacting Parts Express. If shipping is not offered, it is due to the fact that we cannot meet the delivery standards to your location, as set by Amazon. In other words, we cannot guarantee delivery within their expected time frame. Please accept our apologies. Customer Service Team
No and the mic stand is horrible in so many ways. I ended up returning it.
I purchased these for a pair of RadioShack TV wireless headphones. They are about 3" X 2". They do stretch a bit and fit just fine. Good Luck
It is not necessary, but is much easier because the ASD51W was designed for recievers with a monitor out.
Not sure saving $99 is worth finding out. The peace of mind this gives allows me to hike farther, hunt harder, and keep peace with my wife. Compared to what I spend on other equipment and $ getting to the trailhead, this is pretty cheap.
Yes it will - there are no dead spots along the Alaska Highway (I drive it often year-round), and it's not affected by storms.
Doubt it. Mine barely work.
Yes it will - there are no dead spots along the Alaska Highway (I drive it often year-round), and it's not affected by storms.
Yes
Before I answer this question my advice is do not buy this. It is junk. I had it less than a day and it swallowed a CD and refused to work. I had to dismantle it to retrieve the CD before returning it. Others comment on it saying that it did the same thing to them. I suggest you read the other reviews before considering this. So to your question: As I remember, there are clips in the back that the wires connect to.
Mine are installed in a 2005 which I believe has the same speaker holes. Check crutchfield.com!
It works on the T3. I have one and has no issues with it.
They most likely make one for this model, check before you buy.
Yes, you push down and move forward to lock. Pull back to release.
No , will play any music ,even from a drag and drop . Don't know the max , but I 've found the larger the drive , the more time it takes to go thru the files
no these speaker has no vol. control
Yes. I use it with my iPhone
Yes
NO! This is CF card, the T1i uses SDHC cards, like SanDisk 16GB Extreme - SDHC Class 10 High Performance memory card (SDSDX3-016G-P31, Retail Packaging) - NEW 30MB/s version
It is OK for quick voice captures, much more suited for line in recording or off the built-in radio. You do need to add your own SD card of choice in order to record anything. There are 3 bit rate settings, it also has full time auto level control in record mode on Mic or line. Sound quality is really very good all the way around.
They are mp3. Please consider carefully before purchasing this radio. Mine began having so much noise recording AM that the record function is useless for my intended purpose. I did a web search and I am not the only one with the issue.
Any normal daytime light bulb will work. Its hard to find replacements for these exact bulbs.
It originally came with none but I contacted them and they sent two barn doors to me free of charge.
No... This item just work in tv VCR or computer only because have a receiber signal box with RCA plug
I have this headset and just looked at the cord...the connector is the 6P4C type, the same connector between a corded phone unit and its handset.
Yes, the Passport 21V headset is a USB model.
When I check battery status it does not provide that information.
sorry cant help you on this. It fits perfect in my avalanche. I would buy it try it, and return it if it doesn't work. But definitely try.
No,didn`t fit,I bought a uc-e13 already.
I am not sure because it worked but for me for a different model of FINE Pix
to connect camera to computer to download picts
It's a pretty basic usb cord. I have a few other devices with the same cord, and they're interchangable. I'm not even sure which one came with this :).
I have 4 1tb drives attached to this controller. I don't know if it has a size limitation.
Yes, it is SATA I.
Yes
Not sure my was a python worked great though
2 pin
Yes. It's USB enabled.
nope i have had it running for 15 16 hours no real issues at all! it was and still is a great investment
Just researching systems myself. But at the most all you should need to hook this up is a audio RCA cable. It should come with a RCA cable though. It also should come with speaker wires. And that's really it should take to hook it up.
Yes it has a very small basic remote.
You can hook this up to any tv, I have mine going to a Toshiba, works great, good sound, great for small apartments, got it for a great price...very pleased.
I just ordered this laptop. I read those reviews about the trackpad too, but found recent reviews stating that there is an update for the trackpad at Dell, that solves the problem.
I have watched a video review of this netbook and this model (the 10v) has vga. The mini 10 (no v) has hdmi.
no, it does not play Blue Ray disks
10-100 watts per channel/rated 4-8 ohms
My guess would be no more than 5 to 10 watts. More than that would need a larger platform for heat transfer - and since this is a plastic construction device - more than 10 would be doubtful. Even still I am happy with the sound, levels in a standard office/household room.
Yes, I use mine with my Kenwood
No it will play thru your radio
No you would need a different radio like the stealth
Yes, I purchased this for my husband's EZ.
Yes
Yes
I'm on Windows as well and still wondering if I should buy this camera - does it have anything decent offered on Windows?
It works on my W55. I am sorry I don't know about a W800. I am also not on the page that sells them so don't know what it says. Sorry I can't help you!
The cord is 70 inches. The adapter itself is 2 1/2 inches in length.
No, there are not additional ports, pretty basic configuration.
it does
i don't use the steelseries microphone, its always retracted, but my friend whom i talk over skype/ventrilo with whilst listening to music also has this headset, and i have never heard his music.
it can roll or be carried by handle - too big for a shoulder strap in my opinion
I can only guess, but it could be fluctuating power from your electrical line. Try plugging the cyber power box to a different outlet on a different circuit.
It was installed off site by someone else at our company so I don't know.
Yes you can center your location or starting Lat and Long and a directional arrow will point out the way you need to go.
I'm not sure. I purchased the voyager hd pro.
The headphones are ok not that bad but not top of the line. I use them when punching in guitar overruns. But put on my best set for mix down to master tracks.
Yes it is!
No it does not go over the face of the Ipod.
I don't know. I would call hummingbird customer service. They would be able to help you.
I have a P-tronics Voyager Pro, and it has a peculiar fitting. The Voyager earbud has a pronged base that it is glued to. So the Umbo, for me, is not just a normal slip-on fit. I had to cut the earbud off a base, and trim some of the Umbo material at it's base, and with a little glue I got it to work. Which is good, because although I love the Voyager Pro, the stock earbuds are not very comfortable for me. The Umbo is a vast improvement.
I haven't installed any software for IDLE on my external 3.0TB but what I do instead is when I shut down my computer, I shut down manually my External Hard Drive. So far I haven't have any problem and the WD Drive doesn't make any noise when is spinning.I got to tell you is a good investment.I almost forgot to tell you it doesn't overheat evn when I leave my computer on for 3 or 4 days on a row
Yes - I bought this as a XMas gift to myself. I have Windows 7 and wanted to move all my pictures and songs to this new drive. Simply plug it in and windows will automatically recognize and you are good to start dragging your files over. So simple - no special software - hope this helps.
No
Tape deck may simply need cleaned, if it's ejecting the cassette. My ideck worked in my cassette player, just like a regular cassette. Make sure it is fully inserted, when using it
It works with many sockets and I think 1155 is one of them. Check the package picture it will show it :)
Yes, this worked in my 1st generation Macbook Air.
I have purchased 2 macs from Amazon with no problems, both were new non refurb units. Just make sure you buy it from Amazon and not an Amazon reseller
Apple computers come with a program called Boot Camp that will help you install compatible Windows software. There are also commercial software that will run Windows on the iMac. Just do a google search for Boot Camp on iMac then purchase my iMac :)
I would suggest something. Class d and atleast 2000w rms im running a hifonics 1700.1 and sounds pretty good but im thinking about upgrading my amp
Great product, It's so good I purchased 3 It works perfectly with Chromebook and any PC Plug and play, no installation of drivers required
Yes??
If you are talking about CPU heat sinks, then yes this can use those clips, but it doesn't come with any. I had to take the clips off my old fan.
Yes, you need to buy a printer cord with a USB on one end so that it will connect to your computer.
If you're connecting to a graphics card that has 2 outputs on it then yes. Then in the computers display settings you can set what is sent to each video source.
It was not what I expected and it doesn't reach 3000 ft range
Yes, I have used it in UAE, Dubai and Abu Dhabi
The battery works well with my Dv7 notebook. The battery life is roughly 1 1/2-2 hrs. I run the notebook on AC power and use the battery when taking the notebook into the garage for YouTube car maintenance or to the printer for scanning. I recommend this battery.
It is a computer issue - I have had back and forth issues - good playback after reinstall of Flip software and bad after Windows Media updates. Looks like a Computer performance/Codec issue - camera playback via HDMI is fine. HD is higher data bandwidth and could be putting a strain on even a mid range computer like my own.
What OS are you working with? Most systems wouldn't require a driver.
It comes with the following: * A nice box :) * A cloth carrying bag. * A wrist strap. * Manual, software (on the MinoHD itself), and other documents. I wouldn't call the included bag a "case" per se. It's just a little cloth bag, and works OK for protecting the MinoHD. However, I should point out that the Flip MinoHD is TINY. A huge case would be silly. This is designed to fit in a pocket.
Yes. I don't have the full list of key commands in front of me but there is a pretty robust set of hotkeys that can switch the K/M, video, audio or all at the same time. See my review for details.
It should work with any laptop not just dell
The unit operates on 100-240VAC, 50/60Hz
You will be able to reset the individial radio system through the computer interface from a remote location, simply log into the GUI on the radio using it's specific IP Address and select SYSTEM RESET from the menu page. You can do a Warm reset (retaining your personal setup parameters) or you can do a Factory reset (restoring Factory shipping settings minus the IP address).........
a little small!
Yes, that is the soft case.
It does not.
Doesn't work and Amazon would not take it back...bad taste in both companies!
I am not sure. But looking at amazon pic with the lens extended is seems the sony lens diameter will be too big. http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Cyber-shot-DSC-HX20V-Digital-3-0-inch/dp/B006K551WQ the lens diameter needs to be about less than 1.5 " I originally got this to fit with an older sony cybercam similiar to: http://karachi.olx.com.pk/sony-cybershot-3-2-mp-japan-optical-digital-camera-iid-108792348 I'll try to upload pics with a ruler and adapter.
I am not sure on the formats. It should say in the details section. It recognizes regular DVDs in the US but not sure of how global...
You probably need a new battery.
It should work fine. I use this product on my Olympus E-P2 and E-PM2 and also my Panasonic GH-1. It's great giving new life to old lenses.
What do you mean?
Owners manual says approximately 9 pounds each.
No. The screen is held in its place with adhesive strips that stick on the frame of the laptop screen.
Has multi cords included will hook up to anything
Yes it will. I've used my Garmin from Montana to South Carolina, including North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina in between. It worked perfectly. I recommend adding a SDHC card (4 gigabytes is enough, and it just simply plugs in) and downloading the free 2015 detailed maps from the Garmin web site. This gives extremely detailed maps of North America.
Sorry for the late reply, I just got my 1450. I use Garmin's Mapsource trip/route planning software. I've been using it for over 3 yrs to plan routes with various Garmin's and it works great! you can zoom way out or in very close, click on the road you want to be on, zoom out and click the next. You can insert waypoints etc. When we plan a trip I always plan it with Mapsource.
It does not have built in RF capability. You have to buy the IR extender separately for close cabinet system.
I disregarded the bad reviews and bought these anyway. It lasted 2 minutes before it stopped working. This was a complete waste of time and money!
No, it doesn't
It works with my Galaxy S3, but only for start/stop, not volume control. It's still good for when you need to pause in order to hear something (e.g., with noise canceling headphones).
Not sure. It did not work on my lg or htc evo
i dont know the exact awnser i no longer have this item. but i remember its about 6ft
The unit I purchased has a low-profile plug. So far I've had no problems with it. Hope this is helpful to you.
Hello Russell Holloway, If you are seeing this speed as your 'connection speed', then that is the transmission speed between the adapter and the router and should not affect download speeds. If you are referring to a download speed measurement (such as from Speedtest.net) then that speed is normally determined by your internet provider as well as the router itself. If you need any assistance, please call or email our free US Based Tech Support for assistance. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@mediabridgeproducts.com
Have you contacted the MediaLink support? Medialink Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@medialinkproducts.com Tue-Sat 9am to 6pm Eastern I am using the Medialink successfully, but do have DSL via the phone company and have a wireless router in my configuration. Ask the experts here - the Medialink folks. Best wishes!
Solved the problem. You have to turn off the "home group" in windows. Once that's off, you'll have a flawless connection that no longer drops.
I used it on a Windows 7 OS, but Medialink's literature says it works on XP so I would have a high confidence level that it will work on XP Professional. I also have a Medialink router that works flawlessly so I have had good experience with Medialink wireless products.
Yes, I think this will work well in that case.
40 watts. Here are the rest of the specs: Specifications: * Woofer: 6-1/2" polypropylene * Tweeter: 5/8" polycarbonate ferrofluid cooled * Power handling: 40 watts RMS/75 watts max * Impedance: 6 ohms * Frequency response: 70-20,000 Hz * Sensitivity: 87 dB 1W/1m *
I have no idea. But the device do require a driver ti work with all machines. best to ask manufacturer
No you have to buy an adapter
No, it is the case and all listed accessories only.
Yes of course, it's got 3 5.25" bays, or up to 10 if you take the front fans off.
No and I regret buying it. It's a power PC processor and can not even sync to my iPhone. Stuck at 10.4 BS
These are from 2005. No, they will NOT run Mavericks. I think "Panther" OSX 10.5 is the most recent they will run.
If by bass knob you mean an adjuster to increase and lower the base level, then yes there is one. I wouldn't recommend this amps because after a week of working it suddenly stopped. Power was right ohms was right. I was even using a Pyle speaker. Good luck.
It handles my 500 watt 12" subs. If your speakers are 1000 watts then I would go with something higher watts. Depends on how loud you want the subs.
I just checked. It spins around, moves up-down, forward and backward. I didn't see anyway of removing it form its mount. Didn't want to manipulate it to much.
Nicole, I'm not sure how the discount is applied-- but if you pay the total and shipping is any less, or we can safely put both in one box, I'll refund any overpayment. Regards, Roseanne
The stand itself is only 30 inch high, the base is less than an inch so you can put one of those monitors (29inch) vertical.. but not two
Probably just won't work on laptops, which have separate mic & headphone jacks. Smartphones on other have single port that is shared for both purposes.
Yes, if it has a standard 1/8" phone jack.
There is no mic, so it won't get in the way. I've noticed these earbuds don't have much treble, but have more mid and low ends when playing music. I like these earbuds because the cord is really light.
They are Y cords, wire length is not crazy long but not to short.
Not a question, but I'll try to offer my take on these things. I have had four Thermaltake Power supplies, in 500 to 650 watts. Only one failed, but no fans. It was the little tickle current that allowed it to start. I sent it back with all its paperwork and a description of the problem. They promptly sent me a new one, in its own box. Thermaltake Power isn't cheap, but their quality and service are unmatched. I've used nothing else for about five years. Good luck.
Cooling fans are sized based upon the socket type of the motherboard. You will need to lookup your particular Dimension model number to find out what the board type is. Or just open the case and look on the motherboard with a flash light. Once you get the model number of the motherboard, you can google it to find what socket type it is. Once you get the socket type, see if you have a match with the types compatible with this cooling fan.
Yes, because your computer has an LGA1156 socket.
Here you go! http://www.amazon.com/Replace-Samsung-SUC-C7H-Charger-Digital/dp/B004V2EKRW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425850760&sr=8-1&keywords=samsung+pl50
stretched it is about 3 feet
I'm not sure. My iPod is older. I've had it since 2007/2008. If your iPod is from around that time it will fit
Your DVR must support audio, if it does there will be seperate connectors an controls for the audio. I hope this helps.
Yes, it will work.
Try updating the drivers. UniBrain makes great drivers for all FireWire cards. Hope this helps! - http://www.unibrain.com/downloads/
When the Windows is running, a new device is automatically detected. It wil treat the device as a Texas Instruments OHCI compilant IEEE 1394 Host controller card and install its built-in-driver. The update software drivers are always available for download on the following website: http://www.drivers-download.com Searc for DL code DL-0300132 from Drivers Search
I don't know about your board, but I have an asus board, and it did NOT work.
No Bluetooth. Yes to buying bridge later.
This may not be definitive, but the Sonos just has a line level input. I think you may need to put a pre-amp between your record player outputs which are usually either moving cartridge (MC) or moving magnet (MM) outputs depending on your cartridge type, to boost the output levels to line level to be usable.
Yes, it has a line in option. You'd need the line-in cord. Not remembering now whether it's just the single plug earphone out to line-in plug or a typical analog L/R cord.
I dont have a Galaxy note. However, this should work just fine. I use mine with my Nexus 7, all of my external hard drives to connect to the Nexus 7
It will.
Sorry, I cannot answer that since I do not have a Kindle Paperwhite.
This one only comes in black so you may need to research another brand.
Yes, the height is adjustable on the stands...
Does not. Callers complain of bad audio.
i believe it refers to the voltage from your wall outlet (110v not 220v) that this product should use.
I believe it would.
We could only control it manually to change songs from the phone.
You can use any .jpg from your hard drive as a background. This software is very easy to use.
i only do stills sorry
I believe there is a feature comparison on their website. Mainly G vs N networking and I think the USB port is just on the XR. If you missed the gold box deal for under a hundred for the XR, that's a shame-it was the same price as the next model down. This is the best tech investment I have made this year-super easy setup and great picture quality, flawless operation. Worth it just for the Netflix alone.
I requested Windows7-Pro 32 bit. It would have shipped with any OS I wanted, just make it clear what OS you want to the supplier.
i seriously doubt it, unless you can work something out with the seller. ms should make the iso available for free (it's worthless without a coa), because a situation like this one led me to try linux for the first time and i don't plan on ever going back. i suggest linux mint or zorin. doesn't cost a dime.
Should work with any standard PC tower.
This is a Lite-On LightScribe 24X SATA DVD+/-RW DUAL LAYER IHAS424-98. I do not believe that there is a revision B for the IHAS424-98. To be absolutely certain, I recommend you contact the manufacturer and verify that this is correct.
Everything is saved you just change the batteries and keep going
My daughter uses it for her TV, video/cable box, DVD player and stereo. The only limitation is the number of options the wand holds, but she does use hers on more than 1 device.
Yes
I have these lamps from a few years ago and had a hard time finding replacement bulbs. I ended up just buying regular lightbulbs that fit, but stuck way too far out and did not work well. The specs listed say "30 Watt 5000K Daylight Balance Compact Fluorescent Photo Light Bulbs" which can be bought on Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/CowboyStudio-Daylight-Balanced-Fluorescent-Bulb/dp/B001MLBK0U/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1394214764&sr=8-2&keywords=30+Watt+5000K+Daylight+Balance+Compact+Fluorescent+Photo+Light+Bulbs But if it's saying 45W on what you have, then I guess the specs above are wrong! They do have 45W here: http://www.amazon.com/CowboyStudio-Fluorescent-Daylight-Temperature-Photography/dp/B004LONG0W/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1394215030&sr=8-2&keywords=45+Watt+5000K+Daylight+Balance+Compact+Fluorescent+Photo+Light+Bulbs
It's an Auxiliary Cord. I connect it to my phone so that I can listen to music in my car.
That has more to do with your monitor, or the drivers you are using most likely. Upgrade your video card drivers, and your monitor drivers if possible. If you still can't, your monitor does not support that resolution.
What headphones?
They work as headphones on my Lenovo T60 And my Dell latitude. I'm sure they work in any headphone plug I haven't had any problems with them at all.
I don't know but I don't think they will
Do not know mines came broken in the box
Yes it does
Hi Rick. I use three different Pinnacle studio editing software and it works perfectly. I haven't tried with Adobe yet, but I'm sure it will work.
It works with my Window 8 just fine.
I'm not familiar with your model, I have the digital hdr160 with the hard disk drive and the lan connector works great on mine. It has a record button and the ability to zoom in and out at varying speeds.
It did not work on mine. The camera would power off.
14.9 oz.
The 840-S is designed primarily for Television viewing and works with any radio, sound system or TV using the standard 3.5mm plug. "Streaming" may not conform to the basic analog signal. Get in touch with Sennheiser to verify compatibility.
I am ashamed to say I do not know the answer to this.
The sound quality is great in the ear phones. It blocks out others around you
No They Have A Cord On Them .
For downloads you would have to go to our website, EZbackgrounds.com since Amazon does not allow for digital downloads of this product at this time.
The iPod itself will fit in the case. The problem I had was the case would not snap, thus making the case unstable. I wouldn't buy it.
Yep! Sure does
I ordered three sets and each broke within a week each. The ear buds have a filter that also wears out within 20 hrs of use. I would buy them if they cost -35 cents
The sound quality is great in the ear phones. It blocks out others around you
It tilts by adjusting the screws but it doesn't move up or down.
There is no offset. The tv and the plate it is mounted on are centered with the wall plate when retracted. Because there are two arms and three swivel points you can maintain this center at all distances as you expand it away from the wall. It pulls out far enough out that a 52 inch TV can be rotated to 90 degrees. Hope this answers your question.
This pair does not. It has a volume control instead. The ones that do, say "with mic" somewhere in the title or description.
The most recent bag I purchased did in fact add an extra pocket specifically for a tablet in one of the thinner compartments. It's in the center of the bag so it provides some good protection. There is also a compartment designed to hold a laptop and allow for "easy" security screening that might not (depending on the TSA checkpoint) require removing the laptop; just zip open the compartment for screening.
I'm not really sure, but I would assume that if it has the standard ball head mounting stud it should be just fine...I really like this ball head...very sturdy and easy to use.
This will show you how difficult the process is if you have the right equipment: http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070901205923AA4PGse The quick answer is that unless you can network the DVR to your computer the answer is no. With an HD Tivo you have more options: http://www.zatznotfunny.com/tivotogo-faq/ I made DVDs by playing back the HD program and recording it with a Panasonic DVD-R machine. But there are no BD-R units available in this country that I know of. They are available elsewhere in the world.
It would work/fit but if you set the Bullet at maximum power that breaks FCC rules for maximum broadcasting strength. http://www.afar.net/tutorials/fcc-rules/
One and a half inches tall.the garment I have is 5&A half inches long and it works fine
Don't know what kind of question this is, but no I would not recommend using while driv'n...
This router doesn't support VPN. You can check TL-R600VPN or TL-ER6120.
Yes
Nope. Sent mine right back after I spent hours trying to get it to work, hours trying to contact Vizio, then they casually tell me I needed firmware, like I should know that. If I needed it, they should have sent it with the TV !!! I figured this would be only the first of many problems with an inferior product marketed by sloppy manufacturers. Idiots!
The one I purchased had a silver finish.
Hi Ronald. No this is a stock Canon photo. I sold my Mark IV several years ago via B&H
They can run on 6 C batteries (i believe) or AC cord (included for both). So yes, they are truely wireless.
The tv came with 4 to moint but I believe that I had to go to the hardware store to get 8 more to attach the two mounts together. Can't recall the size.
16.5V-3.65A
I did not get one. Sorry.
So with these chargers there are in fact two separate pieces that can both be plugged into the wall and the laptop. However there is also a longer cord that can be used in place of the connecting piece that goes into the wall. If you look in the upper left-hand of this picture you can see the piece that detaches from the charger.
we just did this today added 4 airport express to dead zones around the building now we have 4 airport express and a base station covering the building no conflicts or problems at all
Answer here..This will not work in Heavy Duty Trucks. You will need our GoTrack 3 wire unit.
I had good results with 1000 pcs White CD DVD Paper Sleeves Envelopes with Flap and Clear Window Sold by: Provision Store. Quality is fine and price was right!
No
Hi Mallory, I would love to help you but I didn't order this for myself. I ordered it for my job, but they are placed in the factory so I haven't even seen the merchandise. But they seemed very happy with the pole. I apologize for not being able to help more. Karen
The one I purchased has XP, but it's possible it was upgraded to Home Premium. These are questions you need answered by the seller.
Sorry, the new macbooks don't have infrared receivers, they can't be controlled via the apple infrared remotes.
The remote should work with your MacBook Pro and AppleTV as designed. No worries you can return if it does not work out for you.
I am sorry I don't know. My husbands is a new one and I don't know anyone with an earlier model.
Dear customer, if you still have not received the order, please contact the seller directly through email. Please check your order if it is from our company, if so, you're welcome to contact us through info@iafor.com.
dude idk
No it's 2.0
I don't quite understand your question. The product as I got it consisted of USB to SATA/IDE adaptor, cables, and power supply (the power supply is included because some disk drives need more power than a USB port can provide).
No, this is for old Olympus OM system manual lenses to connect to micro four thirds cameras like the Olympus Pen Series. You need a four thirds to micro four thirds adapter, the Olympus MMF series, or a cheaper equivalent if you can find one, try Pro optic, as I an't find one by fotodiox.
Yes it does; but whether or not you can support 1080p will depend on the TV. If your TV came with 1080p capability then you're all set.
Yes. This is the correct battery for your laptop.
I ordered 5300, but received 6400.
No
no it doesn't have that
I purchased 10 sets of these when Amazon had them on sale for a very low, low price. They all worked in all of my devices and turned out to be high quality. Therfore I am sure that they were 3.5mm jacks.
No, the E6500 does not. The E6400 has a webcam. The E6500 meets a government requirements for security that requires the removal of the web cam.
Yes
Yes. You can tap into the 12v power feeding your head unit.
Hi, is only 1 speaker not 2.
Yep. I have the same exact computer and it works just fine
I have a few of these, and they are great ! The cord that runs from the charger to your device is about 3 feet.
No you can't plug it in to anything but your computer. (I tried the same thing)
Possibly...I bought this for my T3i and it doesn't work at all and I was honestly too lazy to hassle with returning it plus it was super cheap so no biggie.
you will need to go to canon.com and find the online manual for your particular model. IF it supports a wireless remote shutter release, then i would venture to say yes. otherwise, i seriously doubt it. however, i would expect that your camera does have the ability for a cable shutter release, which also allows you to not touch the camera while you take the pic, which also prevents camera shake. personally, i prefer the cable release. it's more reliable.
The instructions for the TL-5102TP Two Call Paging system do not state any info for purchasing additional call pagers. Since each pager is used independently, do not see why you could NOT use a third pager. suggest you call the mfgr Smart Caregiver Corp 800-650-3637 or www.smartcaregivercorp.com to inquire about purchasing an additional pager. It's a good paging & alert system, works well within 150 ft range inside/outside. Have had unit for almost a year, and satisfied to recommend it to others.
I have the 5 and it didn't work. And it didn't help make my recordings louder either. Don't buy. Lol.
Spin-Clean is very secretive about ingredients in the cleaning solution. It does not have an alcoholic smell to it - if that means anything to you. Here is a link to the MSDS... http://www.spincleanrecordwasher.com/material-safety-data-sheet.html
No, this unit does not receive hd stations. This unit Sangean HDT-1 HD radio tuner is your only choice. For a rack style tuner.
What?!
yes you can i bought mine two years ago and i love it
Yes but i reccomend the audiisource apm-100 much bette quality
there is an output of RCA to go to another unit. But the output for speakers are with audio wire and/or banana clips.
I am not sure what you mean ? Most speakers are connected via RCA cables .../which it has . A sub-woofer usually has it's own supply of power coming from a 120 volt outlet ...unless of course you are connecting via BLUETOOTH . This source of power [ 120 V ] is normally located near where the sub-woofer will be placed [ not near the amp .] Unless of course you do it wireless ...BLUETOOTH .
The answer is yes, I just got it hooked up a few days ago and I'm still figuring out how I want to configure my system... with that said, the other night I'm watching a dvd. Them hum was coming through the system. I turned off the Bluetooth on my s4 and that seemed to help. It seems to me it's constantly searching for a signal. Now, I've not read the Bluetooth section of my docs yet, but I'm hoping there's a way to disable it while doing other things like tv, est.
I'm pretty sure if you look you can find just the speakers I couldn't say where you would just have to look
yes, the top bolt you take off and full function.. its very heavy but I use it a ton.. TV shows, Football games...
Carry case, neck strap and covers.
I don't know details about your application, but I doubt it, and even if it does, you have not solved the issue - heat dissipation. One side of this device gets cold, the other hot. You will still have to dissipate the heat with some heatsink and possibly fan. I would leave out this device and mount the LED to properly sized heatsink.
yes
No
Please let me know what connections did you use to get this improvement? I am experiencing the same problem. Did you use component out from DirectTV HD DVR and/or SD DVD player to the receiver? Did you use a separate digital out to the receiver for the sound?
It's cause you didn't read the specs of the 9040 before you bought it. it is essentially an Elite 21 in the regular Pioneer clothing. To do 3 zones (independently) you need to step up to the Elite 23 or higher.
NO
It comes with a cf adapter so this isn't your issue
just slap em in and use em!
The unit itself did not come with 2.5" adapters.
ST is PCI with a different clock circuit IIRC, STX is PCIe. FWIR ST sounds a litter better thanks to that
You would just use the line out (RCA outputs) instead of the 1/4" headphone output.
I feel certain it will work. I plugged it into a MAC that had a bad wireless adapter in it and it worked there. I also tried it in an older Toshiba laptop and it worked fine there as well.
Unfortunately I do not know. I have never tried it with a TV.
no it is single point access only
No, they don't, however, always lower the volume when not in use to protect the speakers. A surge of loud volume could blow them.
yes the remote battery is easy to install, its a watch type (circle) battery. just remove the back cover and replace as you would do with any other battery.

yes the remote battery is easy to install, its a watch type (circle) battery. just remove the back cover and replace as you would do with any other battery.
The unit does not have outlets for additional speakers; however, for about $10 (Radio Shack) you can get an expansion pad that allows you to connect additional speakers. You just connect the pad to the speaker connections and then you will have an A & B capacity.
no, it doesn't have AM tuner, but I dont care, as long as I don't listen to AM.. I love my Yamaha Micro Component, it does what I was looking for, to keep it in my kitchen and listen to my music on my iPhone- my son's Droid, or a CD.. :D
No. It is 17" wide and 5" high. Like in the picture.
yes the remote battery is easy to install, its a watch type (circle) battery. just remove the back cover and replace as you would do with any other battery.
They have a headphone OUTPUT for plugging in a headphone to listen and an input of the same size for a line in cable ( to add say a tape cassette player) and a USB port
It works perfectly on my EOS Rebel. I suspect it would work with any Canon digital that has a shoe.

yes it does
Not without a speaker switch (use to be available at radio shack). it helps keep the ohms in perspective, but no guarantees
This is the exact modem Comcast used to rent to me for $8 a month.
They are not the same. Cisco 2203 has a telephone jack to connects to voip (voice operated internet protocol), and it seems to have a battery that the model cisco 2100 do not have. I use my cisco 2100 whith magic jack and it works fine. Also, there is about $ 100.00 dollars difference, making cisco 2100 cheaper and it works great.
You are correct in your thinking. Only one battery per adapter.
i used acetone sparingly and got the goo off without damaging the adapter. BUT, handle acetone carefully and use it at your own risk as it will damage many paints and plastics. on my eneloop adapters it did not seem to do any damage.
My belief is that the total energy in the smaller batteries is not adequate for that purpose. You should use D alkaline batteries. However, I have never tried to use those spacers. Instead, for my D cells I have used another brand of rechargeable D batteries (Tenergy), but that was in LED flashlights with a lower power requirement.
Yes it will power the flashlight. I use my spacers with AA eneloops for all my devices w/o fail.
You put AA batteries in the spacers and use on devices that require C batteries.
I would think so. The Enelop AA batteries are the same size.
Yes, i use it with windows laptops.All you need is internet and email if you want the pics to be mailed to you.
Yes. But be cautioned you might need set up help. And there is no original company behind the product to get it from. Been trying to get tech support help via email and phone (assenting machine) for 6 months.
all at the same time/ thanks,
Towards the left but it is on a pretty long cord and you can attach the usb cord for the fan either to the right or to the left. I have a 17" laptop and I can use either side. I love this lap desk.
Yes
The best answer is that my WD unit liked it. If you have a newer model/version - then I can not answer but I know they would not want to mess with something that is working for now. Besides, it is cheep and if it doesn't work your only out a few bucks.
Did not have to. My speakers had key hole mounting and there was a screw provided that worked well to mount speakers.
Easily... I have a Canon 60D with a battery grip, 2-430 EXII flashes, a case with 3 Pocket wizard Flex TT5's, and accessories, 4 lens of various sizes, a 17" Notebook computer, batteries, manuals, and whole bunch of accessories, and a full sized tripod. It is a big backpack, has a handle on the top, many belts so when you put in on it's not going anywhere but with you. The problem is you get so much stuff in it it gets heavy.... Construction seems to be good, zippers work ok.
Can fit anything, because you can remove de division so you can put Whatever you Want Inside
Unfortunately not. On the outside there are 2 pockets on one side: one maybe for a cell phone, and another smaller one for small items (keys...). On the other side there is a fold for a tripod. But no pocket for a water bottle.
It should fit that no problem , my son stuffs his to the max & has used ( & abused )his backpack for the last 2 years & it's still in great shape!
No
No, it doesn't have a chest strap. But it does have a lot of room and is really comfortable
The specs and features indicate it is for a small home. I would assume that it means a one-bedroom one-level home, depending on whether you have cement or wood-frame, two-bedroom with more of an open plan could still possibly work fine. http://us.dlink.com/products/connect/wireless-n150-home-router/
Anything is removable with bolt cutters! As for a slightly more helpful answer, there's a screw on the bottom that looks like it probably allows the stand to be removed, but I haven't tried unscrewing it
No. The subwoofer will only accomodate two satelite speakers.
About 6 feet. It can make it through the rear grommets of a desk and reach a under-the-desk keyboard drawer.
There appear to be LEDs on the undersides of the keys.
yes it fits our 4.3" Garmin GPS and the cord so it should be fine for your tom tom
It sure will! I'm so glad I made this purchase. It is perfect size for any tablet & notebook with plenty of extra well-padded room. It has interior pockets as well as exterior pocket and has padded carry handle &/or long adjustable (padded) cross-body strap. You'll be very happy with this bag.
I don't think so. It fits a Kindle Paperwhite and an HP Slate 7 but just barely.
47 inches
I beleive it comes with a 2 year
No, per the Microsoft's Website for this exact product. It is great keyboard and works really well on any of the ones listed below, along with our xBox 360, as it is what I had bought it for. **Taken from their site: Requires a PC that meets the requirements for and has installed one of these operating systems: Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7.**
To be honest I haven't tried. It says it requires an operating system but the list of conpatable ones does not list any gaming console.
I believe it should it basically screws onto the front of the lens similar to how a lens cover would. I have a D5000 with a stock 18-55 mm lense and it does work. There is a little bit of vignetting around some of the images but not bad. It is a decent attachment to try out a wide angle effect but it is not itself a lens
it will work, since i attached it onto existing lense
yes
The best I can describe is a nylon I think.
yes, it covers the 13(.3) inch macbook, macbook pro, and macbook air.
I agree with the previous answer by Ebert, "As long as you have not run out of the 1 year warranty, you can buy and apply the applecare to extend your warranty."
Hi, I left you a post in the other thread you asked the question. Short answer- yes, you can buy Apple Care from Amazon if it is the correct version and within a year from the iMac's purchase.
Yes it is But I thought it was a 8 " sub and I still have it and got no use for it
Works with Windows 7 Standard USB Drivers. As far as for Windows 8, I do not know.
There is no socket for a tripod attachment. One of the many reasons not to buy.
you don't actually make the barcode, the code is printed on the box or container of store bought item (new in the box). There is number that is under the barcode which is the equivalent of the barcode or UPC (universal product code) and upc's can be bought and used for items on amazon that don't exist on amazon yet. The scanner will not scan the number under the barcode, only a barcode. Hope this helps.
this mounts to your lens not your camera it screws on the end of your lens as a filter would so if your lens is 58mm it would work with your camera
Yes, it fit perfect!!
Absolutely!!!
It does on my 13" 2009 MacBook. Very well.
I can use the power adapter in Asia's 240V. Also the headphone uses micro USB port. so even if if the power adapter is spoilt, you can easily find another replacement for it.
Yes, it works with any aptx source.
My daughter runs her with her android phone all the time.
Yes, you could probably fit 3 one inch binders at once.
I've taken it on an airplane many times as a personal item. No questions asked. Just don't take a purse. Put the purse IN the backpack. In other words, you can have a carry on AND this backpack, no problems :-)
Yes
Nintendo has also verified the operation of the following SD Cards: (Last updated: 10/24/2014) SanDisk Extreme: 4GB SDSDRX3-4096 8GB SDSDRX3-8192-A21 16GB SDSDRX3-016G-A21 32GB SDSDRX3-032G-A21 SanDisk Extreme PLUS: 8GB SDSDXS-008G-A46 16GB SDSDXS-016G-A46 32GB SDSDXS-032G-A46 SanDisk Extreme Pro: 16GB SDSDXP-016G-A46 32GB SDSDXP-032G-A46 Panasonic GOLD: 8GB: RP-SDUB08GAK 16GB: RP-SDUB16GAK 32GB: RP-SDUB32GAK Lexar Platinum II: 8GB LSD8GBBSBNA200 16GB LSD16GBSBNA200 32GB LSD32GBSBNA200 I tried it on mine and it did not work
You can always use a faster card for your camcorder. It is an overkill to use a class-10 card if the camcorder only requires a class-6. But it will definitely work.
I used it in my Olympus SZ-12 and it was fine.
Yes. You can switch the lens for a different one if you choose.
Mine came with a used neck strap probably heavily used back in the day but Im in high school and don't really care. The stitching on the neck strap was coming undone but aside from that the seller included the camera, 45mm lens, and a pack of batteries(which was very appreciated). But that's it only those items
When the diffuser is positioned as in the picture, you can see while you shoot only if you switch from View Finder to Live View.
It should work with any USB connection. I have used it on my synthesizer with its USB port and it worked fine. It just wasn't bright enough.
The angel is pretty decent. To best answer this question I am a DJ. Whe. Working I am in some really low light conditions and this this light is BY FAR the best light I have spent my money on to see what I am typing. I would purchase it again!
Yes. I bought this for the 255W and then lately upgraded to the 65LM for the lifetime maps... this set worked well with the 65LM so I did not have to purchase one for the 65LM. Hope this helps.
No
I feed the transmitter from speaker outlet of TV, so I can't answer for your own setup. I would think that these can be connected to any kind of speaker output.
Randall ... I've had to continually press the search button on the headset and it eventually locked into the TV station I was trying to listen to. It took several tries to get adequate reception!
I would not take chances, unless you want to be strongly disappointed on NY Eve.
No
You can use it on your led lights if it is 2.1mm DC Output Center Positive, 12V DC 500ma per channel.
does not come with them
No it doesn't and that's my problem with it because that is what I needed.
no it doesnt! I made the mistake and bought it no jack! Ended up buying a Emerson,cd, tape recorder The kid loves it. Head phone jack on Emerson YES Emerson Portable Radio CD Player with Cassette Recorder (PD6548SL)
I wouldn't use this in a home setting and here's why: this unit (and 99% of all automotive electronics) use 12 VDC. Our homes supply 110 VAC. To convert home power to something useable would require a separate transformer-and it would need to be much bigger and more robust than a simple wall wart. You could do it but it could be costly. Would it sound good? Possibly, but the sound of this sub is designed for the small space of a car-which helps low end response-not a room, even a small one.
No, it never dims on my unit. Sounds like a failing alternator. Alternators fail over time in a lot of cases, not suddenly.
Yes, I'm using them with my Onkyo 7.1 speaker system just fine. I'd highly recommend using the heavy duty extender poles that come with this set for maximum stability.
2 speakers
I am not sure, but I actually had to drill into the back of my speakers to attach them. Wasn't a problem just be careful.
Yes. I have a Dell Studio 17.3". Its perfect for me. I think that will be perfect for you!
how many books & how heavy? many buyers including myself wish we had bought another backpack. on mine the stitching came apart between the straps. try another one & let us know how it performs.
It should easily fit.
Yep. It has no problems with that. Mine has been working for a year now
According to the description, no.: "Genuine Dell 250W Power Supply PSU for SFF Small Form Factor Slim Inspiron 530s, 531s, Vostro 200s, 200 (slim only), 220s, Studio 540s Identical Dell Part Numbers XW605, YX301, XW604, XW784, XW783, YX299, YX303, 6423C, K423C, N038C, H856C, YX302, XW602 Compatible Model Numbers: TFX0250D5W, DPS-250AB-28 B, 04G185021200DE"
It did not work with my computer, a Dell XPS 8500. My Sony Digital Camcorder, model DCR-TRV103 NTSC was not recognized.
Hi Paul, The battery is not replaceable, it is a crank radio, never needs replacing just crank.
I don't know what it's for. I ordered a 3 prong extension cord and was sent an appliance cord. Which specific appliance I have no idea on.
No ma'am, you should be ready to go.
ABSOLUTELY! I use it EVERYDAY with my 7D and my 70-200mm L lens. It's an excellent strap that is VERY comfortable to use. I have many neck issues, and this strap stopped that problem. (On an extra note, the fastener (carabiner) does tend to make a mark on the bottom of the camera as the camera is swinging freely on your side. I believe that the BlackRapid RFH-1E0 Fastenr Tripod (FR-T1) (Black) along with your tripod plate attached the the bottom of your camera would stop this problem.)
I unplugged my hand held part and kept it on the phone. Pick up and hang up as usual, but your headset is used for talking/hearing. I don't think this headset has a connect/disconnect feature.
No this is a single record player no stacking. But it's a fantastic player that has been working great for us since April 2013.
Yes, this is an m-mount to micro 4/3 mount adapter and the Lumix G5 has a micro 4/3 mount.
No I haven't. They were rock solid. I game heavily and do other things which do tax my RAM . Answerd a question over at a bs site but still during the course of answering it I pushed the heck out of my CPU, I think it was overclocked, and ram http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120416211457AAh7THq . They never gave me any problems.
It holds my nikon sb800. Cold shoe only, standard.
Yes, the end has fitting with 5/8 holes, one parallel to boom, one perpendicular and a knob to secure the head. Seems like a solid unit for the price. I'm happy with them.
I dont think it sill fit. If your port is small ans skinny like the 50D then it will not fit.
I dont see why you would have to change any of the wires. All camera cords and power cords should be the same. Only the actual camera changes
They are an .mpv file and I think they are recorded in a Lynx FS. Also the recording directory is only 4GB and then the rest of the playback partition takes up the rest of the 2TB. I can't remember if I ever tried to play them on a pc.
European maps are about $89. The question is does this GPS have sufficient memory to add a European map? Some of the earlier models let you add an SD card. I don't think this one does.
Yes. As long as your mic has a 1/4" male end. A converter from 1/8" to 1/4" should be fine as long as it is a quality connection.
you need to check your mother board specs. That is what my son did - other than that, I'm clueless.
in real terms, it's about the size of the palm of your hand. It is extremely clear. I'm a court reporter and I use it in very large conference rooms, it is perfect.
There is no radio on this exact unit.
It work with my usb and my window 7 computer. I like it so much.
I'm not positive, but I believe it does. According to http://www.idmanagement.gov/approved-products-list it is on the FIPS 201 Approved Products List, with no restrictions.
we have 400 right now.
Yes, as long as it's compatible with your laptops memory freqency......that is 1066MHz memory chip to a 1066MHz motherboard, 1333 to 1333 and 1600MHz to 1600 and so on. You can check which frequency your laptop uses by looking it up on the web or just check the box from when new.
it does work with Skype and in HD; I agree, that it doesn't work "automatically" but you need to edit the XML file and add a Video Tag with Height and Width to get it to work; but it does work, and it is awesome.
Yes it does and if you have windows 8 pc, there is a app on store that let you use manual focus or auto focus.
no
The Micca player itself won't let you organize that way, it simply reads whatever input device you attach to it. In order to achieve what you want, you need to organize the input device (i.e. your external hard drive) to show the specific folders. I have my hard drive organized by genre (Action, Drama, etc.) and when I plug it into the Micca, I just choose "Folder" menu to see the folders arranged on my hard drive - don't view from the "Movie" menu or it will just list every video alphabetically.
I can't confirm it works in an HP Pavilion. However, it did work just fine in my Dell Poweredge. Best of luck, Mike
Yes it will. Most of the mounting issues are related to the Motherboard, not the processor.
I think it is really quite. I can barley hear it most of the time. Its actually much more quite than my laptop and xbox 360 fan.
I believe it comes with the mounting brackets for LGA sockets however I used mine on an amd fm2 socket,
No. Mine were very basic. No volume control, just earbuds.
They don't have volume control, plus i would recommend getting different earbuds instead, these earbuds aren't very good
Australian version maybe?
The one I purchased only worked for two weeks.
I do believe it would work. From doing some research. I've noticed the first two numbers are the size of the screen. But it is the same part number. Takes all of five minutes to replace.
yes.
I don't know enough about the different models to answer your question. I love what it did for my model.
it does have dovetails
Here's the way I see it, observe the product, ie: Mounting Plate. pictured . That plate mounts on the Camera, then onto to Tripod MX1000. The base of the Plate is 1 3/8" X 1 3/8" Square and that Matches the Slot that it fits to on the Tripod. The Bevel as you describe at 1 1/2" is not accurate. My measurements for this item is correct, re-check your measurements, especially the Tripod opening, if it's also as mine are, then this will be what you are looking for. Hope this helped ?
I'm not sure about Duracell? However, they are a 3A type battery. Most commonly used for smoke detectors and alarm sensors.
No. I planned to cat 5 it to my wifi router but the unit I had was a p o s. I returned it. Went with a used but newer dell. Works great.
yes, it does
No, you have to take it out of the otterbox case. We really love it
Not prepaid. Yes w/verizon.
The newer version of the M305 mouse can pair with the Unifying receiver, although it comes with a nano receiver. It has the Unifying logo on the underside of the mouse, but not on any of the packaging. Look for a 2011 copyright on the bottom of the package; the older 2009 version is not compatible with the Unifying receiver.
Turn it bottom up. Then look for a square depression in the plastic bottom. Look real close in good light and you will see an symbol that shows what direction to push and slide to open the compartment for the battery.
Hello Carlos, thank you for contact us, the warranty is 60 day for this equipment
80 GB Sata 3.5 hard drive
These drives can be very slow if you aren't aware of the restrictions of an Advanced Format drive and you fail to follow the directions on the WD web site: http://www.wdc.com/en/products/advancedformat/ In particular, most of the negative reviews here directly state a condition that is guaranteed to cause a performance problem (such as cloning an existing unaligned file system to it or using XP to initialize the drive without using the WD utility to ensure that it is aligned).
No, the PS3 uses 2.5 sized hard drives. Typical laptop size hard drive.
I bought this for my son. I think the battery would last with normal use and charge but my son is on it constantly. Sorry I couldn't give a good answer to this!
Purchased it around 8 months ago and this is my firmware 3.13.30 Build 130121 Rel.69318n
No promise on the revision from Amazon. Most are getting the W revision
Most newer dvd drives are made to work horizonally or vertically. I wasn't sure about this one but just for you I laid my computer on its side and it read a dvd just fine.
You should be able to upload but it might need converted to a wave. It will be saved on the SD as whatever extension you name it. Assign it to a track. Then use any available track to lay vocals. Mic and master, export and done.
Yes, you can just use one of the built-in mics and it will take up less space. You can also use one built-in mic and one external input.
Hello Martin,my wife is logged on and I saw your post.I have this recorder,Dp-008.8 tracks but you can only record 1or 2 at a time,then go back and record on another 1or 2 until all 8 are full. There's only 2 inputs anyway.this is true for the dp-oo4 4trk also.Mabey a different brand or I know most 16tr recorders allow 4 at once.Hope this helps,you probably have your answer already. Allen
I purchased several camera batteries and some of them don't have the voltage indicated. I just looked for whether or not it was specifically for the Nikon D3000 camera. If the 7.4 volt battery was not recommended for your camera, I wouldn't use it.
The following statement is from Fuji's data sheet for this film: Airport baggage inspection equipment use X-rays that may cause irreparable damage to film, including streaking in the final photos. It is thus recommended that you present film packs and loaded cameras to airport security personnel for visual inspection when passing through a baggage check.
No
Mine came with an extra needle. I imagine you can get another one on eBay. I haven't had to buy one yet.
No, that is not how a capacitor works. It won't drain your battery if it stays on. The lights will auto off after so long of the car being off.
Correct
I ended up giving this to my Aunt as a gift & she is still using it today, with out any problems.
Yes it will
Yes IMac desk top, this product also works for the mid year 2011 21.5 inch screen desktop.
yes. according to your laptop specs it should work fine
Yes it will
Yes is the same model of mine and it worked.
Memory *should* work in this model, although it has not been tested specifically by Dell. As with any laptop, manufacturers sometimes configure hardware to be very specific. Go ahead and try these sticks. You might have to go into the bios and manually configure speed, timing, etc. Worst case is that your laptop won't boot but it shouldn't harm anything.
Only an 1/8" input jack, no headphone jack.
My only experience is with the Icy Dock and a Samsung 840 Pro SSD. In that case my first attempt produced the same results you saw. Checking things over, I realized that I hadn't made a full connection although the SSD appeared to be in the dock. With a bit more care, I was able to make a connection and the computer found the drive.
No it will not. Most, if not all, SSD's will fit in a laptop bay out of the box. This product is to make a laptop hard drive fit in a desktop bay.
This is not required for your Yongnuo flash. Your flash will work directly mounted to the t4i hot shoe. The off shoe mount allows you to hold the flash to the side so you can get indirect lighting.
24" or 48" stretched. Works great on a Justrite bracket.
Hi - I actually have the bag that matches the above picture exactly. I ended up getting one as a gift, so I had two. I really like it because the camera fits inside and it has enough room for an additional lens.
I doubt this bag will fit two lens' and the camera. It is pretty tight with the camera and one lens. If you have 2 of them, I would suggest going up in size so you and fit everything comfortably.
It should work just fine, the battery grip should have a rescepticle so you can screw in the attachment screw. The cable is plenty long enough so there should be no problems at all.
For an I pad
I have no idea. I'm using it in a PC RAID array.
2.5" size is for laptops
2911
There is a cleaner and cloth you can purchase just for this board.
No. This isn't a transmitter.
I have been using it for a year. No problem with flights. The right size to go with u.
Yes the cord is about 6'
I've used mild soap and water. Gently scrub the area, then spray it off with the shower head or very low powered garden hose and let air dry.
it should..nikon mount..is nikon mount... it will be all manual though..focus, aperture..etc... hope that helps.
yes the direct web site has instructions.
The cable I purchased approximately three years ago is a 4-conductor cable.
If your inspiron has a s-video port you can use the video rca but the audio rca will not work. The s-video is just video only.
Fan noise was non-existent for me, that's with the 1201n running MacOS under OSx86
I found memory to be, well - just OK. My MacAir is 4 - 5 hours, the ASUS 1201n was more like 3 - 4 hours. That's just web browsing and a bit of word processing.
I don't shoot Canon but if it is a normal dslr (not mirrorless), it should. It has a focus motor and comes in a Canon mount. Excellent lens.
Hi, No, this lens only works on DX Nikon , for FX you will have to buy full frame lens.
Yes, this lens fits Canon EOS 350D.
The official specs say the Dell SC420 requires "ECC" RAM. ECC RAM has 9 chips on each side, it is designed to be highly resistant to corruption. See this article on ECC memory: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECC_memory The official Dell SC420 specs here: http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/products/pedge/en/sc420_specs.pdf This RAM is not compatible, unfortunately. I myself have never heard of ECC RAM before.
This product qualifies for Free Shipping for orders over $35!!!
I don't see why you can't use this for any device that has RCA outputs. It's just a ground loop eliminator. I used it to get rid of the hum on a home audio system and it is still working great.
Yes it does.
Usually amazon has the replacement parts too. I returned these cos they didn't work for me but I recall reading some reviews saying that amazon has the replacement bulbs.
I am not sure how a LCG projector works.i have connected 2 laptops and 2 desktops with a bunch of external hard drives it at works wonders.very happy with it
I do not think they are bright enough. We use them to photograph artwork and they must be placed VERY close to the object.
There is no optical output for sound.
I have no idea best to look up model of light to see if it is.
Yes it will, however, Sony, being the proprietary company that they are, may cause some unforeseen bugs or hiccups like: It will power on the camera and flash "no battery" but will still work for hours leaving you to guess when the battery is low. SONY=SONY I recommend you buy the brand name because it will definitely work...or try this battery...maybe it will work fine...maybe it won't! Just my 2cents
Yes it has a fan,,,runs great too! Nice graphics for a low end card~!
It should if you have ur pc has a pci-e slot.. look up ur computer model on google and it should show the specs and what type of slot ur pc has.. hope that helps!
I'm going for the 410 because of the battery life. I can't figure out why they would go to a smaller battery when the primary upgrade is the n455 processor so that it works with DDR3 ram. I want to be free of power cords for extended periods of time with a netbook so that's why I'm getting the 410!
Crucial's web site will tell you the correct memory for any system. www.crucial.com
Yes you can.
Yes, Bluetooth Headphones are planned for Q1 of 2014.
I have not seen the other bag in person, so I am afraid that I cannot answer that question. I am sorry!
Yes there is a zipper on top. I would think you could carry all that in there. I put a 17in laptop atablet a chromebook a phone some notebooks and a kindle. Plus cords and a mouse and head phones. There is plenty of room to expand. I hope this helped you.
The switch works when one of the three units is turned on and automatically switches to another unit when it is turned on. I understand that if any of the three devices, like the cable box, is always on, that should be in slot 1, and the others should be plugged in in the order of frequency that they are used. I would try each of the three inputs separately in slot 1 first, then try them in tandem. I have had no problem plugging in a Dish Network Receiver, a Blu-Ray player and a Google Chromecast.
Yes if you have a program for it on your computer. This is a very flimsy item. Mine broke after the 3rd use.
it did for mine... so I assume it would for yours.
Yes. I use it on a D800 with 70-200 f/2.8G ED VRII, and it works like a charm. Image quality is a bit lower than without, but the AF works quite well.
i used in 70-200 mm 2.8 and I think it's very good
Sorry. I no longer have that item. The power supply DID work for my Seagate drive, but I can't be sure about the exact part number (?)
Output: 12V - 3Amps
Can anyone tell me the differance between the T505 and the T505 2.0
It's a USB rechargeable unit.
Yes. It works with any phone that has Bluetooth on it (iPhone 5s included).
Yes. This chip will fit in any socket P accepting board. I put one in my Gateway FX gaming laptop and it really boosted a lot of things (not to mention an SSD as well)!
No. Thanks, Discount18
just the big piece but u wont have audio ull need to hook the red and white pieces to have audio
It really depends on how much wire you need.in addition to the wattage being produced by your amp.
Accroding to the specs, the answer is yes, it works in India. But I don't have personal knowledge that this is true.
Yes u do and a wire connecter
The 14 just has an updated graphics card amd minor tweaks to the case, but yeah it should work. Just ensure your old adapter is 150 watts before purchasing this one.
Contact Blendmount at c54qpynh020m1b5@marketplace.amazon.com
the short answer is yes. but you need to configure the router, and have the DMZ enabled pointing to the address of the server inside the cam . You also need a DNS service that points to the cam, so you can access it from anywhere on the net. The DNS service is abbout 20 bucks a year. It is not simply plug and play. They will give you a domain name, just like any other website
the short answer is..... if you buy the proper software that lets you save to dish. The supplied software wont do it............
Yes
Haven't yet. Mostly use for close up shots outside.
I remember having a detachable lens hood ( as shown in the picture on Amazon), a lens cap, and a soft pouch to store the lens (hood detached). There is a generic Pentax lens manual, I have several Pentax lenses, so I didn't even look at the manual. I assume you are talking about a new lens, obviously a used lens may be missing something.
Dear sir Hi! Thank you very much for email me! Of course,yes it can use your K-30. I can send this lens as gift and low value. So do not worry about custom tax. Thank you very much. Best regards Nobuhiro Oshima JAPAN SHOP RYU
It's not a t.v., it's a plexiglass protector for a 51-52 inch t.v.
It's pretty light. Wouldnt add more than 5 lbs to your total weight
Yes!
It controls your device's like ipod and start phones. On click to play and pause, two click to fast foward, three clicks to rewind.
Yes D. Pearce, they are compatible with the HTC 1
Yes!
Nope.
While the teleconverter WILL work with the D3100, it will only work with a small selection of Nikon lenses and unfortunately the AF-S 55-300mm is not one of them. Nikon has a "Compatible With" tab on the product page for the TC-17E II which will give you a definitive list: http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/AF-S-Teleconverter-TC-17E-II.html
Yes
This item was not what I received. The seller misrepresented and sent me a damaged non working device.
I have the same issue and it seems pretty common on the reviews. Any idea where the drivers are that would fix this? Which one does the trick?
To answer your question, no, there is not enough room to put a tv tuner in this. Howeverthere a number of usb tv tuners available...I haven't used one myself but I have seen them before and read about many people using them with this unit.
Indeed it does support WI-FI.
No.
The ZX3 has a removable battery and is not shockproof. ZX5 has an internal (non removable) battery and is shockproof. There are some other minor differences such as video recording formats but that is the main difference. Hope that helps.
Had the same thing happen to me and I was able to fix it. Turns out the internal memory had become corrupted. Here's what I did: 1. Took out my SD card (in this case my 16 GB class 10) 2. Hooked up the playsport to my laptop (windows xp) 3. Once the device is recognized a removable drive will appear 4. Format the removable drive (FAT) 5. Remove USB device within windows 6. Detach playsport from laptop and power off (if it doesn't shut off automatically) 7. Put in SD card and give it a try!
My drive has never worked nor have I received a replacement so I can't tell you.
Battery? Yes. Charger? Yes. SD card? No. 16MB card at full resolution holds 4000 pics. Great camera. Using it in Portugal today.
No
I hear you but never seen a larger pads possibility on any forum for this already fairly large/wide portable driver size. I also have the rival DT1350 from Beyer with smaller and softer pads for "big ears" but it too is "on ears" and not around although size is important for proper seals. I guess you have to live with the original design or buy a different sized headphone. I too wished for a bigger Cup here!
Jayson If you have some type of U.S.compatible ISP provider. I remember in my tours back in 1981 we had nothing but AFN. Hopefully now we are up to speed technologically. What do you have over there now?
yes
You can install them on any car
Sorry, I have no idea :-(
No, it does not have wheels. It comes with a shoulder strap and straps to carry it on your back. It is padded very well, and has turned my iMac into a portable computer.
they are most defintely powered. Amazing sound. to my knowledge I have yet to see computer based speakers require a reciever. plug them in the wall grab the minijack and plug into a puter or ipod sitback and enjoy the clarity these blow away any logitechs ive ever had and really put out the sound.
Installation of this device does not require password, if any it's your computer requiring administration password. If you log in as an administrator, you should not be asked for password.
If the Fuji X20 has a USB input port that can control the shutter, then yes, it will be compatible. Studiohut has a great reputation and you should confirm with them that you can return it with a full refund if it does not work. Check your camera's user manual to see if the USB port does indeed work the shutter. If so, you will be very impressed with the remote shutter.
I bought this radio for my sister, who had it installed by the Geek Squad at Best Buy. You might try calling a Best Buy or a Radio Shack to see if they carry (or look online on Amazon!)
Don't know, I had mine installed on a 2011 Camry
Get a professional. $$$ well spent...
This is only one DVD player for one headrest. The cords come out the bottom on the seat and yes they hang depending on where you plug them in for power (either dashboard or back seat plug). Some have the cords put under flooring from a car speaker company. Mine layed on floor to plug. I put the mud mats over them.
Dont know, sorry. Have you tried unplugging it and restarting. Sounds like wiring problem
Yes. If it is a newer auto lens you will lose control of aperture.
I found this adapter to be cheap. It broke on me. Sorry I can't give you better news.
Yes it should work for you. Just remember there are know auto functions, just manual functioning for the lens. I use a variety od lenses for my G3 and have had no problems. wish you the best.
It might, but those things are very touchy. If everything is not just right then you are stuck. You will get no help from mfg or Bulldog
No - you need apple's proprietary cable for that unfortunately.
No it is for old radio freq's . I bout the Uniden Patrol man. If you would likr to do hight P25 programming don't buy the Uniden BC355C it is junk .
I think it is a analogue...very good scanner
Yes
of course i have a 7D just shoot manual its a great lense.
not true. I have a dell mini 10 inch netbook 1 gb memory and it buffers and the quality is awful. it stops and starts, not a smooth picture so you should be careful about answering this question with such conviction. it depends on what netbook and how much power it has
Sorry but with this antena you can only get few local channels and no more! Not worth buying.
It's a light -- not a flash -- it does have built in dimmer
You have control of when it's on or off. There is a switch on it for on/off and there is also a switch to only light up the L or R side of the ring. It's in no way synced to your camera.
The adapter rings is over the lens and there is 6 class of adapter, depending the lens (49mm/52mm/55mm/58mm/62mm/67mm)
Yes
I have not measured it, but best eyeball guess is abou 2" diameter.
you will need a converter that i picked up for 15 dollars. I still use it for in the summer time I show movies from netflixs for my friends and such
You use one of the power connectors on your power supply. that should be noted in the installation sheet
yes, I've got an Hp probook 4310s and works as I expected
It comes with it's own power supply, so if your tv has headphone jack audio out, or you use RCA to Headphone jack adapter(http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Audio-Cable-Splitter-1-Mini/dp/B00004Z5CP/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1381299353&sr=8-2&keywords=rca+to+3.5mm) it will work. It is not vary loud, but for small room on small tv it will be good. Hope this helps! Kris
It's about 13-1/4" wide x 1-1/2" tall x 2" deep.
No it doesn't work right away, and I didn't bother trying more. Used Win 7 instead.
Yes, it can display pictures in random order. Still going strong at our house after almost 2 years.
I used a flash drive to display pictures. You can download pictures from your laptop to the flash drive. I haven't used the SD card to display pictures yet, not sure how you would download pictures to a SD card.
You can extent up to as max as you can. 8 or 10'. But its great deal and below link, I used 80% of my shoot with this product. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA1ehEfYRu4
I haven't tried the other, but this one works well however it is a little thin. I use the supports but mostly with other backdrops that are a little thicker. the green screen does work, but it has to be up against a solid background like a wall with no light to work best.
per HP spec sheet, 240W
If you mean, do they have a separate audio plug on the speakers into which you could plug headphones the answer is no. However, you should note that the USB connection is only for power, you still have to plug these speakers into a regular "speaker/headphone audio" plug in your computer (or whatever you are using them with). That means you could just plug your headphones into the original source audio plug, unless you thought these would work only through a USB connection, in which case these are not the speakers for you anyway.
Ours follows rivers when we are on highways, but have no experience with this on a river. Sorry.
No it cannot be used with an iphone.
It works with any camera with a standard tripod mounting ability. Weight of the camera is an issue - this is not designed for heavier, DSLR cameras.
I wouldn't say that they feel heavy over time, however the pressure on your ears becomes tiring on long trips. If you think that would bother you, then I think your best bet would be to get a set that completely cover your ears unlike these which sit directly on them. Other than that, these are great. I use them all the time when I travel.
No I don't think so. As long as the sdhc card is the correct size and fits the device I'm sure that you can use whichever size you'd like.
wondering the same thing....any updates?
I've used it on both the Mac (Leopard/Snow Leopard) and Windows(Vista/7) sides without issues so far. If you're curious to see how well the camera performs you can check out a camera test here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrUWfX3s6FY
I bought two extra generic batteries. Occasionally the camera prompts me stating that the battery will not work because it is not a downy product. If I give the blogging a light smack, insert a different battery, or even take the battery out and reinvest it the prompt doesn't appear and I can use the camcorder.
No I don't think so. As long as the sdhc card is the correct size and fits the device I'm sure that you can use whichever size you'd like.
I was interested in this too, so I went to the Olympus website, and this is what it said: * SP-800UZ Camera * USB Cable
Press the Focus button repeatedly to scroll through Normal, Infinity, Macro, and Super Macro modes. The current flash mode appears on the LCD or EVF. Normal AF: No icon; Normal picture taking. Infinity AF: Mountain Icon; Distant scenery or for taking pictures through a window. Macro AF : Flower Icon; Subjects that are 3.9-39.4 in. (10-100 cm) from the lens. Super Macro AF: Flower+ icon; Subjects that are 0.4-11.8 in. (1-30 cm) from the lens. Manual Focus : MF icon; The focus icon shows the direction and distance of the focus (to infinity).
Comes wit 4 pre charge rechargable batteries with charger, but instructions want you to charge the batteries first. Thats one reason that I bought this camera, you could use AA batteries.
Yes, it does.
You don't need a docking station. Follow page 36 of the instruction manual "Preparing a computer". You need to install the PMB software. Once the PMB program is downloaded, just plug-in your camcorder to your computer using the USB cable and follow directions.
yes, the screen for this one is a touch screen
Not sure if it is. It records files as MPG for videos and Jpeg for pictures. Hopefully this information helps you. I do know this camera works on Windows 7. Good Luck Brendan.
Yes, mine came with all the plugs.
It works fine, but it is not as good as other cameras that have lighting capabilities or night vision capabilities.
Pretty decent. Zoom looks grainy at times but sound wise id say this is a great little cam!

Hi, for this Sony camcorder, it doesn't have night shot feature, however you may use "Twilight" settings under scene selection in which it maintains the darkening atmosphere of the distant surroundings in twilight scene. Hope this helps. -Ely
Its just excellent camera in generally, I tried it on rollercoaster, it was awsome. I decided not to use on the highest quality its needless high and keep 2-3Gb for 3-4 minut video.

Hi, this Sony Camcorder doesn't have any microphone jack (IN) for external mic. -Ely
SD ProDuo slot on the bottom if the camera. Hard to get to when it's on a tripod.
I was told by a City Officer in my area to buy a digital scanner instead I bought the Pro-164.Its picking up fine for me!
Only for clearer music. Some phones create static when connected to car via aux cable.
This is for an ipod/iphone with 30 pin connector.
I dont really know what port the S3 have, but i dont think so.
If you can use earphones on the iPhone while the lifeproof case is on then it should work because this cable is as thin as it can be.
This unit does not work on most cable network in the states. However if you get the one compatible with American Tv signal it will work Mean if you have internet streaming box, it will work with it. Good Luck.
It fit my HP Pavillian Dv7 laptop just fine.
Sandra - This battery worked for my HP Pavillion dv7 - 1245dx Notebook however, I no longer have this computer and didn't keep info. Sorry! When viewing for a new battery, with your computer type info, battery compatibility listing should be indicated. Otherwise, request battery #480-385-001 for compatible computers. Hope this works....Good Luck!
I used it for a 2004 toyota corolla
Very easy to setup and it does remember where you stopped the DVD. The remote control has been excellent. I am very satisfied with the DVD player and have not had any problems. I have British DVD's and it plays them flawlessly.
Yes
HOYA or B&W. It's good to have some ND filters (reduce the amount of light to prevent blown out highlights and to be able to shoot at widest aperture while shooting during bright daytime) or circular polarizer (cut down the reflection/ and some light). UV filter is good only to protect the lens, in my opinion.
I had this same problem, i had to end up taking the battery out of it to reset it each time... ended up returing it to amazon
Yeah I'm pretty sure it comes pre-installed. But yeah you should be able to download it if it's not already installed.
I'd like to know myself. Looks like Asus wants to try out it's big brother, the 1000PE first.
On startup press f2 key to go into bios. There you should see the full 2 gig of ram is recognized. Then press the F10 key to accept and the full 2 gig of ram should be recognized. But beware - you may have trouble shutting down or restarting when on battery power. See other discussions.
My ASUS EeePC Netbook power adapter lists an input voltage from 100 - 240V. I also found a dedicated auto adapter for it on ebay, I think it was around $30.
Please restate the question, I do not understand what you are asking.
Yes works great for me
Yes.
have spent all afternoon trying to find out on my DSC-T99 and no luck so far !! Did you ever find out ????
I believe so. I use Linux, I had to select this device as output. Go to your sound configurations and do the same, it should work.
I bought it for the same purpose and it didn't work... I ended up using for my laptop's softphone. (connect my iPhone handsfree cable to the laptop)
The battery should not be glued to the case normally. There are two latch releases that hold the battery on. My experience with ours is that those latches are delicate. One broke, and we had to tape the battery on. If there is glue involved, it could be that someone (previous owner?) had a similar problem.
anecdotal evidence implies that OS X is not very touch friendly (gathered from those who hackintoshed their t-91mt)
Just checked - no double / extra thickness. BUT I have just came back from the outside - Boston - rainy day - all set. The materials are really from good quality b
Yes, comes with buckles and solder straps.
No. There are other pieces of equipment available with that.
yes
Yes.
I don't see why not. It is basically a Thunderbolt cable and Thunderbolt can support some pretty high bandwidth. However, you should probably check with Apple to be sure. If the "Apple version" of this cable supports 4K, the Belkin probably will too.
I didn't check the "I don't know" choice but although I do not have an N router, I would think it would be downward combatable with the radio. Hope someone with an N router can give you a better answer.
I don't think so....I am pretty sure you have to have the password to the wi-fi router...not just a login to the internet.
No, it does not need to be plugged into your computer. It does work off wireless internet access. If your work has WiFi then the radio should work just fine.
No presets. But you can program as many favorites' lists as you need.
I will recommend you use this site to scan to reveal the model of your laptop ram, then you decide which one exactly matched your laptop http://www.goldenram.com/
I am unaware of possible problem with N routers. Could be that radio wifi receiver only works with B/g but unlikely. Are you sure you are inputting passcode correctly?
No, it will not. As my review stated, it would not even power my mids. Blew after just 10 minutes. And the seller nor the manufacturer will do anything to assist in this. The product is garbage, and the manufacturer and distributor is even worse. Save up another 50/60$ and get something of quality. I tried the hard way. And learned my lesson.
I don't recommend Vivitar products to anyone anymore. The quality and reliability of their products is poor. I had problems with two different models of TTL flashes. One did not even last a week before dying. Another model lasted about 6 months. Their repair/warranty service is awful. i gave up on Vivitar and spent the money on a Canon flash, which is great. You get what you pay for.
I think that it is, but mot 100% sure.
no remote
I don't know. In my country we didn't use GMC cars, I really wants to help you, but I don't know. In my Nissan versa 2006 it fits perfect, if you can, look at this car and compare with your.
Of course. But it won't be as loud
Your best bet is to buy a better quality radio. This radio is bad quality.
contents in the box: manual; fuses; assembly tools; bass controller remote button (with cable/wiring attached). The amp works great!
You can use the amp in bridged mode, but my advice is to buy a better amp..
Yes it does. I have 2 p3d2-12 and it worked perfectly for me.
can anyone help me i need the wiring diagram for this unit.
They say this fits a lot of cars but it doesnt. Do not buy this. It wont fit right so the screen will keep falling off. And if you find a way to keep it on it will break within a month
Honestly it's not going to power two twelves that well
only 2. not high volume producers. An amp would help.
With no problems . As long as your wiring is correct . Mine ran my four alpine type r 12s and never got hot at 1ohm . The amp is worth the buy . Take the chance you won't be let down .
I have a sealed box and it works great. I've had zero issues and it's run like a champ for many months now. I'd choose sealed because it's cleaner quality and takes up less space. Hope this helps
The ends of the amp are detachable. If I remember correctly, use a hauling key to remove the ends and it will reveal the mounting holes
6.5"x3" divided into 2 sections... so each section is 3x3
yes very good
Yes. Even though this printer is supposed to be WIFI (wireless) it still requires a USB cable for initial install. Plus, if you have issues setting up the WIFI like many others do, then you will need this cable to print your document(s).
It wouldn't work with my MacBook Pro, after saying it would on the website. I returned it...
No. That is the exact system I use. Totally messed up my laptop.
Am sure that it will.. the only problem is that it is too shprt of a cable.. i had to order one that was 6ft long
Had the same question myself. No information on it on Amazon. So I said what the hell for the price I will accept whatever it is. The instructions are in very hard to read broken English. No product information there. I never got any to work, in my opinion you should look at something else. True piece of crap.
I really don't know except this is not a wireless headset and it does not have a receiver also I believe that model phone has a line cord? My Panasonic has wireless remote phones that this headset plugs into. So the wireless phone acts like the receiver. I don't believe this will work on your system. I hope this helps
this is the exact UHF remote that comes with the DVR722 and you won't need anything else
No.
They are male rca plugs, long cylindrical post in middle with a ring of metal on the out side, should fit in every female rca jack effectively
Press Menu. Scroll down to Date Stamp. Select your setting. Press Menu. Done, that easy!
USB cable with mine about 3 or 4 years old..vk
I Find that it supports metric system for deph.
I am not sure. I do know that it did NOT work on my Canon Vixia HF R300.
It would fit. I have used it one MC lenses of various brand
I got unbranded plastic covers for Micro 4/3 lenses; they came in a pair - one cover for the camera body and one cover for the rear end of a Micro 4/3 lens. I found these at my local camera store though (I didn't get them online).
The battery I received here is marked 7800 milli Amp Hour, and should be the correct one I asked for. The only way to know for sure if is what is printed on the battery is a standard load test. a problem for most to perform. I usually trust what is printed unless performs poorly in the machine. my past experience is usually good to what is printed. good luck, I felt I got what I asked for.
If you can take the battery out and run your laptop on just the power adapter - the battery is dead. My battery only lasted 5-6 months. Initially I got 3 hours on a charge - no more.
Yes It will. I have one in my RV and it works well.
I'm not at home to measure, but the description says 26.5 to front of tv. So subtract the depth of your tv which would be very close to 24. You could always mount a 2 x 4 or build out from the wall to gain extra depth. Do you have access to the back of the tv once installed for hooking up wires? This mount does have a piece that you mount to the tv, then you hang it on the bracket, then bolt it together so you'll need a little bit of room for that.
I have a Samsung 60 inch TV on this mount for almost 2 years. For a TV with this type of mount you must lag into studs. We love it and have not had a problem with the mount.
it isn't very good as the cooling fans have to have a table or something solid under them as there is no bottom to it and the fans are exposed I would not recommend it.
Sorry I can't, my PC isn't really easily accessible but if you have room for optical drives you should have room for this. The fan is 25mm thick, and I'm not sure how thick the front bezel is but if you allow for 15mm (and a 3.5" HDD should be 146mm long) the overall length is about 186mm, or 7.3". That's probably cutting it real close for you, but if this doesn't fit you could get a 15mm thick fan and slide the drives forward a little.
No you don't have to buy lenses.
nope
Neolux
OEM bulb, same brightness as origional in TV. No issues.
yes absolutely
Both CD/DVD
Unfortunately probably not. Most desktop pc do not take buffered memory. Check memory finder or newegg for proper memory.
Ddr2
Hey Daniel, I have with Bose,Samsung and Skull with no problems. Used with team speak, skype, go to meeting and mumble. I have not used turtle beach. K
Not sure what you mean about the lines but I had two pioneers when they worked they were great but both screens went bad. I use a different brand now
It did fit my porsche 996
I believe you need both.. I checked on the Pioneer website. The XM support on Pioneer is far superior to Sirius.. I opted to get XM rather than keep the bus adapter and Sirius connect module from the AVIC-D1 that I am replacing.
The colour of the frame is white
Inside the box You have 2 cartridges of 10 each As the camera can hold only 10 pics
Yes, it works.
Yes, that RAM should work in your MacBook (2009). I believe your max RAM is 4GB. I also have the 2009 MacBook 2.13GHz notebook and it's running in mine.
No, I don't believe it would work on a plane.
Yes you can use it for your Sony WX350.
Though bit of a snug fit, this case fits well and has small pockets to fit space batteries and SD cards. I am Ok with this. Hope this helps.
I bought it for a Sony Cyber-shot SG so if the dimensions of your camera are similar it will fit perfectly with room for cables, extra battery and cards.
Hi JudyJ, yes, this battery is compatible with the HDRCX230 camcorder. The camcorder is compatible with any V series battery. Thanks_Mitch
I suggest you check the SONY website or Amazon.com, usually they list compatible batteries as accessories for the unit. Sorry, I can't be more help in this instance. JZ
No it is a genuine one. I bought this as a spare and it has the same codes and warranty statement as my Original. So far in use it has been exectly the same as my Original one so I am a very happy customer. When I decided to go for it, I figured that even if it was a fake, it would at least perform half as good. For a spare that would be sufficient. Now that it turned out to be genuine, I feel even better! I would recommend to take the chance.
The RAM will work in a Lenovo R61i. The computer specs call for PC2-5300 DDR2 memory and that is what the above is.
It is a single 2gb stick of memory
Yes you can. That is the intended purpose.
Yes it works just fine :)
YES, THE one I received was a CANON manufactured lens
Probably. Read Your motherboard booklet. Usually with 1 chip the motherboard slows way down.
Have to get a conversion box I believe. This part didn't work how I had hoped. Think I bought a vga to rca converter . If not does just a vga to vga work
Hello, Our products are shipped from Logan, UT within the United States. Thanks, and please let us know if we can help you with anything else. Have a fantastic day! Lance
View sonic makes a 3d converter box that hooks up via hdmi to the projector. That and 3d glasses make a hell of a viewing expierence!
eye piece cap attaches to cord. end caps are attached to body and all may be removed
Ultra-Sonic Motor. Instead of being noisy, these are fast and silent, as sound waves emitted are done so in the ultra-high frequency band, beyond human hearing.
Only via HDMI or composite cables. There is no coax.
Nope
We have a big porch and just set it up there without staking it in. The legs are longer in front than in the back so it's sturdy. Never have a problem. Buy it it is the best screen and literally takes a few minutes to put up! I love it!
You have to buy/rent a projector. It does not come with one.
Your lucky I still have the box. The dimensions are 15 3/4 X 12 1/2 X 6 1/4 inches
Both numbers represent the size width in inches. The 1.6 is just over 1 1/2" wide and the 1.0 is 1".
Yes - it does at 720 dpi.
I accidently left it outside overnight. It rained hard and the radio was left on the ground where the water from the roof spilled onto it. I found it the next day, turned it on and it worked perfectly even though it had dirt (kicked up by the rain) all over it! I tie it onto the back of my kayak and splashing water hasn't affected it at all. But it is not waterproof so I would not totally submerge it underwater.
I don't think so. I couldn't mod mine in the end. I'd save your time if I was you and buy something like one of those Android TV things... Probably a better match... http://www.geekbuying.com/category/Android-TV-Sticks-1548/
Your computer needs WiDi. It's a graphic chip. I bought it and would not work without it. I was told you have to get it with your computer, it can't be added on. I went to Apple TV instead for my tv/movie needs and a USB cord for my big screen presentations with my iPad. Sorry that's all I know.
I could never get mine to work even in the room I was trying in. And I never saw where the money was credited back to my card once I sent mine back. So I can't say if it will work through walls . I couldn't even get it to work in the same room.
I have no idea as to what it is compatible with, I used it in a Uniden phone, and took the battery out checked the number, this one corresponded with mine, and worked wonderfully!
Yes, it comes with the keyboard ribbon connector. Fantastic. Sturdy. Just like the original casing only without your computer's serial number, so you'll have to use a permanent marker to make sure that's written inside.
yes, it has both 2 prong and 3 prong sockets on the same unit. So assuming the current & power draw is within limits, you might be able to put two pieces of equipment on the same unit if needed..
Plug them into your computer USB port. There should have been connecting wires with the speakers
I'm not sure about other brands, but I do know it works with all Canon DSLRs.
Yes it works with a nikon D90
WD1600JS yes I have many WD1600JS - ??????? 40NGB2 or other or does it just have to be WD1600JS , un formatted ? or formatted ? and then how FAT32 , OSX, OS9 ..... I have 25 in stock.
The short answer is, "it depends." The dependent factors are how much data you are going to back up, whether or not you have a SATA connection for the drive and how many generations of backup you want to maintain. With so many backup alternatives available, and for the price, you might consider one of the larger-capacity Western Digital USB-attached backup drives instead. The only reason I bought this drive is because I needed to repair an old desktop PC. It was the lowest cost alternative available.

Yes they are mountable. We have ours on all 4 corners of the house. The picture on TV is awesome not a waste of money for sure. We love it
Yes I have that PC and the card and they work flawlessly!
According to the site, it's supposed to work with Windows XP. My experience has been that you must have Windows XP Service Pack 3 installed to get most modern products and software to work. Have you updated XP to SP3? If not, that would be the first thing to fix.
The back of the charger says Input: AC 100v-240v -50-60Hz max150Ma Output: DC4.2V.....600mA. Is that what you need to know?

Yes, if you have enough batteries to power it.
I THINK IT IS A 2025
I have only the PMX680 which is a neckband version. 'i' designation meant to work well with apple products and with mike, OMX is ear clip style, MX is earbud style. They look similar to the 685 models shown on the Sennheiser site under sport.
Amazon's replacement for the G51JX-X3 will be the G53JW-XA1, but higher specs and with i7. There will also be a G53JW-A1, also with i7 and beefier specs. Look for them to be available for pre-order in the next couple days.
Not familiar with the Canon 40D. However it is a continuous light source so does not require a sync cord
Depends on the size of your set. I use it for a small fill light for the face. It only works when they are sitting. Its not strong enough if they are standing. So a small set like how south park first started then yes. For a large setting of models it will not be enough unless you want a low light setting. If you are using 3d models you will need more than one for proper depth
Yes
Yes... the hot shoe foot on all Canon flashes are the same size... this just screws on tight holding the foot in place... so there really isn't any risk of it not fitting.
Yes it does..... Have had mine for 3 years..... Works great! The Bluetooth dongle can be used to work for multiple devices at the same time also.
Both of my Coolpix cameras were able to transfer pictures to I-Photo on my Mac. I said "were" because both cameras are now in the landfill. The connector for the charging cable is very fragile and breaks easily. Once that happens, it costs as much to repair the connector as the camera is worth.
Works fine for me with direct line of sight. I have the receiver plugged into the front of my computer, so I can't speak to other setups.
It's "CoolPix L110" btw. From the User Manual, page 73, under "Recording Movies" - number 3, 4th bullet: "Digital Zoom cannot be used while recording movies. If digital Zoom is used before recording, it will be cancelled when recording starts." Optical zoom works fine, though :D
Yes it does: I bought for mine an 8GB Class 6 SDHC (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ECQVSS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and it works like a charm! ***Make sure you get Class 6 or higher speed to take full advantage of the HC... Greetings from Costa Rica!

This hard drive is a little thicker than standard drives. Open your laptop and see if you have at least 3mm of extra space. For laptops that let u slide in and out the drive I would not recommend.
No, it probably won't for a few reasons. One, this will require drivers that your television PROBABLY can't support. Two, the USB on most TVs is usually, but not always, for factory diagnostics and loading of firmware.
Mine didn't and it was over a year ago.
if you have a usb port on your camera and the correct plug is on the product in question the answer is yes. i use this cable for any usb device to usb port on pc including pc to pc. i hope that helps
Hi E. Onions! Thank you for your inquiry! The keyboard shelf is 56" from the ground. Aiste BisonOffice
The top shelf (where the keyboard is shown in the item's photograph) is 38-3/4" from the floor with the wheels installed on the unit.
i honestly have no idea...but the Plantronics website might help you.
I don't remember exactly how long they are, but they're lag screws, probably 3 or 4 inches. The weight of the arm plus the weight of the monitor will require a very substantial screw. Mounting into a 1" thick piece of beech wood wouldn't hold the weight, it really needs to go into a wood stud. Or maybe a machine screw/washer/nut combo could work depending on how heavy the monitor is. Either way, you'd absolutely see the hardware on the back side.
Yes
2" x 2" x 4" and weights about half pound . it is a very good one . I have it on my monopod and works great.
Hi, Adrienne. We currently don't have a Lightning to 30-pin Adapter. We suggest that you check with other retailers.
Not by itself. This is a passive speaker, it is not ampified. Preamps out are made to connect to an amplifier (such as http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004S55ES6/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3S9OO504Y0AMM&coliid=I2ONUTR0SFC1NX&psc=1 ), which in turn would be connected to the speaker(s)
It already has the app...as well as Pandora and many others. Have had it for almost 5 years and love it!
I have the same system and have no problems playing my ipod through all the speakers. There must be something wrong in your settings for that port? I guess I never changed anything when I hooked up my ipod.
I'm having similar problems with connecting my iPods (various models)..system not recognizing it (them)
I'd also like to know this. One response from Sony on their own forums says Yes, but I've seen No elsewhere a few times.
Hi, if you are pertaining to the remote codes so as to program your universal remote to control this TV, apparently those remote codes will be provided by the universal remote you are trying to use. You may check its manual for further assistance. -Ely
Hi Maurice, Yes. This product can play music CD's & FM radio. -Anthony
Yeah, I'm late.....But if any new buyers are juggling this topic, I've discovered some information from researching Blu-Ray HTiB's for well over a year. In regards to the differences in the two models, the 570 can produce a stronger, crisper sound than the 370. The 570 also has built-in WiFi, you have to purchase a separate component to stream content, wireless, to the 370. The DLNA support for the 370 had been of and on, so its caused confusion. It currently supports it with the latest update.
Yes. When unit heated up got open circuit lost audio. too expensive to repair. bought a refurbished unit from amazon and had no problems since.
One AA
Yea, that's why I got it so I wouldn't have to use the touchpad. It's easier to navigate Windows 8 with this Mouse
I apologize for the inconvenience you experienced with your B006-VU4-R. Please reach out to our Chicago-based Tech Support at (773)869-1234 so they can help you determine the cause of your issue and troubleshoot your issue.
Yes
I think so. The device is looking for VGA/resolution signals only, nothing about OS as long as you can convert Mac's signal to VGA output.
Yes
It is made for iPhone 4 (or 3). I have an iPhone 5s & I bought an adapter to make it fit. I really like the ihome, small, portable & has a really nice sound. Not sure which connect the iPod 4 or 5 has but you can buy an adapter that doesn't cost much if needed.
I use a pair in 2ch with 4 subs. Love em. Very wide sound dtage with the tweeter.
Go to this link to find your camera's manual... http://www.camera-usermanual.com/canon-powershot-sd3500-is.html
Yes
you will need an sd card size adapter and it should work.
if the lends gets smudged, you can use eyeglasses cleaner and cloth and it'll come right off
the camera auto focuses and auto stabilizes
1 year US warranty assuming you are buying brand new and not from a reseller/gray market product. Buying from amazon (or any other authorized canon dealer will ensure you are getting the 1yr USA warranty).
it does get dust in it internally and should go out for service to be cleaned
This will not work with the XBOX-360. Others are unknown.
Yes. Both have standard mount size.
The manufacturers warranty only, but I guarantee its in working order and like-new.
Mine didn't. I bought it used, but it doesn't look to me like it was meant to have a mount.

I'm not sure but I'm using it on an old HP pavilion dv6.
Yes they are
+5 red. Gnd black. Sp/dif brown.
.camera .lens cap .neck strap .cable (same set is audio/video and usb) .set of startup batteries (alcaline type) .cd with windows drivers, basic software plus complete owner's manual (pdf format) .basic printed manual (in several languajes) .product registration card that's it.
I don't think they have a mic.
Generally I would say they fit tightly enough in my ears with my music loud enough that I don't notice outside sounds.
I agree - it's a four thirds lens that I don't think is optimised for m43. My other non-optimised four thirds lenses can be v.slow to focus so I don't use for birds in flight etc. It's almost double the weight and longer. Not sure what speed it is at 150, but it's rated as f3.5-6.3 so probably pretty close. Min focus distance is pretty similar - around .5 m.
maybe with an adaptor but why would you want to they are 2 different sensor sizes and it will not auto focus
what is the question?
It does it and it is pretty good but mine seems to not be able to be easily set on video. I might have messed up a setting and since I don't care for video, I have not tried to find out what makes it so hard to set.
Olympus protocol flashes made by Olympus, Panasonic, Metz, Bower, Polaroid, Vivitar, etc. will give you TTL flash exposure. For manual flash (non-ttl) Sunpak makes a nice small auto everything flash. I would be wary about the old Vivitar flash, some of the old ones had a very high X sync voltage. Tedolph
It doesn't come with any memory. You must purchase SD/SDHC/SDXC cards to insert into the camcorder. If you want the same exact camcorder but with internal memory on top of an SD card slot, go with an 8GB hdc-tm55k, or a 16GB hdc-tm60k. It is cheaper to purchase the hdc-sd60 and buy sd cards for it than to buy one with internal memory, but some find internal memory useful.
No external microphone inputs on this camcorder.
Unfortunately I'm not using Final Cut Pro. Only iMovie.
I have been tracking this issue also, but I don't have the new camera yet. I just put together s system with the same processor and memory, and installed Sony VMS 10. From what I have heard, the problem is capturing the video from the camera in it's native format. Once its in a suitable format, it will handle the video. Check the forums at sony here: http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/forums/default.asp
on the round button up and down.
Yes a usb
yes it does
I'd need to measure but the cable is pretty long. I mounted a 55inch tv and there was still lots of extra cable on both ends
They both play.... So normally both the tv and speaker play... If you mute the tv, it is muted and the speaker still works with normal volume. This speaker is great, I put it on outside deck and watch tv (normally muted) thru the glass windows.
yes
It must remain plugged in. There is no battery to charge.
Yes u can, first u have to install the driver with the CD that came with ur printer, and make sure the pics are in jpeg format
I don't think, unless they make special paper. Because it doesn't use ink.
Nope. This printer is way too old for that sort of connectivity.
It will fit but in all honesty this is not worth your time or money for an extender. it is cheap and does not have functionable use. Save your money get an L series Canon lens and buy the Canon 1.4 extender you will produce quality pictures. when it comes to photography don't settle cheap. i have learned the hard way with buying cheap and instantly regretting it.
I'm sure you got it figured out by now, but to anyone else, I use a CLASS 10 SDHC 8GB card with no problems. Key is that it is CLASS 10. And the video length can be changed in settings.
The neoprene wrist strap comes in the accesory kit that is sold seperatley. I have never heard that it was supossed to be included. I did purchase the accesory kit and inside was the neoprene strap.
more than likely...China
Yes it will work but in order for the hook switch button on the headset to work properly you will need the jabra 1420120 link 20 hookswitch adapter
No. It's only input is power. Otherwise it's a stand alone device.
Easy. You need any radio with an auxiliary in and a headphone auxiliary cord. Plug the cord into the player, and plug it into the radio system, and jack the volume up! Voila! Or get an Ipod Nano 7 or any player with bluetooth and a bluetooth compatible radio.
I use Nikon but when I attach a flash to my hot shoe, I plug the transmitter into my Nikon flash via the pc synch cord. When I click, my on camera flash flashes and it activates the transmitter to set off any studio flashes that I have connected. All in synch with my shutter. I don't have a way to plug a receiver into my Nikon flash to be activated by a transmitter attached to my hot shoe.
they are good for listening to music by the pool or while doing yard work. but they have limitations and need to be recharged every 3 or 4 hours I'm sure you can find better sound quality in speakers made for wire less inside home theater applications
Hi Raul, I think I fits since I placed my D5100 with a 70-300 and did fit with no problem. As I remember shorter.
I believe it does. I Will mention I had Cobra from 18 years ago that worked great until a few years ago. These new made in China units i have had a terrible time with bad quality. I have sent it back so many times and got the run around from Cobra I will never buy one of there units again. Its not reliable at all. Dont be fooled by making claims of 27 miles. In perfect flat open conditions you are lucky to get a mile or so I have tried it many times.
I understand from reading the comments on other Samsung products that it is advisableto update the firmware over the Internet, I just ordered a Samsung 3D Plasma and the Pioneer 1020; based on your comment I will hold off on this Blue Ray player! It sounds like HDMI has some issues...
I suggest you get the HP,simply because its cute,small,takes very nice photos,its touchscreen,and the HP brand is better than Samsung.The Samsung is10.2 mp,but the HP is 12.0 mp.The HP is 3 inches,but the Samsung isn't.The HP is a better bargain because it is touchscren,12.0 mp,nice color,and like i said a better brand so i reccommend you to get the Hp PB360. I hope you enjoy your beautiful nice digital camera
I use mine solely for dvds and blu ray discs.
I have not had any problems with it at all.
You would have to replace the two hard drives in the LinkStation with drives that have a larger capacity. Supported drives can be found here: http://www.buffalotech.com/content/files/products/Supported_HDD_List_LS-WXL.pdf You will still need to transfer your old data to the NAS after installing the new drives.
Yes - This is what I am doing with my Buffalo. Works Great!
I bought mine used. It didn't come with an OS, I'm currently running Puppy Linux with an Alfa wireless adapter. Works great.
Remote works great!!!
Not sure what the Nook Simple Touch is... Sorry. I own a Nook Color Tablet and it fits perfectly.
This microscope has a USB port to transfer images to a Mac or PC. Any common imaging program can then display the pictures or video captured by the built in Celestron camera.
The padding inside the bag can be adjusted to accommodate almost any size slr. I believe your camera with grip will fit. This video is a great review that may help you figure out if it will work for you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maZ3Whz7LGs&feature=youtube_gdata_player

They melt on 250W tungstens. These aren't thick or high quality.
I had to make a bracket to mount it on the wall because it did not come with one. After all of that, the unit I had was defective but that does not mean they all are.
They come with the JL logo that you have to put on the grill, very easy . &#9996;&#65039;
sorry we can not open and sell only one
This question was asked before and the documentation with the phones say 110. 220 volt is for things like dryers and other items that take a great deal of power.
It's not listed as one of their available or 'coming soon' apps... http://vizio.com/via/
Janet, The speakers on the LN32C350 are indeed forward facing. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
I have mine hooked up with Component cables. I just got my sister an off-brand set at Gamestop for 15 bucks. I think the Nintendo ones cost 30, whichever one you pick will be worth it as it cleans up the picture very nice! Cheers
I don't see that stamp anywhere on the upc label of the box or on the stickers on the radio itself.
don't buy from this seller if he has not tested the pcs for 72 hours. 1 of 2 fails to stay on for more than 1 hour. i haven't opened the second one. it comes with pc only i think.
Not that I know of...you can go in and rotate pictures I think, but it won't save them that way.
It's black, and it isn't wooden.
Sorry. I have no idea, if Coby doesn't offer them.
From AC supply to pic fram it is 6 feet. Hope that help's
Yes. It will. I have installed em before. As mentioned though. You will have to take that god awful plastic ring out to make it less a pain in the butt. On the other note. I have had great success with swapping out z3, land rover discovery, rang rover, and jags stocks subs with jl audio 6w3v3. They put out cleaner bass. And run off the stock power a little better. In my opinion.
NO - it is only a 56K connection, just like all dial up connections.
Good Morning, The item your looking for is T110PLBK. Yes we have it in stock. Thank you.
They can both be wired to a main head unit and play the same disc or externally you can use the little av wires to hook up a dvd or Xbox or whatever individually
So does it length
My understanding is that you need a wireless N router. If you are directly connected through a phone line, then this adapter won't help. I think you need to consult a real expert to answer your question correctly. The wireless N is a recent development and requires updated equipment.
Yes
We don't have the box as it was returned in original box. Wish I could help you
Yes, but why?
Yes, but you will STILL need the additional Tivo subscription to make a Tivo Premiere unit functional. If you only want the online services there are much cheaper solutions (ie, Bluray players like Panaonsic's) that will give you those features.
I doubt it will work because when looking closely the 8 pin connector cannot be separated.
Rebecca. I don't recall listing the specs for the 90W adapter, but here's what's on the adapter: Output 19V 4.74A. Therefore, Power = Voltage * Amps = 90.6W. By the way, the adapter is still working after 2 years of service. I previously bought two of the 65W adapters to match the original one. Both of these only lasted ~3 months.
if the number is the same, it is. These are very high energy Lithium batteries and should last long in a flashlight.
Yes
Don't know, mine broke pretty quickly. Now I use an iPad.
Well since I am not a IT specialist all I can say is that it comes with a cord that sticks into an outlet at the back of the DVD player and the other side plugs into the wall outlet. I've had this DVD player for about 3 years for my grandkids. It still works for us.
I checked the index of the operating instructions- no mention of bluetooth.
I don't know about RealPlayer, I use the USB cable to transfer music to my Coby. And mine is the 8g, not the 4--but if they are the same except for memory, it's a poor choice for video. The screen is smaller than my year-old Sansa, and the player only handles one odd video format, ".mtv" So I wouldn't recommend this for video. Good MP3/radio, though.
Yes. Absolutely.
worldwide input voltage 100-240VAC/50-60 HZ. Ebay has a new one for 13.99.
I've ordered twice and received exactly as advertised.
No, it goes into standby mode. I tried to override with the buttons, didn't work. I've been able to squeeze about 7 more minutes out of the battery, by turning down the brightness of the LCD.
Police radars mainly use "k", "ka" & "laser" alerts. Other car radar detectors use most of the others, so I recommend checking those off the menu list as I did. In town shops with automatic doors will set of the police alerts, and if you pass them often enough, you'll recognize them. Highway driving with the police alert going off briefly with no police in front or behind might be a police car going in the other direction or hills/median concrete walls causing the signal to break up intermittently.
Yes, power cord is included. Windshield attachment is included( 2 suction cups).
Yes I don't see why it wouldn't mine is on the stand not wall mounted.. So it's looks great with the sound bar mounted on top of the TV with this
Michael The box seemed ok, mine came through just fine.I have been buying on line for several years and have never had a problem with UPS. Doug
No it does not. You'll have to purchase the software separately.
it's ok. I use mac pro too
For sure, they will work all over Europe. I do not know about Morocco.
Yes
yeah, it only renders to mpeg 2, but I edit using sony Vegas software to render my final video as mp4 and it looks pretty good. If you are have internet access you are supposed to be able to download a codec that allows the Hauppauge to capture as MP4, but I have not done that. hope this helps.
Yes, this was built for exactly that kind of use and environment. On initial setup, I believe that is the default behavior. Having said that, the one caveat with this device is the importance of the initial setup. It isn't difficult, but it will require a computer, network, proper cabling,and about ten minutes.
I'm using it with Ubuntu 10.04 beta and it works perfectly--including the media and volume buttons. If you press both left and right mouse buttons simultaneously, it's the equivalent (to Gnome, anyway) of a middle click.
It came with software, but I haven't tried uploading to youtube. I have however burned to a DVD.
Only 1 short cord connecting speaker to laptop...transmits power + audio from laptop to speaker. Clamps onto laptop effectively + unit sounds great. Very pleased with the purchase.
Yes they come together I got them a few months ago.they are very great because my music sounds more better than my old factory speakers hope this helps you out more.
I want to say yes it does, but I can't be sure. I have like 4 different ones ;-)
I had two of these in a gmc sierra extended cab in box under the rear seat and with a 500 watt amp it sounded bad ass and hit really hard. But I know your question is how much and I don't know. The most I put was 500 to both bridged. But I believe they are rated 500 a piece. Hope this helps.
I use only HDMI, don't know if other option exists.
yes, as a matter on fact, this br is excellent, i am so happy with it.
The BDP-S370 (ethernet, but no WiFi capability) can "pull" .wtv files through the player menu via DLNA, but they can't be "pushed" to it (on computer, right clicking file and selecting "play to". Yet the BDP-S390 can receive the "pushed" .wtv files via the "play to" selection noted, but it can't "pull" them via the player menu. Ironic that the step-up model that has WiFi can't do something the lower model can. Sony support is completely useless in this regard.
Yes, but the inside peeled off when I cleaned it. West Bend is replacing it but now they are on Backorder until June.
Regular (NON HD) TV always looks awful on the big screen HD TVs. Upgrade yourself to high def and never go back.
No
It's approximately 21.75" X 11"
I don't know. The set died after 18 months and has been replaced.
my Samsung has NO flicker! Great picture and great color. HD is outstanding with NO problems.
I don't know. I returned the TV due to a buzzing noise.
I believe it is to let you know that the TV has power, and is on standby. When you turn the TV on, it flashes, then goes off when there is a picture. I didn't look through the literature, so I hope that's correct. Good luck.
Yes, that is how I have my TV set up. One end of the cable is 1/8" headphone male (TV end), and the other end are RCA male plugs (receiver end).
From the product description: 40.6 x 24.8 x 2.7 inches (WxHxD). I believe the 42" number is the diagonal measurement, from one corner to the far opposite corner.
no one lying to you that model is 720p i have it also but... it might have a 1080i for blue-rays and other higher broadcast modes.
Go to neweeg.com and get you a Rosewill RNX-N1 dongle for less than $30.00 and it works just as well, it has the same chip as the Samsung and easy to configure...I know a got one and it's great+ saved some money.
I would worry. I was supposed to have my TV delivered last Friday. Never came, no call from Pilot or anything. I call every day since then and just found out today that Pilot "does not have the TV", they lost it. They blamed Amazon, Amazon blames Pilot. Long story short I'm not getting a TV as Amazon no longer has any in stock to send me as a replacement. Very upset with both companies. I hope your experience turns out better.
It works with all computers. I use it with a Mac and you just learned to use different keys.
Please contact seller if you have any issue through the following link;
no
Hi Jim, Yes it works with my panasonic lumix micro four thirds camera. with mine it will only take pictures in black and white because you have to put the camera on the "no lens" setting, but that makes it great for taking astronomy pictures.
It should, as long as the Nexus 10 has OTG support. I think it does. This device definitely works with Android tablets.
Yes we do allow international orders. If you have any trouble, please contact us by phone.
On the side with the black plastic plate and related socket.
Yes.
It would probably fit your head a lot better than mine. I'm a guy with an average size head, and it's pretty tight for me. As for the padding, there is a small hole in the back for you to fit the headphones in. I guess you could push some foam padding in through the hole, and slide it around until it sits where your ears are.
No - didn't work for me...
Its plenty big and cord is long. We ordered 2 of these and within a month both beanies had one speaker not working.
Not sure.. but if you are buying on Amazon, I am sure you can return if not. My quess it will work. No reason to keep changing a system (docking station) that has been in place for years
It uses a rechargeable battery and includes a usb cable so you can connect to your computer. I also plugged mine into a wall charger for phones and it worked just fine.
Yes a usb
it comes with a data cable that you can plug into your computer or any wall plug that accepts a usb cable
I agree with you; but you can FIX IT; edit your shared.xml file and add this section: &lt;Video&gt; &lt;Height&gt;720&lt;/Height&gt; &lt;Width&gt;1280&lt;/Width&gt; &lt;/Video&gt; You will be chatting in HD in no time. Also, make sure you get the LATEST version of Skype which as of now is 4.2.1055
Yup. I use it on my new Asus K55 laptop which runs Windows 8 64bit. Haven't had any issues what-so-ever
According to ATI this chip set uses Pixel Shader 5.0 (DX 11)
only 2 of 3 outputs work @ a time, so no.
No, but are noise canceling. My problem was that, because of the high tension on the head band, I could only wear them about 10 - 15 minutes. Cheers
I got the same and yes it should fit prefectly.
The noise cancelling is good. Not at much reduction as the Bose, or some of the other "over the ear" headphones, but for the smaller/lighter on the ear types of headphones, it is quite good.
I don't know
works great
I went with 14Ga. The connection ports will accommodate 12 but for all intensive purposes I felt the 14Ga over the length of run I have,(20ft) was sufficient to give them full power.
8-5/8" tall x 5-13/19 wide x 9-13/16 deep
I have had no issues with this. Treat it like a baby and it will be good to you. I wouldn't drop it, or use it for anything other than as intended....
Windows 7 is fine, tested and proven. I don't think XP will be a problem since it runs in 7.
This battery is a great replacement for a MacBook Pro with a 15" display that was purchased in March 2008. Sorry, I don't know what generation it is. Maybe you can compare it with the purchase date of your computer.
Check out the online user guide (http://www.tp-link.us/resources/document/TD-8816_V7_User_Guide_19100105.pdf) First go to chapter 2.4 hardware installation, connecting the router, then go to chapter 4.4.2 advanced setup, routing. Its too much to type in here. Follow the directions and you should have your router up and going in a short time.
It is just a modem with one Ethernet port to wire your PC directly to or a router.
This is for converting an older pc that has PCI slots and not PCI express slots. It will allow you to plug any PCI express card into an older machine. I used it to convert an older pc to be used as a dedicated fax server for a Dr office. The fax modem card I purchase was PCI express
Yes, a Western Digital 1 TB Black Caviar drive with Snow Leopard should be able to boot from this easily over Firewire, if it is formatted with a GUID Partition Table.
It works just fine with my 2009 MacBook. I don't have a Pro, but I would imagine that it would work with one.
500 mono block alpine. Best combination !!! I have had the system for over a year and never have I had a problem.
You actually want to go with an amp the is bigger or has the same wattage rating as your subwoofers. As far as the rumble, dynamat because it helps control the vibration.
The light starts as red and goes to green when charged. Mine does not fully charge and may only be half charged when the light turns to green.
10c is more like your everyday sub,meanwhile the cvr is more of a comp sub having dual voice coils,meaning it can handle twice the power. And yes the cvr's are gonna hit a little lower notes.
I would go with the bigger box. I use an angled box for mine.
Yes, it also gives off a fresh pine scent.
Yes
I have used this particular camera in an IMAG setting for a show that I produced. The HD-SDI worked flawlessly as a feed, and the quality of the image was superb. I would definitely own this camera with no hesitation.
You will have to refer to the manual that came with it, a list of hard drives are listed. Steve
The fast aperture on either of those lenses is going to be unimportant for a landscape shoot such as the grand canyon where you will likely keep your aperture at f8-ff16 to maximize your depth of field. You can accomplish this with a 24-70 2.8, 24-120 f4 or a variety of others. Having said that, the 24 1.4(which I use) is one of Nikon's sharpest lenses and except for the price has no real negatives. The 28 1.8 is a nice budget alternative although that extra 4mm might be missed on landscape shoots.
It does have PC VGA connection for use as a computer monitor, but before you purchase check this site out it may help with your buying decision http://www.consumeraffairs.com/home_electronics/coby_electronics.html
defective power supply
ADD a tv sound bar. cant raise coby volume without one, about $45 Walmart
Yea it's for the pair and it's a great set of speakers
I've been wondering the same thing. I don't see why Canon didn't just put a second remote sensor in the back of the camera as well as the front. Why didn't that cross their minds?
It's working fine with the autofocus mode on your lens, would also work with the manual focus but you would have to preset the focus on the lens. Michael
Sorry this dispositive no found overhead freezze not found ; dlna no found ; not found whit My hard disk
It will work on any laptop that uses sATA.
HP
If you are talking about the Seagate Ultra ATA 44 pin, perhaps. The WD Blue Scorpio slightly larger than the Seagate (by .01 inches in every dimension). So if you are already getting a snug fit with your Seagate, no. Here's a link to the specs for the Seagate and WD drives respectively: http://www.netcomdirect.com/sest4029ulat.html http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/SpecSheet/ENG/2879-701278.pdf
The power adapter (labeled Canon CA-PS700) on mine reads: INPUT: A.C 100 - 240V 50/60 Hz, 16VA(100V) - 26VA(240V) 0.17A, OUTPUT: 7.4V DC 2.0A. Hope that helps. Works great on my Canon T3i.
Don't know exact size, but very small.
The one I received when I purchased it nearly a year ago was indeed a genuine Canon product. Works great and worth the extra few bucks not to get a knockoff, in my opinion.
Yes
Yes it a standard sata hard disk disk for laptops
jose, 4K content would need to be downconverted to a resolution that is supported on this player. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
For my truck, it had stock tweeters so all I had to do was mount them in the same holes. If you don't have stock tweeters, you may have to cut holes.
I am wondering the same thing. Anyone? I am guessing you cant.
You would have to have the same astra 777 alarm. You have to match the remote brand and model with the brain of the alarm.
Mine came with the AC Adapter, one short plug wire, adjustable stand, the diagram book and that was it....the unit works great and like I said I wished it had a light....but for the price and what I needed I pleased......Hope that helps.....Brad
Does not have backlight.
Yes, however; does not cover accidental spills or drops. Manufacturer refurbished is a plus. Enter code 01QJ000242M13047 for discount.
I can't promise you it will fit, but I have the Nikon D3200 with the 18-50mm and 50-200mm. When I put my camera in there with the lens on, there was still extra space and the material is very flexible. So I think it would fit! :)
I have had very good luck with refurbished PCs. They are checked out and cleaned and have a fresh copy of Windows. With used, you never know quite what you are getting.I've been amazed at the quality of the refurbished equipment I've been able to find on Amazon at ridiculously low prices Make sure you thorougly research which model you buy, though.
It's 10v DC and 2.5A - might be able to find a replacement at Fry's, Radio Shack, or an online electronics store.
I checked on ebay. They have several listed (all used), ranging in price from $16 to about $30. Just go to the ebay website and type Ilive ITP100B Remote in their search bar. Hope this helps.
I don't think I would try that. I checked in the owner's guide. The diagram in the quick start guide that shows all the connections has the power connection labeled - DC IN 10V, which I guess means 10 volts. I may be wrong, but all the golf carts I've ever dealt with have 12 volt batteries. It may be too much power for the sound bar.
http://remotes.com/store/ilive/itp100b.html http://www.ebay.com/itm/iLive-Audio-System-Remote-Control-ITP100B-/261480262149?pt=US_Remote_Controls&hash=item3ce1702a05
I do not recall what connections were on it. I sent it back because it had terrible sound quality.
It needs to be hardwired to the vehicle.
Well, I guess they will work. The cable is long (4 feet, I guess), so the iPod doesn't need to be very close. I hope it helps!
This is a mono amp, there is only one channel
Should work. That is the reason I had to use this.
No
It is good and fit for anyone.
Yes. They are lightweight, sharp of focus and easy to focus. The field of view is great for Alaskan wildlife.
Yes it comes with a microphone.
That's a tough question to answer, it's so subjective. I have a couple loud mice that I replaced with this Kensington mouse. I can't stand loud mice. They are annoying and I'd rather throw them away so my family can't use them either. I really like this Kensington mouse. It has great buttons and features and I found it to be more quiet than other mice I have owned. I do know that there are some mice that are more quiet, but this one works great for me.
I bought both the Vivitar wide angle and the telephoto. I use them with my PadCaster to change the focal length of the iPad. I have been satisfied with both lenses, especially given the price. I have suggested to PadCaster that they design a turret so I can mount both lenses and easily switch between them. No response from them. (They are not Carl Zeiss, Canon, or Nikon quality, but they work for me.)
Try guide, menu or options. You pretty much have to keep hitting different buttons until you find the correct one. Also make sure that you are using the correct code. You can sometimes have several codes that work some what with the same machine and one that works better than the rest.
Yes based on the manual information this will work for insignia blu ray.
Hi Nanci, For further details regarding this universal remote control supported brands and devices, please check this link: https://docs.sony.com/release/Flyer_4170685121_EN_ES_FR.pdf - Jerome
Most likely. There are probably multiple codes for Samsung in the manual as they are a major player. I don't own any Samsung products but if Sony didn't want to be a laughing stock, they HAVE to have Samsung codes. That being said, you usually have to try one or two to find the "one" that makes everything work on your particular product. Best answer I can give you at this time.
I checked out the support site: http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/model-remote.pl?mdl=RMVLZ620 and did not see sound bars on the list of supported devices.
I haven't found a way to do this
Yes it can, and it is a great lens. I have the A77 with the 16-50 Sony lens. The Tokina and that lens were nearly impossible to differentiate from in quality. I had wanted a wider angle lens, so got the Tokina and only returned it because the difference in its coverage and the coverage I already had with the Sony was too similar to warrant the cost. I also have a friend that used the lens consistently with his Nikon 300 and loves it.
no it does not, it actually comes with its own antenna.
The device is recognized when hooked up to a Mac. The files are MP3 also recognized by Mac. Just drag the files to a different folder on your computer. You can import them with iTunes or other software.
It connects with a mini usb cable. Yes, its included.
You can turn off the voice activated recording mode to change how audio is captured at the time of a recording. You have the option to add onto an existing recording so you do not create separate files. You can also make corrections. This is done prior to recording the additional material. There is software available that allows you to join and edit existing MP3 files.
The product did not come with instructions, you wIll need to find the driver online, and it did not come with screws.
Yes, it has.
No, it is not waterproof. It is an aviation GPS, not a nautical one. I have it mounted to my SeaMax Seaplane. It had a few occasional saltwatee spills without any problems but I don't believe it would be happy to go underwater.
No idea.
approx 1.5"
I hope you still have the operating manual for this thing because that's where it looks like the answer is, on pages 29-32 under "System Setup". Use "AMP" to assign the rear channels to ROOM 2 and SW M to select the subwoofer mode. There's a "gotcha" here too. There are 2 sets of speaker jacks for the rear channels. One for SURROUND and one for ROOM 2. They are not interchangeable. I learned this the hard way through trial and error. Good luck. This is an amazing piece of equipment once it's configured properly
I had the same problem. There was some speculation that it was due to overheating. Because of this and another problem I had with this receiver, I returned it and got a Pioneer unit that I am much happier with.
Directly from Samsung...
We are using it with Samsung NX1100 Smart Wi-Fi Digital Camera Body & 20-50mm Lens (White). Don't know about the NX300.
Yes
YES
Si, yo lo tengo con nx11, para funcion ois en nx10 actualizar firmware
Yes I had to move the front seat up work great
yes you can !
Absolutely. We have the same set up, the radio seems to be slowely draining the battery, after a few weeks of sitting its dead, I would put in an additional switch.
Are you using a public DNS server I recommend opendns because they will locate the closet and fastest server to your location to avoid buffering. This article goes into more detail: http://lifehacker.com/5835775/google-dns-and-opendns-users-are-getting-a-web-speed-boost?tag=dns Improved Navi-X for me.
Total record time depends on the type of disk an setting on the recorder for speed. I can't seem to find my manual but I think the speed times on the recorder are 2 hrs, 4 hrs, and 8 hrs with the proper disk
I found it quite suitable for kids- clear, durable, handy, and still in good condition after being used for a long time.
I have this system and it sounds great.. However, your husband would not like that the rear speakers are not wireless. Great system though!!
did you get an answer for this? 'cos I have the same question!!
Yes, it's all over the net. Do a Google search on "Panasonic firmware 1.43" -- AVS has pages on it. In summary: firmware defect, they are "working on it" (have been for a couple days), no immediate way to get back to previous version. All we can do is wait (or return units, if that's still an option)
Yes! There is a good sized compartment under the flap that is great for folders or notebooks.
I can verify that this tv does indeed work with the iPhone 4.
Yes, I tried this with my iPhone 4 today for the first time, and it worked. I have not tried the hands-free calling feature yet. I only tried playing music through the FM stations using the GoGroove FlexPod+, and that part worked fine. And it was pretty good for an FM transmitter!
It would probably work well, because the stand is not specifically made for the iPhone. It uses a clamp system that would allow the whole thing to work with pretty much any object that would fit inside those clamps, provided you had cords long enough to reach the aux port. It comes with a short audio cable that would probably work well for you.
Same mount across SLT line. Should work/
I bought it for a Seagate 2tb and it works fine, I assume the tb size would not make a difference and that it will work with yours
As far as I can tell it does...........
Yes, considerably well.
Crucial.com has a system scanner that will show you upgrade compatibility.
The Cintiq21UX, DTZ-2100, uses the same driver as current Cintiq displays. You can download the latest driver from the driver page, here - http://us.wacom.com/en/support/drivers/. If you have trouble, I would encourage you to reach out to our support team at 1-855-MY-WACOM (699-2266), or online at http://us.wacom.com/en/support/
Is this number on the panel somewhere? If I remember when I get home from work, I can look for you.
There was no software with it for use as a router. It is an adapter that both sends & receives signals so in theory the computer it's connected to could serve as router with the proper software. I saw another questions answer that mentioned the "Internet connection sharing" feature in Windows that will allows sharing a broadband connection but I suspect you need a networking knowledgeable person to look at your specific requirements.
I imagine it will, but there is a CD to load some software on your PC. If it doesn't have a CD drive, I'm not sure what you could do to get the software on there. Check with the vendor to see if they have software they'll send to you via the web.
Who cares about XP try Win7 64 bit with 4 gig of RAM.... these core 2's fly with it...If someone is doing basic computing these computers will give them years of life.
You have to connect a Wii via Component cables like this.
Sorry, no microphone and no remote.
it says one year limited warranty from date of purchase which was sometime in feb 2014.
It should mine came with many plugs to fit almost all computers.
Yes it does.
Yes. I bought the Altec for my IPod Nano as well as my shuffle. Also works with IPod touch. Great sound.
I have the 3rd Gen Ipod with the 30-pin hookup at the bottom. I would imagine if the 4th Gen ipod has the 30 pin-hookup (located on the bottom of your ipod) that it would be compatible with the Altec Lansing IMT320. The sound quality on this speaker system is fantastic.
I am unsure, sorry. I have an iPhone 3GS if that helps answer at all
151 work well with dynaudio x12 as having a nominal 4 ohm impedance
No it does not it has a RCA in.
High Gain Digital TV Aerial - Portable Indoor/Outdoor Digital Antenna for USB TV Tuner / ATSC Television / DAB Radio - With Magnetic Base This one was better just do not stand in front of it or block it and it was under $10 And although it may say no signal change the channel or move in direction of any window, worked great!
It should have; I would contact the seller and ask that they mail them you.
I'm using 12 mm, but why not ask HP about 8 mm ?
Yes it can:-)
They have volume bass and treble knobs on the back of the left speakers.
This is just for background/ambiance lighting.
You might have to cut it or wrap around sides. Depending on room it might put out too much light. You could always put a dimmer switch on it.
Not needed during the day as I have some lighting from outside. If I want it on during the night time I can turn it on.
Each strip is about 9-10" long, with about 3 feet of cable connecting the two.
Yes at 12 feet you probably can't tell the difference between 720 from 1080 on a 32". Same could be said for a 50" at 16 feet. Details has to do with distance from the screen (all other things being equal). You will see more detail in 1080 on a 32" at 6 feet than you can a 1080 on a 50" at 12'. At 6' a 50" will also look pixalated and appear to be lower quality. Pick your size/resolution based on what your viewing distance will be.
check the remote for the aspect button (it's a rectangle with arrows) or go to the picture menu and on second "page" there is the aspect - it sounds like you're zoomed in. i did that to mine by accident.
I didn't know you could Skype using the Viera system this Panasonic model has. I cannot recall using Skype with it. Sorry.
From one side to the other is about a 40 inch range.
I have not had that happen...so far so good two years later. Sorry I couldn't help.
Camera size is 4" wide by 2.5" tall, and 1.25" deep with lens closed. About 2" with lens open. The screen size is nice, about 2.5" wide and 1.75" tall.
The default settings have the gps on at all times, even when the camera is shut off, that way it's able to keep the location updated without having spent a prolonged amount of time trying to reconnect to a satellite each time you turn the camera. There are two other options for the gps however. The first is airplane mode, where the gps will turn off when the camera is off, which means slower updates for the location, and also a mode to completely turn the gps off.
It will play but I did find it buffer more as the bit rate goes up. I know it is not my ISP as I have Verizon FIOS at 75 MBs, the wireless access point is sitting next to it so it is not a signal. So to confirm 256 does play most of the time (it might depend on the source of the stream), I also tried playing 320 but that is buffering too much.
nope
Hi, it is a matt screen
Yes
i'm now sure but 32 is what I'm using right now.
yeah, mine looks good but has no audio in realplayer. maybe someone will answer. i get audio with the software included but may not always have access to it when trying to play back.
Definitely not. Sorry. :(
It's long enough to wear around you neck, but a little extra length would be welcome.
No
If your asking will this control your cable box the answer is yes.
7"x 4"x 6"
The camera will fit, but it is not a lot bigger than that. Yeah, a charger might fit in the side pocket. A spare battery, lens wipe and a SD card in the other. But you will run out of "space" fast. If you tend to want a little more for bits and pieces, you might be better served with something with just a bit more volume.
I have the canon powershot sx 50 and it fits great and it's cute and sturdy. I love it. yes, you carry it over your shoulders.
No they are stationary and the distance is 8.5 inches
19.5 wide and 11.5 high
yes, it held mine.
No
No it won't. Mine let water in within minuets of going near the water.
No
Mine came with a disk and 3 downloads. Good to have extra downloads in case of. Computer crash.
If it's the same one that I have, it's a disk. It's a full version of the software with disk and key inside the box.
Yes.
Yes
That depends if you know the frequency of the transmitter. If it is in the same frequency range as a Wifi then it will work.
Its approximately 15 inches long
one
No. But you can get an adapter very cheaply on ebay that will fit the dock. That's what I did with my older iPod.
We had the system and it stopped working on our first 4 wheeler trip. Had to buy a different radio. Circuit board broke!!!
Yes, you can. It seems it will give two discrete tracks for two mics. Watch for noise as it is a passive box.
I think I was one of the lucky ones,... $478 shipped! I think they were trying to price match Walmart's Black Friday Door Buster, which was the newer and lesser 42LD400. Someone over at AVS said the $478 price only lasted 5 hrs, but if you had it in your cart you were protected from the prices jumps. As of right now, it seems to have settled in at $549.99.

*************AMAZON HAS IT ***************** Search under ALL "LG Electronics/Zenith AKB72915206 REMOTE CONTROL" should be around 10 dollars.
This tv is not supporting any new apps other then NETFLIX,CINEMA NOW, MLB.tv, PICASSA,VUDU,YAHOO SUCKS,YOUTUBE VIDEOS! LG HAS ....NO PLANS TO UPGRADE......They dropped upgrading as soon as they finished the making of the Model....LG told me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
NO, LG stopped updating the software of this TV long time ago...don't bother...
Just turn off the Tru-Motion setting. I agree it looks horrible and I don't understand why it is the default. Maybe it is nice for sports and games, but for movies it immediately cuts about 40 million from the production value.
outside edge of whole TV
Did you ever a find a set of speaker stands that was a little more affordable?
I do not recommend this product. I had to send back the first one. Then the second broke the same way. The plug at the top had faulty connections both times.
not sure, haven't hooked it up yet
This is just an enclosure, no camera.
I don't know. I have a 16 G Nano and it worked for awhile. The display will show what song is playing but no sound. Have you tried to "reset" the receiver? That worked a few times for me. Good luck. Perry
I don't think you can. At least, I haven't found it :)
Assuming that you're flying, it probably doesn't make financial sense to lug/ship this thing over there. Especially if you're coming back in a few years.
I just got mine today, I havent opened it up yet, but will tomorrow. I preordered directly from pioneer the day they sent out the emails. I got it for $549 and got the upgraded 2 days shipping for $20. Im replacing a onkyo tx sr-605 with this pioneer. I will give a small review tomorrow once I have it hooked up.
Yes, and I think it is a good remote for the unit. Everything you would basically use is on it
Yes it does
I am not sure I understand. It opens fully to reveal the iPad or whatever, but it does not fold completely underneath as designed. You can force it underneath the bottom (where the device is kept) with little effort, but I am not sure of it's stitched integrity.
It has adjustable corner velcro pieces for the iPad mini and shock absorbers
You will get the crappy holdders with any hard candy cases now. You can email them and pay an additional $15 or $20 for the 4 fitted corner holders.
My guess is yes, the zipper would close, but it would probably bulge...and unless you have one of the magnetic folding covers from Apple, you would have to put the keyboard under the iPad vs on top.
In my experience, This optical drive has served me very well. I can do all of the things that I wish to do,i.e., Burn,download,etc... As for will this work for you, I would contact Gateway and see if this device is compatible. Also, If you remove your old drive, Which is very easily achieved, Flip it over and you will find the part/model number imprinted on the device. Good Luck and I hope I was of some service. Robert
Suggest you ask Toshiba direct!
the price is for each friend
No, it doesn't.
Snap the ring off the earphone and put it INSIDE the new pad. Then snap it back on.
hi, no, you do not need the 8 way splitter to connect one receiver. thanks
Yes, the USB cord plugs into the top of this adapter and the adapter plugs into the wall.
yes! works great for ipod, iphone and ipad! mine are still going strong.
I have no idea - Sorry
I can't say for all systems, but I have used it both directions.
I don't think so I'm pretty sure it's just RJ12...
Yes it will. This mount is universal.
This projector mount can only extend from the wall in the horizontal axis and is not height adjustable. The height is less the 6-7".
Not sure about that model but it is universal so it might work. Mostly likely
There are 2 open PCI Express 1x slots in the HPE-250f, so yes, you can buy a card that will provide two eSATA ports (and even IDE support for a floppy or older DVD-ROM drive ...). Such a card would typically cost less than $25. Check out the link below http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816132014 Sixteen Gb RAM is huge. The HPE-250f appears to be a good value, but realize that there is only room to add one more hard-drive inside the case, and adding cooling to the case is not possible either.
Hi, I have this computer connected to 110 v grid. However computers as this one can work in any grid from 220 to 110 v. The AC to DC transformer can handled both. I hope this helps. Regards
I don't think they will fit your land line phone. They were designed for cell phones....
no pads
yes it is, and it is a good product. Like it a lot. I like it also for the fact that it can play vcr tapes too--which is good if you have a lot of tapes as I do.
it should but check with size of the camera and when you click the the camera case it will show you the size and if it will work.
Hi Reginald, My Mother-in-law uses this in the kitchen and it manages to fill several rooms with crisp sound. Bass gets muddy as you crank it up, but just adjust the EQ on your device untill your happy. It sounds good at low volume and works great as dinner background noise.
I ended up returning this dock and purchased an Altec Lansing that I am much happier with. I was using an iPhone 3GS at the time and I would think any iPod Touch should work. It might come with an adapter but you shouldn't need to download anything.
Simply Google iLive 37 inch sound bar and you will be taken to the iLive Web Site: at the middle/bottom of the page, you will find a tab marked downloads where the manual can be downloaded in PDF format. I would suggest getting a universal remote with a "learn" feature to copy the functions of the original remote, especially the clock set and iPod controls. The sound bar itself if okay, but the remote that comes with it is notorious for spazzing out, so prepare in advance for the remote to stop working entirely.
I honestly don't know. I've always just used the remote that it came with. Cool thing about it is that if you watch a movie or pretty much any type of video through an iPhone or ipod , connect it to the docking station and with a/v chords connected you can watch directly through the tv
I wondered that myself - the place where emf is emitted is far away from your brain, but it ends up by your heart instead! I don't feel anything in my chest though like I did in my ears when I wore conventional ear buds.
no
I still have the packaging for this and it states it fits the 1300 series, so you should be good
Good afternoon This purchase was for the older smaller GPS. I entered Garmin 40 and a few were uploaded, get this a try.
I realy do not know...I believe it will work with any hdmi connection but it will only connect with only one unit at a time..you cannot connect three at a time....I have one connected to my tv one to a dvd player and the other to a dvd recorder ....I hope this helps..the remote works real good
It does have a headphone jack and you can hear better with them
Of course it has speakers but they're not real powerful.
Yes, I used mine with it. iPod classic also.
Yes
I am not sure
the item should have the screws included. mine came with the suction cup.
I don't have an Apple System, I recommend asking the manufacture or Apple Representative...
Yes it works on my 2008 macbook.
Yes!
can't tell. What model number do you have? Go to HP's website. Click the support link, input the correct info, and download the user/ service manual and check the part number for the keyboard. This one matches HP part #483275-001. Good luck
It has a carying case,and a draw string bag that it fits in. I think the flip locks refer what you can turn up
I don't know the exact weight, (Should be on the product page), but they are by no means heavy. I own heavier binos and they aren't even cumbersome.
I can't answer your specific question, but I wouldn't recommend this mouse. I ended up giving up using it because it would constantly just lose connection with my laptops and sometimes so bad I couldn't reconnect without rebooting. I don't believe it was my laptops, as other bluetooth mice didn't have this issue.
You can't record with a DVD player. Try one of the excellent DirecTV DVR's for excellent quality recordings.
my laptop is dell inspiron 1545 it fit just right on my computer no problem with the drivers and also you can use dvd fab to burn blue ray disk
James: this drive should work with any laptop that has the same physical slot opening which utilizes SATA III. I installed this one I purchased in a Lenovo W700 laptop with no problems for months now. Keep in mind -- if you replace your existing drive with this one, most likely you will have to swap mounting hardware & the faceplate from old drive to this one.
Not by itself, as it will not have the audio ports needed
If your audio system has a mic, yes
Goes back to the default.
Yes, with the lightning adaptor.
The one that I received came in the original packaging.
It should work fine. We use JPG datamatrix barcodes in a crystal report and they print great. You just have to set your label size in print setup of whatever software your using. The print driver allows you to use the label printer like a normal windows printer.
In some ways yes the only difference is the pictures are smaller and I think clearer.
I do not believe so. These headphones work using i/r (infrared) technology. They do not plug in or work with bluetooth. I used them for the dvd players for my vehicle entertainment system thts on an i/r system. Hope this helps.
I use one of those adapters for the cigar lighter which has 2 USB ports on it then I simply plug in a USB cable from that into the bottom of the Tom-Tom. It works fine. Jim
Had one lasted about 18 months then would power cycle reset itself and some times power up other time just stay dead
I just plug my TomTom into mu computer and follow the onscreen directions to get updates.
Kimberly, don't listen only to what Peter says about this GPS. Look at all the 4 and 5 star reviews. They far outweigh the 1 star reviews. I've had a TomTom One for 4 years never with a problem. TomTom has been a great GPS for me as well as many others. This is a great price.
no, only American male/female voices/accents. however, you can purchase other languages. not sure how but it can be done.
Usually refurbished means that it was once in the hands of the consumer who returned it for some reason, maybe it did not work, maybe they decided they did not want it. Either way, it is tested and looked over (usually my the manufacturer) and resold as a refurbished item. Usually Refurbished items are a good bet as they have been looked over and tested by a technician, where as only a few new items are tested.
I go on line for all owner manuals I need
Yes i am. Actually i have two monitors and my tv hooked up. Switiching is fine i have two monitors if similar size so mouse transition is smooth and level with the borders
Nope
It could be that the web page you're trying to open is a phising site or any harmful site and your antivirus/firewall is giving you a warning. You may want to try opening known-safe sites, like www.linksys.com, and check if you will get the same warning.
Yes.
The problem isn't the audio but depending on what your watching you can't adjust the bass. I believe it does have the input
Yes it does - I can tell you I absolutely LOVE this frame- have bought 11 of them fro friends and family!
I have mine set to my photos, witch shows for 5 seconds. Read the instructions, it is pretty easy to do Hope this helps you.
I do not believe that it has HDMI however this is not a feature I use, it does have VGA hope that helps, but to make sure ask the seller this question
Got 3 years ago with XP, upgraded to Win 7 Pro I would not use XP if connecting to the internet. No security updates anymore.
not yet im be tackling said task in a few months i know it works with driverless devices such as game controllers and game controller boxes and emulators over long distance and it does well when recovering a signal
Yes, but it depends. If you have large lenses it will be tight. I just took a two week trip in Europe and it is tough. But loaded down this thing is very heavy. Be careful about checking it on a plane. I had to check it on a small plane for my first flight and the axle bent the first time. It still roles but disappointed I bent the first use.
I don't think u can make it. It measures 8 1/2" inside. I think that is 216mm.
I use it for a Nikon 300D with an 18-200 lens and it fits very nicely.
It may fit, but it will be tight. Also, I am using it for a bridge camera. A DSLR has more things you may want to bring along, that would not fit!
I'd just like to mention here, since a lot of the bad reviews are based around this problem, that the problem is FIXED. I did a full free map upgrade, software upgrade, even added new POIs and voices. No errors, and everything is still working fine. The only thing I have deleted is the non-english voices.
I go on line for all owner manuals I need
Unfortunately I don't have much information to help because I'm considering the purchase of the same system. Has your impression changed much from the original post? I enjoy classical music but don't know much about different audio outputs and quality differentiators. Is there a better system at a similar price that you know of? Thanks for any additional thoughts.
Mine do, just the front left and right that dont
Yes, each piece of hardware requires it's own hdmi cable to go into the receiver (hdmi ports marked "In 1, In 2, In 3"), and then you need a third hdmi cable to go from the hdmi "out" port of the receiver, to the TV.
Ddr2 or ddr3 exclusively. They cannot be used together even though there are seperate sockets for each.
Quick answer is no it will not. Touch screen computers need a certain type of capacitance typically to work. Your body naturally has that. The boogie board uses a different mechanism more like pressure I believe so the boogie board pen will only for work those types.
You can connect a cable with 6 emitters on a single port and it will work perfectly.
Yes
It's an oval shape exactly 5 by 17. It's awesome and works exactly as specified. I hope you have the space for it!
I have a 4th Generation ipod nano and it works great...
I'm not too sure with the newer generations, but the ones with the iPhone 4 plug in yes...
most in wall speakers will sound good but adding a sub in the wall lacks the punch i was looking for so i went an floor model.it also depends on how loud you listen to your music/movies.in walls wont give the clear sound at higher levels from my exp.i am no super audiofile but i have installed many a system for home owners....im a remod. contractor.floor speakers just perform better for me good luck my friend
You can put the speaker wire in thru the side OR the back of the banana plug. Make certain to buy the largest gauge wire. I bought 18 ga for small Element speakers and the wires don't stay in the clips. Bummer.
I don't know the full dimensions of the Mac book air, but it fits my keyboard, iPad, the stand ... and there's room to spare. Hope this helps.
Sorry don't know android devices.
actually to my I've had wonderful! excellent... This hard disk brings a program to support but I never install this program, use it as a mass storage and it has worked perfectly! Thanks -en realidad a mi me ha ido de maravilla!!! excelente.. este disco dura trae un programa para respaldar pero yo nunca instale ese programa, solo lo uso como almacenamiento masivo y me ha funcionado a la perfeccion!! gracias
http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductReview.aspx?Item=N82E16822149103 Read TOM review ....he said he did this!!
Yes. It works with my late 09 imac.
No... I ordered this one with the tripod Vanguard SBH-250 Magnesium Ball Head with Sliding Quick Shoe
I think I have the answer. See this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_surround and take note of the "reflected speaker" patent. That said, I get these today, I do have a 5.1 surround sound system .. and I will know how well they virtualize the surround sound. :)
No. In this case, Sony is better choice. Sony Active Style - MDR-AS41EX
Yes, but the cord needs to be thicker so it has less resistance. The thinner cord like I bought is too much for the converter to handle (even at 25 FT) and causes a "flickering" on the TV that switches from normal picture to a blue screen for a split second and does this a lot, so if you need to find a 40 foot cord make sure it is thicker than 1/8" diameter so that this does not happen. In other words you need to find a thicker gauge cord. Logan
As close as I can discern, the unit has subtitle selection, (If the DVD you are playing has subtitles, you can activate) but I don't see anything in the manual that indicates 'closed captioning' is available. While I was searching for the online manual, (I gave this as a gift) I did notice that one of the Sony products may offer it. Sorry I could not be of more help.
I don'y know as this is the problem I have had and no answer yet as I have not been able to link it with my Panasonic sound bar. When (and if) I do I will post the fix.
yes
YES I CAN
It did not work for me. Sorry.
not Sr all come inside you don't have to buy separate cables and they are long all depend on the distance but they package come with the cables, remote control , mouse, set=up but is easy to install if you have more question I can help ok
Just a name. They are not reference quality but they have good representative sound with a slight bass bias
To use these on a tv you'd need a stereo Y adaptor with male RCA plugs to a female 3.5mm single plug. That way you can plug it in to the audio out port on your tv since most tv's don't have headphone jacks. A 10-20 ft stereo line cord would allow you to sit far enough away for comfort. Sennheiser makes a wireless headphone set that works well with tv also. It's rechargeable and has its own stand. The model# is RS120 and it's available from Amazon too.
Nope.
it's a mic for apple devices , wouldn't use it for pc .
Weather resistant, 1/4" Color Sharp CMOS IR Bullet Camera, 65 degrees viewing angle, Max resolution 420x360, Max recording resolution (352x288 PAL), 12v connection
I had the same issues. And as soon as the warranty went out the DVR went out as well!! I had noted all of this on my review!!
Make sure the power supply is connected to each camera. This should be near the receiver (the main box).
you can play recorded video files in your laptop, go to http://www.canyouseeme.org/ , your IP will display, then click Check your port. If your setup is corrected, Success: I can see your service on 108.XX.XX.XX on port (80) Your ISP is not blocking port 80
The popbox doesn't have composite.
yes it does but I would recommend a diff system. this one is outdated and too many issues
YES! The battery will eventually have to be replaced. I did get the a/c wall charger also, to complete the many ways of charging this unit. This is a great little unit, the sound out of it is incredible for it's size.
You would have to buy gps component. I can't assure the reliable or the GPS but I do know this is an option for this unit google planet audio for the model type.
If you've recently bought it, send it back for a refund (the whole unit). Otherwise you may have to contact Amazon. It's pretty common that this unit fails in some way. I had two arrive "dead on arrival" before finally getting one that worked.
You need a projector and camera to use with this device. If you don't have both, it would probably be best (most economical) to use a commercial 8mm film to digital service. There are many companies offering this service - just do a web search.
Its just like a piece of plain clear plastic that lies over your keyboard. It is not fitted, so it slides off very easily.
That is why i purchased it, not sure if it was defective, it just worked on one computer and not the other, so i have to move ethernet line to other computer when needed. For the price it may be worth a try.
really not sure if that will work for you but the cost is so very little so may worth a try.
I could only play DVDs and its locked to play only US Region.
Yes and No... My son uses them with his Sansa mp3 player. They sound Great! However, the in-line volume controls/mic do not work.
I can Help you a little better if you can tell me if you mean "County" of "Country" If you can tell me that and also where you are located I will be gad to help in any way possable! I can take you to the FCC Data Base site and get you all your answers!
Sorry, we can not offer you discount, since the item is already the promotional price.
Yes, this mount can hold my 42" panasonic TV, so I think it will hold your 42" panasonic plasma.
It may but I don't think so. I bought this and had serious disconnecting issues. I would spend a little more and get the td-w8980, it has been the best modem/router i've ever owned.
Yes, and it works just fine. Mine is connected to an Apple extreme wireless network, but set up modem with direct cat5 cable (included) with your computer.
No
I haven't had any experience with multifunction printers and this device. Based on the setup I have done in the past I believe it should work. My advice to you would be to look and see if your printer model also comes in a model with a network connection. If there is a model like yours but with a network connection then setup will be easy.
It can be used by unlimited computers at once. My main one is printed to by 4 computers a day, by multiple OS types too, here at the shop. The computers themselves can all separately set the "default printer" that they call the default, but there is no default for the printer backwards. The printer only sees the TP Link which is sending it jobs to print, it doesn't really care how they got there or where they came from beyond that.
No, only the printer drivers are needed. Your router will assign a local IP address to the device, and the printer will be seen just like any other networked device.
Should work, that model uses sd ddr ram pc2100, max 1gig. Note: 1g memory is good for XP and basic home computing. But for say, windows 7 and heavy programs like Adobe Photoshop, don't expect super fast response time.
Good, the reports listed here are modules of 8 chips, 4 on each side. Each module is 64kb. I bought 4 modules of these reports, install 2 modules in a Dell Inspiron 1100, so I had to recognize 1Gb update the Bios. And Install 2 modules in a Toshiba Satellite A10-SP100. The 2 computers are operating perfectly
Your notebook uses PC2100 ram and this ram is PC2700. It may work in your computer but it would likely run at the slower 266 MHz that your computer is made for. It should be backward compatible but would run slower than it would in a 333 MHz system. You could contact them to be sure.
Unfortunately I cannot provide a definitive answer. My printer is the Brother HL-5250DN. I had a 256 MB chip in the printer that worked very nicely. So, I was taking a chance with the 512 MB chip. I followed the chip requirements as spelled out in the User Manual that I downloaded from the Brother website and determined that the Komperbay complied. I have used Komperbay memory before and have found their products reliable. I hope this helps.
Yes, exactly as pictured. Laptop PC133 specification.
It appears as if it is. The Compaq Evo D510 Desktop uses Module Size: 1GB, Package: 184-pin DIMM, DDR PC2700, CL=2.5, Unbuffered, NON-ECC, DDR333, 2.5V, Max RAM TOTAL = 2GB.
About 3 hours - long enough to any movie. Love it.
Sorry, I am not sure. But we didn't have any problem on the road. Although we only travel on regular road.
I can't remember if it has an adapter for the cigarette lighter, but my kids use them all the time on trips (I think maybe it does, so they recharge along the way if it's a long trip). We bought 2 for Christmas in 2009 for sons aged 11 & 7, they use them constantly. This summer the younger one, now 11, knocked one off a bed and it jammed the outlet, so we ended up getting him another one. That being said - they hold up very well and are extremely handy-definitely worth the money.
Should work. All Garmin nuvi models use same kind of cable.
I am not certain because I do not know whether female plug on 205 is mini or micro or something else. This cable is a mini male end.
Yes
Yes
The cable is approx 3'
Not sure because I've only had them a month but they are uncomfortable. Maybe my ears are small. My 18 month old was able to remove the actual bud. Pretty cheap.
I has an I or straight Jack.
There is no actual adjustment for this head set. That said, a lot would depend on the size of your childs head. I find the neck band a bit small for my head but not so much that it bothers me. Since the phones do hang over the ear I think your child could us them.
No but unless your head is truly enormous, it should fit.
Perfectly, getting ddwrt on it is a little tricky, but I have done it on two of these and they are both running for several months with no issues.
Only 10/100.
I purchased the case for my Samsung WB35F which I think is the about the same size as the Canon Power Shot. There is plenty of room for the camera and strap and snug with the padding. I carry an extra battery, card, and plugin in the accessories pocket.
Hi Lee H. Yes, your ASUS T300LA 13inch Transformerbook will fit with more space. My HP ENVY Laptop (dimensions 13.38 x 9.28 x 0.78 in) fits perfectly with enough space for a pencil on each side. TIP TO PREVENT SCRATCHES FROM ZIPPER: When unzipping, tilt the case so your item shifts to the far side. I never had a problem with scratches from the zipper, but I'm cautious anyway.
call apple or twelve south to be sure. But mac retina is thinner than old mac so it should fit with room to spare.
It will not extend that much. I measured about 10" from the wall to the back of the television.
Technically: YES. My personal experience: The pins will bend after a few days in a way I've never seen before on a reader. For CF cards I would buy something more heavy duty and better quality.
This eSecure All in 1 USB Card Reader has 6 card slots Big one on back reads CF cards the 5 on the front read several different size cards via USB connection to PC or anything USB compatible ....I love this reader very pleased with multi sized reader. I believe your Sd card will fit please check product description to confirm...hope this helps.
Yes, go to motorcyclelarry.com where they offer a better solution in the form of a replacement brake reservoir cover designed to accept the RAM ball mount. It's a much better and stronger solution than offered by RAM itself.
I'm not sure the difference of CCD or CMOS, but I did install it on my 2008 TSX. http://i306.photobucket.com/albums/nn274/Typeronie/stuff%20for%20sale/IMG_3920_zps366b1c48.jpg http://i306.photobucket.com/albums/nn274/Typeronie/stuff%20for%20sale/IMG_3933_zps29d63e59.jpg
Doesn't matter at all. It's your choice. I did the driver side.
Do not know. It's manufactured by Startech. You might find the technical support you need on their website startech.com
may be, have yaesu FT 900 with Automatic tuner
I would think so as it supports all Apple 30 pin iPod, iPhone and tablet products.
don't know, you should be able to go to the yamaha site and check compatibility or call customer service. sorry, hope that helps.
They are symmetric and conform very well.
Yes.
After 8 minutes of untangling all my wiring, the audio cord is 4' long.
Yes, I use windows 8 on my Lenovo and it works fine.
Camera yes, but the battery definitely not. But I really liked the case, it protects the camera well and does not cover too much space. My wife carries it around in her purse all the time as the battery life is good. When we go to a vacation I put it in a different case along with the charger, batteries, SD Cards etc etc. So I recommend you to buy 2 cases including this one...
It would be too tight

This case would not fit the Sony RX100 Mk II. Check the Lowepro Dashpoint 10 Camera Pouch for a really good fit.
Yes.
It's an lp-e8 pack I'm not familiar with the t5i but I would remove the battery from your camera and check the model to see if its the same that I I said (lp-e8) well I hope this helps you answer your question and sorry I couldn't be much more help as this 2ti I have is a spare backup that rarely use. Cheers and good luck
You can manually enter the numbers using the 4 arrow keys (slow and painful, but works) or you can select from the recent Caller ID log and chose to add numbers to the lists. One problem with selecting from caller ID is sometimes, for example, Caller ID may show 1-555-555-5555 but in order to block you actually need 555-555-5555, which are not recognized as the same number. Not a big deal, but test to make sure.
I have a few DVDs with ALL regions code and the player plays them all.
I don't recall it coming with earphones but it has a place to plug earphones in. I bought it for my son and he doesn't care for ear buds. There are plenty of reasonably priced headphones out there that perform just fine. (10-15 dollars)
Yes. I've played DVD's that have been burned for me by family members as gifts from all areas of our lives in years past, in addition to those burned with music on them.
Hey bro I had to do the same with my amplifier go to power acoustic.com and go to customer service and send an email about your problem with the product they will email you back with further information I had to send the amp and 25 dollars into them and they fixed my amplifier! Great amp great sound quality and overall great customer service. Good luck bro! Happy Holidays
This price is for two speakers... a pair of 6x9 inch speakers. Usually the size for the rear of various car models.
Love this player. Give me a couple of days. I have a Neon 98.
Sounds like a wiring problem with your amp. Speakers are very simple to get working
I believe the receiver alone will run 18 to 24 hrs on a standard car battery. If you are going to run it on a stand alone battery, better to use a marine deep cycle. you might get 48 to 72 hrs before a recharge is needed.
No speaker, it is just a really simple CD player
I purchased the Pro-Am bag with it, inside is the jib and stand all inside the bag 3 ft
Im using windows 8 pro 64 bit with it now, works final www.iceline.info
Yes
It should. It connects through a USB port. The manual say it connects to "Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP and others"
It doesn't do dvd at all. I honestly think it's a terrible product as I have had no luck with anything
It should fit into the HP Pavilion. Whether it works or not, it would need to be tried. However, I don't think you'll have a problem. This drive is a 2.5 inch thick hard drive and the one in the Pavilion dv9500 uses a 2.5" form factor hard drive.
I am not sure. I believe it is only for certain Sony MP3 players.
According to the Amazon "Does This Fit Your Vehicle" it does. http://www.amazon.com/Metra-95-2001-Installation-1990-Up-Vehicles/dp/B003D3NEEU/ref=au_as_r?ie=UTF8&Make=Chevrolet|47&Model=Trailblazer|489&Year=2003|2003&n=1077068&newVehicle=1&s=car&vehicleId=5&vehicleType=automotive
No I don't believe so u need the. ( Metra 95-3302 General Motors DDIN 2004 and UP Dash kit) should work
According to Acer, it only has a VGA port.
Nope
The VESA capabilities for this monitor are 100x100 mm.
It should work in everything.
I am currently playing a digital copy of a video game stored on the card. Absolutely no issues. It should not be a knock off
On the front with the built in tripod pocket.
It is just a tray that holds your laptop so you should be able to use any computer.
Cheap curing causes silicone to come out of the membrane. No permanent fix, this works.
Not unless your receiver has the same slot as Panasonic does to plug in a wireless card. I would say they are Panasonic specific.
I would say yes. I've jogged a little in them and never had problems with them coming loose, but not any distance. The main negative I would say is that if there are other sounds, like grass mowing, etc., they aren't snug enough to block out the sound, like an ear bud might.
They will absorb moisture although I don't know if it would help odor or not. We use them to keep scuba dive boots dry when stored and it keeps them from getting mildew smell.
No, the one I does not.
The outputs out of the amp itself uses phoenix connectors, which look similar to molex plugs. I've made custom cables from Phoenix on one end to banana plugs to my wall patch-panel, but it does suck when trying to use any reasonable gauge wire. I tried to find pre-made cables with no luck. With that said, the cables still work fine. I'd suggest using electrical tape or heat shrink tubing on the Phoenix connectors.
i have a casio hr-100t and this works fine with mine
The compatible Seiko IR-40T fits my older model Casio, the instruction manual for which specifies IR-40T. .
Don't buy this printer it is the worst waste of money in the world! We had to go through 3 printers before we got one that worked. It has worked for a few months now and I just got rid of it because it was eating paper. I would never suggest anyone buy one. Buy a cheaper one and bite the bullet on the ink is the best way to go!
No, this printer doesn't do borderless printing.
The first one I bought didn't work with the AC adaptor. I had to return it and get another one. That one works fine. If you don't use the adaptor, be prepared to buy a lot of batteries. They only last a few days at most. Good luck.
I do not know for certain. I do know that when I bring up online pictures for the the Escort Supercup and compare them in detail with the Supercup for Beltronics detectors, they are the same pictures. There may be slight dimensional differences though. I could not find the exact specs on either model. I would recommend that you contact the manufacturer. Sorry I couldn't be of more assistance.
As far as I can tell, this remote control works for every devices. All you have to do is to make settings on your PC and it works pretty well for me. Please do make sure that your original remote control have to be working, otherwise it will not do any good.
I think you are saying this like you already try it. And you are right the adhesive mount is rigid and it wont take the helmet shape. My suggestion use another mount, what about goggles, Do you use googles? try with that. That the only thing I can say. Bless
no, no features other than recording. i would stongly recommend just getting the xtc280, HD camera, way better than this one.
this is a great item! yes- it closes totally all around the case.great case ,good quality and the cost is really a good buy!
There are 112 slot holders for your dvd's or cd's. Any more make the case too difficult to handle.
Nope, the pages aren't removeable @ all
It works fine with my Vizio VSB200 sound bar. May depend on which sound bar.
No
I don't believe it is possible because both devices connect via HDMI cables and do not interface
tuner works for analog and digital signals (cable or over the air). It dooes not record in HD--but it does upconverty the recordings to hd. Plays pre recorded disks in upconverted clarity. You will be spoiled by the hard drive recording (no tpes etc) Can be bought from Walmart on ship to store(on line)
It fit my model that was shown in the specs. I bought that and a battery from Batteries Plus. And they both solved my problems. So it worked great for my model which was an older model. Hope that helps you!
Probably not. If you read the description it says to not use with game consoles, probably because they draw too much current for the converter. The xbox would be almost 400 watts (using a nominal 220V value for input and the 1.78A gives about 390 watts). This converter is only rated for 100 watts. You'll need something more heavy duty, probably rated for at least 500 watts. You could also look for a US xbox power supply for it. That'd probably be the best way to handle it. Good luck!
Sorry, no. The converter is only for max 100W peak and also nit intended for equipment producing heat, like driers, toasters, ...
It should be able to easily. Usually I would try the limits of any product but unfortunately I haven't tested it that thoroughly. I would still expect it to handle 75watt easily.
Yes, but I don't know how well. If your picture keeps breaking up you might have to keep adjusting the antenna for the different channels.
The hard drive enclosure comes with a MiniUSB adapter that powers the hard disk when plugged into your PC via USB.
Yes, the imager will work with the Amscope M220B. Just put the imager in the end of the tube where an ocular lens goes. The 4421 fifteen power imager is half way between the 10x and 20x ocular lenses that come with the Amscope. I imagine the provided software will work with xp, but any video cam software that works with XP should work with the 44421 because it works like any webcam. For for example, Windows Movie Maker should work. Any video cam software that came with your computer should work.
Unfortunately I purchased them as a gift to be given in July so I can't speak to this issue.
Hi, I replaced my original earbuds foam pads on my Sansa with these n they fit just the originals. Yes, they will work with yours! They fit earbuds like a second skin yet cushions being slip off. I went slow n used my nail to put on. Totally love them!! Hope this helps!
Always blow out. You don't want lint and gunk building on vital components.
Regular size SD Card
The Camileo H30 shoots in AVI movie format. From a Google search I found out that: According to Apple, iMovie supports these video formats: MPEG-4, QuickTime MOV, MPEG-2, AVCHD, DV (both standard and high-definition videos). And iMovie supports most of the commonly-used video codecs, including H.264, MPEG-2, MPEG-4, DV, and AIC. I would contact Apple to see if iMovie can convert from AVI format. Also check out Zamzar.com for free file conversions should you need only one or two files converted.
In order to use with a tablet or cellphone, you will need to use a dvr that has remote access function. Converter will only work on a pc.
If you want to have security footage in two areas.....we have three...one in back, one in front and one on side...especially if your house has access to the back through a drive or space between neighbors without a tall fence....liability wise also...we film the front because of the sidewalk....and walk way
I'm quite sure that it doesn't work with a Zune. At least not without a lot of effort to find an adapter. It is also not equipped with an auxiliary input jack. I think it would be best to find a dock made specifically for the Zune. Good luck!
I have the Ipod that is the newer one with 160G memory and it works.
Best way to make sure exact fit is by going to Crucial's website. Look for your Mac model and it'll give you all compatible upgrades. Then you can go back to amazon and look to see if they have the one you need, otherwise I recommend to get it straight from crucial
It works on everything, this is just preferred on MAC for some reason it increases the v.card capabilities of MAC Books.
Yes it is dual voltage. The switch is in back on amp.
The magnifying eyecup does not come with a case or strap, as it is intended as a direct replacement (screw-on) for the standard eyecup that comes with the Hoodman Loupe 3.0. The Hoodman Loupe itself includes a carrying case and strap.
If there is I can't find it
Don't know. Haven't hooked my tv up to. It yet sorry
you would be pushing it, there are better meters for that.
When its fully extended and still able stand without assistance (in the shape of a TV dinner tray) its 19-19.5in depending if you tilt the support plate. If you have the legs completely straight its about 26in but its pretty much useless in this shape unless you lean it against something, and even then I wouldn't trust it to hold my pc. So to answer your question: 19.5in
Mine is ~24" long with the USB on one end and a DC ? (female) power adapter on the other end. DC ? power adapter is similar to an electric shaver power cord. Problem is, those aren't necessarily found with USB on the other end. Original Company should be able to help sell separately.
The wall plate itself connects to a standard outlet box like any other wall plate (AC outlet, cable outlet, etc..). I found a handy one at ACE hardware that you can install from the front (outside) of the wall by just cutting the hole, inserting the box, and tighten down the "molly" like tabs. Run the wires inside the wall and into the box before inserting the outlet box into the wall. I hope that helps. Take a look at "Thomas & Betts #b120r Sg Old Work Box" on Amazon for an example of the outlet box.
Yes the are single
No
Can't answer for sure, but it works great in our 2007 Commander. Sometimes, we have to cycle through the source selection on the radio to jump start it playing from the ipod. On the Commander, the isimple uses the DVD player input.
If you're going with a sealed box for your W6 you want somewthing with 0.625 cu ft of air space or 0.75 cu ft of air space if you're using a ported box. The dimensions of this Scosche box would have actually worked pretty good with your W6 if you added some extra badding to account for the slight difference in cu ft (which you should always add at least a little bit of badding anyways IMO) but its a moot point because the dimensions of the W6 are too deep to fit this box. Hope this helped.
It needs earphones, external speakers or it can plug into the AUX on your radio.
Thank you for your inquiry. Yes, we recommend that you remove the Optical Tube Assembly (OTA) before attempting to transport the telescope. The base has convenient carrying handles as well.
I'm running it on Win 8 w/o any drivers and it runs just fine with the Win 8 built in drivers. Just plug it in. Remember to use the supplied dual USB plug because you can't get enough power from one USB 2.0 port to run the unit at it maximum performance, otherwise. It needs two USB ports for the extra power. You might try using a USB 3.0 port wince they put out more power, and then only use one usb dongle too. I haven't tried it.
Throw it in the trash. I've had two of these and both stopped working so I'm now hardwired. Also don't bother calling sony they are clueless regarding their products.
No.
they arent huge, maybe 8 or 9 inches tall, by maybe 11 inches wide, but they sound good for background music, and people dont even realize they are fake rocks
I just used it for hair dryer and it was fine their electricity is more powerful than here so wouldn't like to say about a strip!
I have one...works charms :)
If other adapters work on your camera then I'd guess that there is something wrong with the threading of the adapter.
I think this is to convert either a Nikon or Canon lens to 4/3, body, my old standard 50mm Nixon lens works great with this adapter and with my 1st class Panasonic 4/3 camera and this adapter costs so much less and is of good quality, be careful as some that are made in China are very poor quality and poor fit as well. You can go on some of the photographic forums and receive first class advice from some pretty experienced people. Good Luck, Ray
No it dosnt connect to make the lens work
As long as your Nikon has an F mount, it will work. Be it only manual focus...
Yes
Yes. It works quite well with the d700 big bright viewfinder
I believe it is just a reality of the circuit layout inside the box it involves s portion of the internal board power cycling briefly with capacitor discharges as the switching process takes place. I brlieve it ensures a stable voltage output and protects the internal components. Hope this helps. Your device is working correctly as mine does the same as well.
Yes to both questions. For the price it's great buy.
No to both questions.
Nope. They change their cables model to model, package to package. Depending when you buy, you might get one cable type, then another. They will sell you extra cable at $20 per 50 feet run, plus $10 shipping.
No Rails included but you can buy it on our online store
Yes will work with anything with 3.5 mm headset jack
22 awg
I don't understand the question. But if you mean if it pull forward to the center yes it does.
It will extend the TV 20" out from where the arm attaches to the wall bracket. The distance the arm extends out from a compressed to extended position is 8"
It's slower being it's usb 2.0. I don't know what the benchmark numbers for usb 3.0 but I would assume it's quite a bit faster. I had need of the older legacy 2.0 and the price was right for me.
I am sorry but do not know what is Maverick? I know it works with Dish network dvr
It doesn't. That must be a special version of the keyboard. I have ordered three and all of them are in english with the regular set of symbols.
It is 59 inches long
My first pair lasted four months.
yes they are stereo
The cord of those earbuds is 46 1/2" long. From the radio end to where it splits into two cords is 29 1/2".
The plastic has a 90 degree bend about 1 cm. away from the metal audio jack insert. Interesting question. I hadn't previously considered how that might make a difference and still don't know how. Perhaps you could enlighten me?
All headphones work with all devices. The universal standard is 3.5mm unless you are working with $1,000+ headphones that are studio grade.
Yres, I am an ancient, over the hill, older that dirt fossil and anyone younger than moi is a "kid". I am from the South and children were called "kids" among other things.
They plug into any speaker jack.
I don't know. However, I can say the radio reception is terrible. FM was weak and AM was worse. I sold the unit on eBay. Sorry I couldn't help more.
Yes you can, I have a Samsung S4 and a Samsung player and both connect via bluetooth and usb cable.
Yes it works with Macs
No USB
needs to plugged into cig lighter or adapter. Just used on a trip and was great for my 2 year old grand son. we watched Frozen over and over.
There is a DC in: 9V, 1A input. I am unsure if this cord is included standard with the item or not, however, they can be purchased very cheaply online (1-5$)
It does have a battery, but it doesn't last very long at all.
Yes, I have it connecting my xbox to my tv.
I did and it works great. If you want high Definition (HD) pctures you need HD cable and a HD subscription.
It should if both your tablet and TV has an HDMI port. If you don't know what that is, look up the ports that come on your tablet.
Don't know for sure. One end has a standard HDMI plug for like connecting to a TV. The other end is a mini HDMI plug that fits in the smaller type HDMI jacks like on our camera. I got it to connect our camera to the TV to look at the pictures BIGGER!
yes this cable would work for your kindle 2 and any other micro usb device.
single core
Yes it is enough space. It takes about 4 gigs to install and very little to save. The 16 gig flash drive is the overall better one though.
This 8 gb won't work for get a 5. I would buy something a little more bigger.
No.
You can use fotodiox grids but they are very delicate (can break easily) . The soft box it self is very durable. I'm sure you can use other brand grids as along as it is the same size as the soft box .
I use the Alien Bee 400. I would actually like a bit more power, though, so I'd say go for the 800. Paulcbuff.com!
not sure but it plays everthing i own or rent from nexflix
I am not positive. Have a look at your battery specs first. The battery I received from this seller is a 3.7v 2.2Wh battery. If yours is the same, it will work. If not, try Googling for a battery with your specs, I'm sure something will pop up.
I put a 2tb green WD drive in my enclosure and its working great.
Sorry, I do not have the T3i, not sure.
Yes. I have an Onkyo. You literally run cables to the transmitter like just like you would run them to your speakers. Then the receiver (across the room) has cables that run to your rear speakers.
the "Ultimate" models have blank keys. the "Professional" models are the same keyboards, except with lettered keycaps.
I used to have the original PSP which had a Sony Memory Stick Duo slot, and I used a 4GB card. The new PSP-3000 still uses this Memory Stick Duo, the PSP Go system uses the Memory Stick Micro, and the PS Vita uses the PS Vita Memory Card.
Hi Dale, this Sony 8 GB PRO-HG Duo HX Memory Stick MSHX8B will work properly on your Sony HDR-SR11. -Ely
The good thing is the computer does NOT have to be turned on. Once set up, this works just like a table radio. I have mine connected to my stereo system, using it as a tuner. I have the Innovator2 with the remote. But I also have the Android app for this on my Evo phone. So I can change channels and adjust the volume without getting out of my comfortable recliner. I love my grace radio and use it more than the 40" TV I bought about the same time.
I'm not 100% familiar with the starmate 3, but if will work with a remote I think the remotes are somewhat universal. I've used older remotes with newer receivers and vise versa.
All the slim line DVD are the same size. All the laptops use the same size DVD drive. So yes. You only need to be careful older computer uses a different cable type IDE, all the new ones are SATA.
I wish I could tell you for sure. In my case, I had to exchange the front plastic trim plate on the new unit with the one from my original. The drive then fit fine. You need to match up the actual part number of your original with this replacement (part number is on the white/yellow label on the drive. Hope this helps some.
U dont need software or driver just plug and play to dvr
You would need some type of video input or capture card. Example... http://www.ebay.com/bhp/pc-video-capture-card
Sorry, I cannot be sure - my HC-V201 uses the VBY-100, VBT-190 and VBT-380 if that helps.
I have not been able to select which alerts I want to receive.
i didnt even see one on there, but i wouldnt trust the batteries no matter what the date is!
yes this is a good battery thanks Paula Reising
The battery for the DM4 is an MU06 and the MU09 is a direct replacement for the MU06 (slightly different form factor, but same battery voltage and connector)
If you go to the HP web site to accessories and put in your model number, it shows that the MU09 is the replacement battery
The internal measurements of the jacket are 8 1/4" x 10" with the depth of 1/2".
I got a shoulder strap. I fully expected to get one. I like this pad cover as it allows me to carry it securely and easily. It is light weight and comfortable.
This is the model that I have, and it does work, although it is somewhat unwieldy. What I did was cut a hole in the foam padding that comes with the case (There are 3 foam inserts, and I used all 3 of them) and mount the power plug into that hole. This actually works to make the GPS easy to remove and install in the holder. If you want, I can send you a picture of it mounted.
The dimensions of this model are smaller than those of the packaging. The support is the perfect size for Nuvi 42 (12.6 x 7.8 x 1.9 cm) and is right. As I see, the Nuvi 250 (9.7 x 7.1 x 2 cm) would be very small compared with the whole package.
Headphones in bag cord red all in black box
My husband says no it cannot
Both are plastic
Yup comes with both, and the power supply isn't to clean so just get a ferrite core to snap on the end of the power supply that plugs into the xmitter and that fixes the problem right up. Cheaper and less stupider than buying a new supply :3
Yes, 3 shelves. If you need more, you can buy them here.
Yes
3 3/4" long by 2 1/4" wide, by 1 1/2" deep at the highest part.
more than 5ft.
I am not sure. Unfortunately it was not worked for me.
I bought the 50 foot roll and connected it to a LAVA antenna and to a 4 way splitter. The cable is well made and the connectors are easy to tighten. I am well satisfied with it. I don't see any issues with the 100 foot roll.
Hello Jovan, The cable isn't rated for direct burial but alot of customers have installed PVC piping and fed our cable through it. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@mediabridgeproducts.com
Hello John, Our cables would work fine tucked under aluminum siding due to the triple shielding it has. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support
No remedy it's the same as plugging in headphones the speakers will shut off you can't have both
I think the answer is 'you don't'; however, I reduced the bass controls on my laptop and the speakers work fine for an inexpensive speaker.
Yes
I have never seen a matte screen version... unfortunately, those might be a thing of the past... The higher resolution monitor will display items at a higher density and smaller physical size. Both IE and Firefox have options for zooming in and out to help with this if it is hard for you to read web sites. Windows also has a DPI option for making items larger. I typically zoom my browser in around 115-120%, but I leave the Windows DPI setting alone.
I couldn't find any. Which Surprised me. Which is why I ended up buying this.
Yes, as long as you purchase the Sigma for Nikon mount.
No...this is not a fish-eye lens. This is an ultra wide angle lens. Great for wide landscapes. If you are to close to certain objects, it can give somewhat of a distorted perspective. I have used this lens at outdoor parties, landscapes, night sky photos and sunsets, and architectural photography and love this lens.
Yes you can use this camera and lens together *The lens demands a camera with an APS-C sensor and exactly such a sensor you will find inside Nikon D90. * The camera has a sensor of type DX (1.5x). * Your focal length will be equivalent to 12-24 mm.
Only with adopter if you buy sony mount get sony adopter orkes great
The player acts like a flash drive. all you load on it via the computer, the only way to delete it is via the computer. in short, no there is no delete button on the walkman. to delete you would have to plug it in the computer and delete like you would for a document on a flash drive. The podcast you downloaded on your computer, then uploaded on your player.... you listened then plugged it in.... back in computer and delete it when done and upload more.Hope this helped.
Only with adopter if you buy sony mount get sony adopter orkes great
Sigma makes this lens for Nikon, Canon, Sony and Pentax. If you got the one made for Nikon, then it should fit all Nikon DSLR cameras. If it doesn't, either you ordered the wrong version or they sent you the wrong one.
The Sigma is an extreme wide angle, but not a fish eye. Straight lines will remain straight (almost). Autofocus works better on my D90 in bright daylight, worse in dim interiors where accuracy suffers.
The lens has a built in AF motor, so it should. Double check with Sigma to be sure. BTW, I usually focus with the distance scale for low light indoor stationary subjects. I mainly photograph real estate interiors, and find this works better than AF, especially with a DOF table.
It has that standard AF/MF switch on the side. Set to MF and you adjust the focus with the ring. It's like the other lenses I've used from Canon and others. I'm not sure what slip-ring would be, unless you mean it focuses and then you change it. I haven't tried that.

I'm not sure mainly because of the iPhone 5's power port. This will be the determining factor since the iP39 has been designed for the versions prior to the iPhone 5. I am able to plug my iPhone 4 and iPod classic into it.
You set the camera body on Bulb and you can set the amount of time the timer keeps the shutter open. 2-7-12 minutes, etc. which is the same as open continuously.
Yes it fit
If they Promaster lenses fit on a Nikon, then yes, they will mount. No autofocus.
Yes, it will charge while playing. If the battery is totally dead, a ten minute pre charge is sufficient to play a movie if it stays plugged in. By the time the movie is over, it will have a full charge.
I got it for a Pentax DA L 18-55 F/3.5-5.6 AL and it works well. I have read about other who had loose copies, but mine is not. There are other models of this lens so check if yours is the same.
The two sections collapse to about 3 1/2 feet sections, this is an estimate. It is about the same height as my stands in fact they fit inside my stands cases perfectly. They work very well and I have had them for over a year and used them many times.
yes it telescopes from 9 to 12 feet any size inbetweeen a good price for a bar i have 3
Length 3.54 In. Width 2.76 In. Height 4.21 In.
Continuous. Not very bright either. You will need additional lighting on top of what is included in this setup since it is not very bright.
Yes it will work, if the remote control slot on the dv5 is a 34mm PC Express slot.
There is wiggle room. Not sure exactly how much but my cover fits over my 32" TV with room on each side.
Not sure what the question really is. I'll assume: "What is the maximum recording time?" At the highest bitrate setting, you will chew through cards at the rate of about 27gb / hour. You also have the relay recording feature, so the two card slots in relay with 64gb cards gets you nearly 5 hours at the highest bitrate. Of course, you can always get more by trading down on the bitrate. Not sure if that was your question, though.
Absolutley, yes.though 400 yards is a long ways away, for any camera. You might end up looking at a much more expensive HDSLR with a 800 mm lens. But for video this works great, it's lens is about 500mm if I remember right. You might try getting closer. 100 to 200 yards is probably a better distance, depending on how large you want the deer to look in the frame.
it has two XLR inputs on it for you microphones or your mixer, also has mini hdmi out.
It most likely will. The best thing for you to do is pop the old one out before you purchase a new one and ensure that it has the same interface. This particular drive has an SATA connection, and SATA connections are fairly universal and work on most laptops with the same interface equally. If you are unsure what an SATA connection looks like I would suggest doing a Google image search for "sata connection." Hope this helps.
I'm sorry I cannot say if it'll work for your PC all I can say is that it works perfectly on my dell inspiron 14r
I don't know, sorry &#128542;
I would depend on what you want to connect to this tv. BlueRay, HD cable box, pS 3 etc

how can I find a web site I was on Sat Oct 6th. I went to sign in and didn't have my password. for some reason could not get back to site of third party military and biker patches. I had complied an order of about 30 patches valued at $1125.00. Can you help? I am not currently on the computer I used on Saturday. Thanks
I use it on a EOS550 and works fine.
No they do not. The more expensive bigger ones do though.
Hello The short answer is yes. Before you purchase this item make sure that you have good signal coverage of GSM 2G data. If you have coverage by T-Mobile it is preferred since their network seem to be a more stable network.
Since Panasonic use the same mount for almost every 4/3 lenses I think that will work good for you!
The wall plate is two pieces that are laid on top of each other (on the edged) and screwed together
I assume yes, but don't really know
Yes Yes, the PCI-E bus is a standard - the x1 to x16 indicates the number of lanes supported by the slot. You can get some good details from wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express To summarize for you - as long as the slot has more lanes than the card you want to install in it, it'll work. So, you can put a x1, x4, x8 or x16 card into a x16 slot. The reverse it NOT true - you cannot put an x8 card into a x1 slot, for example. Good luck!
Not sure you need to check your motherboard requirements.
I don't think so, I will have to look, but think there is just a plug for the ipod plug.
No it will blow them find a 1000 watt amp
no bluetooth. or it would be more expensive. But new phones coming out are waterproof so 3.5 jack and open phone is not bad.
This amp really doesn't use much power. I've run the smaller (200 amp 2 channel) one for 20 hours (most of a weekend) off a simple AGM deep cycle without charging it while at anchor.
No
Yea it comes with one
the amp did come with an auxillary control to adjust the gain but i didnt install it so dont know how well it works
Yes
Not good for baseboard, only hold good on drywalls
Absolutely! I even use these clips for thick power cords.
This amp is not for highs & mids. It's for lows only. (Subwoofers only). This has a lot of power.
Probably defective voice coils.
Price for one.
Yes, it'll protect against most any surge other then a direct lightning hit.
I think it does a good job both ways I have large power surges where I live and its backup works really well also.
No, this is a mono block. Single channel.
i have no clue as i am not familiar with the specs of those subs. i run my 3 kicker cvrs off it and it blasts!
Yes it works, but I do not recommend to you to buy this brand, I bought 2 DIMMS and one doesn't work, do my comments, and never heard back form them. It is better for you, if you buy Crucial or Kingston they are great quality.
Yes it works on WIN 8.1 I loaded the included software, but did not try to record. I did try the live TV which it works. I prefer Media Center, it's so much easier & I have two computer so I can copy TV programs between each.
Yes
No. It splits the signal to the from the antenna to the Genie. You still need a Genie to put a picture onto the second TV. If you want to watch the same show on the second tv, as is being shown on the tv connected to the Genie, you could use an HDMI splitter.
The terminals marked "Input" are wired to the system audio amplifier. The terminals labeled "Output" go to the speakers in your building. On my instruction sheet that came with the AE100VC device this is shown in the pictures on the first page. They state "INPUT AMPLIFIER" AND "OUTPUT SPEAKERS" with circles down to the terminals.
It will work fine, but you will need to adapt the antenna's PL-259 plug to the radio's SMA connector. There are SMA to SO239 adapters available on Amazon.
This antenna will fit any standard Motorola NMO mount, I believe this would include the Motorola flat mount you refer to.
Yes it does.... has a lot of kick for the price too.
Yes, it can be longer, as long as it's 50 ohm, if you replace the RG58 coax that comes with the antenna, you should use RG8, or RG8X. You'll have less loss with those.
Yes they do.
yes it is, the element Q has a SFX power supply and silverstone has the smallest SFX psu. For example the SFX from sea sonic is a little larger
Assuming you mean http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/P8H77I, I'll be blunt. The answer is "Yes".
it works fine on my laptop in chrome and in windows speech reconnation,iam not sure about the rest. Thanks Gary
I am a serious amateur. After comparing both lens, I concluded that the sigma is a better deal.After purchasing the Sigma I could not be happier with my purchase, it's an excellent lens for the money, I love it!
If you want to crossfire the gpu's then I would not recommend this power supply. If you are only running one gpu then this power supply would definitely suit your needs.
If you are referring to the cable you plug into the power supply that connects to the wall socket, yes it does come with that as well as a set of various other internal cables.
I've had two since purchased and I've never had any issues. Can imagine that's a monitor specific issue rather than a power issue, I'd say internal components are more likely to fail first over external if for some reason you are really stressing the PSU.
Yes
Yes.
absolutely - and hold your charger and a few other small items
Yes, it works with my macbook pro 15" with retina that I just purchased in November.
Yes, as long as the cable box has an HDMI port, this monitor will work as a TV.
I don't know for certain, but that should work. The red, piggybacked plug is the one that draws extra current, so you'd put that one on the charger.
this has a dc 3v port
I have this radio and it's great.
There is a line in Jack.. I'd imagine you can..
I have not noticed that. This may seem idiotic, but have you tried a normal setting? My vague rememberance of my naval electronic training was when stymied do the opposite of what you are doing. Good luck! H holcombe
It worked on my DCR-SR47, but I don't know about the hc28 specifically. I do know that it's the same size as a generic usb small (micro?) cord but the generic wouldn't work on my handycam and this one would.
Does a one legged duck swim in a circle?
On my office desk phone it works right out of the box. However, for my smartphone you will need the adapter to convert from 2.5mm to the 3.5mm smartphone plug. I haven't done this because I use mine strictly on my desk phone. Adapter is very inexpensive though!
Any devices used with the power strip needs to be dual voltage when used internationally. The device's charger needs to indicate 100-240V.
As mentioned by other commenters all you need is an adapter to make the strip function. But to clarify, if something you plug into the strip can't handle the higher voltages in some countries those devices would need a converter/transformer. Most modern electronics support the higher voltages (read the labeling on power adapter) but items such as hair dryers usually do not.
You would have to search Amazon, or contact the manufacturer.
No. I have the same set up. Got this for use with my laptop. Love it.
I would call it full size. But don't believe the dimensions given in Amazon's listing. They're so large it must be the size of the box and not the mouse. By my measurements it's approx. 4-3/8" long and the width varies from about 2" to about 2-3/8". We have a couple of them... one for my desktop and another for my wife's laptop.
It is not a free-spin wheel.
About 4 1/4"
Yes, it does have an on/off switch. The battery is easy to change and you will probably never want any other mouse again, just like me. It is wonderful.
I can't tell you precisely because it is based on the distance between the mount points on your TV. Mine was 400x400. Look in your owners manual. It should tell you. This mount will handle 400x400, 200x200, 200x100, and 100x100. Please be sure the solid plate (roughly 8.5"x9") centered between your mount holes on the TV won't block access to connections (component, optical, HDMI, etc.).
3 x 12.5 inches
See if this link helps. Looks like maybe the 838 has Bluetooth Music Streaming, Dark Detailer, 1 more HDMI, PerfectColor & PerfectTint. http://www.top100gadgets.com/best-gadgets/2010/mitsubishi-wd-82738-82-inch-1080p-3d-dlp-hdtv/
No picture at all? Hold down power button for 10 seconds to allow tv to reset itself or, unplug it for a few miniutes and let me know how that goes. Have you replaced the lamp recently or opened the back panel at all? if so, make sure it's back correctly. My problem was the power strip cable, now, I connect the tv directly to the wall and have no problems.
Only if the plasma TV has a headphone jack output, and it must be a small one, not the big ones that sound systems have.
Yes. They also come with a number of types of SuperTips. My favorite are the gel ones.
Yes They Will
no it has a standard 2 prong 110v plug with no ground - you might be able to split the load from the power supply though,
75w with two pins on the back see http://www.amazon.co.uk/Rocwing-220v-Modeling-Flash-3200K/dp/B007RAL3UC/ref=sr_1_fkmr2_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1415959255&sr=1-3-fkmr2&keywords=75w+modelling+bulb and similar .. they are good but very delicate when hot..
That's not a good thing and they normally don't take long more then 2 sec for me
If used for an electric stove as an extension I would not. Usually that should be a direct plug into the outlet. If its just a gas stove and you need power for the timer, clock etc. I would think it would do the trick. Of course check with an electrician first.
It comes preloaded with a marine coastal chart map. But if he is going deeper inland on the waterways he can down load an additional comprehensive Blue Chart g2 with even more detail. He will have to install an Micro SD cart of 16 gig byte to store it on. But it should serve him very well.
It's three prongs that plugs in the wall, but only two prong plugs into the charger running down to one round plug for the laptop!
I'm afraid I dont know
I am 99% sure it will work. I looked up the Avaya 4621 IP phone and it appears that the headset plug in is the same as on the headset. It is also good quality. I have had this product for over two years with no complaints.
Have no idea. Sorry.
When the device is connected to the computer, or mac, it is recognized as external disk. If you have mp3 or wma files in your mac, you can copy into it. It will not sync with itune.
No
It comes with SFP ports on it by default.
I am pretty sure that this pen does not work with the bamboo tablets. I have a bamboo tablet but bought this pen for my Intuos 4 tablet.
Depends just how heavy your component is...cabinet is sturdy but why take the chance. If it were me, I'd break down and buy a new component (which will probably give better quality besides!)
I dont think you can use it in the car
it has a separate connection to use the reed switch in installations where you do not need insteon wireless connections. So depending on your alarm, it could trigger it when the door moves to open.
You need an insteon capable hub to communicate with this device that is capable of sending email alerts. I use powerlinc usb hub with homeseer software to get alerts for this and many other isteon devices.
Yes because nothing is made of plastic except for the wire. Also wire, and magnetic leather ear pads are replaceable. You can just do a fax order for them through Bowers & Wilkins. Basically you get what you pay for compared to Bose and Beats because you are just paying for the marketing and technology, but materials used are cheap not durable.
I have no problems whatsoever
Hello, My experience with the GPSMAP 62 was not very good. The unit froze up several times during use and each time I had to restart the unit. Coworkers of mine use the GPSMAP 60 and really like it and I have heard the GPSMAP 64 is a good model. I recently purchased a Garmin Etrex 30 and I love it. I paid $200 and it's worth every penny. The new GLONASS technology in the etrex 30 is outstanding, I can be in the thickest timber canopy and still have &gt;20' accuracy. I hope this helps.
No, it does not have a USB port.
No. I purchased the Roland PSB-6U separately.
Yes it has a DAC because it has a headphone output jack. I assume the quality of the DAC is the same as the ADC used to digitize the audio to begin with. However, I have not used the phone jack.
This stereo unit is tiny. I can't imagine that this will be any problem with your install. Good luck.
YES, we have the USA-630, USA230 & USA-1 for your truck. Please let us know the year, make, model when you order. Thank you, KnA Bargains.
You will not need a new antenna if your old VW one is still in good condition.
Yes. The CD that I received did not contain what the instructions said it did. I emailed their support and after 2 email exchanges, they sent me the software that was supposed to be on the CD. This may be fixed. THe antenna worked in "dumb" mode without the software. It picked up a source and worked. The software allows you to control which network you join and what the performance characteristics are. For a MacPro, you will need one USB short extension cable to reach both USB ports. One port is used to supplement power.
Omni direction live on sailboat also works great.
Yes it will work as long as you have a cd changer on your car.
Yes ipod will work but i dont know with the ipod video. I dont think it will work with your system.
Works on iPad and iPhone Can't answer for ipod.
Yeah Buddy!
This flash works great on my Canon SLR 30D. Great product for the price. I am very happy with my purchase.
Hey Frank, i had the same smell for the first few times the lamp heated up. This Did not last more than a few days.
Trash the TV. Other options include drilling the screw holes a little larger to accommodate the old screws. You could also glue it, as you will probably not replace it again.
Pay for the higher priced one. The cheap ones only come with problems.
It's meant for connecting an external drive to your computer, both power and data transfer. What are you going to charge?
I can't assure you 100%, but it works perfectly with my 2010 MacbookPro. So I would say yes if you have a firewire port on the Mac Pro
yes
hard drive is a hard drive... it will work in a dell 310 but it might void warranty from dell..
Unfortunately, the USB is set up to access a Hard drive, not the network. There is an Ethernet port on the back that requires HARD-WIRED to a router or hub.
They're made from a hard plastic that can support my Canon 70-200mm f2.8, bust some parts are metal, like the release latches and the autofocus connections.
Did not respond to mine but also looked the same and worked right out of the package. At the cost, I took a chance and glad I did.
No
Pam, I don't believe this case will be useful for the DP-201 model, this case is relatively small and thin, try to find the right size for your recorder...Hector.
I cannot for certain answer this question as I don't own a Mac, but I have a large 17" HP and it fits comfortably. I guess you could measure...
Yes it is
The range is 25,000 sq ft, 10 acres, 6 floors of penetration in a building.
Yes 100%Compatible. I own a HS30-EXR and it works flawlessly on it. I shoot in P, A, M and EXR (SN) Mode and works very good on these modes. I also shoot with this flash Off Shoe, using radio triggers and it also works perfectly.!!!Buy it it is a great Flash unit!!
You can have it show speed (mph) instead of pace (min/lap distance). There's an option in the setup menu.
i do not know, sirius xm will not sell parts, see if amazon or crags list has exact model number off charger or a complete radio that the power adapter that works, you have to match up volts and amps or you will fry your device. i am not shouting. my eye-site likes all caps. you can run sirius xm on line with smart phone and wifi to car or sound cube
Are you guys new here? Amazon prices fluctuate more than grocery stores. Go to camelcamelcamel.com and put in the URL of whatever product, and see the fluctuations...
Hi Like, You may connect speakers from the back of the Sony Stereo Receiver. S-Air Speakers is basically for having wireless speakers setup on different locations. -Vincent
Put the CD in and press the first button on the left. Sometimes it takes a few seconds before it starts. Make sure you switch the toggle from radio to CD. It is a bit hard to read but there are only two toggle type switches. One opens the CD player the other switches from radio to CD.
20 minute or less
Yes
Yes. It's what I have in my vehicle. As long as you have the other car kit accessories.
I don't have that problem, but what I do see is that the device reboots itself sometimes, which in turn causes it to go back to its default location. Maybe this is what is happening with you?
Hi, Yes, I have iPad 1st generation 64GB and it's fit perfectly
It has no difference according to the users who used both of them :)
Not when I purchased it. I actually purchased a tablet zipper-type case for travel purposes, which it fits nice and snug into. I love this cover!! It has sustained many falls from my son w/NOOO damage. I want to purchase a couple of more to keep on hand.
The remote I have received not exactly the same as a picture. I was so disappoint.
Hi Vanessa. It is an exact replica of the original remote. It does have the NETCAST button in the center above the dial and the WIDGETS button in the center below the dial.
Yes, it will play anything that is on your ipod. Whatever you would hear through the headphones you will hear through your car's radio.
Yes it does, it comes with two different lengthed detachable cords.
the wings on the top can be adjusted simply by pulling on them. they should click 3 times when you pull it out, it does require some pressure to do so. it does lessen the pressure that they put on your head and increasing the comfort of the headphones.
don't have a mod mic 4.0 (i know what it is) but there is a big enough flat surface to stick the mod mic base/magnet/mount, and there is no mic plug, would have to use the long mod mic cable
No
Yes.
I was in the same boat, but I think they are the best bang for your buck. Had them for 2 years now, still loving them
No
We are sorry, but we do not fully understand your question. Can you please elaborate?
As long as you have a powered USB outlet you should be fine.
The sound is transmitted via standard audio cable; that will definitely fit. The power is supplied via USB cable, though, so unless your S4 has a standard USB port; no. You would have to find a way to plug it into something that would power the unit. You could plug it into your PC's USB port, and plug the sound cable into your S4, if all you want to do is play music that is on your S4 - it just won't be "mobile".
Hi Ethan, Thank you for your inquiry. We unfortunately do not carry that item. If you have any further questions, you can reply back to this email or call us at 1-888-672-4870.
going to be a little tight but yes
No, it doesn't have a built in surge protector.
Wait for the UL30JT
This is run from any USB port.
Yes you can, if Internet connection is over 5G or it depends of router data transmitting.
I'm pretty sure it doesn't open at all. I tried the same thing and just gave up after a while.
Sorry, no, works with multiple Wacom drawing tablets, not interactive tablets from other companies (unless you connected a Wacom to an iPad I guess, but I don't think that's what you meant).
Yes, the pen should work automatically. no charging, no batteries, no alternative source of power. Make sure your wacom is of the same make and model needed for this pen, and also double check the driver that's being installed on your computer to use the pen. If your package didn't come with a separate disc to install a driver, you can still do a google search to find it online. It's a free download. I hope that helps.
Yes. They point at about a 30 degree angle in one direction so when you install it, you need to position it where you want the sound to go.
the RCA connections are only for input to the amplifier it has four speaker wires coming out. if this doesn't answer your question please provide a little more detail on what your trying to do and I will try to help.s the first thing I would recommend is not buying this amplifier.
It needs to be connectecd via bluetooth. There is a USB Bluetooth Adapter included with the keyboard, so you do not need to buy a separate one.
it is compatible with iphone6.
i buy this item to upgrade my 2 TB seagate go flex to 3.0 usb. The item include ths 3.0 cable and the power cord. I am not sure if will fit yours.
Hello FolkFan! I watch movies in widescreen (16:9) format all the time without a problem. Now, keep in mind that I am using an Xbox 360 as the video source and that the Xbox does allow me to output in different formats. I would think that most dvd players you would buy today would have options for widescreen output. I hope this answers the question! -Dave
I think its like 30 days. The bulbs are crap. I ended up ordering one from Mitsubishi. They give a 90 day warranty.
I have no problem installing new lamp. It is working fine.
Unknown
Mine didn't come with keyboard & mouse, since I already had these. I don't know if this CPU can be connected to Wireless Internet
They have a .5 hard edge above the screw line so if you got the clearance get these
It doesn't come with brackets, but it does come with a trim ring that can be used in certain situations. Depending on the application, you may be able to use self tapping screws to create the 4 hole design rather than trying to use the 3 holes already in the car. If time is not critical, purchasing the speakers first and then determining if you need the separate bracket has served me well in the past.
Two
The switch itself requires AC power itself to power the ports.
Yes
Both...
This is not USB to HDMI, this is Display Port to HDMI and yes it works perfectly.
These charge units require a case you need to put the phone into, so in my case it required me to remove my Otter Box case, and then put it into the other charging case for charging overnight. That didn't work for me, too much switching back and forth so I returned it. To directly answer your question I don't think so as the charging case is too small for the 6. You might need to shop for one that says a 6 fits in it and make sure. Hope that helped. K
From what I understand the PS3 won't play 3D movies until later this year after they release a patch. Right now it only works with 3D games.
It's only $20.00, If it doesn't you are not out a lot of money.
Sorry...wish I could help....no idea
I bought it for HP DV 6000 series laptop (DV 6433cl to be exact) and it is a perfect replacement for the original battery. Well made and lasts as long as the original. Can't go wrong with the quality of this battery. Hope this comment helps.
I used it in an HP dv 6000 and it works fine.
Works fine
My HP laptop is a Pavillion dv6000. The original battery shows HSTNN-DB-31 and a sticker says replace with HP Spare 432306-001. Don't know if this helps. Call ANKER. The new ANKER battery is working great! sPARE
The outer mounting holes are 100 mm apart. The inner holes are 75 mm apart. I've used the outer holes to mount a flat screen TV. Bob
It is probably around six inches. The base is flat enough though that I can set my keyboard directly on it and it doesn't really affect the angle of the keyboard. I have a relatively small desk and it fits just fine.
The AC adaptor that came with mine is rated for 100-240VAC. So, as long as they are still supplying the same AC adaptor, the answer would be "yes."
Yes it works great for that purpose I have used it to capture Gamecube,PS2,Xbox,Wii,Dreamcast,N64PS1, and even X360 footage so it is a great piece of hardware for doing such things. The only problems it has giving me is with some of the retro consoles such as the NES,SNES,Genesis have video issues but there are work arounds for those. I hope that this helps you make your decision.
Sorry for the late reply, delivery time will be around within 3 business days for 100pcs, but I wanna say, the cable we have in stock has the female plug outside of the PVC Jacket.
Hello, Yes it's possible. Make sure that the base is well secured and tight.
yes you can easily slide that out, but depending on your monitor remember you have to disconnect the monitor wiring. i mention this because some monitors the wiring is connected inside the monitor which requires disconnecting the wiring from the computer which can be a little time consuming. The mount is a great unit I love it.
I cannot say regarding the kindle, but I bought this because I used it with my DSLR canon to connect to the nexus 7 2013 edition for filming....as an ext monitor, If you look up to see if it is the same connection via specs info you may find it just may work..
I am not sure to be honest with you what I suggest is you contact company selling the cable and ask them they should know, but if the Canon 60D is a Mini B 5 pin connection it should be fine, these cables are great!
Check to see if you have a Mini Display Port on the Surface Pro.
I don't know personally, although I have worked with this company for some time and they have sent me a replacement cable at no cost when mine went out. I'm sure if you order it and it doesn't work, they would be happy to take it back.
It's typically the settings in your tv, you likely have it programmed to shut off other attached hdmi devices when you power off your tv. Shut off the Phillips "CEC" commands (I believe they are called) in your settings and that will likely solve the problem.
I have the same problem but it's most likely the TV that's the issue. No matter what output I put it on it drops the signal while the other two tvs I have connected work completely fine
No. Your single female RCA S/PDIF output is a digital coax output. It's won't work plugged into a analog RCA input. You should have either a RCA digital coax input or a optical input on your sound bar for receiving digital audio. Alternatively, you can just plug in a pair of stereo RCA cables from the TV to the sound bar. Otherwise, you would need to use something like a SPDIF to analog converter.
No. This is RCA on both ends. You'd need a 3.5 to RCA converter at the least.
It may "function", but you'd be better off using a true co-axial cable splitter. There is a difference between ordinary audio cables [which this is] and a real co-axial cable. It may just be a matter of superior results using the correct type of cable. You won't hurt anything by trying this --- and it is so inexpensive. If you're like me, you'll find another use for it eventually if it doesn't work satisfactorily in this application.
Hi. Does this work with RGB cables? I don't no what RGB cables are, so I can't answer that. Is there a version of an F-FF s;itter that can? Can what? If you are asking if this is a femail to dual femaile yes it is, if that is what you are asking.
Yes, it works on my Nikon D3300.
I work on many desktops and laptops and in many years of doing so I have found that these Parameter Ram batteries are all the same. Only difference is that laptops use a battery with a small plug and are sealed in plastic (see pic). You could peel the plastic off, pull off the wires and use it in a desktop. Answer is yes, it will work.
Depends on what the laptop is used for. Under normal use around 4-6 hours
On the 2013 iMac you will need the thunderbolt to firewire adaptor as well as this adaptor to connect your firewire 400 device.
70 inches -- just less than 6 feet.
No
Yes
I mounted it by throwing it behind our couch on the floor. Works great.
Either you get a post or you mount antenna to wall with lag bolts through the holes in the center of antenna where to u bolt would go
No you didn't havehave cut it open - you have to undo the buckles at the top and there is a flap on top on the front side tou pull open
1333MHz If you have i7.
i think s95 is compelling if u want better pictures and control. since s95 has the bigger sensor (better pictures) and the PASM (better control). but really, the 4000 is a true P&S wif some kick-ass hardware baked in.
Image qualitly for sd4000 is good. The video is wonderful - very good in low light with a f/2.0 lens. The SD4500 had higher definition video at 1080 as opposed to 720 on the sd4000. The S95 has more manual controls. I like this camera except - no F/2.0 lens, no zooming when shooting video. My fav is the SD4000.
It should
Sorry. I'm not sure of the dimensions of the Logitech gear so I can't comment. My iPad 3 fits in the case comfortably but with no room for anything else.
I added RAM on mine - 2 gig because it only had two slots. Not sure when it maxes out, but that probably would be determined by what sort of chip it is. I'm sure you can research that online.
It's a 32 bit
Sorry, we do not have this headset to check.
If purchased from Power-O-Matic all our cordless phone batteries we ship from NY.
5 & 7/8" W, 2 & 1/2" D, 3 & 11/16" H
Your kidding right
If it is, I've never used it as such. I've only used it plugged in in my home. I bought it bc it's small and I travel a lot. GREAT sound, though, for the money. My only dissapointment is that the front cover is not metal (like the cheaper option), it's a thin fabric.
Yes it comes with an usb cable but you need to buy memory card
The cord is not detachable. As for replaceable, I'm sure someone who knows what he is doing can replace them.
I've had mine for about 2 yrs before giving them away and my friend who got them says they are still working great after another 2 yrs
I believe it will charge anything with the old 30 pin connector
The sound on the one I got today is great. No issues what so ever
I don't know that one
Sorry I don't know...BUT I have used different remotes by accident and they worked...I have 3 Samsung TVs. Wish I could be more helpful.
NOT SAME , THANKS..........................
I don't know. But I do know that although this is a quite good tripod for the money it will not replace a high quality tripod that a semi pro or pro photographer would use. In my opinion if you want to invest in additional heads you will quickly spend more than you invested in this tripod. You would be better off just buying this tripod again if damaged or you lose the head.
I've used it with a zoom lens that weighs about 4.5 pounds. I really like it.
Yes, that's what I use mine for.
Inside the case is about 4-3/4" x 3-3/4" x 1-3/8 thickness
Mine doesn't turn that far either. Works ok though.
I am not sure, but it only stands about 6-8" tall and has a tiny connector screw to join your camera/binoculars to. If I remember correctly, it was not too expensive. I suggest you try it out, if it doesn't work, you can return it, I think! Sorry, however, I hope this helped you.
I bought spacers. When you remove the old speakers and replace them with the new Kenwood speakers, make note of how much room you would need. For example, these 1.5" spacers might work for you: http://www.amazon.com/Metra-82-6900-2-Inch-Speaker-Spacer/dp/B0002BG6U0/ref=pd_sim_e_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=0481M3KTFY9ESKWVKG8V I use 1.5" spacers similar to the one I linked above, but I bought them off ebay. They work great, and these speakers sound awesome, too.
They are my back speakers for my corolla.
The Webcam has micro included, if it is supported by the OS (and it should), no problem with that :)
If its attached to a laptop and set to record, but truthfully it would be better to look for a different device for your car.
Brenda, Yes it will fit easily. The bag quality did not hold up for me as well as i would have hoped but i have a larger laptop. should work fine.
The back of the bag has a velcro band that is used to put on a rolling suitcase .
i am not sure but i have no problem with the bag, its a good buy!!
It's a case, which completely covers a laptop, with a zipper closure. It will handle a pretty good sized laptop
The camera lanyard will pass through a hole in the top flap. No lanyard on the case. It has a belt loop
This case would be too big for the elph 150 IS
Yes, you can download a driver for a Mac on the Andrea website
Mine is run through an amplifier so I cannot truthfully answer that. Maybe depends on how much power is required and how much the TV puts out. Sorry I cannot be more specific.
I do not, But this is great. I use this for micro and it is great. It is a bit bulky and slides, I do recommend this highly.
I can't say if this will work with an A100, coming on to being an 8 year old camera. I use mine with my A850 as a cable release. I do not think this can be used as a "remote"---what I think of as a remote is something that can trigger the shutter without being physically connected to the camera, such as an infrared remote. This device does not have that function. It is very good as a cable release and timer, though, and the quality surprised me very positively, considering the price.
This monopod has a 1/4" screw and most ball heads have a 3/8" thread. So you need a 1/4 to 3/8 adapter before you can use many of the common ballheads found on amazon or elsewhere 2x 1/4" Female to 3/8" Male Adapter for Tripod and Camera and Qr Plate/adapter Brass - This is what you need
well? If I knew the question maybe I could answer it. But I do Love the stick for steading my camera for still photos and some video making. My camera doesn't have the small view finder but the large one and sometimes have trouble making good photos but with the stick it is now very easy and I enjoy taking photos again. if that answers her question
Technically, yes. it has two zippers when brought together could be locked with the right lock.
Yes it does. However, the connector has to be pushed in a little hard sometimes to get it to work.
I don't know, I would call Olympus and ask them if a remote that works on an OM-D m-5 will work on your camera.
As long as the camera has a hot shoe on top it will work.
I returned this tv as the remote didn't work. But I can tell you that my opening is 14 inches and it fit there with extra space on either side. Hope that helps.
Yes. I have had mine for over two months. It holds a charge and is fresh.
I don't know. That is not the model number of our Uniden phone and I can only speak for compatibility with our phone! You may try www.uniden.com and ask.
yes it works perfectly well.
If you use a Crossover, then you'll need a crossover on the other end as well. it runs over cat6 but is not being transferred as Ethernet. On each end the pin order must match.
This extender is a way to transmit a video signal via ethernet cables. So if the source, cable box, satellite box, blu ray etc...., has a HDMI connection it should work. You would connect from the source and go out to another tv somewhere. I hope that makes sense.
In both ports. With any of the ports not connected I lose video on TV.
It seams to only work with really low resolutions only. It didn't work for me at all (purchased 2), so had to get 100' HDMIs with boosters. Price has gone down considerably on those.
Yes, that is what I bought it for. However, I have had two of them and the port broke in both of them almost instantly. I would recommend you buy something of better quality.
I have mine plugged into an acer laptop with windows 7. I have a printer and a external drive connected with no issues. You may have a defective unit. Amazon will replace this and that's what I would do. You can contact microsoft to see if any USB port limitations may exist on your computer. Hope this helps.
I don't know for certain, but probably not. I've noticed that Skype HD webcams have h.264 hardware encoding, otherwise the real-time video will use a lot of the CPU. Engadget has a review and found it uses 30-40% of a 2.5GHz Core 2 Duo.
I use sb 400 n it wrks fine
I'm not familiar with the Nikon D50.
Yes - works perfectly with my Canon 60D. Uses the standard e-TTL II technology used in Canon cameras to control flash through camera body, should work just fine with 70D.
Yes
Hi Susan, I am not certain. I works fin e with my Canon EOS 5D MK II ... Sorry I do not know more. B&H Photo can probably answer this question.
I set the flash on manual mode. Is that what you are asking, if not please clarify question.
Mini DV Md80 dimensions are 5.5 x 2 x 1 cm.
Mine didn't work in low light. I had problems and never could get it to work unless I was right there pressing the record button. Also, when I asked, I was told this was motion and light activated but mine would only work with noise and it had to be loud. Just opening a door wouldn't activate it like I had thought it would.
eadio shack or fingerhut
Yes It also programs the channels based on your zip code
First, if you are set on a 14 inch laptop like I was, this one is the deal. You can find better pricing on 15.6 inch lappys but generally they aren't as powerful. They still may meet your needs as the tendency is to overbuy. Look at the top 100 list for amazon computers
Also, can it burn double layer DVD's?
Yes
When the headphone amp worked yes, such as if my mp3 player was cranked all the way up then I could use volume on amp to increase the volume louder still. hope this helps
It's a 30-pin device. IPhone 5 uses a lightning connector, so I cannot answer because the technology is different. It may work with a 30 pin to lightning adapter, but I haven't tried.
There was a person saying it worked fine on theirs. i believe it was in the reviews shown under the product without expanding the reviews.
The answer to this questions is yes. A computer being a laptop yes, along with small electronics with organization it can hold more than just one IPad or kindle.
Compare your current battery with the picture, I had to return this as it didn't fit my model. Or call the vendor and ask. Return was simple and fast, but still....
The rule of thumb is: 45w is for MacBook Air 60w is for MacBook 13" 85W is for 15 and 17" So, just find out which your friend has. It should be relatively easy to tell. The MacBook Air is super-thin, the 13" doesn't have any speaker grilles on the sides. The 15" has speaker grilles on the sides, but they're just an inch or so wide. The 17" has 2" wide speaker grilles. Hope this helps.
You will need to leave the light on full power for a few minutes before using the dimmer
I can't show you, but I can suggest to make sure your locking is tight when attaching it to a stand, and then make sure the lever adjustment is snug. If your ring is tilting, then rule out the stand. If the lever tightener on the ring is bad, then contact Stellar. I've had no trouble with the two I have.
You plug one adapter/Cat5 cable to your network router, switch, hub or wireless accesspoint, this puts the networking signal on your AC powerline wiring. Then, somewhere else in your house, you plug another adapter into the wall, and this one's Cat5 cable goes to the remote user you want to add to the network (computer, TV, Tivo, printer, whatever).
Yes. You can verify that by looking at Comcast's website, they have a list of all routers which are supported by them. Note that there are speed ratings for routers and the wireless protocol they support. This is an older model, but thanks to Comcast's high speed internet (even at basic service), speed is not an issue.
Your camcorder uses the BN-VG114 battery, so yes, this charger will work on it.
I emailed Panasonic technical support about this before I purchased mine. They responded in less than 24 hours. The extender does not count towards the number of useable telephones. I am using six KX-TGA660 phones in conjunction with the extender.
The range increased beautifully with this.
NOT sure.... the connector (round) must be the correct size then it should work.... I used it with a camera and had to change the round connector cuz it was just a bit too big.... but it works for me.
Yes. You set the camera to bulb and then just press it once to open and once more to shut.
I am unable to view your request. If you are asking if the remote control works with the NEX 6 camera, I can only answer that it works with my A55. I believe Sony is using the same system for remote control of their cameras and, if I am correct, then that would include the NEX 6; however, I do know that to be true. Good luck with your choices.
In the left side lcd window push the middle bottom or in the body the camera
1. a small gregarious toothed whale that typically has a beaklike snout and a curved fin on the back. Dolphins have become well known for their sociable nature and high intelligence.
Yes it is.
Yes, it comes with a SATA cable which plugs into the TiVo DVR.
I would call Transcend directly. Google them for a customer service number.
I use incontrolha control 10 device ( actually 8 the controller and weather device (time and date to control dawn and dusk are default)
This pair does not. It has a volume control instead. The ones that do, say "with mic" somewhere in the title or description.
They don't have volume control, plus i would recommend getting different earbuds instead, these earbuds aren't very good
No. Mine were very basic. No volume control, just earbuds.
they do not have any in line controls if they do they will be in the description of the product
No idea. Don't buy them! They broke within a month of me owning them.
Grado
The E7 will be installed on your computer as a new sound device. Because of that, you have the option of choosing the output device for windows. If you select the E7 you will hear sound out of the headphones; if you select the default sound card, you will hear sound out of your computer speakers. Some programs give you the ability to select the output device for only that program. (Skype is an example.)
As long as you have them in the upright position (on top of your head, not around your neck) they don't move. I relax in my chair and in bed with them all the time. Hope that helped/made sense!
Yes.
The Samsung TV isn't "smart" enough to run the DVD player i.e. the TV doesn't have enough of an operating system to "mount" the driver. At least my Samsung doesn't. An inexpensive Acer 722 (netbook) which has a mini-HDMI port will play a video DVD with this drive at full 1080, but it has software drivers to decode the DVD. For me, this has been a very good and reliable DVD R/W with the Acer 722 (and as a backup for the DVD drives in other desktops).
I don't know. However it works perfectly with my Garmin 255w GPS, as advertised.
Yes
This laptop doesn't have a dedicated graphics card so its gaming functionality is very limited. It will play browser games and run low end/much older pc games but anything that would be considered real pc gaming won't even open. This was a reasonable work computer but had to be serviced 3 times in the first year and I eventually sold it. I would not recommend.
Yes, it's a great mechanical keyboard for an iMac (what I have mine connected to).
Yes it is. I run the latest version of Yosemite and the keyboard works like a champ. It is a true plug and play keyboard.
18" wide
Hi, there was a warranty but it woul cost me more to execute it than what I paid for the TV. At the end I lost my money.
It is about 3 ft long, I have it plugged in with an extension wire as my desk is deep.
The headset has the correct connector to go into the Yealink phone. You don't need any other type of adapter.
It comes with a power adapter
I have two of these holding a 55" Samsung for several years and also holding a 60" Samsung 7150. The mounts are very good and really allow you to take advantage of these really slim panels. For both however, I had to purchase different size bolts (Home Depot) as those supplied with the kit did not work with the Samsung mounting holes.
Mine has the HDMI port.
The XMP wasn't part of the name, but it's in the description, Intel XMP (Extreme Memory Profile) Support is apparently one of the features of these matched DIMM sets and must allow some custom tweaking unique to Intel control chipsets. My board was the MSI 880GM-E43 and just about everything was adjustable
Work good
If it has Bluetooth, it sure will
The Creative D200 will work out of the box with your iPhone / iPad - if your device has A2DP bluetooth connectivity. The transmitter is for devices which do not support this bluetooth profile. iPhones / iPads received A2DP support with the iPhone OS 3.0 update, so you should have no issues connecting to this speaker.
it says it is FTDI
Greetings - All OCZ Vertex series SSD's have a 3 yr. warranty, except for Vertex 4's which have 5 yrs.

They will contact you with shipping instructions, and will arrange for a replacement if it's suitable. Here's the information on their SSD warranty: http://ocz.com/consumer/support/warranty. Best of luck.
No not fit for Garmin novi 55 lm.
Yes
I have a 4S phone and the cord works fine with that phone. However, I have a 2013 Forte and it works for me. I would assume it would for you as well.
I'm sure that it would work
I had this problem or the woofer loosing the connection to the unit. Unplug the sound bar and plug back in and the unit should reset and pair, also try this with the sub woofer. For some reason this reset the connection and mine started working. I think I unplugged the woofer after the pairing and it started up. Then when they became unpaired I rebooted the sound bar. Hope this helps.
I have a through hull US sensor and it works fine in the Gulf of Mexico at all speeds and depths to 50'. Probably faster and deeper but I only go out 15 miles to 50' deep.
Yes, you can use this remote control as your TV's. It will compatible with yours. Thanks a lot.
3.6" x 1.7" x 1.7"
I think it does, but honestly the stand seems too big/bulky for the Mini. That's just my personal opinion. I love the stand for my Air, but probably too much for the Mini.
This product is for a 4/3 camera (theoretically any make). It allows you to use legacy Konica lenses on your 4/3 camera. My camera is a Lumix G5. If the Kalimar has a Konica mount you could use the adapter with a 4/3 camera. The Canon T3 however, is not a 4/3 camera.
yes
i'd say somewhere around 1/16 of an inch
Velcro will attach to it but it depends on which kind of velcro. It has to be the velcro that has a fuzzy side to it. The other type (the plastic ball tip looking kind) won't attach to it.
Yes..thats what i have Is the m1033 and it works perfectly! But it is only the cable and u will need the adapter if u want to plug it in the wall to chg
No it didn't work for me, I also had an old Kodak however it wouldnt charge nor transfer pictures etc. So I had to buy rechargeable batteries which worked for me. But I would not waste my money on this
yes, it has option
actually, if you use such as the verizon mifi you can get an antenna just for that and then put the antenna near a window, outide in the direction with the most signal etc.. The wilson booster is probably overkill.
Full size.
I would say yes because I see one in the image. The one I bought was new in box and it came with it.
Yes. Everything you need except for a memory card. I recommend a Lexar Pro 1066x or a 1000x.
In my opinion, both of them will take great portraits... you can never go wrong with any of them. Your portrait shot will just depend on what lens you have and the kind of lighting you have. They're both full frame. Only 6D has GPS, 11 focus points, Wi-fi, if you can live without those you'll be fine with 5D. By the way mine is 5D mark ii.
Yes it will! Plug in into the USB and follow the prompts.
It's a regular keyboard ... it doesn't have any features that would make it easier or harder to be used by a given age group. On the other hand, it is a full size keyboard, so all the keys are nicely spaced out and since it's not wireless the user doesn't have to worry about turning it on and off or replacing batteries.
You can only make it as fast as you type.
probably should -- it's a generic and really depends on what lens is attached --
If the HDMI port on the soundbar is an input, it should work.
It looks like it should work fine. This drive is the 2.5" form factor and your Dell has SATA drive connections.
Yes it does. This was the sole purpose for me purchasing the drive and it works great. As long as you follow the instructions on reinstalling the PS3 firmware onto the drive, you should have no issues. You'll notice a substantial speed increase for system boot and installing/running games. The capacity helps as well.
Just plug and it work
Have not tried the other 2, but I will say Shure makes really quality stuff. I used to think Sennheiser was on top of everything but they moved so much of there production outside of Europe, it has not been as good. Wish I could help you out further.
These are for entertainment. I think for transcription these would be more than overkill.
The actual mouse is about 2.2 inches in length. About the cord, tt appears to be about 2'4", when you stretch it out.
I don't see why not. It should just fit in the USB port.
It's actually controlled well. At it's widest aperture you'll see it. This is a known issue, like on the Zeiss. But it's something that can be fixed in Adobe. The lens is a good deal and worth it.
I don't own the 5D. Shot with it in the past. As far as I know, there shouldn't be any issues at all. Sigma 85mm is spot on.
The lens itself does not have any rubber gaskets to keep out water and dust. At its closest focusing distance, there is a gap between the first element and the mount where you can see the electronic chip so put the focus somewhere in the middle during storage so nothing gets inside the lens. I've personally used it in the snow and got it pretty wet(heh) but all in all it was ok when I got home. It should be fine for usage in moderately dusty places.
do not know
No headphone jack
don't know
They were included, I no longer have them, however..this is what I did. 4-wires, for single-phase 220..Green to ground, white to nuetral Buss-bar, and one each of the black wires (there are 2) to SEPARATE-sides of the breakers. (One attaches to ANY Right-breaker, the other to ANY left-breaker.) Best left to an Electrician, if you haven't any experience with house wiring. (I assume no liability.)
The specs for this amp indicate 40 watts of power for each channel....so I believe it would be within your speakers' parameter.
Distance isn't the issue. They must be on the same circuit.
Yes, this lens will work with a Nikon D5000 camera. However, it is a manual focus lens only.
Yup! Correct! Your gonna love the developed film! Great bundle price also!
4 AA batteries
Not as your only source of reception pictures. They are small and you can't adjust color or focus. Lighting is important and you can't zoom.
The video capture function of this camera is quite good. You can get high quality videos, and you can zoom in or out during the video capture (the process of zooming is quite slow, though). I recommend this camera.
2 external Antennas!! one on bottom & top if standing on provided platform.
yes there is! http://www.aliexpress.com/product-fm/330679386-7-Outdoor-waterproof-Dome-Enclosure-For-FosCam-Wireless-IP-Camera-or-similar-camear-free-shipping-cost-wholesalers.html i have been buying these from here for years,and they hold up quite well. they are actually made for Foscam FI8918W{the REAL ones},but these HooToo will fit just fine. REMEMBER! with the HooToo ip cams, YOU HAVE TO COVER THE IR LIGHTS ON THE CAMERA when putting inside of any dome,because the Ir lights will "blind" the camera at night{ir lights will reflect off the inside of the dome}. i recomend REAL Foscam FI8918W, because only the "Foscam FI8918W" has the ability to disable its nightvision,so theres no IR reflection.
No. But it works well in every other respect. And does not ask to install proprietary software!
No shipping is a standard price. Usually 3.99 or 4.99 set by amazon.
Works just fine for storing mp3 or .wav files. It can be accessed for individual playback..beyond that, no idea.
The case itself is pretty sturdy and has space for several cooling fans, which I imagine would be a must in a gaming rig. I'm not sure that the power supply will be sufficient. My build is a typical 'desktop' build, and this case has been a good choice for me.
I think so unless of course your roof leaks, hahahaha as the outdoor models are water proof. Check out their indoor models which are less expensive and will have just as good of a picture indoors.
How are you testing it? It won't work if you're using your home wifi.
There appears to be some confusion. Orders for the SCNC3606 camera with 640x480 resolution are automatically upgraded to the SCNC3706 which has the identical 640x480 resolution, faster internal processor and sharper lens, and adds H.264 video compression. To restate this again, the original and the new camera have the same resolution, but the new one is better in many ways and identical otherwise.
Yes, it plays MP3's. My biggest complaint about this stereo is that its volume is extremely low. It also will not play *.wma files.
According to the specifications listed by Dell &lt;http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/latitude-e6410/pd&gt;, the unit has EITHER a "54 mm ExpressCard" slot, OR a "Type I/II PCMCIA". As this Amazon listing is sold through multiple third parties, the exact sub-model (and thus the specific configuration) varies. I recommend that you look at the particular amazon dealer's (whichever you choose) information for the item - their listing may further specify the configuration.
yes
This is the right Cable for your camera. It is just the small end of the cable that is proprietary.. It should work for you..
What you do is put the plastic screw on the wire first then put the split rubber gasket on. Then plug the Ethernet in then screw the plastic from there. The tighter you screw it on, the more weather proof it will be.
In a building heavy area, the signal projected well into 500yds. In a clear field it will travel three times that.
I believe it will do both depending on configuration. I had planned on connecting it using a LAN but it automatically connected to the WIFI from across the parking lot and has been working ever since (almost a year).
No, you have to get your own power supply.
I have a MSI990fxa-GD80 in mine and I don't think you could fit one bigger in it.
I purchased it for my Panasonic Lumix model DMC-ZS19. I believe it should be compatible with your camera as well.
Based on the the number (AS04131) that you have provided the replacement battery you would need is number GYAM1100BP-P4
If you have a wireless G adapter, you will get no improvement from purchasing this router. You will need to upgrade both your adapter and your router to wireless N.
Depends on when you buy it. Mine had 12.2 or something like that but I have 15.x on it right now. Anything 12 and newer will work. CCP sucks in many ways but im a diehard CLI guy. Anyways it s a wonderful little router though I kind of wished I would have purchased the 2900 series instead but no biggie this gets the job done no problem at all.
It should work as long as you have an open PCI slot on your motherboard. Mine is working fine in a Dell XPS400.
I think it will work with NEX7. This microphone is designed for all NEX cameras.
yes it works on the MBA, not a great product but lasted me a couple months
The stylus pen works as your mouse when it is plugged in so as long as you can use your mouse in the program you can use the tablet
Yes it does
Yes you can...Use inputs AUX 1, AUX 2 or CD....Make sure your speakers are rated at 4ohm and between 60 to 120 watts for best sound
I think so. It has a "Record Out" set of jacks as well as speaker out jacks and a headphone jack. There is also a michrophone jack.
Dear Leonard: Unfortunately I do not have the answer to your question. However, I recommend you contact Samsung at 800-726-7864. I have called them before and they are extremely helpful. Patricia
My Golf Buddy displays in English because that is the language I choose to use. There are many more languages available. It is very easy to choose the language of your choice. It can also be used in many countries around the world and will have most of the courses available. Again a simple procedure to choose a language, country and course.
we have 6 sets of speakers in our home and we have a 6 way. I set these up by hooking 2 lefts and 2 rights together... using 1 "space"..... I guess it would depend on how you want to use them.
Yes
Yes, you can expect two outputs at the same time, as indicated by the output voltage. The voltage selector at the back of the appliance is for the correct voltage feeding, which MUST be set according to the mains input. Once the input has been set correctly, the output sockets at the front should feed out the correct voltage as labelled. Hope this helps.
I absolutely love this product! Not only have I used it to back up three laptops but it has sped them up as well. You can never back up too often! All of my photos (and I have THOUSANDS) and my music are on there and I still have well over one and a half TBs left!!! I highly recommend this product-it's a very wise decision that I do not regret one bit! Have a great day :)
Yes, but I would recommend checking to see if your model Chromebook supports Bluetooth, and going with that to save a USB port.
I own a 9NK2AM-510, so I can't say for sure that it works for yours. I don't have any problems with this cord for mine, but search by your model number and pick something that has the same in the description or name.
You need to find the model number to your seagate.......
Yes, it is a HP JE009A. I was also initially confused but based my purchase on SKU and description.
most warranty claims they lookup by serial number. as of proof of purchase your sales receipt and barcode cutout I assume will work? good luck.
I am 5' 2" and have had no issues with the size! It adjusts fine for my height. I did have some issues with the adjustment slipping throughout the day but nothing major. I used this everyday on a trip through Asia for 2.5 weeks - It was well worth it!! Much more comfortable than my other strap - less stress on my shoulders. I recommend it for traveling!
Being a male, I'm not really qualified to answer this. Bought it for my wife, however.
No little pockets. It is extremely comfortable.
It's included, with a coupon to order more!
If you know how to download songs, yes you can put them on the cards. You may also rip from cds or get music from Youtube and load on these cards to play.
Once the master device (TV) is turned off, peripheral devices will also turn off within 30 seconds and no longer consume any electricity.
I would,think so. But it may depend on whether or not you have a separate cable box or how the TV is serviced by cable. For example, my Tv is plugged into electric so if I put one of,the devices on that outlet, it,would,only turn off the TV. My cable box is plugged into a separate electric outlet so I would need a second device for that.
If your TV is receiving a video input from a video source like the Internet via an Ethernet /WiFi connection then the audio output would only be available on it's headphone socket or via a dedicated analog RCA stereo output or Digital optical or SPDIF output connection. It would not be available on other HDMI sockets which are usually all input connections on the TV. The linear analog or digital audio will have to go to the Yamaha AV inputs or audio input connections. It's mentioned in the manual . Look for the user manual on the Net.
Works fine. Haven't had any problems.
You can put a retail PSU in it rather than having to buy the Dell replacement. Mine has the 305W, but you can put in anything bigger, especially if you want to add a video card or plug in several USB powered devices.
Hi John. This computer could be a decent gaming machine if you do the following. Add a 64 bit OS to it. Then add like 8GB of ram. Now your talking! However your card with an i5 or i7. Is insane dual core processors vs quad cores for gaming will produce a lot more frames per seconds. I hope that helped and sorry for the typos.
The preamplifier has 2 parts. The first is the actual preamplifier which should go as close to the antenna as possible. The second is a power inserter which sends power to the preamp using the same cable bringing the signal in from the antenna. The power inserter can go near the TV.
Maybe try a different player.
There was a basic instructions sheet in the packaging but there isn't a lot to the device so the instructions were fairly light. Even the product site http://www.povactionvideo.com/Products/1-5/MAC10.aspx doesn't haev any instructions for the MAC-10. To switch it on hold the button down for a couple of seconds. You will know it switched on successfully because the light will flash blue every second or two. To switch it off hold the button down for 5 or 6 seconds. Once off the light will no longer flash.
Yes you can. However it is a single screw mount at the bottom of the mounting knob the also goes into your camera which has a small footprint. So if you are shooting video there is little lateral stabilization if you pan by putting pressure on your camera instead of your tripod pan/tilt arm. And it will wobble a bit because of the small footprint. I don't use mine anymore.
when you buy the monitor they provide the cable. Just follow the directions. Did you just buy the monitor and they didn't provide the cables and set up directions ?
if you have the appropriate clamps, absolutely.
We found by trying every key combo: Insert is Fn+M :)
This DVD player is a great disappointment. It does not perform as multi regions. Does not play wmv and mpg. I threw this DVD player in the trash after a month of purchase.
Where are you being asked for the code? Did you by any chance check that you were paying with a gift card as method of payment?
NO
No. It is not a video encoder or storage device. The device uses the lower drives to simultaneously burn duplicate copies of the disc inserted into the topmost drive, which it does it very well I might add.
You can use any I pod that have the the 30 pin plug or you can use the 3.5 mm jack that come with the unit to play but not charge
No... Just bare wire.
That's the device I am currently using it on
Yes.
Yes. It should be compatible. This memory has worked great for me and the price was terrific!
I think it may depend of the computer motherboards specifications, but generally speaking, If using windows XP 32 bit you can access a maximum of 4GB of Ram. This should work unless the Motherboard specs say differently.
http://www8.hp.com/h20195/v2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=c04110960
It is 8gb ram and 1tb hdd. I am not sure where the other info came from
I am not sure if you are asking about the cable or the camera. The camera I have is Sony Cybershot DSC-H55. The cable I bought to connect from the camera to the USB port on the computer is the one listed. The camera end of the cable is proprietary and the computer end is USB. The cable works fine with my camera and the camera is automatically recognized as an external drive by Window 7. I hope that answers your question.
yep. Don"t know if it is normal or not but thats about all I get
All I know is: We live in Israel and my daughter got one purchased in the US as a gift. Thing stopped working and NO ONE in Israel will touch it. Further: The Cowon site is one of those maddening ones where they are hiding somewhere: They don't reveal any brick-and-mortal locale, and you have to REGISTER in order to submit a service query. This sucks, I repeat sucks, should be illegal. There is a word for any product whose site is such: evil.
go on line to lorex company and ask I am going to have to replace my rechargeable battery for my monitor have been too busy to go and ask for it but will need it for the winter months maybe that is what is wrong with yours.
no need to activate, just follow step by step of the instruction until finished and then it should be work as is stated.
Should be ok. I have recorded vinyl to PC. Most important is the audio software capabilities
No you can run the PCs directly to the ethernet switch and plug the access point into an open port configure it and you're all set.
The only thing that the USB port is used for is power, all programming is done through the Enet port or wifi so I do not believe it will work for this application.
No. There is no SIM card slot in the DAP-1350 router.
It's slightly larger in all ways and more robust.
Yes
Sure does.
works for my W80; don't know about wx80.
according to the UK website (ww.panasonic.co.uk) below, this sd600 camcorder is 50p "1080/50p recording (Full-HD, 1920 x 1080, 50 progressive recording) conveys about twice the information of 1080i (interlace) recording to produce the ultimate beauty in image quality, exceeding even conventional Full-HD images. It minimises afterimages and moir patterns caused by subject motion and renders crisp, detailed images. 64GB SDXC Card can record approximately 27 hours and 30 minutes of 1920 x 1080i high-definition video in HE mode and approximately 5 hours and 20 minutes of 1920 x 1080p full high-definition video in 1080/50p mode"
Hello, I am the Buyer for this product. The SD600 is a US model, though it does have limited distribution. You are correct that it is distributed more prominently in other countries. Some have indicated in the product reviews that it may be PAL, which it is not; this model is NTSC, which is the US standard. Hope that helps.
Yes. No issues on Linux.
You have to have an a-mount lens. With this adaptor, practically, you need to do MF (because so slow and only works for SAM lens) but appature can be controlled from the a3000. If you intend to use for quick moving subjects, it is not good at all.
Yes. It retains all of the contacts necessary to do so. Great item! Once obtained, there's no Sony lens you can't use.
No, when you plug in an external mic the external mic overrides the built in microphones
May be yes.but not 100% sure.
I believe the price is per mount. The listing is for the same item is a clearer on some other site.
I use this for two Canon Speedlite 580EX II. If the Canon website says they use the same canon battery pack (which I believe it may) thenthis should work for yours as well.
I have a Macbook Pro. Im sure it will work with a Macbook Air. I've had this since November and its a very good product :)
Do not know
Would work probably for a small softbox but would not try it for a medium to large softbox as it is primarily for lighting backdrops or a fill light.
HD720P DVR
I have a really big house - it's wooden frame but I use it well from basement to my son's room in the roof which is 4 floors above. I'm actually surprised how good these things are
By adapters if you mean a AC power transformer...no. But I'm been running mine on batteries for 6 months and it still going strong.
need more information on how you are hooking it up.. Then I can tell you if it will work or not ..
The size should be right, assuming your phone has a standard 3.5mm small headphone headphone plug. Further to this my advice would be to spend a little extra and get a plug that's going to last. Mine was loose within a couple of weeks.
Does that TV have a 6.35mm port for headphones? If yes, are you using headphones with a 3.5mm male end? If yes, then sure.
Dont buy it its bad
It allows you to plug a large stereo jack (such as is used on large headphones) into the audio output jack on a computer or smartphone. It works fine.
The power supply for units sold in the USA is AC 120 V, 60 Hz. I understand there is a model for foreign countries that has a 240 V power supply.
You need to use an external microphone connected through the jack on top of pen to get better quality recording in large lecture halls
This pen will not directly help your memory. However, it will let you write down notes with a voice recording of the person talking (yourself or someone else). If you go back to the notes, you can tap them with the pen and hear what was being said when you wrote down the note. You could use this as a tool to remind yourself of things or to hear again something that was said that you need to remember. For example, you could use it and record a what was said at a doctors appointment.
I would say yes, spelling doesn't matter as he could go back and listen. I have horrible spelling also :-), go to livescribe.com there are pencast that you can see how it works.
I would call Livescribe tech support. They may be able to walk you through some trouble shooting steps. If it's still under warranty, they'll replace it. One of mine was defective and they replaced it for free. They even paid for return shipping on the pen that went bad.
Yes. See the manual here http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c02244589.pdf
No, I don't have any dead pixels either. I have no way of knowing if that's typical, or I got lucky.
Probably but not sure
Yes
Actually, I put it in an attic. I would definitely think twice if I was putting it in my mouth. Sorry I can't help you on this one.
Yes
Dear Sir / Madam, Yes we can. You will have to provide all the information. We offer free delivery to Canada with international sign for service if you place order with amazon.ca. (this for you information) Customer care
its a USB unit - thats all
They didn't work, right out of the box. I returned them. They're crap.
Yes, it is. I use it on my work PC which is currently using windows 8.1 OS
I ordered and received the VPC-CG20 even though the image on the box was black instead of red. The red one was the one advertised.
This item will not work with a viewsonic projector. The projector only displays 3d in frame sequential format, while this adapter only sends out in checker board format. There are currently 2 adapters that will work. The Vip theater adapter or the Optoma 3d-xl. The Vip adapter does not even require your projector (or TV) to be 3d capable to display 3d content, they only need to be 60 or 120 hz. Unfortunately both are very pricey around $500 a piece.
I have Etymotic ear plugs for use at concerts and they fit/sound the same with no music playing but I'm unsure of the measurement you're using.
I'd say YES , if you are in a band. Personally , I think mc5 is good enough for monitoring just like as er4s or p . Just there is a little tiny difference.
It appears that the Writing speed is about 5.60 MByte/s and the reading Speed is about 7.37 MByte/s. This is based on some of the tests I was able to run on my PNY Attache III 16 GB USB 2.0.
- one on the side - one at the top - one at the back - one at the front I added 1 extra fan at the top since there is an opening spot, I use this one http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002LE8BJA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Hope this helps
Yes. I use that exact combo.
the docking station has a dvi connector, you can connect a cable dvi to hdmi and obtains a high resolution image
Hi Shamillia , Yes the bag is fit to all 15.6 Laptops.
Hi, Though I have not seen or heard the klipsch, I can tell u a little about the Onkyo. I bought one a month ago. Unlike the HD 1000, this came with a receiver which had more inputs than u need. This is THX certified, has auto calibration, Zone 2 and much more. I researched for a year and a half b4 I made the purchase trough Amazon. There is newer model out with networking and USB support. Good luck
The case slides back It's a little hard to slide
Yes, you should be just fine. Just dont format your usb, or else all of your data will be wiped. Your mac should be able to use the usb just as fine as windows would
It appears that the Writing speed is about 5.60 MByte/s and the reading Speed is about 7.37 MByte/s. This is based on some of the tests I was able to run on my PNY Attache III 16 GB USB 2.0.
It is rechargeable. A charging device is included.
It worked fine but I am not sure if it does text to talk.
Not sure. It fits my Droid mini with some room to spare.
it will not be able to work natively with this camera.. you will require an adapter or conversion mount.. this is sometimes a bit tricky and can be troublesome.. you can look along the lines of the metabones speed booster as i've heard they are pretty reliable in this..
Yes
Yes it can be used on sl1 camera
Hi Samuel, Sony TMRBR100 3D Transmitter is compatible on this TV. -Vincent
It works with any of them as long as they aren't the new lightening USB port, but it has headphone jack capabilities too.
It can be removed an taken anyplace that sells watch batteries. If you remove it from the casing and put the number in you may be able to get it off amazon
It has the 30 pin connector, so I doubt it will. You could get an adaptor and it is a very handy machine to have around. I use mine at my small gym it works great.
No. It doesn't have the right connection.
On The Seagate Share page, you have to navigate to the folder that contains the photos you want to see, and then just double click on them.
This drive is not intended for USB connection. It connects to a router via an Ethernet port. It has a USB port for connecting a USB memory.
It's got plenty of volume.
Don, I have. and yes it does work. the device is actually running an embedded version of linux. it is running arch. with the right searching you can actually find out how to ssh into it and do what you want for running apps. I have gotten into mine, no large modifications as the device is my primary backup at the moment. the device is really just running SAMBA to give network access to the storage. I hope this helps if your still wondering. :)
Are you asking about the actual hard drive inside the storage module? According to the Seagate forums while it is designed to be a "no user serviceable parts inside" component, it is technically possible to crack open the module and put in a new hard disk, but not recommended unless you REALLY know what you are doing. As for swapping out the storage module itself with a new one from the same model GoFlex, that's easy. Just pop the old one off and put a new one in.
Actually it fits better. I bought two. One for me (MacBook pro with DVD drive) and the other for a friend (no DVD accessory) and he actually had the problem most other reviewers had about it sliding off and I didnt. Mine doesn't have dust between the case and the actual mac also I've had it for a month so I'd say my experience with this case is valid
Yes just checked my model number. I have the MBP 13" with DVD/CD drive.
Yep!
Yes
No ps3 uses blu ray. You need the ps3 version for thar
Since they have not yet released a remote for the XB1...no. However i have read that Logitech Harmony remotes have been updated to include XB1
I'm afraid I don't fully understand your question. This remote can be programmed for many things, including your TV. I am not sure what you mean exactly by "programming for TV Channels".
I am not sure, but I believe if you can plug in a USB port it should work. But I am not 100% sure.
Seems like this could work well in a bathroom. However, the lighting feature wouldn't serve much a purpose.
No fingerprints. No scuff marks so far. We all use our phones like crazy. Although we do store them in pockets and purses. It's not like they come in contact with sharp objects, maybe keys and key chains. Still looks new after 6 months or more.
I pre-ordered it and I received mine today. I love it! Works great with iPhone 4 :)
Well, although I use my printer is not too much, I used to use a certain air pressure and with a clean dry cloth to the most sensitive areas. To date I have not had any problem, except when the ink is consumed, when copies out there with little tone and replace the cartridge.
It's a 7mm and works as good as a 9.5mm. Have it in my 2013 macbook pro.
Thank you for your interest in our bundle! This lens set up will work with your Nikon D60. However, this is a manual focus lens only and will only operate in manual mode (M). It does not have any AF or VR capabilities. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact our sales department at 800-991-3350 EST. We thank you for your time and consideration!
26.5" to 31"
Yes, they fit into the eyelids and yes, it has a quick disconnect that gets the strap out of the way, but leaves about 4-5" still connected to the camera. The male end of the quick disconnect, shown by itself in the picture, (not clipped in) is what would be left on the camera when the strap in disconnected.
I don't think so without upgrading the system.
Download Microsoft Activesync
Not sure..Since it's a Windows OS i don't see why not...
one (1)
experienced a 4 hour battery life. So. you can watch a 2-3 hour movie. Mine did come with a wall charger.
They fit everything with a 3.5mm headphone jack.
they do not have any in line controls if they do they will be in the description of the product
it could be loud enough most likely, but it is just a voice amplifier and it has a tinny sound. it works well speaking as what we got it for but not sure you would be happy singing through it
Sorry, I no longer use this adapter.
Sorry, can't help you. I no longer use this device
Yes they are strong I have cables box DVD box and Internet box on them
I wouldn't know
I used this to hang my 40" RCA Flat screen and it comes with so many adapters for different sizes for adapting to all TVs.....I would be really surprised if it didn't work....was easy to install....Hope this helps
Yes
These work on the old iPhone earphones. If your have the "EarPods", they won't fit.
I believe it's compatible with the Bluetooth headset you mention. If the adapter is bluetooth and your headset is bluetooth, I imagine it must work because they're both bluetooth. Try it out and see what happens.
I have only used it for a kindle fire and a ipod sorry
NO, it's not, in the sense that you need to open the lid, flip the lp on the device, lift the cue and position it on the track you wish to listen to. Automatic is the return of the cue when reaches the end of the last track.
No
Should work with all ipod and iphone's that have the 30-pin charging cable, I've used it with my iPhone 3GS and iPod Nano.
These eartips fit on most earphones, they will fit on mils davis truimph
I got the assortment so I could try various sizes as well as gel vs. foam, so I can confirm that the white ones pictured are what Monster considers "small".
I looked up the shape of the Unique Melody 3DD, and I would assess that the tips would fit. Essentially, they are very densely molded foam tips that conform to shape. They slip fit over the post of the in-ear type speakers, creating a snug fit when inserted into the outer ear. The center hole in the foam tips measure approximately 1/16th" (varies by tip size)
I do not know away to check battery life , 5-6 hrs of steady playing with full charge has been the average .
Yes, Optical audio from TV (out) to Sound Bar (in) is available. You might get more info if you can obtain the Owner's Manual (or equivalent) on-line at the Panasonic, http://service.us.panasonic.com/OPERMANPDF/SCHTB70.PDF. This link isn't the correct manual, but it does show the optical terminal connections.
No, it is a converter for newer iOS devices to recharge using cables with the older iPod cable which did not use the same pin out connections for power. It also has an optional input for power from a USB source.
Yes. Not the sturdiest stands in the world, but they're solid.
Well I hold a monolight and a large octabox with no problems.
It's strong enough. But if you are putting it up and taking it back down a lot it won't last long
There designed to do that. So light no need for wheels if you are using them for lighting.
Yes
No. You just go to readybroadband.com and activate your account and buy airtime. The first time around I had to call up customer service to set up my account. It is not cheap internet (around 25$ for 350mb of internet) but it works everywhere there is cell phone service.
I don't know
When I bought mine last August I returned it, but the replacement is fine after a year.
Thank you for your time. If the order is required by 10/19 then we would have to suggest utilizing the Expedited service.
You need to open up and find the exact number on the back of your screen.
It should work without any problems.
I don't know if it'll fit your Acer. The best thing to do is look for either the model number or FRU number of the screen itself to order the correct screen. This would require removing the screen from the laptop. Good luck
when i order screens i order the exact number that is on the screen that is bad. and usually recieve the same screen, some lcd screen companies will send you replacements, but i pretty sure that i got the exact thing that i ordered on this model sony..dont order from model number...pull the screen
Yes
If you look on the bottom of your mac there should be some numbers there that will tell you your model number. I had the same issue. If you have the unibody this display should be fine.
We checked it for you. This item will not work in XPS model.
Nope, tried it, didnt work. :-(
I do not believe that it is compatible. If I am not mistaken, the connector is slightly different.
No, it's an APS-C crop sensor. (1:1.5 crop ratio)
Yes. Ring controls aperture on both newer G lens and my older AI lenses. Takes some getting used to. You'll have no f stop data displayed anywhere.
What's TiVo
I assume that UN55C7000WFXZA is a model of a TV. If you already own this TV, just look to see whether it has DVI type inputs. If it does, this connector will work with it. If you don't already own the TV, you can look it up on the manufacterers website, and look at what types of input jacks it has. As far as I know, most TV come with DVI jacks on them so people can connect older models of VCR's and DVD/Blu Ray players up to their TV.
The aplicaron incluyes let you crearte your own desing. I use a $20 design progrsm, save it snd then open it on the lightscribe applicstion.BUTthe more complicsted the design the longer will get to print. I did one that took half an hour to print. Yet is much better than a label. Exito
Mine is the same toshiba as original. I don't remember how my new one ran 3 yrs ago, but this lasts as long as I would expect a new one.
I bought this as a replacement for an HP Laptop it worked great. To be sure though if you google search " is (type of charger) compatible with ( type of computer )" you should be able to get a more specific answer. I am sorry I could not be more help
Gen 1
Yes it works perfectly fine.
No, the IPad Air has a lightening charger. Try this? http://www.amazon.com/Cellet-Licensed-Lightning-Coiled-Charger/dp/B00BTF5EHY/ref=sr_1_3?s=wireless&ie=UTF8&qid=1398801070&sr=1-3&keywords=ipad+air+car+charger+apple+certified
Yes
I have my bar connected to my television through an optical cable. It gets all of the sound from all of my devices connected to my television.
Does your receiver have an "optical" output? If it does, try hooking that to the Soundbar. Have an HDMI and an Optical hooked up and they both work fine . . . . .
I recently charged my iPad 3 and an iPhone 5 in an airport using the USB ports. But your mileage may vary.
I haven't noticed a wattage rating on the fixtures. 1000w is the high estimate of the tungsten equivalent of those 5 CFL's. The dual diffusers do cut the light output somewhat, but four of these units have been working for me for a couple of years. I suppose if you're a good electrician, you could change the fixtures. Sometimes, if I have a high white ceiling, I leave the softbox off of one of them, and just put it up high, pointed at the ceiling. I then use the others normally.
It mounts on a standard 5/8" stud on a light stand.
I received them with a complete set .. u should contact the saler
It takes v-mount batteries. These can be a bit expensive. What I do is use a UPS. I was able to get a couple of free ones, and they last for 2-3 hours powering this light.
This works with my vivint panel; however I believe they have released a newer version of the panel and I am not sure it will work with it. I did have an initial problem as Vivint programmed it as a wired sensor rather than a wireless when they added it, but after the tech found that it has worked like a charm.
I don't know - Check with its manufacture. I know for sure it works with 2GIG security system. Regards
We currently carry two NAXA 9 INCH LCD Televisions, model NTD-9001 and model NT-9567. Model NT-9567 is currently out of stock but both units can easily connect to your cable provider's box.
HP marked all over no reference to anything 3com.
Yes the JE007A#ABA is a 24 PORT-POE switch 365 watts
Yes, it comes on a MicroSD card, therefore make sure your Garmin has a MircoSD slot.
AAA-NiMh when I can find them, prefer lithium.
Yeah it works with mine. Exarcly what i used it for
I did. It worked for me. I have an older jbl sub and nit works nicely
FEET
These speaker cables are available in 10 feet length, you can put this code B00BI7VGU2 in Amazon search to get the detail page.
yes,pictures can be added on the 2 sides of the sheet.Color of the Background is Black though.
10 sleeves per package. And even though it says sold in twos the price is for only one package. I got these and they are really good quality. Definitely worth it.
Does not come with anything but motion sensor. Must connect wirelessly to key pad and panel. This item works with an existing alarm system only.
I don't see why it wouldn't work. U can put any sim in there and it shoots the signal out. BUT BEWARE I BOUGHT THIS AND IT ONLY WORKED FOR 30 days then stopped working . I emailed the company a bunch of times and they never replied.
Yes, I have just that, connected to it. It's a western digital.
Probably, but not salt-proof. Just be sure to rinse it in fresh water soon after snorkelling. Then dry it well.
Fits ferfect, and you dont need anything
This is a Solid monopod, for a big person, I'm 6'4. That being said, it's about 21" so depending on the backpack, it might fit. Camera backpacks are usualy smaller so you might have some trouble there. It comes with it's own case. Hope this helps.
Yes, that's the original that my laptop came with and it works.
It fits the adaptor but the output is to strong for a iBook g3 it will end up putting to much power to your battery which could dangerous! The best thing to do is look up iBook 3G adaptor
Yes but they don't last long
Excelente producto, no se presento ningun inconveniente con respecto a la entrega del producto.
That I cannot say, however it works perfectly for my 4510 s. If the port is the same then this will work for you.
I have never been able to use this battery, it was a waste of my money. They say it will fit the acer aspire, but it did not. It left me with only being able to use my laptop while its plugged in. They never responded to my questions and I was not able to return the battery.
Yes
Yes it will work on the Lenovo V570 laptop. The difference in output is less than a volt which is negligible
To be honest i am not even sure what that is, but it does work very well to an acer laptop. Sorry this wasn't very much help.
Does not work period! Does not hold a charge for mare than 45 minutes. Do not spend your money on this battery from this seller!!!'
I don't remember. Sorry. I no longer have the laptop so I can't even look to see
There is a roomy front pocket that would probably fit both. I have the smaller tablet and just put it in to see fit. There was quite a bit of space around it.
Yes.
U have to put ur phone on speaker once u answer and talk through it, it doesn't come through car speakers, not mine anyway.
Don't know if the NP FV70 batteries work. We used NPF550. Sorry that I can't be of more help.
The Neewer 160s have more LEDs and are slightly brighter. The Z96 is slightly better designed and more compact, but if all you're concerned with is volume of light, go for the Neewer. I have 3 of those and one of the Z96s for just that reason. Not sure about battery life, but they both seem to last roughly the same amount.
I use this with an Android tablet. I believe mine runs 2.2 as well, and I didn't need to install any drivers. If you don't have a full sized USB port into which you can plug the receiver, you'll need to get a host cable from eBay. Just do a search using the name of your tablet and the word "host cable" to see what is available. Good luck!
yes, and as a user , it works perfectly great!!
have not use it for nokia but it definitely work for asus transformer and acer . I tried microsoft rt, it does not work. Hope this help.
Yes, it fits my Inspiron 1545 perfectly. Sorry but I don't know the answers for the other questions.
It's a player with no internet connection.
Hi, no it doesn't.
It works with almost every lnb and dishes. It should work without problem.
hello. i got the small one and i even added the softbox attachment....but i wish i had the larger one because then id have a larger softbox possibility. i really like and enjoy using my small one though. good luck deciding....then enjoy for holidays.
It is not easy to re-orient the Flashbender from landscape to portrait mode on the flash unit because it held on by an elastic strap with a Velcro fastener. I am not sure this is a bit issue if you are using the Small version of Flashbender with its optional diffuser overlay. The diffuser overlay has a lid that folds over and has button snaps to hold it in place . In addition it has silver reflection material so that the flash unit light is bounced down onto the Flashbender and forward.
The lights are great. It does not come with the batteries. You need to purchase v-mount batteries or if you use np-f serie batteries there is an adaptor for it that costs around $230.
Yes it does.
Metal
It is about 5" x 14" x 8" (Including the handle).
No. It's 110 volt.
Yes
Mine was packaged wrong and when I called customer service they looked at the actual part number it was still wrong. I ordered the Seagull model and that worked great. I have a Sony A65.
Had the same question. According to a review on this page, the answer is yes. http://www.vizio.com/vbr220.html
Yes, the bound edge is the 8.5" side and opens to be 22" from left to right. Pages are inserted from the top of the 11" side. Definitely a landscape portfolio not portrait.
It doesn't make a different Sony Memory Stick of any capacity should work in your Sony Cybershot Camera.
I Couldnt tell about filters, but what I can tell you is that is a headache to keep de lens cap in place while using this hood...
No it is not.
No it only fits a 52MM lens. Remember these attach to the threads of at the end of the lens. A 10mm difference is oversized for your application. Some of these are listed by manufacturer also. So try looking up the correct lens that way.
If the lens size matches it should screw onto the front of the lens like a filter. I don't recommend this product. My images came out blurry.
Made in China.
Mine turns off when I click it flat. Could be that yours is defective?
you must have the factory satellite radio harness. Check your radio for a sat button or ptty button if not get the pa15-niss. When its all hooked up its fantastic
Yes, it will.
Yes. This is the Right piece
This looks like the correct cable: http://www.amazon.com/UpBright%C2%AE-Adapter-S201HLbd-Widescreen-Monitor/dp/B00AI13SWS
as soon as the unir is hungo nth e door knob, give it 15 to 20 seconds, and any movement will sound either the loud alarm or chiming of the bell. put it on the inside or out, and movement will set it off
I think it would take more movement than that. The unit has to be moved around alittle.
Excellent product. Delivery fast. Highly recommend seller.
Yes it will it did mine very good
Images are transferred Excellent quality
Unfortunately I am not sure. It all depends on whether the small end matches what your camera has. I am sorry I could not be of more assistance.
It means it is a used or refurbished battery. Service Battery comes up when your battery has lost at least 1000mah. I suggest downloading a battery check (like Coconut Battery) to check how many times the battery has been charged previously. I had the same issue from multiple sellers on Amazon!
Don't buy it mine exploded
I just contacted Asus myself and they said that the "Asus 360" warranty is 2 years on all laptops. This means either 1) Amazon is misinformed or made a misprint, or 2) Amazon is falsely advertising by claiming this comes with Asus 360 warranty when it doesn't.
No, but this wasn't a deal breaker for me.
My unit just arrived a couple days ago and I am unable to play video using Windows Media Center as well. I tried downloading the "latest" video drivers from Asus, which were months old - even more outdated than what was already installed! "Updating" (downdating?) the video drivers did nothing to improve the problem. The video files play perfectly on the PC using Windows Media Player; but not Windows Media Center. I get audio and a motionless garbled or black picture only.
Not through Amazon.com - you have to go through squaretrade.com
PURCHASE WAS A BUST BECAUSE THE COMPUTER DID NOT work when initially plugged in. It was returned for a refund.
It comes with HD+ (1600 x 900) screen with 6 cell battery (good life). I will install MS Office 2007 Pro free of a charge.
It has just one
a: It is stereo as much as two speakers 4" apart can be stereo. It does have great sound though. b: there is no watts listing on the speaker however the output is more than adequate for portable speaker. c: Yes it is compatible with laptops that is why it comes with a USB transmitter. F.Y.I. it plays excellently on Bluetooth from an android or iPhone.
Yes, it would, as long as you don't need it too loud
To my knowledge, based upon reading the literature, the answer is no. This seems to be constructed as a disposable item. I've had my current headset for about the same length of time -- it's held together with tape and very gentle handling, and I always keep it plugged in.
Sort of. Silver painted buttons don't work except for power off. The black music volume/prev/next controls at the top do work.
It's not built in as in same unit ... but the receiver is needed for both and is tied only to the units in that package so it won't work on other ones
*bump* I was wondering this exact same question! Please, if someone knows, share your wisdom.
Yes it will work with a Samsung Smart TV. In fact I have Samsung Smart TV and it works perfectly. You use the same unifying USB transmitter that you would use on the computer. Just plug it into the USB port on the TV and it recognizes the USB transmitter automatically.
I have not experienced that. I have seen that in the past with older PCs/laptops where the system was so bogged down that typing and mouse movements were delayed. I'm typing with it now and everything is "live" and in synch.
if the sleeve were then, then yes. though it would stick out like an 1inch or 2. mines a 15.6" and it fits perfectly. great investment for school and laptop!!(i carry 3 thick books with laptop and looks then)
yeah there's a pouch, so when you open it you slide your laptop in the back pouch then put your notebooks and other stuff in the front
Yes, *if* you buy the apple 30-pin to Lightening adaptor.
You can plug it in and the keyboard stays lit, or unplug the keyboard and have the light shut off 3 seconds after your hands pull away. I've used this keyboard for years. I don't find it distracting at all. The illumination is fairly gentle, so it's not at all jarring when the light goes out.
Quality antennae. If you have a 120 household outlet in the attic, just buy a small 50watt power converter to convert 120v to 12v. Very safe.
It comes as a complete new installation kit, from cables to booster,& yes a base is included. It is the same as you would get from a R.V. dealer. We get all the local channels in standard definition as well as digital channels. Installation is quite forward, just follow instructions. I had no problems installing new unit, my old interior cables were in good shape so didn't bother fishing new cables, but did install new booster.
Yes The Are Very Badly Made. Sometim If You Twist Or Spin The Plug It Will Make Contract. It Won't Work Very Long If You Plug The 1/8 Plug In More Than A Few Times
Yes, Amazon is an authorized dealer of Klipsch products. I have personally used the warranty for other products I have purchased here.
They are very well balanced. Bass is good without being muddy or overwhelming. The only drawback I've had is the cord is a little thin so you have to exercise caution with it
Definitely worked with my 4s and the remotes for iOS are all standard so it should work.
Yes
yes
no
you will need a s video cord and and 2 (two) DVI male to male cable and a couple of A/V cords
I took a 15 mm drive out of a Seagate 1 Tb external drive and put it in this housing. You should be good.
Yes It does, this enclosure is for 12.5 mm 2.5" hard drive height.
Call Headsets.com They are the go to people for the Office Runner!!!
The encryption is provided by the router the hub is attached to, in my case it is WPA2.
You can, but it well not take you through the streets. It only takes you the way the crow flies
Thank you to contacting us, this is specifications: Speed Processor: 2.66 GHz Memory Installed: 4 GB DDR3 SDRAM HDD: 320 GB HDD
comes with. it just disconnects at the top instead of at the bottom.
hey ray im matt and i have the same cam. so on the back of the cam you will see two tumblers look like micro mini light switches well with a safety pin you can flip the switches up,up-down,down or 1 up 1 down or well you get the picture. well ray thats how you will change cam channel. hope i was some kind of help and you enjoy this new year. mateo
Ours arrived as shown.
About 330 feet. (3.3feet/meter)
Yes you can. The frequency has nothing to do with the multiple cameras.
The short answer is yes, but some assumptions have to be made. Your compressor is probably in a 3 ton unit, which means that the motor will start and run with a 40MFD capacitor. And the capacitor mounting is a simple loop strap. There are ways of testing your old capacitor, which you might want to do if you are trouble shooting and are not sure if the capacitor is bad. On the other hand, if you replace the capacitor and symptoms do not change, you now have a spare.
The zBoost ZB545 is compatible with 850 and 1900 MHz frequency bands. Unfortunately, these frequencies are typically only used within the Americas and not in the rest of the world, which use the 900 and 1800 MHz frequency bands.
No, I believe it is only water resistant. I have mine outside under the awning of my roof and it has done fine with the rain. Although, I would not leave it exposed to full on pouring rain.
that depends on what software you use, the software that comes with it opens in a web browser, you could open two browser windows, resize them to fit on the screen side by side and accomplish what you are trying to do. I use a software called central management system, made by Easyn I believe, since this is a copy of a Easyn camera it works and you can do a 4 camera 8, camera or 16 camera view, http://www.easynp.com/DLInnerShow.aspx?id=60#.UlNzxVCRBOw
I have had no sound problems, but I connected a separate set of speakers to the TV.
You can connect to the internet using wireless access. This will allow you to receive Netflix, Hulu and other movie providers. The set doesn't have to be next to the router, just within wireless range. I have my set three rooms from my router.
Just checked the manual and the answer is yes.
Yes ours does that sometimes but if we turn it off then on again its fine. I don't know why it does it though
Yes. I used it for that.
Rokinon makes the similar lens for DX (cropped camera). If you use this with the D3200 you will get a 1.5X crop or basically a 21mm lens. If that's wide enough for your needs then it works. Otherwise look at their 10mm (I believe) for DX (cropped) sensors.
It should work with any full frame as long as you buy the one with Nikon mount.
There is a Nikon version. It's a very good lens if you don't mind all manual.
When I ordered, I thought it was going to be a black cover based on the picture they give you... However, it came brown. It's a dark brown, but deffinetly more brown than black. They may have black cover ones out there, but I'm not sure... I haven't seen one. -Blue Skys!
not in the US; they do not meet TSO standards.
You will have to check with Rokinon to see if they make this lens with a Pentax mount.
...if Pentax Kr works with a normal mount lens...yes.
Sorry, no clue. I tested it on Canon 6D.
Is that. Odell a Samsung flat screen tv.
I believe it is inside the battery compartment.
NO. You have to run the wires to the unit.
Yes, I have the LD22 and it works great. It fits perfectly on the end and does not fall off. very happy with it.
Yes. I have to say I'm disappointed with this camera. Should have kept my old coolpix
Yes, it will connect any two things, provided they each have a SUB port.
No it does not, you have to buy one separately, but they are very reasonably priced.
Did you try removing the battery?
Hello, I think it has a very good battery life. It can go a couple days without having to charge it. I really like this camera.
Yes, it's very easy. I use iMovie.
It's almost 4 hours......Most of the time mine says 3:hrs and 55 min
no it is not unless you have rechargeable batteries
SD or SDHC card. I have a 8gb card.
The intern pic storage is between 20-50. Pics. But you can have any size memory card you want. That's what I did
Thats wrong. Its alot smaller, maybe 3 1/2 inches long and about 2 inches wide.. I havent used it. Im still angry that in sellers description they did not mention- that you are unable to get soft ware to make it easy share. Thats why I wanted it for facebook.
It's almost 4 hours......Most of the time mine says 3:hrs and 55 min
Nothing except the camera. It has never worked correctly. A friend recommended it and hers worked. Mine simply never has. I don't recommend it.
Kodak Easyshare C195 Digital Camera takes great pictures. It is easy to use and small enough to fit into your handbag. However, the easyshare feature only work if you use a memory card to load your pictures to your PC or Laptop. The USB cord included in the box will not allow you to load the pictures when it is connect to your PC of Laptop. This is the only downfall. If you do not mind using the memory card to upload pictures, then its a great digital camera.
I bought this one, it works fine. You also need a card reader, I got the IOGEAR GFR209A, plug n play works great. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JRB0TC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
yes, haven't had any problems using this camera outside
Yes it is
I have front and rear door speakers, as well as the in dash tweeters in my Subaru Outback, and they are all indeed functioning through the Alpine amplifier. Trouble is, I bought the Alpine from Amazon, but had it installed professionally and I'm not at all sure about the actual wiring setup. You may be better off calling the manufacturer. I can attest to the to the amazing sound, though. It Absolutely Rocks!!!
Yes it does. My client really like's the head set. We use it for dragon.
I purchased it to function with Dragon Speak software. It will do this if you have that software.
YES
No, you don't have to charge it. Just plug it into your computer and use it.
no
Left when looking on the back of the screen (right I guess if you're referring to where it connects on the keyboard). I found this out the hard way because it was opposite for my computer. I eventually just carefully removed the tape that was holding it to the screen and moved it to the side I needed. I haven't had any issues with it so I guess it works.
No it doesn't but it does not need it this recorder could pick up a pindrop
If you have set it for Voice Activation and have pressed Record once, it will start recording without pressing the Record button again, as long as it hears something to record. In this mode, when you talk, it will record and the red light will be solid. When you stop talking, it will pause and the red light will blink.
I don't know why Sorry
Yes
I don't remember because I returned it a soon as opened the box. It looks cheap like something that you will found at Ross.
Yes, it is compatible. I currently use it on a 64-bit desktop and laptop
Try going to the upper right corner click setting and Request desktop site.Some video's only play in desktop or try using Firefox as a player.Hope this helps you,it worked for me.
I tried to use it for mine but it didn't work.
I have not tried that. Anyways I had ZTE phone which had pin similar. After some research on internet I took a chance, thought it would work, but the headset never worked for me via this pin.
I have my doubts. To be honest, I wouldn't know at this point.
Yes that's what mine is and the one I bought is working fine.
i looked it up and from what i found it may be. your best course is to look at the old battery you have now and search its part number or serial number.
Yes, it will, definately. It has enough room inside. Also, the extra room won't compromise the protection of your MacBook because there is an elastic belt that you can use to tuck the MacBook into the case. Good luck!
This is very good!!
Yes it will fit your card.
It works best on fine jewelry but does work somewhat on costume jewelry
Just looked underneath .... 35w
It will work were ever there is an expandable memory. If those apps are installed on your card u will have to reinstall it on the new one. I don't know about that brand but if you can increase the memory and says to 32 or 64 should work. What ever the devices limits are.
I am convinced that if the actual card is also a SanDisk, this will work. But have in mind to verify the specifications for your 8gb tablet. See if it will take a 32gb micro card.
The remote is not wireless, but rather on the wire that earphones are attached to. The remote can be used for talking via microphone, volume control, muting the mic, as well as forwarding/reversing to a song on your iPod or iPhone.
The battery has to be charged in an external charger. You can't even charge it in the camera, even if you connect the camera to the optional AC adapter
The Legs DO fold out further, so that you can get lower to the ground. If you want to get lower, what you can do is slide up the middle piece all the way up, it comes out. Then you can flip it upside down so that the camera is now between the 3 legs. Sure your photo will be upside down, but that's what the rotate function is for in your photo editor.
Cards can be safely removed,no problem. It will not disable the reader.
Sometimes when I put in A Compact Flash card to the C.F. slot , the computer will REBOOT ( the computer will re-start ) this has happened 3 - times in the last 6 - months , I am NOT very worried about this as it hasen't affected the computer or the memory card . Gary S Meredith
I think the power cable is almost a foot long which was more than enough for my full tower case, especially when i connected the molex adapter to my PSU cable.
Danny, Yep, in fact, the following is from the item's description on the Amazon site: "The sleeve bearing motor is designed for long life and the exterior mounted speed control makes it easy to adjust." Aside from that, the bright LED illumination makes this fan match most all vendors' blue accessories for PCs. It's a great fan and moves a lot of air, even in my Silverstone Raven RV02, a monster of a case. I'm sure you'll be satisfied.
It didn't for me and I tried it numerous times....
You can put the computer to sleep, but it's not a computer remote control. The remote is specifically for the windows software.
No it doesn't. We ordered one from eBay. Just put in your region that you want. Hope this helps
If I understand your question correctly, Yes. I plug it into my tablets USB port and it let's my Tablet use the GPS features of websites like Google and Yahoo.
Yes. Mine came with a small bag of screws.
Not waterproof
No
Yes, very much so.
press to talk but the back and forth communication between the inside and outside person is crystal clear.
It adjusts separately. I wish it were a bit more adjustable because my hands are still a little too high when the monitor is at the correct viewing angle. Maybe if I had a taller monitor it would be OK. It's still better than the other options out there, which don't seem to articulate separately.
This is not an expensive unit and I think you would ruin it very fast doing so. It could be used under water but maybe not very often and drying it would be almost impossible. Hope this helps.
no

Hi Brian, if you're buying new, this particular package is supposed to come with all the accessories. But if you're buying used, I'd recommend checking the descriptions from each seller because some of them are missing the lens.
External dimensions are 7 1/2 inches by 10 7/8 inches by 4 3/8 inches high.
The ones that I got were a light blue.
No...it is the size of a shoe box
Yes
I am not sure what you mean by additional pieces, but the box I bought had everything I needed to install it. I will give a piece of advice...Tighten the handles before you put it on the wall. There is not enough clearance between the wall and the tv for a large arm to go between to tighten them afterwards.
I'm not familiar with the Sharp. I used it on a 60 inch Samsung and didn't have any issues.
I don't think so, in thickness it should be ok otherwise, the size is too small. My portable disk is smaller than a passport.
No it does not.
Yes is water resisted ... It doesn't have a cover
Unfortunately, we have not tested this item with the Leica V-Lux 4. However, this is not one of the cameras listed on the compatibility list for this item.
They will work fine with all of these.
While I have not tried a 3TB hard drive in this device I have used it with a 2TB drive and see no reason why a 3TB wouldn't work!
Yes!
Per comments below this YouTube video, the "i" implies made for iPhone, iPad etc. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zhn_0ClVj34 &gt;&gt; sennheiserusa1 year ago in reply to ErikLavine123: CX 680 or CX 680i (if you use an Apple device) is the way to go!
As far as I can tell this works with all the Toshiba laptops. My wife has a different model than I do and it works just fine on hers as well. A friend has yet another model and the connection is still the same.
Mine is a L455
5. I like the auvio real well but the battery wore out after maybe a year. I don't know. I have had three of them. Now I can't find another one to buy. I'd snap it up in a minute.
Yes
Yes
Without the commander subscription you will only be able to view real time action. With the subscription you are able to perform all the camera manipulations the alert commander software allows online This will allow replay of recorded footage from camera,e-mail alerts,adjustment of motion settings,change in camera focus,reformatting the camera sd card and other adjustments. You get full online function with a pc, but phone apps are less functional. Hope this helps Matt
no u will not be able to add anymore to that system now you have to get another master camera and start again but they will all be under one account so all you have to do is pick the site and go
No. The 750n is the indoor version that does.
This one does not - you need to look at the infrared version of this camera.
I have a 5420 and it works great....
Yes it will, works great on many E and M Series Models. Just make sure you buy the Pro2X Model
No, you need a d series dock
Yes it will.
This is doesn't do wifi.
It can be replaced or you can add a second one for more memory. It's not the pull out type, you have to undo screws and remove the cover.
no
Most any Bowens mount modifier will fit.
No, the downside of this grip is that it does have a proprietary quick release plate. Vangaurd has a newer version that works with Arca Swiss plates. You will pay a bit more for that one.
It comes with one.
Yeah. It's got neon orange stitching.
Yes it definitely can be used, thanks to its unique extended centre column. You can almost touch the ground by positioning the center column at a lower angle. Hope that helps.
It holds my canon 5d markiii with a 70-200mm well.
The unit does not have a USB port .
No it doesn't
AC adapter is not included in the package. You can find a matching AC adapter easily at local electronics retailers such as Radio Shack. USB ports in typical USB hub provides 500mA of power only. It is ideal for low-power USB devices such as flash drives, mice and keyboard. USB Hub is not ideal to charge devices such as smartphone (1A minimum power requirement) or tablet (2.1A minimum power requirement).
Credit card size
Yes unfortunately. They last a while but you will have to find these at the store or order. Can't use AA or AAA that most of us have lying around. I take my batteries out when camera not in use.
No, when you take the picture it prints out instantly.
No it's not
I am not sure. Please check for the dimensions and the connections at the back.
Yes but it will only charge it like 10%
Honestly not sure, can't find anything on it this one does but a little more expensive; http://www.amazon.com/HP-Pavilion-DV5-1137LA-Laptop-Battery/dp/B0053T507G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1424110390&sr=8-1&keywords=laptop+battery+HP+dv5+1137la
It is compatible But don't buy it. Mine lasted three weeks and died.
If you currently have NP-FV 30 or 50, then 70 will work.
I've been using it with pretty intense graphics for about a month now and haven't experienced any noticeable latency whatsoever.
Works for me so why not you?
I installed it on a mid 2010 iMac and it worked with no issue.
I have no idea what the answer is to this question. Mine only worked on 110V for about 30 days, then both cameras quit. Customer service is very poor. Problem not resolved. I recommend another system.
Technically it's not made to be weatherproof, but we've had ours outside exposed to all of the elements for almost two years now with no issues. Still flawless images. We had a lot of rain last year too. It's been cold, it's been hot. Still no problems with the cameras.
No. Each camera also needs to be powered by an electrical outlet. "Wireless" means that no wires are needed between the cameras and the receiver.
i have used on fiber and charter internet(cable) has worked awesome for me
You can plug Breeze Mobile into any power source that has standard USB connector, e.g. wall-charger, cell-phone charger, power bank, backup battery and so on.
I ordered this for my Sony Alpha and it works perfectly. Can't tell you whether it will work for a Nikon.
I'm not sure what SUB woofer output is...but I can say it's a booming lil stereo. It has good bass and it goes much louder than u would expect. It's great for the price. I and my teen girls love it...
Yes. It starts off very quiet and then works its way up to full volume.
It worked for me and I have a Wacom Bamboo Fun Tablet! So yes.
Kathryn, Thank you for you question. The LP161E is a newer pen and will not work with the CTE-440. The EP155EK is the only pen that will work with that tablet.
Yes it does have Headphone Jack 3.5mm on the back of unit.
Daniel, I'm sorry I can't answer your question. I do not own any Apple products. The radio works and sound great. Rowland
I used the S10s as ref spkrs with klipsch towers on front. Sounds great.
No you remove the gold plated bridge between the highs and lows were the speaker wire connects. Then you run individual speaker wires from the reciever to them so using four channels instead of two. You can change the internal crossover with the receiver settings in the reciever. My marantzs has a diagram on the internet which can be downloaded.
That is for a Bi-Amp set up. Just use the bottom posts for a standard stereo like mine and you will love it.
Never tried to. Good question.
I asked my self the same question a lot especially since the rc 42 is cheaper but the rc 42 uses smaller drivers and has less wattage. The c20 will be better balanced with your f30. I highly recommend it. Also because of closer power specs to your mains the C20 should put less strain on your amp. Ok good luck. Tell me how it goes.
No
I have used them on every set, except the 5.0. I can't stand the pressure of the foam.
Yes there is a coaxel connector for an antenna or cable connection,,,,,,,,, It also comes with a magnet mounted eantenna;; I use the magnet antenna inside the apartment,,,,, I pick up 4 local tv stations and 5 stations 35 miles away,,,,,,,,,,,, Of course cable would do better,,,,,,,,, The AM FM Radio is excelent,,,,,,,,,,,, THIS UNIT IS GREAT,,,,,,,,,,, I hope this is helpful,,,,,,,,
I don't know because I didn't install batteries.
It was just the standard size. About the size of an adult hand. Buy it new though because I bought it used and they sent a broken/cracked one.
You recharge it with the usb plug on the back. It charges an iPhone from less than 20% for about 85% batt. in 15 minutes.
i hope so, because the kensington k39264us travel charger is fantastic, and i want to upgrade to the iPhone 5s. i have not looked yet.....i have had no problems with the charger. always works, and the blue power lights have always been right on; plus it holds its charge almost forever.....good luck!
Sorry I can not help you. I had my car vandalized and it was stolen soon after I bought it.
Nope, this has a 30-pin connector that is only compatible with iPhone 4S and earlier models. I had to stop using mine when I bought an iPhone 5 this year. You could probably use a 30-pin/Lightning adapter, but I doubt it would be able to hold the phone up very well. I've since purchased a "Snooze" dock from DistilUnion, and I highly recommend it.
Sony NSZ-GT1 has a 13" width per the Amazon spec page. Hope this helps
End to end is about 46 inches. Hope this helps!
They work with every phone I've ever had including the galaxy s4!
Touch Menu, then select record setup and hit enter button (on the dial on the top of the unit) Turn the dial so that Rec Source is showing and hit enter. Turn the dial to Line and hit enter. there you go, all set. let me know if this helps. frank cox
For the area around Wheatland, Ca. the reception of FM is excellent regardless of the time.
Hi there is a switch inside the battery compartment, if that switch is set to the Nicad position and you put rechargeable cells in the unit they will be recharged with a quite sophisticated charger that does not overcharge or damage the battery. Hans. J Weedon.
Umm, one is coloured black, (black is beautiful, bro) and the other is white, (the colour of purity and chastity). Pick your poison.
Yes you can watch all of your DVDs. Hope this helps you, Glenn.
I have not had one problem with this TV works great
I used it for a few days, but I found the screen way too dark and was hard for me to read without my glasses, so I returned it. It did have some nice features I wish I could add to my present GPS, but I returned it mostly because of the dark screen.
You can download GPX files of routes for hiking and biking. Also some maps that you can purchase have these routes printed on them. Yes the GPS does show your elevation very accurately. I have compared it to the elevation markers at the top of hikes and it is within a few feet.
As far as I know, there is no warranty. However, I purchased these over a year ago and they are still in good condition, usually these bands loose the resistance after a while. I guess it also depends on the seller if a warranty is issued; try reaching out to the seller to find out.
What does not fit? Do you need to connect two RCA Males, get RCA Female to RCA Female Adaptors at Amazon. The proper A/V cables normally come with the units, with RCA Male connectors .
This DVR is not wireless capable on its own. The video inputs split off to two RCA male plugs; One is for video and the other is for MONO audio. You would need to have a wireless receiver that can get the signal from the camera and output it to an RCA plug (which will probably also be a male connector so you will need to have a Female-Female coupler).
I believe so..there are jacks on the side
Yes or hang it on the wall. Its meant to do that.
Yes. AA
I had 2 HP monitors w/out holes. I removed the backside of them and drilled 4 holes in each to accept the the pattern of the mount. I used suitable small machine screws and nuts to attach the mount. Reassembled the monitor and and was in business. Hard to imagine why all monitors don't have holes for mounting. Good luck.
I have a EOS 60 D and it fits fine,it should say in the item description.
the material is 100% percent cotton. A good solid blue and green screen.
It fits the Nikon D40 kit lense, and its a 55mm so I am sure it would! 55mm is 55mm
All I know is the case is well made,And fits all 3 58mm filters perfectly. It's small,But filters and leather case are made well.
Yes
It should work but the auto focus feature will not. You will have to manually focus. My friend uses this on a Sony and it works just fine. Enjoy!
The silver button releases your lens. Much like the button to release the lens on a camera.
Yes, indeed. I have used it on my Sony Nex 5 since 2010 to graft a number of vintage Nikkor lenses with wonderful results.
With a good adapter (State of the Art = Novoflex) no problem!
Yes. Worked fine for me
ISO is controlled through your camera, not the lens, so you can use auto ISO if you'd like. Since you'll be controlling aperture with the lens, you'll want to have your camera on shutter priority mode. Basically, you control shutter speed and aperture manually and you can either set ISO manually or put your camera on auto ISO.
if you lighting is bright enough to wash out the seams but sometimes my shots would show seams and look like it was photographed inside a white box. still very nice but not always seamless
As far as I know you can only use an infrared remote for a D3000. http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Remote-Cords/4730/ML-L3-Wireless-Remote-Control-%28Infrared%29.html
It works just fine on my Sony A65!
Hi, I have an a390 and it didnt work eventhough it says it does
Hi K. Shulman. The port is doesn't exist on nex7, and I don't know any converter to make it work. It just work on the big alphas, I'm pretty sure on a77 and a99 works , because i have them, but i think it will work on a37, a65 also and others like that.
yes they get warm but they are CFL lamps but in my opinion nothing to worry about
You can tilt the light forward an back, but the actual poles just adjust up and down
Yes it will so long as you have a M42 or "screw mount" lens. My advice is to keep it clean. I often leave the adapter on my lens & use the EOS rear lens cap but once a month i take the adapter off and clean it cause it gathers gunk. That said, great buy if you can handle more old school style manual aperture & focus with no confirmation of focus on your camera. Hope that long winded answer helps.
The writeup says it will fit your d40. I use the k1000 lenses With my D3100 and it does what it is supposed to do. Just remember that the lens will be manual only and you need to adjust for the added focal length.
Yep there's padding
According to Amazon's website, If you have the plugin on your camera for it there should not be a problem. Here is Amazon's link for the Aputure for your model camera. http://www.amazon.com/Aputure-Control-Shutter-Powershot-Replaces/dp/B003Y35VJA
No. I'm pretty sure it won't.
I have the sp-590UZ and it works for me.
No the connector is different but you can use a stereo to stereo mini cable from your iPhone headphone output. Hope this helps!
Not sure, I do get a battery level indication.
I have a Sony Handyman DCR-SR68 and the battery fits. I have had no issues at all.
I do not see that any where besides this description that it has been discontinued. It is still listed on the Griffin Technology website as a current product. If for some reason this listing happens to go away you can always just search for Griffin iMic and find the product.
Specs say "80 mW x 2 @ 16 ohms" so it's designed for lower impedance.
I used it with three different flavors of Ubuntu, and it worked fine. That is, until the unit just failed a bit after two years.
No, try an HRT iMusic Streamer. Another Apple exclusive peripheral pain in the ass.
Yes, it should work on any 4/3 camera. The company is very helpful and has a downloadable instruction manual.
it will not fit. you need a micro four thirds adapter not a four thirds adapter
In my case, it was about 50% charged.
I have the MacBook 13-inch Mid 2007 (Model Identifier MacBook2,1) , white, 2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with the Intel GMA 950 64 MB. This keyboard replacement works perfectly with my MacBook. If you have the same one, it should work with yours.
if your model has chipset rtl8191su, is not supported for windows 8
-The easiest way to view is to plug it into the laptop/monitor. Alternatively, you can also take out the SD card and put that into your laptop as well.
im sorry i can't help. i bought this as a gift for someone. all i know is that they just plugged it in and used it .
the camera work off 110 only
No
Yes
Manually it rotates. Automatically it does not.
Only 3 ft
From what I read, it says it's a Philips bulb. I don't think it's neither a Sony or Philips brand from what I hear. I am currently using this bulb and it seems to do fine for now. The only issue you may have with this bulb, is a slight flickering on a bright white picture on tv. Hope this helps.
The battery can be easily removed. There is a cover on the back of the BT-Q818 that comes off. The battery model number is HX-N3650A-G.
None, but it's pretty simple and mine works. Just make sure PW 0000 or 1234 is used.
Do you really mean amps and not watts?
No
Yes it does
How old is your house? If you have a newer not more than 12 - 15 years old it should work fine. Older than that the wiring may or may not support these devices transfer of data through the electrical system. Hope this helps
Yes, I tried it on my MacBook (OS 10.9.5, altho I don't think it matters). Only the few Windows specific functions do not work; all else is fine. The "Windows" key functions as the "Command" key on the Mac. When I hooked up, the Mac ran a little test and determined the kbd to be of type "ANSI", which is good.
Yes it does as long as it isn't unplugged.
Yes, I have cases on both iPod and iPhone and it fits well.
Yes there is on the back of it there is a bright red master button
after the purchase you send the bar code off the box and they send a check for $100.00
Sorry, I only have the Nikon version of this lens. I don't know anything about any Sony versions of the lens.
It works with Sony A-mount cameras. You would need an adapter to use it on an E-mount camera.
It said it works for any computer with a USB port
If you have a USB port, it should work.
I tried to weigh them on my digital scales and they wouldnt register, but our best estimate is under 2 pounds; My husband loves them , they work great , we plan on using them at a Nascar race where we will be walking and carrying them far quite a distance and they are definately light weight enough for that.
It says 'SIL switching adapter, input 100-240V' on my Jabra US adapter.
I think the bag would be perfect. You'll have extra room for cords, wireless mouse, other supplies, etc. I've even used this for my ipad mini. It's a great all-purpose carrying case. Enjoy!
Yeah, I like them with my android.
Even balance to music. Not made for super bassy sound but pay attention... Not "super bassy", its "balanced. I recommend these for bet good sound.
I would not think that the UE 600vi to be the choice for bass lovers as it is more for towards the treble/clarity side. You might want to check out the UE 900 instead although the price range differs alot.
I may not be the best person to answer this. My ear openings are small and I was never able to get a good fit with the Ultimate Ears, certainly not the kind of block-out-everything tight isolation I like for mowing the lawn. I still use the Logitech earbuds sometimes for stationary activities, but bought some Etymotic MC5 buds for moving around.
I am considering purchasing this as a replacement keyboard for the Gateway LT2805u. From the pictures, the dimensions and tabs across the bottom appear to be a fit. It is also my understanding that the Acer and Gateway are very similar products. Any tech folk think this Acer keyboard might work?
Sure it would work. Would need external powere supply and extra chips. No loop record function
Yes, I can put my 16 gig card and new battery and its good for about 2 hours and a coin toss to see what dies first. Good thing is both are cheap (memory and extra battery)
I do not see why they could not be copied...the keys look to be of a standard design.
All outlets are ON
Push the DVD tray door in with your finger and the door will click and open.
~4x~2.5x~1.5 inches
No, but you can ask for a nano sim
Yes, you will be able to view via web browser. It also has a built in email server so you can use the motion detection option to email you 6 still shots when motion is detected. I use an app called Surveillance Pro on my iPhone to remotely view.
I don't think it would work with that motherboard. The motherboard needs to support the am3 socket.
It's got a clone ftdi chip and will be bricked with official windows ftdi drivers use hacked driver or change pid of ftdi chip or use a different os You can use Linux to reset the pid of the ftdi chip then install the hacked drivers on windows
No it does not, thats more of a motherboard and gpu thing.
Not without an adapter. It has the old style plugins for the mic and headphones.
No this is specifically for PC
That's correct, 640 x 480 or 320 x 240. Don't know the frame rate.
I can't give you a spec, the quality is good enough. It is not a great system. But what you are buying you get some nice options.
Initially it worked great with my Toshiba portable hard drive (Toshiba Canvio Basics Portable Hard Drive 320 GB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive) but after about two weeks, for some reason I started getting errors when I plugged my hard drive into to it. It has worked fine for other devices though - speakers, my wired keyboard, mouse. And it has no problem reading my smaller flash drives. My 8G Sandisk flash drive works fine when plugged in directly. Hope that helps a little. Thanks-
Yes, it is a camera as well. Makes 720p resolution.
No it does not. You would have to purchase software and install.
What do you mean by module? You only need the SWM and the 3 LNB dish. If you want to use it as single wire to each receiver, if you have more than 2, you need splitters. That SWM only has two outputs for the single wire feature.
I used it to split an HD signal from a cable box, there is no noticeable signal loss or loss of picture quality. For sound I am using an optical output from the cable box to a surround receiver.
Although its possible to attach a camera mount to this scope I wouldn't recommend it. Dobsonian mounts are rather poor for astrophotography as there is no tracking system.
If it's compatible should work just fine
When you use the Fuji 3D W3 camera, you can see the 3D videos and images on the back of the camera displayed on the 3D LCD viewfinder. If you want to view on a 3D TV, then you can attach your camera to the 3D TV HDMI port using a mini-HDMI cable (ordered separately). You need to use the type of glasses designed to work with that TV. If your TV is not 3D then images and video files display only in 2D.
Yes it can, as long as your dvd recorder has the RCA input (yellow female connector) it will work. I've first tested this on my TV card on my pc that uses this same port. The cameras came with the adapter to fit RCA connectors. Hope this helps, best regards.
Night owl or video secu make good cameras with audio.
no
BNC and these cameras stop working before a year is up. They sent me new ones and those also went bad..
I use this software I get from StarrSoft.com called Win500. It allows you to manage all of your banks and channels yourself. But I does require a little bit of know-how and a compatible programming cable. If you don't feel like doing all of that from what I know you can go to your local RadioShack and they can program it for you. Hope this helped!
I think they will. I've used mine with phones and tablets they work great
I used it on a 2008 Triumph Motorcycle I'm unsure of the compatibility with BMW's
I don't think they are designed to work that way. You plug the base unit into your stereo or TV source and then you can sit in bed across the room or walk around the house listening to your movie/music. I don't see how it would be able to read a signal in a movie theater.
I've never really gotten that much on my N150. To be honest I bought it to be used as a bridged access point for my smoothwall wireless(purple) port. It handles my ROKU HD , my Nokia lumia 521 phone and two laptops without any noticeable lag in streaming. It's ultra-cheap and it gives you what you pay for. Still you can try the WRT Tomato tweak and see if you can coax a little more out of it.
Nope, the GTX 970 G1 is 12.23" and the HAF-912 only has 10.55 (ish)" available behind the PCI-E slot, sorry... :-(
Yes... "SR" is the lens mount name... MC is lens series,...
Yes, you hook the red and white sound wire from the system to your tv outputs (red and white)... it works great I use it a lot! Good for everything!
Thats the same TV I have and the wire piece broke off and we had to take tv apart to get it out. The directions dont tell you where all the wires plug in at. We had to guess.
Yes i bought cable extenders like 25ft. only 8 dollars a pc. had the male female end..
Looks to me like it will work. You'll attach the mini to the camera and the USB to your computer or hub. This looks just like the one I use, except mine is white.
5" length, 3.5" width and it's narrow at the top but the base is 3" in depth
When you go into the manual set up mode the first thing you see is either ST or DT in the day portion of the display. Use the up arrow or the down arrow to set it for DST or not. This does not appear to be in the instructions, but mine works this way.
That would depend on what camera it was mounted to, if not a full frame sensor the lens would be more like 120 mm. Any vball venue I have shot really doesn't allow enough room for the length lens. It is how ever a great lens fast and tack sharp.
it sure is. you will not be disappointed. you really need to do alot of shooting to make it worth while. casual shooters should use the 1.8 and call it good unless ;your rich
It's not a good lens for portraits, it's a great lens for portraits! Just remember its a lens meant for a full frame camera so on an aps sensor it would be a 120 mm lens, which would require and large studio or outdoor shoots.
I got better macro results with Auto Mode. Press the round plastic thumb ring at the 9:00 O'clock position and you will see a choice for Macro Mode, but this choice isn't available in Auto or Easy Modes.
Your auxiliary battery needs replacing. Pull the dime-sized disk out of the camera's side - it is the black tab marked "CR1220". You can get replacement battery at pharmacies or Walmart's watch section (what I've done, for about $3) or a camera store or probably online (but the shipping/handling will cost you more than the battery itself).
Totally disagree with it feeling cheap. A solid metal case and the fit and finish is excellent. Sure it feels lite without a battery in it or memory card - but this is a good thing. rigid, durable, and lightweight - a Ferrari weighs 2500lbs. A mustang 3700lbs. I'll take the Ferrari.
Actual cooling grid is 11 x 15 inches. Actual base is 12 x 16 inches. Measure the bottom of your laptop and if it fits on the cooling grid it should work for you. It is a fine and well built cooling pad. Regards Ed
You're right, there is no difference. I realized pretty quickly that this mat does absolutely nothing to cool my computer down, and I've never used it since. This is my only computer-related purchase I've ever made that I really regret.
It works great for me. My guess is that someone got a lemon, and I'm sure they do exist. You can see photos I took with my D5100 at http://idaholyoaks4.blogspot.com/. There are lots of shots there I took with my D5100, as well as some I took with older cameras.
Yes. That is what I use it with. Works great! Took it on safari in Africa. So glad I did!
I'm sorry I do not sell that type of item.
It is a little over five inches long and has the feel of a Cross ball point pen. Works great and lasts long.
This is a original xbox 360 wireless controller
These were a gift to my sons...almost positive it is the 30 pin but a lightning adapter will work as both of them have upgraded to iPhone 5s's since then...hope this helps. John P.
It has three prongs to be plugged in with a three hole outlet coming out the bottom. If you put it in the bottom outlet of the two in the wall, you should still be able to use the other as normal.
It does come with a USB cable so you can charge it from your computer
Menu to settings, click on volumn, use normal or high, lastly, raise the volumn switch on the unit. (Also, earphone quality makes a difference on how much volumn you can achieve).
It has a simple eq with a bass & tremble that has about 5 to 6 settings.
Yes
Yes it has voice command, I haven't tried to answer a text back or actually say the whole phone number to it , If that's what u are asking
NO
Not to me it isn't. I can barely hear it. My laptop fan is louder, and the Logitech I had previouslly whirrs extremely loud at a high pitch and has a teeny fan. I like this one because the fan blades are clear plastic and since they are larger, the pitch is lower frequency.
Mine did. As I recall, it did not come with a 110v recharger. Because it is designed to operate in a vehicle, it gets it's power from the cig lighter. I love mine.
looks like YES
No, you have to connect them to the lens. Hope this helps.
They should screw on to the end of any of your lenses
No its totally plug and play
As long as it connects, it is just an antenna should work fine.
Yes, I've used it with an i5-4570S build.
No, this power supply is fanless and, therefore, completely silent.
I am not sure of the individual LEDs, they are quite large in diameter. The overall unit is supposed to consume 2 amps, so at 12 volts, that would be 24 watts.
I this device and dont recomend anybody to buy it. Work for a couples days just With 2 10. Inches speakers and blowout, so my answer to your question is NO.
iPhone 4S works like a champ. Downloaded my contacts and seems to be just fine!
If you have an ending point that requires you to drive on a dirt road. It will direct you that way. Other then that I am sorry I don't have an answer for you.
Yes. However, you need to turn off the safety feature first (the option will pop-up when you try to program while moving).
No, just North America. Extra maps can be purchased and installed on the GPS
i am sorry , I don't know, but in my limited time with it, I don't like it as well as my 5 year old model, it is larger, but seems to show less good stuff on the map view, and the female voice is not nearly as good as it was on the older model. It is annoying on this model. And lower "fidelity". Sorry can't answer the question on Purerto Rico.
The cord needs only to be plugged in for charging purposes or to use the traffic notification feature. Otherwise unplug from cord carry it around using the gps internal battery as power source. Hope this helps.
I had the same problem. I bought a new cord, off brand, cheapo cord and it works great.
Unfortunately, I don't have an answer to this. I've only used it in the U.S. If I were you, I'd take the question to the manufacturer with the name and model number.
No sir.
No
no cord necessary as the plugs fold into unit on the bottom
Yes and over 20 more languages!
I don't have a Coolpix, so I don't know. Your best bet would probably be to go to the Nikon website and ask them.
No. You need an EL9. Type in Nikon d40 replacement battery and it will come up.
It's the battery only. My experience has been that is will last you about an hour and a half if you record video that entire time-frame.
this is a real pos ,i dont know if u can cause mine did nothing ,but i doubt it,its the case of u get what u pay for,ps it costs more to return it than it costs ,spend a few dollars more and get a real computer,good luck
Scanner should match radio station, but if you have a defective Tunecaster I am sure it is under warrenty. It helps to read manual if it came with one. Hope this helps. Jim
Yes, it charges your MP3 player or phone.
Yes! It's a no-brainer.
I have not tried it with a Blackberry
The charging dock will not work with an iPhone 5S, but you can still use the speaker with an auxiliary cable.
Unfortunately it does not. I hate that about it... love the rest of it
I don't know ... check mfg website.
This flash will work with any rebel with a shoe mount. It will offer more light on your shots but understand there are better ones based on what you're trying to accomplish. If you are novice to intermediate this one is fine.
It does not work well with anything. Not a good product
I have no idea, it was a gift for a friend & he enjoys the flash with a Nikon D3100 - thats all
Yes .. I purchased it and it's work very good with D7100 NIKON .
the new update doesn't include Netflix(updated my player lastnight BD.4.874.00) it's very clear on amazon,and LG site.nothing mentioned about Netflix. 550 and up models do. from LG rep " We actually had models before this one that have Pandora. At this price point we are limited on the apps we can add due to hardware, license fees, etc. We never said this model has or will have Pandora,netflix" plus if u check netcast it does say "features vary by model and category"
thanks for your post - I already have a dvd player that has that same problem...don't need another
I'd say..get a PS3...it's a good blu ray player plus you get a console... it's a bit more expensive at $299 , but I think it's worth it... I've had mine for a year, and it's great for movies and games and more... at $100 ..it's hit or miss... but the sylvania blu ray might be what you're looking for.. it's 129$ on Amazon...
Yes it comes with a charging cable (A/C adapter)
It has both on the left side of the device.
Yes, this does work well on Pixma MG 5520. Nice!
You can but I find that the mic on the webcam works pretty good.
Yes
Yes. has many different inputs ,,rca, hmdi, coax. I am using coax coming out my my Comcast digital transport box now,
Hi. It is using the standard Ethernet port 10/100 Mbps.
There is micro sd port so you can upload any map on it :) Thank you so much :)
It does. It even comes with a neoprene sleeve and earphones. I think it's one of the best values out there for that reason.
Right!
Arm flips 180 degrees, then shoe is upside down, so you would have to unscrew shoe and reset it on top of bracket
I have mine connected to HDMI only for display though. Have not tried sound. I have connected to one Mac Mini for office displays. I will warn you some of the adjustments ie screen orientation can only be change via LG software. It is only available for PC and does not work.
It never worked for us got a cradle point from sprint save your money.
as the previous responders said, they plug into a power outlet, meaning there's a wire there, and the second speaker is connected by a wire to the other one. but bluetooth means they're connected to the computer without a wire -- i have them across the room, so that's a great advantage. my feeling is that they are better for music than for speech -- some voices come across blurry.
Nividia Qudro FX 1500m
Yes
I am reasonably sure it only comes with AM and FM bands.
purchased the radio and found that the earbud outlet was not working. what can i expect for the cheap price
A while ago I asked Skiva Tech the same question on playing videos from YouTube with my iPad2. I was told that YouTube did not support AirPlay, so it will not work with the adapter.
excellent cable and I like it.
STANDARD SIM. NOT THE MICRO SIM.
I am unable to offer assistance. Mine worked about two days before it quit working altogether. I did not get a chance to try it on BluRay before it stopped working. I would discourage anyone who was thinking of buying this switcher.
It transmit both audio and signals
I don't know if it works for the mini but I am 100 per cent perfectly with my IPad. Diane
No you'd have to buy the actual power cord. They only supply you with the USB attachment. No power cord included.
It's for the iPad 1st gen. I have the iPad 2 or 3 and I had to make some modifications to the case. It doesn't have a cut out for the back camera or a cut out for the power button.
Yes
I honestly can't say just how many... I am using a Nintendo Wii, two Kindles, two personal computers and two PlayStation gaming systems. When my family visits they use many other devices that use the WiFi and all at once. I haven't had any problems... The modem came with 4 Ethernet connection ports and currently I'm only using two... It's fast! Well, fast enough for me at the moment.
I had my cable provider install this for me. No software was necessary to install on my laptop. The control software is accessed via the modem...I am certain that this will work just fine with Windows 8.
No onboard microphone is going to sound good for dialogue. What you need is a microphone on a boom pole. You could have the best Neumann shotgun mic and sound devices recorder and it would sound terrible if the mic was on the camera. Check out the Zoom recorders, and the Sennheiser MKH-416. If your going to do on board, don't spend a lot of money, save for a boom pole setup.
I seriously doubt it. You have to have a special USB modem phone. They are not the typical cell phone. But you can try it. Call Verizon, ask them. your call to Verizon is free by dialing 611.
Yes, if you've registered your radio with Reciva, you can add any stations you please to "my streams" on the Reciva site and play them on your radio.
Sorry, I am not familiar with the 2 systems you mentioned. But, for a desktop system, I am totally satisfied with their performance. They are not a big part of the cost of the IRMS300 so you could swap them out if you didn't like them.
Hard-wired.
Digital and not good at all. This camera is pretty silly and expensive.... I'd suggest not to buy. I work with vivotek instead of toshiba: a better choice in my opinion
I believe it is with the montanas but i dont want to misinform you. If you go to the garmin site and look these maps up it will give you a list of comptible devices. Im almost 100 percent it is though.
No, it just means this model is no longer being made.
The lifetime for this Plasma TV is an estimated 100,000 hours which would equal over 20+ years regular use. Yeah, they are very durable now with built in features to protect against screen burn in. You'll get better blacks and if you game or watch sports, the motion blurring is worse on LCD and LED as well. I have a 47" LCD 1080p 120 hz tv right now, but this one is on it's way to replace it!
I'm not aware of any solutions apart from utilizing the headphone out on your audio receiver. With a TV this nice you've got a sound system, right? ;-)
Standard double DIN. I wouldn't recommend buying it, mine didn't last more than a year. The LCD backlight went out. No help what so ever from the company. They wouldn't even sell me parts.
Can't say for sure. I assume it's the version of Skype software that matters, rather than the brand of TV. My 2012 model Panasonic came with Skype preinstalled and it works very well.
Well are you doing something you shouldn't? I'm watching you! Seriously, if you are going to worry about that, then stop using a computer, a cell phone, a regular phone and any other modern device. Just be smart and turn you computer off, as well as other devices, when not needed. You will save energy as well.
on the logitech dinovo mini the button on the top left is a left click button also but if u press the function key and the left click button it works as a right click. Not sure if its the same with this model but i think it should be.
No it doesn't come with wire. Fourteen gauge is perfect.
The RC 62 is a great center fill with good range. Excellent dialog and detail.
No problems... I hooked my to 105watt per channel And it sound wonderful.
Andres, The closest match would be either the RC52II or the RC62II. Eric C
As long as the camera has the function to interact with wireless remotes, such setting can be found under the camera's menu options, however, I am not exactly sure how it works with Canon Eos M.
I don't know. It works fine with my K30.
Not that I am aware of but if you want to do serious timelapse photography check this out, &lt;http://www.bmumford.com/photo/camctlr.html&gt;
Yes. However, the 535s is primarily designed as a freshwater chartplotter and comes preloaded with U.S. inland lakes. The BlueChart G2 Vision is an enhanced offshore mapping chip. You could also use the BlueChart G2 (non-Vision) as a less expensive option if you're just looking for offshore mapping capability. Although the 535s is a discontinued product, the following link will provide all the mapping options available: https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/on-the-water/discontinued/gpsmap-535-535s/prod8108.html
I'm not sure about your question but I'm pretty sure the plug is different. However I would not recommend this cord at all, worked for about a month then quit working completly.
My battery can last 5hrs. when fully charged.
All Apple keyboards have the same setup and dimensions (besides the one for the iMac that has the numeric keypad), and thus any keyboard protector made for Apple products should work.
I would say yes it wil,l because is the same keyboard https://www.google.com/search?q=Will+this+fit+the+Macbook+Air+A1466+model&oe=UTF-8&hl=en&client=safari&um=1&ie=UTF-8&tbm=isch&source=og&sa=N&tab=wi&ei=Zbk4UtupOMjQyAHv74CwDQ&biw=768&bih=900&sei=f7k4UtinBIrqyQHThYG4Dg#biv=i%7C11%3Bd%7ClSL593s7g06VoM%3A
like a glove! that is the MacBook year I have and I absolutely love my keyboard cover!!
Mine came wrapped on a mousepad and I actually stored it for a few months in the package before pulling it out to use it. Have you tried leaving it flat for a day or so to see if it will come out? Was it exposed to extreme heat or cold? Best wishes and hope it works for you!
Yes, the keyboards are the same size.
Yes. They are about the same although you lose a stop of aperture with the 70-300. The maximum aperture is f/5.6 instead of f/4. The 70-300 lens is only f/4 near the 70mm end. Otherwise, optically in terms of sharpness, it's about the same.
Amazon has the wrong product image here. The lens is indeed white.
Mine did
It will work on the 7D cropped sensor but it is made for a full frame. You will not get the full circular 180 degree view on the 7D, you will have the equivalent of a 13-24mm. I would say if you are going to upgrade to a full frame get this lens, if not stick with the cheaper 10-22mm (great lens) or the Tokina fisheye. I have had both lenses and they were great on the 7D (last camera before upgrading to FF)
I use a full frame camera and it goes from circular fisheye at 8mm to ultra wide at 15mm.
It just so happens that yesterday I tried the 2.0 on my 7D Mark II with the new 100-400 II lens and it lost its AF function. It works fine with the 1.4 extender, though.
Hi, Sharon! It sure will. Canon is great about cross comparability. This is a great product, but check the Canon website as this is recommended for certain lenses only. You cannot use it with EF-S lenses if I remember right but be sure your lenses work before you buy it!!! Have fun hope you can use it.
I am not sure. I have an Ipod touch 4th generation.
Hit the set A button to set the leftside alarm. Turn the volume button clockwise to increase the hour and counterclockwise to lower the hour. Hit the set A button again when the hour is correct. Set B button controls second alarm on the rightside.
10-15 ft
For sure it works with X-E2 and X-Pro. I think it should work with X-T1 because, virtually, there is no change in this area for all X cameras
Yes, it was amazing. I did not have to program. I put the batteries in the remote and it started working immediately. Wonderful. Love it.
It does not. No something I thought I would need. If I want to use earphones, they can be plugged in directly to the iphone/ipad.
Yes, you must use premium cable, I dislike the original cable so I acquire a bettet one
They are awesome! Sorry about that. I got them from Amazon.
14/2
if your buying a full home theater system - yes a 7.1 would be perfect. if you just buying a pair - then a stereo receiver would work.
I haven't listened to the Klipsch 100 watt sub yet but in my opinion there is no floor stand speaker that can replace a good subwoofer. Maybe the super high end speakers but nothing I have heard yet. I own these along with a pair of 52's and 42's. I would recommend the 52's and spend a little more on a sub. Both the Klipsch 350w and 400 or 450w sound amazing. If I simplify I will be keeping the 52's over the others.
Yes, you can record up to 7 seconds of sound...
Over but they are super cheaply made
After a while, just replace the buffing wheel. They're relatively cheap and do the job.
you have to buy the Blu ray skip Dr kit which may be a little more money but its worth it
I'm not sure if it will work on that particular disc but I had a lot of CDs and DVDs that my kids scratched and most of them I was able to salvage with this device. I would suggest if you can find an a/c plug for it, that it works better than with batteries.
I don't know! I don't use it very often.
VGA is an analog protocol and can introduce artifacts and other issues if there is interference from an outside source (power cables, etc.). Most VGA cables are shielded enough to prevent this. DVI is a digital protocol and subject to less interference and can provide a better picture in some cases. For most monitors and lower resolutions you won't see a noticeable difference.
No
Not sure. I used one end to connect to an ac adapter and the other to transfer data, but it didn't work, it didn't generate enough power. So, I'm thinking depending on the device, probably not. Hope this helps
It is the SH-FX71. It is on backorder EVERYWHERE online!! I placed an order with Vanns.com early January and they aren't expecting any for another couple weeks. Look around though and you can find it under 100 bucks with free shipping...
Mine came with a carrying bag
No where, don't buy them they are total and complete garbage. (I'm not an expert but when I hooked them up to tweeters, sound was grey, muffled, muggy, almost staticy and volume was much decreased) casings also feel cheap, idk why they bother manufacturering such wastes of time
Yes, it compatible to Windows Vista, I using it on XP, Vista, Windows 7 and 8.
The special pen will be included with this product.
That's what I would like to know also! Most of the systems will say internet ready, but only dsl. Get with the times! What will work on a 45 lan/ethernet?
Mine did not come with a clip. I bought a neopreen case that works well.
No recovery disks comes with this netbook. However, you can recover original content by hitting F9.
I'm not sure. I would caution that my experience with sansa mp3 players has been mostly negative. I had earlier mp3 players without a touch interface and these were pretty good. The players with touch were so dreadful that I'd never buy another Sansa device.
I don't think so, if it does then that option is VERY well hidden
Yes, but I caution you. This device is not easily navigated. With music, once the device has played a song, you have to go all the way back to the main menu to get back to the song list. The swipe feature is ULTRA sensitive. I'd get it set up and it would jump 3 songs just putting it in my pocket!! Extremely frustrating!
I'm not sure. I would caution that my experience with sansa mp3 players has been mostly negative. I had earlier mp3 players without a touch interface and these were pretty good. The players with touch were so dreadful that I'd never buy another Sansa device.
Yes you can, I used it for the same thing. See the link below for compatible Rhasody players: http://www.rhapsody.com/electronics/mp3players
Yes, but I am not sure what it is as I rarely use mine. I prefer the Sansa Clip. It may be a swipe upward om the touch screen, but that may be the unlock. I think it is in the manual which you should be able to get online.
Per the owner's manual, it can handle up to 40gb total. So if you have an 8gb player you can get a 32gb card and it is suppose to work. You can download the user's manual in pdf form at www.sandisk.com.
Hi...I used the hardware that Klipsch supplied. Was very easy.
Only if your tv accepts speaker wire. Otherwise, you need a receiver
Thanks for your question. We are unable to offer a solution for mounting this wonderful sounding speaker. This is a fantastic sounding speaker. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Klipsch dealer.
Look up the specs on line. Very easy to find. Awesome speaker btw
91db
No, you will need a few plastic pry tools and a hairdryer. The last thing you will need is knowledge of how to install the digitizer properly. YouTube is you friend for this.
Yes, it comes with the black rubber lining glued to the glass.
2. B honest ,m not sure but most work cuz u r replacing d who,e screen thou. Mine s like new now.
Yes, my Ipod touch looks like new again...
No it can work without phone, but it wont be able to call you in case of emergency
That is a good question that I and my brother would both like to know. Mine went out on the first power outage that we had. I too tried everything to reset it and had no luck. Sorry that I cannot help you. But if you do find out anything would you please pass it on. Thanks Wayne
If it's the same part number, then yes, you should be able to. They would use the same screens. Many computer manufactures reuse parts in order to efficiently produce them.
No. This is simply the adapter that they use to convert from regular ide to their connector in the laptop. I would recommend the following from adapter eforcity - this will cover all of your needs. Just copy and paste the following into amazon search bar. "eForCity USB 2.0 To SATA IDE 3.5 2.5 Hard Drive Adapter Cable" I have a couple of these and many others from same vendor with fast, excellent service.
It should work with all camera systems that allow you to micro-adjust and calibrate your lenses. If the Nikon D810 allows you to do that, then yes, it will work.
It calibrates the lenses. The camera (Canon Mark III) has the settings for the micro adjustments needed. Short answer ...Absolutely
Go for a more powerful router if you want gaming speed, I did.
Yes
The power adapter is what plugs into the router to a power source that turns on the router. The cable I believe your referring to is the uplink cable / ethernet cable fom the modem port to router uplink port.
The quality is quite good. I used the lens to get a wider angle for videoing my students making presentations. The lens did not affect the high def performance of the video camera. However, one must recognize that the magnet is not very strong. The lens will not remain in place if the camera is subject to any jostling. I used a table top tripod so that the camera was steady.
no
Yes it does. Under the system section, music settings, then the repeat mode and there you have the choice of repeat mode, shuffle mode, or EQ select.
No. It dosent work as an in put.
It shows some trails. However, I note that it doesn't show all trails.
You can get a South Korean chip!! From Garmin; www.garmin.com sir they have it. I hope I helped you! Good luck sir!!
I installed these in a Dell 1501. The computer only recognizes 3 of the 4 megabytes. Otherwise they worked as expected.
Worked fine for me.
I believe so. If you search the xm website and the dock speaker you'll see all radios that are compatible. It says it is.
They fit others. I put mine on the LG tone and my skull candy
No they will not.
They are supposed to fit all Bose
Actually Luc Roy, Your wrong... This switch can be powered from a POE switch. I plugged this switch into a Meraki 24Port POE switch this morning and was using 7W of power to power the switch. It Than also powered to Access Points. Hope this helps.
Pop the USB end off them and use this: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008YOFLXU/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3FW43KUZDI219&coliid=I30EFEZFQCBUG8
It's fanless device, which is great for small office or home use.
Yes it supports DHCP Server. Make sure you update the firmware. I believe it's supported since certain version. Commands thats I used to configure a scope: ip dhcp pool network Data_10.0.2.0/24 address low 10.0.2.21 high 10.0.2.200 255.255.255.0 domain-name lan.xxx.com default-router 10.0.2.1 dns-server 10.0.3.1 This switch is the best bang out of you buck. For less than $300 you have fanless, 1GBit layer 3 switch (static routes only and no IPv6 routing)
This switch has 20 ports. Typically you would only have 1 port connected to a router, the other 19 would go to end devices or other switches. Why do you want two connections from a router to the same switch? Type would seem to cause problems in the routing tables.
WD's SmartWare can activate 256-bit AES hardware-based encryption in the drive controller (overview of the drive on WD's site) Installing 3rd party software based encryption will work the same as a non-hardware encryption external drive and if you use both, the data will be double encrypted and require two passwords to decrypt.
I am not Mac-Oriented... I believe that you can use USB2 interface and firewire on a Mac but the disk format that Mac's use, is different from PC hard drive formats. Your External Disk might require reformatting. There is a software solution available that will permit a PC to read Mac formatted drives via USB.
usb 3.0 cable is included - and usb 3.0 is FAST!
If you reformat the drive you'll erase all the present data on it. If it's a brand new drive, just format it for FAT32 and both -Win7 and OS X- can read it. As to the file size limit, there is none.
This WD drive works with the nomad rugged case, ASIN B00505EZZ6, $39.95 to protect it in extreme conditions, but for normal rugged conditions a Drive Logic DL-64 EVA HD Case (black), ASIN B003VVH8Y6. $9.95 w/free shipping, will do just as good. Check both then decide.

If you still need the help, you may can use the "Disk Management" program in windows 7. Once you find the program that lets you reformat the volume, it should be simple to follow the rest of the instructions.
I have the same problem. I also have not found a solution. I get a delayed write error and then all the folders etc are empty. I have searched for days for a solution (on mine, the contents ARE still there but aren't shown and can't be accessed unless there is a short cut on my desktop). If someone knows what to do, please help.
Some say the ASUS card is better. Some say it's a bitch to get running --funky drivers??? I don't know. I also don't know about the ZxR, but the X-Fi card is effortless to install and does a nice job. If your motherboard has embedded sound, you may need to get into the BIOS to disable it rather than doing it from Control Panel, but that would likely always be the case.
As long as you buy the phone new and buy the square trade plan within 30 days of purchase, whatever you do with your phone is your own business. It will be covered by Square trade. I dropped my first phone (galaxy note II) in the toilet and it was rooted. They replaced with with very little questions asked. Never did the question of it being rooted came up. They just reviewed my receipt from Best buy and paid out the non at&t subsidized price, which was $699.99 + tax. Hope this helps.
no
same battery with a bit more amp hours, should work quite well for you. I don't run out of power any more with these in my pocket.
I have not used my camera long enough to learn battery charge time... as for lifetime.. I think that depends on usage between charges etc.
From imformation I found on Amazon yes.One battery should cross reference to the other.Jim
These models are all interchangable.
There is a loop, but it's too narrow to be anything but ornamental. You can't use it with a key chain.
Yes, plug and play. I've used it on Windows Vista, 7, and 8. All different computers and it works flawlessly transferring files between them. Windows may install drivers and there is a program on the drive which I don't recommend using (just a waste of time if you ask me).
No they do not. These are at least bookshelf speakers - they have a large footprint.
They are really goods and strong i had one since 2012
they will hook up to a tv that has a standard 3.5mm output jack for headphones. you just plug that up to the tv and hook both speakers up to one another with the red and white RCA cables (included) and you are good to go.
Yes, it does. I'm running Windows 7 and I plugged it in and it accepted it with no trouble.
It works on Mac up to 10.9 at this moment sicne 10.10 driver has not released. You can download the latest driver on http://www.premiertek.net/top/download.html, #1. thanks! Premiertek
Go to driverguide.com Their should be CD with the unit
One should be all you need. BUT, it is a very marginal antenna. I'd get something better like Powerlink or http://www.amazon.com/Alfa-AWUS036NH-Wireless-Long-Range-Screw-On/dp/B003YIFHJY/ref=pd_sxp_grid_pt_0_0
We only support Windows XP and Windows 7. This antenna booster is assigned to a Thinkpad running Windows 7 Ultra and the device seems to work well. We have no other experience with it.
Yes. You can order 100.
yes.
same here, very often my track pad stops working or reacts weirdly.
Not without modifying connections and needs amp to power speakers as a computer will not...
the unit that charges the computer gets hotter ( musch hotter then the 90 watt did...also the fitting (that goes into the computer) seems to fall out more but that might just be a grip or spacer issue. Truth is, OEMs have made specific requirements for a specific reason. Take which ever one you want but remember, if you 'click' on something, then you are obviously expecting that item.
Sorry, but I don't remember what kind of Acer I used to have. I replaced my Acer 6 months ago.
The speaker is wired to the transmitter.
Yes.
Sorry to be the messenger... but you cannot Direct Bypass from the Talking Touchscreen. You can Direct Bypass from the XTi panel.
Yes.
Hello, Question Thank you. The size of the plug is 3.5mm. I think available. Thank you FIELD JAPAN K.TABATA
No SX40 is a fixed lens camera you cant remove it.
It would not be wider. Bigger is better but 8040 would probably be enough for that small of a room. Just don't Expect booming base.
Go for the 8060 Center. Just hook it up like your normally would and then set your center channel to large in your receiver's set up. If you can set the crossover point on your center channel, try 50hz or 60hz. It will sound great without having to run another subwoofer cable.
yes
the cloth around is meant to stay on the speaker, which helps protect the speakers from dust and other contaminants that could damage the speaker.
I don't think there are any parental controls, but you can check your kids search history on the internet and apps store.
The new film should be in a tray. If not you have either the wrong film or defective film.
It works on Windows 8.1 on my laptop and Surface in both the USB2 and USB3 ports.
MANUFACTURER ANSWER: Thank you for posting your question. The way to do this would depend on your computer OS and which Lego kit you are using. It seems that the original lego software only supports Windows 95 and 98, and won't run on a modern computer. However, some people have reported success using a Raspberry Pi for this: https://minordiscoveries.wordpress.com/category/lego-mindstorms-rcx/. We haven't tested this. I hope this helps! If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact us at support@plugable.com.
the roku can out put on put types of video HDMI and Composite, just pick one best suited for your TV. The roku will come with composite video cables already in the box, you will have to buy an HDMI cable.
I love streaming Netflix on the Roku, but I believe there is also a lot of great free stuff that you can stream on the Roku, including many "private" channels or "beta" channels that aren't listed on Roku's web site. Try Googling "complete list of Roku channels" and look for this list on sites other than Roku's web site for a complete listing of channels. I love Netflix, but can also stay happily entertained with just all of the free channels that you can get on the Roku.
The answer is yes! I have my Roku connected via the RCA jacks (and two sets of RCA cables) like this: Roku --&gt; VCR line in --&gt; VCR line out --&gt; TV. Your VCR should have a "channel 0" or "line in" or "camera input" function. Set it to this channel and it will record anything the Roku plays. Have fun. :)
Yes. XDS is still supported. A firmeare update is issued now and then if it's needed. Regarding file formats...If your PC can view it, ROKU can move it to TV. Once you've connected a ROKU to the Internet, you can browse a STORE for new video providers, some free and some paid-for services such as Amazon, Youtube.com, TED, and many others. Some music services can also be found.
The great thung about these is that they come with different ear tips so you can use the one you like the most. I use the ones that are like sleeping earplugs that mold to the inside of your ear. VERY comfortable. Haven't felt soreness or warmness even in the sun
I am very impressed by the build quality. These are replacing a pair of Bose in-ears and the wires are noticeably/significantly thicker than the Bose, or any other set of earphones I have previously owned. These will last a long time.

Six feet. Had to use power cord extensions on both of the cameras. If I remember correctly 5 Volts. After you set it up and remove the CAT5 cable to verify it is now wireless, you can unplug it and place it any place that is in wireless range. I used a 20 cent blue electrical handy box to stuff the reset button and keep it out of the weather. One camera has been in 24-7 service outdoors for 12 years, still works like new camera.
Yes, for Windows Vista, 7 or 8 Control Panel, you can configure more than one playback output ie Speaker (Line-Out) and SPDIF-Out at the same time.
What is "less than optimal light"? Is it indoor lighting? Is it outdoor street lighting? Haven't had a chance to shoot in the night with the weather outside. Indoor, it seems be fine.
It works on my Fire 8.9.
Hello CC, Sorry for the delay. Yes, this Micro-HDMI cable would be perfect for your new ASUS Infinity Pad. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 Tue-Sat 9am to 6pm Eastern support@mediabridgeproducts.com
Not sure. That depends on whether or not the port on your computer is for mini HDMI. If it is then yes. If not then you will need the cable with both ends being full size.
Xfinity is Comcast's cable content. The Mediabridge Micro_HDMI to HDMI cable is to allow a tablet or phone to input a downloaded movie or video to a tv.The HDMI output from the tablet needs to go into an unused HDMI input on the tv, then use the "input selector" on the tv to select the tablet output. As long as the tv picture is set to "normal", 16 x 9 format, all should look good...
If you mean when running on battery, the built-in display will give you estimated runtime based on connected active load. If you mean when will battery/ies need to be replaced, that can vary greatly anywhere between two years and much longer. Once a year for the first two years, unplug UPS and see if estimated runtime matches actual runtime - if close batteries are still good. After two years maybe start doing this test every 6 months or so.
It's designed for use in the VERTICAL position. It makes ZERO noise when the battery isn't in use. Best UPS I've ever owned!
The software is for Windows only. There are Linux versions on the website. Their MAC FAQ says additional software is not needed because MAC OS has the functions built-in. QUOTE:Apple's OS X operating platform has a direct interface for UPS devices and utilize Apple's Energy Saver power management software. This software has the capability of reducing energy consumption and is compatible with all CyberPower UPS systems that feature an HID compliant USB port... Compatibility: OS X 10.4.1+ with Intel Chipsets. HID compliant USB port is required on the CyberPower UPS.
It has a battery gauge on the display and you can perform a self-test on it. I assume it would tell you after the self-test that it doesn't have the expected capacity.
I wouldn't consider it a waste by any means, but at the same token it wouldn't be living up to its potential either. I would strongly recommend something like the FiiO e6 amplifier. It's very small and light, about the size of an iPod Nano. Also costs only something like $25 (at least mine did), so it's not a large expenditure either, and yes it does make a difference!
I have not jogged with these but maybe I can give some insight. While they fit fairly tight on my head, they are a bit more heavy and I would suspect they could fall off while jogging. The cord is very long and could get in the way. They are normally quarter-inch and come with a big bulky adapter to 3/4 inch which I wouldn't find practical for jogging.
No, it is not loud at all. I also live in a dorm room and my room mate was surprised on how silent it is
No, it does not.
95 regular, 1 master FP , and 3 more operator FP's, plus it comes with two rfid tags
My husband is an electrician. He said he doesn't remember the specs. But he said if they are on the same meter he thinks it would work. Did you contact the company? I don't remember the distance. We have a 2 story that is 26 feet long and they work up, down and that distance. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
I don't have any problems with the unit. I just plug the memory card into my computer and view the asf video files with the windows media player.
After the SD card is filled, it loops itself and writes over the old videos.
No, you can set it so that it only comes on at dusk.
Supposed to be two, be advised mamp is less than panasonic, which will lower your range. ask for your second battery
The speakers work well with my galaxy S5 - plugs directly into your androids audio jack.
Absolutely. That's exactly what I use.
this device supports vga, otherwise you would need an adaptor. it allows you to use two pcs with one monitor, mouse and keyboard.
yes
No, it is not intended for that.
Good luck.
It can be shipped to Russia but it may cost a relative long time, approxiately 15-25 dyas.
Yes this lens works with the A580. I have the A580 for sale, the 80mm lens for sell, and the battery grip for sale on Amazon.
It is 50mm on a aps sensor and 35mm on a full frame. Normally landscapes are shot with a wider angle lens.
I am using it on the same SLR as yours, A580.
Roughly 2-3 inches from the back of the tv, the instructions from tv I purchased said to not tilt it, but the bracket is quite solid and would easily support my 80" when bolted directly to wall studs and tilted fully. Good luck.
Yes. It's awesome!!!!
Yes it does. Move any angle easily
Yes
Yes you would have to remove the case everytime you place your Droid on the dock. Unfortunately, this dock wasn't designed to allow you to leave any case on your phone while you have it docked.
This mount will not work on the Milestone 2. The USB charging port is not in the correct position.
7200 I believe
All the necessary cords, including international adapters for the power supply, are included in the box. Even the high speed, USB 3.0 is ready to go.
It is not intended to be "portable" as such. It certainly is small enough to be transported when travelling as long as it is pretty well protected from falls, severe bumps, etc. Practically speaking, I consider it a portable. As others noted, it requires a power "brick" and is not bus powered.
The Black drivers
No, but it does come with 6 SFF-8087 to SFF-8087 cables
I know the WD TV Live does. I had the NBOX v3 and returned it. Too buggy.
Not sure..mine is an S8100 but I think all coolpix are built from the same basic body My camera is 4'' x 2.25" x 1.25"
Yes
Yes.
I have no problems, I believe I was prompted to update once or tw i ce, no big deal. I paid 50 used about 2 years as go. My son has a Roku and loves it. I have a sony and a vizzio video streamer, a sony DVD player With wifi and a smart tv. I like them all, but sony's soft ware is easy to use.
Registered OK but the unit only worked for 15min then the GPS system went tits up. Lucky we weren't to far out on the ocean. Could not solve problem with phone tech had to send unit to service dept. Have not been back on the water to test. Hope it works!!!
Its only a 3.5 SATA hard drive connected to a USB 3.0 Its also backwards compatible with USB 2.0. Plug and play. But the manual does say either 2.5 or 3.5? I only used it for my desktop hard drive. I'm not sure how 2.5 would work.
works fine for macpro. so I assume it works for the air
My mouse still works fine. I think I clicked it over 1000 times :)
Does not come with a battery. Went to Batteries Plus and bought a Werker WAK12-9F2 gel cell (9AH) and a Noco Genius 750mA (.75A) charger. I put a 3 amp fuse on the +line to the sonar/gps.
Yes. I run mine off of the starting battery
Near the wrist connection. It uses your body as the ground
Have a similar problem-battery says charging but us always 0% and I can not unplug without it turning off. Called Asus-surprise they only warrenty the battery for 6 months. Very frustrating.
yes it works... I have a 60D. it works as a wireless trigger to take pictures and for the flash as well.
it works OK on a6000, I don`t have a35.
It is almost like a luggage fabric. Very strong. Highly recommend.
Good Luck, Nix May have replacements, I would check online. Perhaps there is a customer service number listed. Best Wishes.
No
Dell Inspiron 15 i15RV-1906BLK have two versions. One have built in dvd drive, the other one does not. If your model have a built in dvd drive, then you can use this drive.
Sorry but I don't know. I used on Windows 7.
There is no connection. The antennas are NOT removeable
No to naming individually and the only disable switch is for HT 20/40 coexistence. it seems to work great and I havent had any issues with any other equipment to this day. For the money it seems to be a really good router! Set up is very easy about 5 mins.
best still pic's ive seen and in HD.very high resolution. this cam is a must if into skype or other like things. auto focus, zoom, there isnt anything i would change, i even use the mic on it which is very powerful to play world of warcraft with since my head set went.
No, not 100%. The cam is recognized by OS X 10.8.2 (in my case) and can be used by facetime, Photo Booth .. etc. but in all Apple applications the picture is much to white. It
My voltage converted died after a few months.
The Sony explode 12 in sub is exactly 14.5 in tall, 6.5 in depth and 17.5 in wide
These are standard automotive type fuses. I bought them for use in my 5th wheel trailer converter, for the 12v circuits. Great price.
Regular size. A good price and functional.
I do not know if they are ATC Compliant. They are standard fuses that will fit in a normal automotive fuse box.
I also don't know about S4800. With my Fujifilm X-S1 it works fine. Arnold
I'm afraid I couldn't tell you. I had Best Buy look up what was needed, bought them on eBay and they worked perfectly.
YES! This screen was easy to install per instructions on a youtube video and is still working well.
To the best of my knowledge, it will, though I could be wrong. It depends on if the SE315 earbuds are removable as all new Shure units are. Please verify this before purchase but it should work with any modern iPhone as it uses the same protocol used by iOS 4 and above IIRC, maybe earlier but certainly every iOS version available from the iPhone 3G to the current iPhone 6. I'm pretty sure I was able to use them on my iPhone 3G.
26.2 feet long
2 fans but the led light is very dim and the ports are weak
This site is very helpful. https://militarycac.com/apple.htm
Yes, that is an ATX MAINBOARD as is the case. When looking at cases just make sure your main board type (ATX, MINI ATX, OR MICRO ATX) is supported. Most new cases will support all 3 with moveable standoffs for the main board screws.
The arm extends 22 inches from the main pole to the center of the board that holds the tablet. Keep in mind that the base needs to fit under your bed for you to use that full 22 inches. If the base won't fit under the bed, the distance from the edge of the base to center of the board is 15 inches.
Absolutely! This thing is way more durable than I could have ever imagined.
yes.. i have my ipad and my iphone on it at the same time....
In order to answer your question I lowered my LEVO stand to its lowest position and measured to the center of my reader. The distance is 30 inches.
I'm running W8.1 and it works with the built in windows driver just fine.
The battery eliminator (wall wart) that came with my unit was only the 110v unit. It is a hefty one at that. It only came with the one, so if you need the 220v version be sure to read the sales description CAREFULLY. Hifiman offers both versions. Basically it is a 16v @ 0.5 Amp converter that is extra heavy duty. If you don't see a 220 unit listed, I would search amazon.uk stores.
Thanks for your inquiry. The EF-2A has a built in DAC which uses the Burr-Brown PCM2702 chipset. Please let us know if you have any other questions!
This amp is intended for powering headphones only. Power output, as such, is probably too low for anything other than headphones. Note that typical headphones have maximum power handling capability of only about 0.1 watt. Also, amp output is analog only (USB is digital).
Mine doesn't at all. There seems to be some sample variation. My serial number is 2027526, manufactured in January.
No, the screen stays where it is.
I don't know how you play game on the DVD player. I bought it as a gift for someone. I don't believe that you can play games on them.
It is a Bluetooth keyboard so it should connect. But, if your device has the drivers in it, like Android does then it should work.
Yes
You do not have to, I am using my set without an ipod.
You have to pull the trigger.
Cold weather doesn't help. I personally throw deep cell rv battery into the jet sled and hook up the fish TV to it. Yeah its heavy, but the charge lasts for days on end.
I'm unsure. It comes with a dedicated USB wifi/bluetooth dongle that it pairs with; it does not pair as an independent device.
yes this includes the 18-55 mm lens.. I got mine 2 days ago..
I'm not sure. The model number isn't listed next to the product. Sorry I can't honestly say.
Yes, the software comes already built-in.
No
sorry can't help. I couldn't get it to email either
I thought the microphone worked great. Yes, recording conversations or interviews replays in great sound quality.
Hi Kenny, continuous playback is possible but is dependent on the battery life of the camera. -Vincent
I haven't had very good luck with either. The last Flip camera I owned stopped working for no apparent reason and the Sony Bloggies tend to shut down in the middle of recording. I purchased about 10 of these last year and have used all of them. This seems to be a problem with all 10 of them. I wouldn't really recommend either product to tell you the truth.
No. I made that mistake. Good camera but lousy in low light
No, files need to be transferred after filming.
well, for the video option its really depends what you dont want to miss. The t2i has manual controls over video. The Sony SLT's dont have. The Sony SLT has continuos autofocus for video mode. The Canon T2i doesnt have. So you have to decide what feature is more important to you: manual controls or autofocus? If you want both, better stick to Panasonic GH1, GH2 PS: There is somerumors about sony will release a new firmware to enable some controls over video. (It will be awesome).
Search Amazon for T-Ring or T-mount adapter. Have a search on Google too. You have to buy one for specifically for the Minolta/Sony mount. I think Celestron do them themselves too.
Not directly with the camera. You can use a WiFi SD Card like Eyefi to get the photos to your smart phone or tablet. Personally after using this camera I would skip it for a true DSLR or Mirrorless system camera. Olympus OM-D E-M10 would be a much better choice. IQ is so much better and has built in WIfi.
Yes u can best purchase ever
For the price they'll do the job for a little while, but I've had three of them now where the sync port came loose so I have to use them as slaves. If you're just practicing lighting, go for it. If you're looking for a professional setup, you might want to try something a little sturdier.
No It's a long, 52" is the correct length.
If I'm not mistaking I jus left it blank and pressed enter
I used you tube on it but the Os is dead I tunes won't update anymore . It's good if you use old adobe products on it . + Facebook works but for a little more you could go here and get a newer version .www.macofalltrades.com
No, it is not designed to be used with an iPad. In fact, I wouldn't recommend this item for anyone.
I would think could as they are wired speakers. You want to make the impedance matches. mine are,currently hooked up to a sony av system
I am no expert, but this speaker is a nice center speaker attached to our receiver. As long as you can connect it separately I don't see why it would not work.
I love it, it synchs to my Bluetooth fast when I get in the car. Clarity is good, holds a charge long!
works with any Bluetooth phone
Yes. It comes with a cigarette lighter charger for your car.
No. It's for the iPhone 4/4S
ePHOTOzine.com just published their full review of the K-5. Looks as if real-world performance matches the expectations raised by DXO. And the rest of the camera performs at that level. Hoya has succeeded in bringing Pentax along very nicely - this model competes very well indeed in the $1,000 to $2,000 price range. Canon and Nikon will have to work harder now and that competition is good for all of us.
I cannot tell you the difference between the various models, but I will tell you my s3's are very comfortable, noise blocking, but not to the point that someone cannot get your attention (ie stewardesses, etc.) and the sound quality is very good to excellent. I only use them for books, so I am not sure about music. But I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone.
Tight but yes it will fit and zip. I like it better than a sleeve and this still fits in my backpack nicely and keeps everything together.
I'd love to hear this too, after having the same problem with the S4i - sounds great, but connector comes apart from daily use.
To me, the sound quality on both is almost the same (I'm no audiophile). The key differences between the two are more in the physical characteristics. The S5i is supposedly built more rugged and is water resistant. The remote is huge though.
The DVD player works fine with me. When you install you need to make sure to take one screw out (that is for shipping purpose).
It will depend on where you will install it. If on the roof you want to water proof it and screw it into the rafters. You can mount it on a heavy piece of plywood and anchor it down with concrete blocks be careful if you have high winds, that they are anchored well to the plywood. On the ground, large log spikes work well. The size of the antenna you are installing on this will depend oh installation practices
You need to check with your Satellite provider. The tripod will hold any antenna.
No it only works when it is connected between the handset and the base of a corded phone.
For those who were patient enough and did not fall for this ridiculous offer, the Finepix X100 will be available April 30 !!
Yes
As someone who does photo editing for part of my annual income, I can definitely say that this is an excellent monitor for that purpose. Once you see your images on this 27" screen, you'll probably recycle your two 15" displays.
Yup. It's all the Logitech Unifying Reciever. Should work just fine. In fact i'm still using the old reciever from the first 1 of these i got. That way if it fails for some reason, i still got the new one in my closet. Unfortunately, don't expect the click buttons to last more then a year. It's a great product but the sensors in the buttons wear out faster then they should.
I believe it will work if you you can plug it into a USB port.
1.5 inches isn't a problem at all... It should easily fit
I do believe it does. I bought it for my blackmagic pocket camera and it works great. It should work on any lumix camera.
No, it wouldn't be. The Evolt is a 4/3 body. This is a Micro 4/3 lens.
The 1.7 lens has more glass and would be better indoors with no flash.
Yes.
A lens hood comes with the lens.
Each cloth ships in a clear plastic envelope that is roughly 2.5" x 6" tall. The actual cloths measure 5.9375" by 6.9375", very close to the stated 6" x 7" size. The edges of the cloths are cut in a saw-tooth pattern to prevent unraveling. Hope this helps.
Don't believe they are intended to be used with cleaner. I use cloths and alcohol pads.(seperately)
I purchased the 6 pack and they were in separate packages in one pouch.
The USB cord is included, and is permanently attached to the speaker.
This speaker connects to your computer's USB port. A Kindle's audio output (earphones or external speakers) uses a normal earphone jack, not USB. I imagine the same goes for your phone. So I'd say no, it won't.
Mine has flip out power plug. The light does turn off when charging is done.
Yes
The mic has two setting: 90` and 120`, which makes it somewhat omni directional. This mic only works on Sony DSLRs by virtue of the Sony hotshoe.
No
It starts from the beginning every time you turn it back on. I have mine set to random so I don't mind what order they are in.
you need only 1 pair with omitter the rest you don'T FROM WHAT I WAS TOLD AT BEST BUY
Yes, it connects via the 1/8 jack and sounds good.
Yes you can ...using line out from receiver to line in on equalizer then line out from equalizer to line in on receiver
The receiver itself does not have a usb port. I connected mine thru the headphone port with a rca jack on the other end. You can get this at Radio Shack.I ean they might have a usb with the rca jack on the other end , I don't know.
He uses them with a VW Android phone.
I thought that it works with all kinds of phones .. The description should say that it works well only on the galaxsy s4
That decision I cannot make or suggest one over the other. I would, however, suggest checking the "stats" between the two brands and then go with what you feel "comfortable" with, based on the "specs" and what your needs would be. Yamaha does put, I feel, more effort into their products to give you a satisfied performance and DO tend to be more "pricy" than other brands because of their use of techknowledgy to make a better product. Sorry I can't elaborate more and hope that you find this useful.
I don't know how far you are from WQXR, but I listen to WCPE, an all classical station located about thirty-five or so miles from me here in North Carolina, and the Yamaha does a fine job with that, so I would answer your question "yes." In fact, I have only had the Yamaha receiver for a month or so and I am quite pleased with it so far. The Yamaha replaced a rather old Yamaha tuner and NAD integrated amp, and the new receiver is a noticeable improvement.
Actually, we have 18 speakers running through our speaker selector, from this receiver. Of course we do NOT run them all at the same time. We have four old Mach I speakers we use together in one room, otherwise we usually use two pair, one pair per room at the same time. We have doing this for a couple years now without issue. Of course, you can decided what total impedance you have based on your speakers, and set the impedance switch on the amp, and possible on your speaker switch if it also has one.
Mine have also been turning off when hot. Now that I've seen that you also have had this problem, I think I'll return it. I thought it was only mine!
Gao..I'm not sure what you're asking.
The ibeats are like an older version of urbeats. Sound quality is very similar no major difference between the two. I hope that helps
Mine works great! Use the quick set button and click the 3D button on the TV remote until you get the blended picture. You may have to click it twice. Read your instruction booklet. I watched the movie with the zombies..something about afterlife..anyway...can't recall the title it was in 3D there's one scene where the woman is blasting zombies with a shot gun full of quarters and I was sure I would have to pick them up off the floor! Sports are incredible in 3d.
I solved all mt sound problems and eliminted all the RCA plug by using an optical video/audio cable directly from my Kenwood receiver to the TV. Sound great!
Yes, It works just like the orginal.
No it's not. But I've used mine multiple times and absolutely no trouble. Awesome back up battery!!!
It's a grip that is also a battery expansion pack that let's you use two batteries at once with your DSLR.
It sounds to me that you actually want one of those soundbar solutions. These have multiple inputs that will accommodate multiple channels. You definitely don't want to combine the left/right/center outputs of your receiver (amp, or other media source) and connect them to the SINGLE speaker input which the Primus has. That's a recipe for disaster, and will damage the receiver. If your receiver lets you send a mono signal to all channels you might send that one signal everywhere, including this center channel, but I doubt anyone would find that satisfactory.
Purist recommend the same brand and model for front speakers because they have the same timbre. However, if you're referring to the sub, I don't see a problem.
It doesn't support RCA digital(coaxial) output...
Yes it should, but it will be painfully slow. This is actually a question that should be directed to Delkin's support people. They can give you a more certain answer.
No it doesn't have a pause, just the square red record button that you push to start and stop. It is very basic, but it does zoom and take both video and stills and the reason we bought it was for underwater filming while SNUBA diving and snorkeling.
I may work, but will not increase the performance because you are don't meet the system requirements.
I think it's incredible! I have 3, i use in a voiceover recording studio, one for a radio station, and one for mobile dj.l
Doesn't have IR for night viewing
Yes, it does work with galaxy 4
Yes it can. I have a D7000 with a 18-200 lens I keep on my camera all the time and it fits fine without even unzipping the extension to the bag. With a longer lens and hood I just unzip the extra length of bag and it fits fine.
Don't know for sure, I would think so. I have a 300mm canon lens and I don't have to unzip the extension.
It fits but you have to unzip.
I believe so. Its not high quality but will get the job done if u don't have other options for sound
Yes it plugs into the wall and charges for 5 hours of battery life. But you can only operate one of the screens off battery, which worked fine for my kids on the plane, we just got a headphone jack splitter so they could both listen.
Yes it comes with a car adapter that has a wire to split between the two screens...
I am certain that it will fit your processor.
Anyone have an answer if this works with an XM receiver?
I'm not sure if that would fit. I have a CDA 9887 and used a Monster iCable 1000. It works perfectly and has a very long cable.
Sorry, I do not recall if it has a tab key, it said that it would work for my phone but it did not so after complaining to the company, it went into the trash.
When I ordered the item it didn't even turn on. I wish I could help
yes
rubbery bendable
Yes you get all ten
yas
yes it does
you get all of the colors
As of I know this fit in D7000 series. You may need check your connector if it is like D7000 or 7100!!
Yes
No. It will not. I recommend going directly to Apple to purchase any protection plans.
no. no envelopes of any kind are included.
About 1/16 of an inch.
The manufacturer's brochure claims it has a 2.1 : 1 zoom lens, so width could vary from 10"wide/foot throw, down to 5.7"wide/foot throw. Yes? You can find the full manual on the Epson web site.
Yes.....in the original box and No.....no remote. It is pretty basic.
Yeah it don't work to good.
I've just wrote a paragraph explaining something completely wrong lmao just sayin :p but yes it SHOULD work but save ur money for something better!!
Adam, you could try to send an email to nvidia customer support,
Yes, it definitely does.
I used it on my sailboat to mount a 20" TV in the captain quarters. It holds its position, even on a rocking boat. Excellent product.
the piece attached to the wall bracket is 7", the one attached to the plate is 5". Both measured center point to center point.
Once fully mounted with tv included it is around 9 1/2 to 10 inches away from the wall.
If you want video recorded, you must install a disk drive internal to the unit. You cannot use the drive on a computer running Windows. The installation uses SATA cables just like a computer so nearly any SATA drive will work.
Yes one can view online. Your router has to have the right ports open and you need to allow it an internet connection inside the camera software. The hand book is pretty good. As well as Swann if you call them.
My D5100 attached with 55-200mm nikon lens fit in my bin 37, i suppose it will fit yr 70-300 attached to D5100. However if you need bigger space, suggest you to get the 47.
I'm not sure how big an ipad mini is, to be honest. I just measured it in comparison to an iPhone, and it seems to be about 1.5 times the size of an iPhone (by that I mean the length is about 1.5 times the size of an iPhone as is the width). Hope that helps.
Yes, I think it will, however, atemospheric issues like condensation may be an issue at times.
the specification for the power unit should be listed on your unit. Personally, i would just order a new tip for yours. I dont recall the specs on this one. i threw it away, as i only wanted the tip and wire.
Yes it works with any of the Hero cameras including the basic HERO
Although I do not uses this brand of board. It appears it will support this memory.
Not really.
yes bro.
Those questions have nothing to do with this device. You plug your USB cellular data dongle (normally plugged into a laptop) into this device, and it distributes the Internet connection via WiFi. Dongle compatibility is the only valid question.
No. It's for USB 3G/4G modems and USB phone tethering only.
I don't think you'll have a problem, however it is overclocked at 1866 as opposed the 1600. So although it may work, you won't be able to use it 1866mghz. You'll have to use it at 1600mghz. Just in case here is a link to the official qualified vendors list: http://support.asus.com/QVL.aspx?SLanguage=en&p=1&s=24&m=Crosshair%20III%20Formula&os=&hashedid=2Y4dQFaJ6gPN18cQ
Yes, it will work just fine. Ignore the first guy, who posted the specs of the motherboard and apparently didn't read them. It says it will work with RAM running at 1866, and that's exactly what this is. Just be prepared to give it a little extra voltage to get the RAM stable at 1866.
Hello, This piece is compatible with the 29 pin LAN systems through GM.
Yes
Yes. They are standard size as far as I can tell. They worked great for our needs
1440x900
Either Samsung or LG
This is the actual keyboard. In order to use this keyboard you basically have to dissect your MacBook to replace the existing keyboard. I did it for my own MacBook and it was totally worth it. Just be careful if you decide to try it by yourself because any warranty will be void.
Yes. I've installed on my MacBook Air. So far the battery life is better than other I've tried. Good Luck.
According to the model number compatibility, this should be compatible with your Macbook
Nope just the plastic unibody
Not sure if all 240mm liquid coolers have standard dimensions, but for example CORSAIR Hydro Series H105 would fit with some room to spare. The space up top is about 200mm wide, more than 300mm long and at least 30mm deep.
Yes, of course, because has incorporate a removal adapter to use with camera shoe or tripod fastener. I took some pictures to upload them but it does not give me the option.
You can use this with ANY camera. This LED light is powerful and has a rechargable battery. It is light weight and very bright. It is not specific to any camera. Has a cold shoe mount or 1/4 inch mount.
This type of hood has an intermediate ring that screws into the filter thread and it has a lock ring to position the hood. If the filter fits, the hood fits. Whether the hood will or won't mask the corners depends on the focal length of the lens. I cannot help you more than that. For the price it's not a great risk! Good luck.
Try mounting a speed light for Nikon or Canon on your fujifilm camera. If those fit, odd are that the cube will fit also.
Yes
As far as I know, yes. How ever I had a protection plan via applecare that expired and I tried to re-new it only to find out it is not re-newable. So when it runs out, you're on your own.
Yes it is
On the Google site it says that they still support Xoom devices
there is a pogo app in the play store but you are limited to 5 games (sweettooth, word whomp, turbo 21, poppit, and worldclass solitaire) I thinck more may be added, but are not stable.
Yes you can, while an scheduled recording is in progress you can watch any other program.
Only if you are showing pictures. The resolution is so grainy it is almost impossible to read text. Spend the extra money to get an HP projector.
I have a solid white wall, but people have stated that silver screens work best. The farther back you are then the blurrier the picture, and the closer you are the sharper the image. The audio is extremely loud keep in mind that this to overcome the sound of the fan motor which is LOUD. Look, I am not going to lie to you this thing is not really great for anything but watching porn. The picture quality is too poor for enjoying real movies. This thing would be awesome if the company invested in higher quality parts.
There are two small Phillips screws that hold the base on. One is hidden under one edge of the informational/serial number sticker. I easily partially peeled it away, removed the screws, and re-stuck the sticker.
i have a computer.
Most certainly,it will run that phone & several other items at the same time without any delays
nope... here's a list of apps that it can and can't use: http://cruzsupport.velocitymicro.com/link/portal/5462/5758/Article/853/What-apps-are-compatible-with-the-Cruz-Tablet-T100-series-or-T301
The tablet uses most of the free apps at freewarelovers.com/android (there are thousands of apps there). Just download onto the tablet and install. You cannot use Android Marketplace now and unless you want to (and know how to) root the tablet, you will never be able to utilize that marketplace but with thousands of apps available at freewarelovers it really doesn't matter.
I am not sure what kind of output a Canon 450 DSLR has.....what I do know is the monitor has two inputs which are both RCA inputs (AV1 and AV2). Hope this helps!
There is only one space for the disc in back of the cover space. So you would need to use the next slot over for the extra disc. The disc slots are shorter than the cover slots so you can get the dvd out easily. Conceivably you could put the extra dvd in back of the paper cover but it would be inconventient.
Regular
Package said 8 years. You applies the paste when you are going to clean the heat spreader every time you are going to clean the CPU. It harden when it get really hot the CPU with the time
As far as I can tell the amp is activated in the software. Only time it wont be amped is if you turn it off or use optical out.
This card has a virtual surround processing chip built in. It will will produce surround sound on regular stereo headphones. You don't need a "surround sound headphone". I use a pair of Audio Technica AD-700 stereo headphones with this card and they sound amazing with the surround sound turned on. the card also has a built-in headphone amp which makes a big difference in sound quality when you plug in your headset. There are also various surround settings that you can tune and modify to your liking.
I personal believe it is the power flow back from you external HD to your notebook. Disconnect the USB, restart your notebook. (I assume you are using notebook, and is a turn off and turn on no response issue. )
I'm not sure how to answer your question, you can contact Seagate at their toll free number, I have used Seagate external hard drives for years, I am on Windows 7, and it does back up images.
Yeah, they will work as long as the screens have the entry in the back, it should be fine.
You can set it to do either one in the OS.
i think the expansion port you have is for the dock it's rectangular... this DP has one beveled corner
Yes. It works both ways...
You already have one monitor hooked up via HDMI/DVI, then probably you will have just an analog VGA port available. If that is the case then you have no choice but connect up the other monitor using the VGA port. The VGA cable should come with your monitor, so you won't need to buy an adapter or cable.
This works fine with my Panasonic AF-100.
It is not in dash. It has a mount that you install. The unit itself can be removed from the mount and stored in a more secure location.
call Humminbird, they are easy to get thru to & always very Helpful
Per bestbatt.com, the Nikon EN-EL 15 battery fits the D800/D800E, D600, D7000/D7001 and the V1/1V1. I hope this helps.
http://extreme.outervision.com/psucalculatorlite.jsp use that to calculate your average usage. Don't take it to heart either, I'm assuming you'd need a 750 to make that setup work flawlessly specially if you are willing to OC.
Don't see why not if the width and length are the same (I thinks most are all universal fits) and it has the connectors you need. I replaced a 500 watt power supply with this one. Maybe Dell support can tell you more. And it's very quiet.
Yes, it has 4 6+2 pin pci-e plugs. So you could run two gtx 760's if you want.
Yeah work perfect...
In my opinion, these speakers have a very good mid range. I have some Infinity Towers, so I use these as rears, but if I didn't have the towers, these would be very good clear, and open speakers with a sub. I listened to a lot of book shelves, but to me these had the best mids of all. Very clean.
Hmm. Good question. I play DVDs directly in my computer. But if you want to hook up the Toshiba multi-region to your PC and are playing another region DVD in in it, I wonder if the PC will reject that other-region DVD?
mine is six feet long
yes this is
Australia power is 230V 50 HZ. Your Australian products probably needs 230v this to work. The Seven Star 200 converts 230v to 120v. So, any Australian product that need 230 will NOT be supplied by the Seven Star 200.
not for me was not working
Does your HDTV have an HDMI out port or at least component cables to hook up to the input of the DVD recorder? I doubt it does so it is highly unlikely that you could record from the TV. In order to be able to record anything you need an input source that has its own tuner, or cancels the need for a tuner, as this recorder does not have one built in, but without some type of input source there will be nothing for the recorder to record
It is. You just can't tell because there is only so much that up-conversion can do. It isn't some magic wand that suddenly turns 480p into 1080p. All it does is enhance what is there, if there isn't enough there to be properly enhanced you wont see much difference.
It fits my Pentax K-5 ii with an 18-135 WR lens, which is a much bigger camera. I'd assume the SX20 is a safe best.
Not sure of the size of yours but it fit my canon 70d slr. It also stayed dry while I snorkeled in carribean. One issue I had is you can press down on camera release button but you're not sure if the picture is taken as camera sometimes takes its time to focus. So I found pressing half way to let it focus then pressing all the way worked better.
Vizio's website shows it is in stock. So amazon and costco et al should get it soon.
no
Windows 7 home premium
No.
No, you can't get unlimited data. You have to choose how many gigs you want to purchase. If I remember you can purchase up to 30 gigs.
L.F. most likely stands for LotFancy, the seller. Some of their other items are prefixed with the whole name, LotFancy.
It will if you ground the parking wire.
No
Speakers are not defendant on file types. If the plug on the speakers fits the jack on the music player, it's compatible.
I'm thinking that it would be. The speaker on these are great! Hope this helped you. I love mine
Well it plays blu ray and dvd movies as well as music CDs. So it should be able to play audio books on a cd disc but if your asking if you can read books on the funai player the answer is no. Hope this helps.
No, only Netflix, cinema now and vtuner.uses WiFi for those three.
It came with everything needed to clean hundreds of records. Follow instructions. Later you can order more cleaning fluid as needed. Also, if scrubbers ever wear out you can order more. Already comes with extra set. I think it's great
Yes, sure
It should. The drive is SATA 3, and the motherboard has SATA 3. 6 Gb/s. Best of all, my answer agrees with the previous answer. :)
i have all ways used blue, never had a problem with blue hd. Western Digital Caviar Black VS Blue.&gt;&gt;http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-1858471/western-digital-caviar-black-blue.html
Quite easy. Smooth out any wrinkles/creases by running thumbs from inside to outward edges of the dish. Connect wire to dish and then to the transformer and plug in.
Yes
I have the same dish. The heater works well. You will need to place the wires on the front of the dish rather than the back side.
Satellite is a laptop isnt it? If so then no. You need a laptop hard drive
Dont go by what the picture says. Go by what the title tells you.
None of these will work with that Panasonic TV as that Panasonic uses RF for synch (not IR, which these glasses use). You can get the Samsung SSG-5150GB 3D glasses and they will work fine (Full HD 3D RF glasses).
Yes
Mounted, the scope is approximately 33" in length. The base is approximately 15" in diameter. Very easy to store, since it weighs about 25 pounds and can sit on just about any table, or even in the corner of a room. Very compact for its power and range. It's attractive enough to be part of any room. Definitely recommend this scope!
It does. That is the reason I bought it as well because it fit it. It was snug though but still fits.
This is only a case to be worn on your arm. It's not an MP3 player.
This is not for camera... It's for mp3
If you want to access it from outside your network, you'll need to know your external IP (or have a dynamic DNS hostname set up) and have any routers/firewalls configured to allow traffic in to the camera IP address.
Yes, the bracket is included. If you mount it from the ceiling, the camera will be upside down. Be sure to check the boxes labelled "Flip" and "Mirror" on the main control panel screen that appears in your browser window. Otherwise, you will be looking at an inverted, flipped image.
This is NOT battery powered. It has a power supply that provides 5 VDC to the camera. With a third party video security program such as Blue Iris or Evocam, you can schedule recording until the disk on your computer or network storage device is full. Three days is nothing!
I think will fit any car. The only thing to take in account is the angle of the hole. If the bend angle is too big the nut to tight will not reach the tread
No it does not have that capability
Do not believe it will
i think it will work with an iphone 5 as far as blue tooth music streaming but i recommend you to look at the new models that pioneer has with the new iphone 5 adapters.
It's been recommended to me to use a "y" splitter to run the single out to both inputs.
If it were me, I would first try to contact the manufacturer via email with product model number and get their reply in writing. If that fails, use the telephone to call tech support or if they don't know, get transferred to engineering.
This will protect your pc as well as your phone. I have another one of these to protect my counter top convection oven. However, make sure you read the part that tells you what the wattage will accomodate.
There should be no problem, but if your plug from the phone is wide you will need to put an extension the surge protector, because is close to the wall.
Depends, you need to find the product that comes with a strap and a cardiac monitor, because you can only buy the clock.
Yes. For the small amount being charged, I think the tripod is great. I have used it many times while taking pictures of the Super Moon and stars
Yes you can use it without the Dolly. Especially when you want to take still pictures.
Yes it's canon lens that comes along.
I love this set. Brand new. Came quick. I dont go many places without it.
Yes the d3000 has the Nikon F-Bayonet and the 55mm will fit http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product-Archive/Digital-SLR-Cameras/D3000.html http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/2137/AF-Nikkor-50mm-f%252F1.8D.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-TechSpecs
yes, all the 500's use the same base.
I don't know..I bought it for an old computer that doesn't have wireless technology and it works great! Don't know if that helps.... :/
I've been using mine with Windows 7 with no problems it really isn't specific to your OS.. so I would say it would work with 8
They should work fine with such headsets, considering the PIN arrangement is the same as on Samsung headsets. However, your control buttons won't work (although this is true for any headset you use).
Sent to me broken....
I would love to know as well. I seriously doubt it though since from what I understand the 1215N wasnt alone it that issue. I wish they would have put an Athlon II Neo dual core cpu (K325 or higher) in this machine, would jump on it. The Athlon II Neo K125 only has a PassMark score of 477 while the Atom D525 in the 1215N gets 720. which itself is low!
CS6 said to "demand" Quadro, on the Adobe site. Other sites say Quadro not great gaming card. A fork in the road for you, I think.
Yes- they are active shutter 3d glasses and should have no problem working!
Well... I can't say how many charges they'll take, but the first two charges of mine have lasted over 20 hours (I think the first charge was around 30 actually) so I don't think you'll have to worry about them dying on you anytime soon... at least I hope not. If you're really worried, just go and get the older glasses that use watch/button batteries... that's the safest bet, I guess.
Sometimes it takes a few seconds for the SD card to be recognized. Some SD cards don't work. Try a different SD card brand and also unplug and also take the batteries out. The unit resets, and you should be good to go.
Dont know..I'm interested in a remote as well. I'm looking at the Olympus LS-20M which is coming out and has a remote capability, but no zoom function.
No audio is recorded
Highly unlikely. The front axles are different between the 99 and the 2003 and later.
Yes
I believe it's referring to gigs with the g. That's it
I would suggest the fanless Zotac GT 430 for an HTPC. Amazon carries it and Maximum PC used an older GT 240 model for their ultimate HTPC build. Plus, the GT 430 is the only current card with lossless-HDMI audio. Here's the link: www.amazon.com/Zotac-Fanless-GeForce-128-Bit-PCI-Express/dp/B00471D1OA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1295644926&sr=8-1
The are sold as a pare
A 800WH has more power and better sound.
12 Guage wire is plenty. I used 12 Guage for my in wall runs. I purchased my speakers along with two spools of the speaker wire below from Amazon. Cable Matters 12 AWG In-Wall Rated (CL2) Oxygen-Free Bare Copper Speaker Cable 100 Feet
Thanks for your question. First of all, I do not have a Bose QC 15, but am using a Beats by Dr. Dre which has the single connection 3.55mm jack and has in line microphone. I purposely purchased this Woodees for the sole purpose to be able to use the Beats and its inline microphone with my laptop and it performs great. I also like the quality of this Woodees version. While more expensive, it is made of high quality.

Just AC. Will not work off of batteries.
No, I use it with my older touch. With the new touch you will need the Bluetooth version of this.
Mine came with 110V.
Call Sony reader support at 1 8669627669. Sony has quit making readers but will transfer us to some Canadian reader mfger but believe Sony still have tech support on their readers.
I have not experienced any issues with this product. I woild recommend this product for use at home or business. No interference issues either. At first i was doubtful about this product, but am highly satisfied. It works well to woth my linksys router.
It comes with a Two-Year Projector Limited Warranty and a 90-Day Lamp Limited Warranty
Not that I see
It works but the HDMI cable on the other end is bulky and it tends to break the micro connector if you don't handle it very carefully. I would recommend buying an adapter that has a small flexible cable between.
It doesn't come with one, but I'm sure you can always buy one! :)
I honestly don't know. I use mine with a Samsung 7000 series. Is the TV Active Shutter or Passive Polarization? They are designed for Active Shutter.
Can't answer this question since I don't have an Iphone(don't have a cell phone period).
they plug directly into your speaker outlet on a puter or ipod
I haven't done any tests myself to verify that this monitor is as advertised, so the best I can do is refer you to this article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_depth . It explains the definitions, and you can refer the section "Industry Support" for a couple examples of cards that support this.
No. The Kindle Fire uses micro-USB connectors while this card reader has a full size standard USB connector. The only way you can use this device with your Kindle Fire is if you also got a female USB to male micro-USB cable adapter. A better option would be getting a Micro USB Host OTG Card Reader, which would not require an adapter to use.
420 Lines of Resolution. This camera does not have an internal battery. It is designed to be used with portable DVRs that have an output of 5 volts. It does come with a 9Volt battery holder for use with a standard 9 volt battery for use with other types of video recorders.
TV with rca plugs any recording device with rca plugs
Yes, it will work on any Micro Four Thirds Mount Camera. Panasonic and Kodak included.
I do not think so, we have had problems with the one we bought.
They come in a Duracell box
did this end up happening or is there still no solution for the Beatbox Wifi?
Yes
It'll run on any 12v battery
Mine does that too ... I think it is a glitch but to stop it take it off auto depth and that should take care of it
Yes if you are crafty IE mounting of the transducer and unit itself, plus the battery.
It is a plastic clip that wraps around the collar and connects to the power cord. The collar is water resistant and has no plug-in holes. The clip has the plug-in hole for charger and the charging sensors for the device. One comes with the Garmin set...but I got a spare so I can keep one at home an one in truck for field charging.
26? Stranded
If you're talking about transferring game save files and stuff no. This is used as a hard line connection from the router to laptops, computers and game systems. You probably need to go to Microsoft forums to figure data transfer out
Yes, it should work well with the Canon t3i. I use mine with the Canon t2i.
Yes
The paperwork says: Although this flash unit has been equiped with numerous functions, depending on the camera model being used, some functions may have some limitations. A type cameras: E-TTL (ETTLII) Compatible EOS SLR cameras. B type camearas: All other EOS cameras except those listed above.. I find that a bit confusing but I hope this helps. Bob G.
hi, yes, the flash is compatible with the Nikon d80----here is a list of all the cameras it is compatible. Nikon: D1, D1H, D1X, D2X, D2Xs, D2H, D2Hs, D3, D3x, D3s, D100, D200, D300, D300s, D700, D3100, D5000, D5100, D7000, D90, D80, D70, D70s, D60, D50, D40, D40x Fujifilm: FinePix S1 Pro, FinePix S2 Pro, FinePix S3 Pro, FinePix S5 Pro
It works perfectly with both of Pentax DSLR cameras. Sigma does have the same flash for Nikons and should work well. Not sure aboutbremote use.
It Should but I would visit Sigma's website to be certain. Since the D5200 is a new model there may be features that won't be available...
Not happy with this product. It would keep my music selection. It did'nt rip well. It dose'nt come w a manual info.
Yes you can connect multiple music players like your iPods and play the music on the iPod boombox.
I relied worth nothing I asked for a refund.
Check the specs on the actual Sanus web site. I have a 60 inch Panasonic Plasma on my LF228 and it works great. Amazon says it will only accept up to a 58 inch. The difference between the two is the size of the TV is will hold. The Sanus site has mount finders for your exact TV so you can be sure it will fit. I am very happy with my LF228 though It doesn't work with "finger tip control" it is easy enough to reposition.
DON'T buy this product. Mine stopped working after about 8 months and I could not get anyone at the company to respond to my inquiries. I tried calling all the numbers on the website and they just referred me back to the website. I also sent two emails and they never responded either. Finally I called Amazon and they also tried to contact the company with no response. Amazon was wonderful and refunded my money immediately.
Near the end of the Product Description it says... Connector: N Female
OE2 version is on ear, AE2 is around ear. The AE2 version (in my experience) leaks much less sound and has better passive noise cancellation than the OE2 model.
Diane, these will be great for tv. You will hear sounds you never heard from the tv speakers. You may also want to consider a good quality sound bar with sub woofer. I have one and it is fantastic.
NO! They cut down on ambient noise but a loud item such as a chain saw or lawn mower is out of the question! If I pay attention I can hear what my wife is trying to tell me, while I have them on
I have a E-PM2 and it fits. E-PL7 is about the same size, so it will fit.
I can't see any reason that it wouldn't work. Will not allow electronic viewfinder.
Brightness cannot be adjusted, however you can adjust contrast by: Pressing the MENU/SHUFFLE button 5 times. You'll see "CONT:10" on the display. Adjust the contracts to your desired level by pressing the &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt; buttons. For further assistance, please email support@satechi.com. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
I am not a computer tech person, but I have bought computer after computer only to have them slow down after about a year and every 2 years I had to buy a new one. Apple computers no matter how old seem to last longer and be just as fast as when I purchased it, making it not only a great purchase but a great investment!
No, it just sends more power thru the micro USB connection.
I do not understand the question but if if the camera can be used by cable and not wireless , if it works properly and bandwidth local wifi is not going to use but if you send over the Internet, whether to use the bandwidth of the internet , if not used by then did not use internet bandwidth.

Yes, I believe that is a standard Matt size and it works beautifully. You'll be surprised how good your matts look..
The only thing that I noticed is when working on it for some time the fan turns on pretty loud. Other then that very good MacBook Air.
I dont know
Probably, wrong listing.
Sorry, it does not.
I use it on my MacBook, IPad, IPhone, plasma and HDTV and it works perfectly. No streaking. Just DON'T spray directly on the screen. Spray a bit on a microfiber cloth (provided). I do it when the device is not in use doing it in a soft, gentle circular motion.
Yes it does fit the Lumix ZS20 and it fits well. The case is padded and I feel it is impact-resistent.
I don't know the exact number but when I have it all packed up in the carrying case it's right at or maybe right under my 35lb dumb bell. Hope this helps.
Pretty tall but you can make it shorter too
Yes in general operation... unable to confirm durability.
none of these functions ever worked for me, the one i had would play a CD for a while although very slow to pull menu from they it play but then it just quit working, the one they sent to replace the first one would not work at all, these things are just junk in my opinion, I wouldn't waste my money on another one.
Yes. But...you have to use the USB attachment for the words to appear on the screen.
I have no idea about the mp3 player. It's a piece of junk, don't get it. It fell apart the first day.
Yes. The portable hard drive copies everything that is on your hard drive including saved game data and downloaded content. The only data that is not saved to the external hard drive is is your game trophies. Those have to be saved manually on the PlayStation network server which can be done by you on the same ps3 console.
not sure, I run pc with windows 8....

It's real leather... They use a different environmental friendly way of treating the leather. I've had mine for over a year. I use it for my tattoo portfolio and it's viewed daily. Do far it's held up well
Please don't buy it doesn't work! Can't even get the installation disk to load. Invest in the Sabrent usb 3.0
No
YES IT CAN PLAY AUDIO BOOKS. it comes with some snipets of James Pattersons books already installed.
Hello Brenda W. yes this unit comes with a 90 day warranty from Seller and 1 year from manufacturer. This is a great product, made exceptionally well, and you can buy with confidence knowing product comes with our full support.
Yes, the strap loops on the J1 are big enough for the small nylon straps at the ends of the large strap.
I think it will split the output on anything. I have my headphone w/mic and my speakers hooked up. I have my microphone from my webcam mic hooked up and they work fine. It works on input and output splitting.
Yes! This works with IOS7. I'm listening to music from my iPad mini through my Bose Wave Radio. Yippee
You can if your computer has the bluetooth specifications.
six
Yes. This will work with all of the iPod headphone jacks.
Yes they should be compatible, because they work with other Panasonic Plasma TVs.
That is a weird question. Most likely the answer would have more to do with my music tastes than how the speakers perform(most people don't listen to all types of music). The speakers sound great hooked up to my TV and any songs from movies or TV come through really clean. Hope that helps. If you must have an answer, Chiptune(best sounding music type) sounds great on them.
Yes it should fit into the SD card slot next to your cd slot on the right side on your desktop
Nope
Not sure, but this battery only lasted about 6the months. It won't even register anymore. The computer says there's no battery.
This battery works just fine with my Sony Vaio laptop. No issues whatsoever.
Yes. For both ends.
As soon as I get mine I will let you know
Hi Terry, All of orders are shipped from USA, we have fulfilment centers in Midwest, east coast and west coast with in USA.
No you can't. You can only text from it that's if you activate the service on it. Its only available in the UK. But not in the us because they disabled it. You can try to find an app in the android market.
That second "stick", as you put it, should be spring loaded and depress when you put the camera on. It should not be an issue.
no, NO too weak for the weight
SURE WILL
yes its perfect
The Cutout Dimensions are Cutout Dimension: 14 &#8539;" (W) x 7" (H) you can find the PDF here http://content.miccastore.com/sites/default/files/203/Micca%20M-CS%20Manual.pdf
To install door speakers you need to find out the Mac mounting depth of your door. Compare that with the mounting depth of the Polk speakers. Also you will need to drill new holes, so make sure you have a drill bit set and a drill.
No it fits on my cannon t4i..
It fits my lens cap; camera is Canon SX500...there is elastic on the sides of the pocket and it stretches pretty well. Love this strap; buy one you will not regret it.
Lol. Hmmm. Until encountering the hot, hot summer months last year I would have totally thought that an odd question. If your perspiring and its directly on your neck, it develops a weird 'plasticky' kind of odor. Not a bad, funky, 'sweaty tee shirt' smell, but kind of like a chemical plastic smell. I just wipe off with a damp rag and from time to time will use a little talc on the back of my neck to reduce moisture. I hope this answer helps.
I used it to project my video camera through my tv
I would recommend you contact the seller. They are really quick at replying. Great battery but I followed the charging instructions to a tee.
(This message is from the manufacturer) Thanks for asking ahead! The power adapter is rated for 100-240V (input), so it will handle the different input voltages world-wide. But note that physically, it's a US-style two-prong (NEMA 1-15) plug - so you'll just need a plug converter to make it fit the different international plug styles. Hope that helps. Thanks again!
Yes, it does. However, the caveat is that you must enable airplane mode first. Just disabling the wifi won't cut it. I don't know why this is, just that it works. Blame the driver developers at Toshiba.
yes
No
I use it with a Macbook Air, but I don't see why it wouldn't work with other Mac models.
Yeah for a cheap product it does not stay together very well; There really is no way to put it back together unless you somehow manage to do it.
This won't work with a speed light..it's too big for that!
It's for Canon FD mounts, The new ones are EF I believe. The FD lenses were discontinued in the early 90's. You also have to shoot in manual mode as autofocus will not work.
No
No you should be able to as long as you can change the dvd drive code for that particular board. Every board has a specific dvd drive code.
im not sure. the way i figured it out was watching youtube videos. i know there is an easy way to tell which drive you need, but i can't remember. good luck. also i know that the is a piece of the old drive you will need to unsolder from the original and solder into the new unit.
Yes, this is model for my 360 Elite. I guess my system was modded (I bought it used) It would not play any games. was able to read dvd's but not games. Took it apart switched the lens and now my 360 works like new.
Yes the seats flip down. It's a snug fit in my truck but they do go down
Just under 10 ft.
No, it does not. They all come on little individual plastic bags, but thats about it
Yes, the Nexstar 4SE is compatible with any 1.25" eyepiece including this, but it will not fit 2" eyepieces.
I can tell you right now it does not fit the Samsung Galaxy Tab... sigh.
I don't know. Your best bet is to go to Radioshack or Best buy and ask them.
Yes it should, from what I understand the cord fits all Canon model printers.
I use the photogenic power lights with a portable battery pack and it works great.
You dont need an adapter for Balcar/Alien Bees. Fits perfectly.
They sell a add on that makes it work with hotshoe flashes. However, said add on is poorly made and doesn't hold so the weight of the dish makes it fall forward unless you have it perfectly balanced....which is useless. I read a comment where a customer bought a heavy duty lockingbolt from the hardware store that fixed the problem. I don't like having to fix new things but it is probably the best option. P.S. This dish is huge
What kind of strobe? it fits on me Allen Bee's and white lighting
I don't know the exact width, but it extends about 4 or 5 inches past the green screen cloth on both sides. I hope that helps.
The Dell computer I installed it into only had a bit above 2 Ghtz of power and it had no problem operating with that low a source so anything you have above 2 Ghtz will work fine.
This battery works great for my Ideapad Z560.
I wasnt able to get it to work. Sent it back. Bought a game camera instead for 52.00 and got great bird pics. I bought different adapters for the birdhouse camera. Dont waste your time and energy.
sure it comes...
Yes all Ubiquiti products come with a POE power supply.
Yes
I used a very old sony vaio and it worked very well. Do not forget to remove the jumper for the pc to boot.
Yes, it is a great purchase for my current laptop, I had an accident with the old one and this is working great so far
I bought these for my grandsons. They are their favorite speakers because they are very clear with no crackle. They have daisy chained them together along with other speakers many times.
No it does not date stamp photos. It's a great camera though. I use it for my black and white film photography class.
I have a d700 and it has worked wonderfully with it. No issues at all, I've used it multiple times.
I use a Canon 7D. This will work using the "B" (bulb) setting. I've used it for moon shots and infrared exposures - all 10 to 20 second exposures.
Inside of each device (the remote and the receiver) there are four pins where the batteries are. These four pins can be on and off individually specifying which frequency channel to use. Make sure the pins are exactly the same inside of the remote and inside of the receiver! Thus they get the same frequency channel and can talk to one another. This way you can have your individual frequency channel when there are more photographers around, giving each photographer his own channel so the devices won't interfere with each other. Please tell if it works.
I have to agree with Kenneth on this one. However, if you leave all the dividers out you could just throw it all in but we all know that's a bad idea.
The camera connecting screw is the screw that goes through the battery unit into the threaded hole on the bottom of the camera. the other end of the connecting screw has a threaded hole to receive a tripod or other screw on attachment. When attached the battery unit is attached to the bottom of the camera and any other attachment that normally attaches to the camera just attaches to the battery unit
Yes it does, but you will need a audio attachment also, I did not know this when I ordered mine. Best to find one that has both
Currently internet radio is the only thing I listen to using my Pure dock. I do however use the digital out to my own DAC and when one listens to a decent music stream in terms of kbps, the sound is great. I was considering purchasing a dedicated internet radio/digital content streamer component to complement my hi-fi but with the PURE dock and my iPod Touch, I no longer need to. Just remember that the sound quality always depends on the quality of the source.
if you have enough case fans you can do passive. like fan in front and 2 at the back. if not go for the video card with a fan.
No it will not........
Yes if you are able to either purchase a map or you get them free. The cable will work.
This does not have Bluetooth connectivity however you could make it so with a Logitech Bluetooth adapter.
Hi Kate, Yes we do. 1) You must purchase on Amazon, look for "More Buying Choices" to view the new and used listings. 2) Locate the item sold by Blue Nook (without Fulfillment by Amazon) and we can ship internationally. 3) Select "Add to Cart" from the Blue Nook listing that has international rates available. Kind regards, Terry
They do not but all it powers is one small led light and batteries last a very long time mine still work and have been up for several months now.
This item comes with a basic conversion software, but doesn't really do editing. It will convert VHS into a data file like MPEG. I haven't found a way to edit the video other than just convert it, such as adding text over the video. If you want to see the quality of VHS to digital, check out my YouTube page. http://www.youtube.com/canaanmanley
One of your HDMI cables may be defective or non compliant. Try hooking up the Blu-Ray player directly to the TV twice, once with each cable, to verify that sound will pass through both of them. If both cables work, then the switch likely has a problem. In that case, see if you get the same problem no matter which switch port you use.
I too have tried and have not been able to get it in focus. I gave up
I sell this exact model with a black base and burgundy base as well. Here are the links: http://www.amazon.com/Dress-Form-White-Female-tripod/dp/B002Z7XKQC http://www.amazon.com/chest-waist-Mannequin-Burgundy-Tripod/dp/B00FOCSRO0
I've had this for awhile and put many projects on it, nothing as heavy as a wedding dress but it definitely appears study enough to do the job
Yes
The camera connects to the computer directly via USB, so it won't matter whether you're using a 110V plug (US standard) or 230V (UK standard). The computer will supply a steady level of power to the device.
It does have a mic but it is set up for picture quality not video. It would work as a web cam but the quality would not be stellar. Your be better off getting an actual web cam.
Have not used it on win 8 but out is an outstanding little stop amination program. I am sure it would though. Had its own drivers
just photos
I have the latest generation IPAD, which fits very snuggly in the holder. If you own the latest generation IPAD, I suspect you may have a holder designed for a previous generation IPAD. You may also have a cracked holder, which would impact the holders' ability to perform as designed. Either way, I suggest contacting RAM directly. They have excellent customer service and should be able to resolve your issue promptly and to your satisfaction. www.rammount.com/
I use the charger that came with my camera. (Canon LC-E8E)
The short answer is 'yes'. The charger plugs directly into a 120v outlet, and that is how I use it. It appears that there is an adaptor that plugs into the charger, and then can be plugged into a 240v supply. I have had no use for that, and do not know how universal it may be. But the charger says it can be used for either voltage.
Yes they work, just fine thank hyou
Don't know my farming charger is for the golf GPS and it works great
Bob, Go to www.Garmin.com, and look for the product you seek. They may have a picture of the charging/data clip on the site.
I connect to the pc and works well
I charged it overnight the first time; I really didn't check the time it took. The next day I placed it on the camera and It showed 906 Minutes the same as the one I charged with the camera. I have use both for extended periods and have not discharged one completely where I needed to recharge it to keep recording. I'm very happy with the batteries
My 6D reads and reports my two Wasabi batteries the exact same way it handles the OEM battery.
It does not.
Rarely. Perhaps once every other month. I have Xfinity.
I would charge it for a full 15 hours before using it. They usually come partially charged, so doing a full charge is the best way to be sure.
I have no idea what is compatible with what. check your literature or contact the manufacturer.
Yes! It works well with my 7.1 surround sound pre amp out Demon.
No
The hole is 3/4" in diameter. Your cable should fit easily.
Tsundo, you can use them, but there are varied reports of how well they perform. See this discussion in the Pentax forums:http://www.pentaxforums.com/forums/pentax-medium-format-645-6x7-645d/127803-manual-focus-lenses-645d.html
I don't see either of those listed in the FAQ or website. http://www.vikant-emb.com/FAQBox.htm
I bought it for me to use it overseas and it works perfect.
I don't know for sure, but if the phone requires 5 volts it should work.
Yes
CR2032
I never got that far, the wireless distance was very poor I returned the item in one day
Yes~
Actually, JBOD is what you are trying to do (it means "just a bunch of disks"). I have two of these and and each contain two HDDs configured as ordinary HDDs (no RAID).
I do apologize but we do not have a USB 3.0 Version of this model.
It should since your putting it in the port hole where you plug your earphones it'll work
Yes, it will work with Windows 7.
No, the case rolls very smoothly.
No it does not attach to a tripod. It has a bendable clip to hang on a laptop or flat screen
It appears to me that you could use an eye glass repair kit screwdriver and remove the bottom of the base/bracket.
Not up and down just side to side. Takes good pictures too.
the cord is 66 inches long...
I don't think this is the adapter for the FZ70. The adapter you may be looking for that is compatible for the FZ70 is DMW-LA8. Well, that's what came up when I did some research. H ope this helps.
No. This adapter works on the Panasonic FZ150 camera only.
It depends on how you are using the router. If you have a Netgear wireless router, and use the panda on your computer, it should connect. I am using it on a computer which dual boots with either Ubuntu 12.04 (linux) and it works with a local wifi hub. For some reason Windows 7 doesn't seem to have a driver for it. I haven't researched that problem yet.
i have my receiver plugged into a usb extension cable and it works fine. the cable is around 5 feet, but i imagine it could be longer...
No, you cannot use the built in flash with the rain cover.
most likely, but the screen is recessed to hold the logo, so if removed, there will be an empty divot.
The case is pretty big and has no give since it is so hard. I haven't flown with it yet but it would be a tight squeeze.
And lots and lots more than that!! Watch this Youtube video and it'll give you a good idea. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuuOQPDuJRs&index=13&list=PLhnFFvvsISnQubuttO7KPPaL5SYsJ6xv_
I believe it is a manual adjustment of the lens by turning the black cup of the lens holder.
Yes
I have never used this. The unit has a repeat button, to repeat all, repeat album. I hope this helps.
A very long time.
I believe most carriers (cellular) will allow you to add unlimited data plans for an additional fee per month. The cable company, Time Warner Cable is reselling Clearwire's service in some areas, for just about the same price as Clear.
Yes! The BlueGATE RCV from GOgroove can do it by plugging it into the 3.5mm input. Just search the name.
Yes. If you run the command joy.cpl you can see it shows up as a gamepad.
It has some limited protection for low voltage (brown outs), however if the the voltage goes below about 90 vac for over a few seconds, the unit will sound an alarm after disconnecting the AC which will protect your fridge in most cases. You will have to Hit the reset button on the RCA unit to continue normal operation if it does not return to normal on its own. I hope this helps. The RCA unit is about the best I have found for under $50.00
Never really being in the full blown rain with it, mostly under umbrella, but it appears to repel water OK. However bigger problem is upper handle - ripped out after 5 weeks or so. But CaseLogic/Thule replaced it under warranty very quickly - just 2 pictures and form by email.
If anything, it's probably because your phone and camera are old and do not support the HC (high capacity) standard and / or are limited to SD cards of fewer GB. Of course without you giving any information about the make and model of either your phone or your camera it is impossible to say. It could just be that you somehow got a bad card. Or that you accidentally gave it a static shock and fried it. Or that your cat peed on it. Without sufficient information the best answer you can get is an educated guess.
Yes. That is all you need. No additional cables needed.
Yes
Yes you actually get both.The US plug is built into the charger when the EU plug is an adapter piece that fits over the US plug
Yes you can. You touch the playback button (looks like a screen with an arrow wrapping around inside) then push the center select button with "Record" highlighted, and cycle through your videos with the left and right arrow buttons. When you find the one you would like to delete you touch the "M" button and a dialogue will come up. It gives you the choice of deleting one, deleting all, or protecting it. You would select "Delete one".
I'm sorry, we have not used the USB cable yet. we are waiting to connect it when we upgrade our computer first.
Yes. It will identify any problems with the pedestal power and won't allow power to the coach if there are any. If not, you will have normal power transfer to your coach. It does not monitor the power from the generator unless you get the hard wired version.
Not sure what you are asking, but if your RV has a 30 amp plug I suggest you consider the 30 amp model. That way you don't have to use an adaptor. I have to use a 50 to 30 adaptor sometimes if the RV park does not have 50 amp service. It works just fine in that case.
Hi Terry, There are multiple different WD 3tb SATA III drives, but this enclosure will work with any 3.5" SATA drive - that's the only thing that matters. I would note that this enclosure, being only USB 2.0, will not benefit from the speed over a SATA III drive verses a SATA II drive, so if you find a cheaper 3.5" drive, feel free to go with the cheaper option.
Yes
NO ! I still am unable to get this device to work with windows 7. it reminds me that you get what you pay for. spend more and get a better quality camera.
Yes....you can choose the side you want to put the wrist in your arm...to you or to outside. But sincerely i didnt like this device....
I bought mine but it never works! Not even once! Thrown in the trash. seriously.
The TV once mounted can pivot up and down but in our van it moves or swings side to side only
5 volts, hence being a good card for CNC.
No... you should look for a European / Brazilian version to save yourself the headache. I had to order a different pulley and use a step down converter in order to get this to work. If you are hard pressed to get a US version, you can order the European pulley from Rega US distributor. It will cost you about $10. You pop the stock one off, superglue the new one on, and use the a step down converter (price varies, it's pretty heavy too) so you don't burn the table.
my Rega arrived well-packaged -- no issues with broken parts. one thing that *did* need replacing was the platter, which arrived warped as many others have reported. nice unit though -- still enjoying it after 1+ years.
The width of the caddy is 7 and 1/8". The depth (front to back) is 5 and 1/4". The depth of the individual slots is 1 and 1/2". The height in front, to top of front slat, is 3 and 3/4", and in back 6". You can comfortably fit 4 remotes in the caddy. Hope this helps!
I use a JacobsPart wifi Router in a mobile home from my son's wifi about 300' away (I cannot even pick up FM radio without an outside antenna). I get 3 bars which equals good signal. It works great. Of course I am not on the computer that much, but it works aytime I connect. And his home has aluminum siding to pass thru also.
Yes it would. It's in protective casing so it fairly well put together. Without the case it's a USB PEN clip style design so you can clip on your person like a pen. The mount it comes with is specific to a divers mask so you'll have to come up with a way to attach it yourself.
my only suggestion is: do a factory reset. it will erase all synchronized data and will start fresh. u will need to redownload apps that you use. if factory reaet doesn't fix your problem. then there is something wrong woth the tv
I use the google tv remote app on my phone. I also have an lg universal remote that works too.
The speakers are 9 and 1/4 inches, the unit is 12 inches without any connections installed...
Yes, it takes PC-10600, SODIMM 204 Pin, 1333Mhz DDR3 memory and max memory of 8GBs. Two of these memory chips should work. You should double check with Lenovo and see if they can provide you with a qualified vendors list (QVL) of memory that's guaranteed to work with this laptop or you can just take a chance and buy it. I've been building PCs and upgrading laptops for 13 years and rarely have I had a problem with memory compatibility issues, even when the memory was not listed on a QVL.
Yes
It uses American plugs. I did use it outside of the US using a power adapter.
Yes. The kit comes with a wall charger for charging your batteries using a regular electrical socket. It also comes with an adapter so that you can plug into the car a well.
I just email an engineer at Oppo and he said "We have been working with Amazon to add their service to our player, but thus far we have not received the engineering support to adapt their application to our platform. So, it's not simply a matter of us "wanting to do it". We'd love to have the service, but it doesn't seem as though it's going to happen any time soon."
I really liked it a lot and I used it with my iPhone 3. It' sound it puts out is outstanding! A great investment! Jeff
Any TV having 4 threaded holes in the back cover of the set should mount to the vertical mount hooks. I found this to be a true universal mount. I have a Sony 60" and this mount is everything and more I expected. If mounted to a wall properly this thing would hold 2 TV's. You will 99% love it.
yes...2 pendants. Nice device...worked great for us.
Sorry no idea
Yes. It does.
Yes its
I have a clear line of sight from my house down the golf course fairway 1/3 mile and get three bars from the club house. I use to see 3 or 4 neighbors computers nearby, now I see 12 to 18.
No this won't work with that device. The real question is, what are you trying to accomplish with that combination?
No
Hi Actually your laptop need 45W (19V 2.37A) and this charger Output: 19V 3.42A. so the output is more than you need it, its working but not good for your laptop and Hardware..... ,search to charger output 2.37 A Best Regards Eng.Yasser
I'm not sure, but I'm a professiona installer...maybe I can help?
Yes, because this might is for 400x400 VESA
I have the Soundware and my Father has one too. They both came with remotes. Love it!!!!!!
Yes it is. Works well.
I have the latest model of the wave. If wave 3 is the latest model, it does work and works very effectively.
Sure, I do not see why not. It is a magnet mount, so I would put it on a pizza pan, metal cabinet, or some magnetic surface to allow the antenna to have some surface as a "ground plane", to allow the antenna to have the best possible inside reception.
Correction you need a SATA external hard drive not USB. Sorry about that.
As a standard equipment delivery from DTV depot or equipment suppliers, yes. But for private transaction from a former subscriber, it depends and you have to confirm and clarify.
I am honestly not sure. We have a generation 1 iPad in an Apple case and it works great.
Hi, check your owner's manual for your device to see if it has a micro HDMI port. If so, it will fit. Hope this helps.
Yes&#65292; This 12 cell battery. Before order, you need to check your battery is 6 cell or 9 cell. If your battery is 6 cell or 9 cell, then this one will be larger than your battery. ASIN: B0080PVJ34 here is a 6 cell battery for HP G42-303dx notebook. Hope this helpful.
It is a fairly good battery but I do not know which other laptop models it is appropriate for
4 inches in diameter would be close, probably leave you with only an extra inch of Velcro. So I guess it depends on what it is and how secure it needs to be.
You have to use a computer a with monitor. I purchased digital art software at around $40 also, but it _might_ work with pre-installed apps on a computer like Windows Paint.
yes
My husbands fits great and he wears it "every"night to bed. What I suggest is to sew with a machine in 2 straight lines in the back vertically next to each other than cut between them (so not to ravel) them sew in 1.5" elastic about 2-2.5" long & that will make it larger for for. Good luck.
It's pretty darn flat. I would say it's maybe about 1/4 of an inch thick and about an inch or so in diameter. I tried to use it for sleeping and I didn't feel the speaker really at all with my memory foam pillow
I think it's just a bad picture of the cable that may be confusing. It looks like male-male to me and the cable that I got was male-male.
It is not a dumb question. I have used the cable (or a series of conversion dongles and cables) for a similar function at the office and it worked. The key is that you need a DVI-to-DP converter, and the cable does act as one of these.
Yep
I use mine for a second second monitor so I can dual screen. I have used both for different purposes. I like the cable because it takes up less space next to the computer, whereas with the adapter you have a weird box that can get in the way.
I'm not completely sure what you mean, but I'll try to answer it a couple of different ways. If you mean does data go both directions so that it functions as an input and output cable then the answer is no. The cable connects to the mini display port on a mac computer and sends audio and video signals to a hdmi compatible television. This is really the only purpose that the cable can be used for since the mini display port is specific to mac computers.
I have the white cable and it breaks really quickly, as I assume the black one does too
You cannot have both audio and visual with the aforementioned hardware, my friend. The best you can do is plug speakers into your macbook's audio port. That's what I does. I hope my answer helped. Also, be sure to minimize your plugging in and out of ports with this cord. Mine broke in a month.
Your new iMac likely has thunderbolt ports, which share the same connector as mini display-port. Assuming the dell monitors you want to hookup both have full-size display-port inputs, and that the iMac GPU can handle the extra monitors, then yes this cable should work fine.
Yes.
Hello, The adjustable arms will adjust up to about 7.5/8 inches in width. If your console is within that range, this will fit over it.
Yes. I have windows 8. It works perfectly
Yes
yes,the only thing is that for xbox 360 you need to change the format, but after you change the format you still can use it with your computer .You need to change the format for (FAT32)this is the format for xbox 360 & PS3
yes it will
Neither. The actual load is so low you can hook it into any ohm configuration and it won't change anything. Hope this helps. Bob
Probably not, you generally need an active adapter to convert the signal back up to digital.
the manual states there is a limited warranty of 1 year against manufacturer defects in material and workmanship under normal use. it says to take the item to any radio shack store with proof of purchase. however, i would expect there to be a problem since it was not bought thru an actual radio shack store but thru amazon online. (but, you never know.) hope this helps.
No. The iPhone 5, 5s and 5c use the new design charger
Yes. "Will charge an iPad" mostly means that it will produce 2 amps at 5 volts, instead of the 0.5 amps that most standard USB ports produce. Anything that will produce enough current to charge an iPad 3 will charge an iPad 1.
yes they are a pair but a pair of junk they blow without pushing them
What do you mean? I didn't understand
They did not fit on the device.
Hi jan I would say yes. Yes you can
No
The Galaxy S2 has MHL for video output not micro hdmi. Just search for "mhl adapter" in amazon. You plug the adapter into your micro usb port on your phone then a regular hdmi cable into both the adapter and tv.
Works just fine for me! It enables me to view my Fire HD on a TV. Of course the TV must have the HDMI input.
There was an opaque sticker stuck over the display window. If you peel that off the display will be available. It comes off easily once you get it started.
Possibly formatted in a non-supported manner? Was it formatted as FAT?
Yes i have a same mother board and i5 processor 3570k intel
30 minutes a day workout-I only charge it once every 45 days or so. Great battery life.
You need at least one remote wire going to your system. The LC2i requires a remote signal, but provides a remote output for your amp. Your remote wiring for the system should go something like this, Fuse Box --&gt; LC2i Remote In, Then LC2i Remote Out --&gt; Remote In on Aftermarket Amp. You will need a power feed for the audio controller as well, but you can jumper that from your amp power or from the remote signal without having to run another wire.
Not sure what you mean by "filter" but it does the Hi/Lo conversion without adding artifacts. I found them to be a bit bass heavy though
You do need a receiver to plug the speaker wires into.
This is a question you should you should call Etymotic about.
Honestly, I'm not quite sure. Sorry!
Yes
Yes. As long as you hook-up the video lead from the camera to only come on when there is power to the reverse lghts. No mater what is happening with the unit if I put the car in reverse the display shows me the camera's view.
Cable is approx 5 feet long.
No, it does not. It 's a cheap, simple DVD player.
Yes...but this can only be done thru Veebeam player only. But unit does not support 64 bit. Also driver for Win7 OPS does not support 5.1 Surround. Distance from dongle to receiver, line of sight minimal...using it for 3 years works ok.
The room I used it in, it was about 18 ft. away, but it's got to have a clear path between receiver and transmitter for best performance.
Well it says it does: http://www.veebeam.com/products/Veebeam-HD.html (Products / HD page) There's a download that can check your PC to work out how well it would work (at least on Windows). http://www.veebeam.com/pages/Downloads.html (Downloads) 2nd link in the Windows section is a Compatibility Tool. 30 Day Money Back too.
It will charge any 30-pin apple device including iPads
No, it's strictly 110ac.
That is very odd. If you are placing two separate orders, shipping would be charged twice however, if you are simply ordering two pieces in one order, you should not be double charged for shipping. This sounds like an error on Amazon's part. We ask that you please reach out to their customer service for further assistance. Please let us know if there is anything else we can do to assist you. Kind Regards, McTechy Support
yes
It does work. I found the connection with it is somewhat spotty. Better of getting a gps watch
Please notice between the color code Is an A or B indicates where to anchor the colored wires. The lower band is for T568B. Just remember pins 1 and 2 are orange and 3 and 6 are green.
Tis a center pin.
Yes, this adapter can work well on your HP G70-246US Notebook PC. Any questions please feel free to contact us via support@laptopmate.com.
You probably could but it may need to be leaning against something to stay in position. The "camera" portion does pivot on a ball joint so you could experiment around. At worst, maybe double-sided sticky tape on the mounting bracket part would work.
Not without you modifying it. It is powered by 2 AA batteries that run the blinking LED.
I received my Tab 2 last night and can confirm that it does not work either. The area the Tab 2 should sit is too small by a few millimeters. I am looking to replace with a bluetooth board as this will work without a doubt.
No
It was a few years ago that I bought this, but if I'm remembering correctly, it is just the keyboard. There is a port on it so you can charge the tablet while using it and/or connect via USB to a computer. I was very pleased with its functions while I had it. Hope that helps!
It fits the HX50V. It is even a little big for it.
Did not work with mine!
I have the wi-fi version. It works perfectly on it.
According to the product's features, I believe it will. See the second item from the bottom below. You can also call VisionTek support at 866.883.5411 and ask. Features *Full DirectX11 support for rich, realistic visuals and HD gaming performance *Compliant with DirectX 11 and earlier revisions *ATI Stream technology to help speed up your PC Multi-monitor support *Offers superior stability and reliability with ATI Catalyst software *Designed for DirectCompute 11 and OpenCL Accelerated *Video Transcoding (AVT) *Supports OpenGL 3.2 *ATI Avivo HD video and display technology *ATI PowerPlay technology *PCI Express 2.0 support *ATI Crossfire X
you SHOULD be able to. Optiplex's tend to have gigantic heat sink/fans/excess chassis inside of them so there's a chance they'll be too large, but these DIMMs aren't the biggest i've seen and should fit in just fine.
It works with my Bose sound system in '05 A6. Do you have CD changer with fiber optic? What version of the MMI do you have? Those are the things you need to worry about about.
If you have either a Nikon Coolpix p300 series camera, or a Nikon Coolpix s3000 series camera, this neckstrap will not work for your camera. Both the p300 and the s3000 series cameras have a single connection for a strap. I would recommend something similar to this, if that's what model camera you have: http://www.amazon.com/Easy-Glide-Digital-Adjustable-Weight-Reduction-COOLPIX/dp/B00A3ZZOAS/ref=sr_1_19?ie=UTF8&qid=1378690998&sr=8-19&keywords=camera+strap+nikon+coolpix+300. Hope this helps you out! :-)
12 feet easy.
I haven't tried that but the user guide says you can set up a wireless network to connect to photo sharing websites and to import photos wirelessly. I'm a little technology challenged but apparently the frame does have that capability.
Maybe you mispoke ? These lamps draw 5 amps each. 10 amps total. A flasher is usually used to make lights blink. Are you attempting to make a strobe ? If so, one 6 amp per lamp.
They are white..
yes
I do not know this model # but I use this mount with a 7 inch Magellan GPS and it works well.
pretty sure no. this is a very light weight tripod which is good for DSLR camera but not with a big zoom lens.
I have been unable to get this to work with my HP Envoy with Windows 8 or upgraded 8.1, with laptop with Windows 7.
Yes, has both a right and left button.
Yes, in fact there are 3 lights that stay on all the time. 2 red and one green. I have it in the floor so it's no big deal. Other than that u love it, can power everything off with the remote.
Cannot get on ziio
Yes car charger is detachable. I keep the car cable in car for when need it and keep charger in home as it has built in US spec plug.
the charger has two pins.
I have the same case and it works fine with it.
Dear J.C.M: The MB-1132 does have the capability to connect to your printer through its USB port. However, we are in the process of testing and updating our firmware to make the Pantech UML290 4G USB modem (as well as other popular American USB modems) compatible with our routers, which could take a few more weeks to finalize. Once this is complete, this router should work perfectly for your needs.
Yes, you can shuffle across everything, within playlists, or with other options.
Yes, the ears slide up and down to adjust for the head size.
It fits me and I'm a big guy.
The trigger and timer will work with your Canon Rebel T2i, but you will need to ensure the correct adapter. In your camera's manual (or check online), there will be a note about using remote releases. Check the type of socket you need. The trigger system is self-contained for most features, and uses a different cable for different cameras. Be aware that not all features may be available, though - some cameras may not support focus, for example. But I believe the T2i supports all the features through its PC port.
yes as long as you get them in correct size for your lens.
possible im not sure how well its will work may be distorted
I have not had the need to burn CD+G however you should be able to if you have CD+G burner software to do so.
It is fully compatible with my Mac! Took it out of the box, plugged it it and burnt a dvd. No software, no complaints so far. OS X 10.8.2 2.44 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo 8 gb ram
Yes it does come with a power adapter.
yes.
No LEDs
It works perfectly on my A77 so I assume it'll work on other Alphas, but I don't have any experience with it in on an A57 or A99.
Yes it will. Noctua's answer for this is to remove the bottom fan to clear extended RAM cooling fins. I would assume you could set the remaining fan to highest RPM setting by not using one of the limiting extension cables. (have you considered water cooling options?)
2 inches
Should...I use it with a Samsung Galaxy Note II . I also use it the Apple IPad.
I tried both. This (older) model is much richer and powerful, though still intended for smaller spaces; single rooms, etc.
There is a mini, a medium one, and the big one. This is NOT the mini. It is the medium size. About twice the width and weight of mini, a quarter the size of the big one.
Jambox requires blue tooth for wireless connection (1st generation ipods do not have that feature). It does have a 1/8" headphone jack and cable that can pug into 1st generation ipod's earphone jack
Scroll down till you get to the section called specifications the correct size of the original is there. It would seem Amazon's own description is off.
Not to worry about frequency response, for its size it sounds great by my desk, my bed and my garage
this is a working, but you can find out only by trial and error .....
Yes and you can delete pictures there too.
It sure does!
It should work, though it might be tough to keep things centered if your mount is not motorized. One thing to keep in mind is that the image quality of this camera is not very good. It works well on the Moon, but that is about it. If you can find a used one it would be a much better value. This camera is not worth $100, maybe $30-$40.
Thank you for your inquiry. I do not have direct experience using that camera with the ETX-90. The camera should work with any telescope that accepts 1.25" eyepieces.
Yes
Yes it will as long as it's the official Apple branded one. I use it on mines and from what I hear 3rd party lightning adaptors don't transmit sound.
Yes....Instructions were sent for three different types of inputs.
30.5 inches long
no, it looks as if 5 amps would be pushing it. the size of the wire is for 1 to 2 amp p/s.
5 inches from the end of the power barrel jack, 9 1/2 inches from each of the four power plugs, for a total length of 14 1/2 inches end-to-end (*including* the metal barrel plugs themselves).
Herringshaw- Yes it will add about 3db to the signal. I am using one on my Rythmic F12 subwoofer. The subwoofer sums the two inputs. It has nothing to do with giving the sub "the full range of sound", it merely supplies it with a stronger signal from the two inputs. Hope that helps, and BTW this is a very nice splitter.
I have a Denon receiver with sub out and Red and White into the back of my Klipsch sub-woofer and this worked out just right for me. The one-out /two-in hookup is what you need.
Yes when you first access the device to configure it, it gives you country choices to make sure you are compliant with local regs.
They are 100 Mbps
Besides checking to see what the timing is on your computer power saver mode to see if it is putting the monitor to sleep, i would contact ASUS directly to see if they can repair or replace it.
It should fit as long as you buy the correct mounting kit.
My son said it will work with any car as long as you purchase the right wiring harness and mounting unit. When purchasing that was not stated that additional parts were needed and my son had to rebuy new wiring harness and mounting unit. He is happy with the stereo system. Hope this helps.
Our pricing is per pair
The Ubiquiti website says 15+km (9+miles) and I bought to connect to an access point 2 miles away, so far it works great and has never dropped the connection since installation, has low latency and great throughput.
El autofocus funciona oerfectamente
It all depends on the connector type, and the polarity of the adapter vs the one on the device. If the shoe fits, as they say, just don't turn the brightness and volume up all the way or you may burn out your adapters no matter which one you use. Half a volt usually doesn't matter except to laptops themselves, other devices aren't as sensitive as some will still work at lower voltages, but barely in some cases.
As I recall the POE was included when I bought mine. Yes, the Ethernet port is inside the enclosure. The picture shows the cable access opening. The Ethernet port is nearby inside.
It will work if they are set to the same frequencies, plus use the same protocol processing. To determine this one has to check carefully the specs for both systems to see if they can be matched. There is less protocol processing information for Ubiquiti. Buy it try it. But my advice is stay with same Manufacturer. Tech support goes nuts if you call in with mixed breeds!
The are no usb ports on this
yes with basic hrml knowledge you redirect user to desired login page and give user limited bandwith or open bandwith
Try Ebay...or right here on Amazon
It should. All it would need is a universal mounting kit and stereo wiring harness
Yea mine had the mounting sleeve and the harness. Make sure you take out your old sleeve completely else it wont fit. As for the wiring harness how my system was set up I had to strip the old harness from the car's stereo and reuse it because I didnt have both male an female sides for the harness; I only had one side. It's not much work though.
Per the manual, page one: It is rated at 300 watts to match 6 to 1600 ohms antennas (SRW up to 32:1) or 150 watts to match wider range of 6 to 3200 ohms (SRW up to 64:1). I am happy with it after owning it ~ 6 months. The manual may be available on line.
No it does not. It has a perforation on one side for air flow.
You cannot daisychain them. You also cannot have more than one in a room without echo.,
We bought this for a Canon EOS 60D (50mm to 185mm lens). Have no idea if they are similar in size or not.
First you go to the system menu then you go into settings , when u select settings , you should see an icon for date and time called system settings , select it and you should be able to set the date and time !
It is not a good starter tablet and if I had the chance I would sell mine my wife and I don't use ours we got the first gen ipad how much are you looking at paying for yours couse there are better ones out now for cheaper and do more stuff faster hope I was helpfull
The new update is still bloated and slow. Half the apps dont work in the market. VEGAN is still the best way to go. Fast customizable and free. I would stick with the ROMs if your able to put the on.
Fortunately I have access to both and did a pretty thorough review of them on my blog site at http://www.blendblog.net/Default.aspx?tabid=36&EntryID=64. Hope this helps, I like both devices but they are different and which one to get really depends on what you are looking for which I breakdown in my review. Sean
Go to SlateDroid, XDA, Viewsonic Gtablet for Dummies, etc. Much better than any OEM support.
Typical use (2 mins sending, 8 mins receiving) you'll get about 3-4 hours at 5 watts output. If you just monitor waiting for a signal, it will last for days in standby. If left off and used sporadically, you can get several weeks of use. Since it is a nicad battery, it will self-discharge in about 2-3 months, even if turned off. I have had mine for 7 years and still on the original battery.
yes it can be used as a scanner
Depends on the landscape, but in a suburban environment, with both stations at ground level--1 mile or less
I`ve had no problems.
On a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being hard i would say about a 5. Not hard to use. Hard to configure!
the item will be shipped within 2 working days and the delivery is within 2 days via DHL
That cable measures 24 inches.
It's possible, you would hVe to purchase a mount or make one yourself , the av type of screw on would be facing down in this case because the cable of the surge protector is pretty think and not easy to bend. The one I own I have laying flat behind my tv
Its plays MP3 & WMA files but not Apple files, so you can go the Google Play store for media. No its doesn't have a camera. Yes it has an SD slot.
I never do text, but it can connet to internet, there are several chat apps for Android, so I think you can text.
I was planning to get one of these for my cousin. I was reading over some of the reviews and it sounds like it should fit perfectly as long as you haven't put an extra layer over the shell. It might still fit if the skin overlay isn't too thick. Personally, I'd probably have both the case and the extra covering as long as they fit.
Yes
It is a tap and to the best on my knowledge does not filter any traffic. If it is filtering BPDU packets, i am not aware that it does. I do not have it setup in a situation to look for them.
I'm pretty sure that the cables that came with the cameras were 60 foot cables. The good news also is that these new cables will hook right into your other ones, if you are extending your other cables as opposed to if you had to buy some from comp usa, you had to have a special coupler to connect the two.
Everything that I've been able to read leads me to the conclusion that the 124J is exclusively for Japanese consumption.
it is a firewire port. so if you have a firewire device you can plug it into your computer. I don't know your model of tv
All you do is plug it into your PCI express spot. For me this was right next to my graphics card. All you do is line up the card and the spot, plug it in and then that's all.
Yes this card was compadible with my win 8 and my computer recognized it immediately and my PC is an HP Pavvilian
Only better if you already have other 58 mm filters..... if you already have other 67mm filters, then you should purchase the 67mm. I own (3) SX series cameras, & all three use 58mm filters...on purpose. I perfer a filter that obviously fits the 58mm lens barrel & not an over-size 67mm. I have had no vignetting problem with all the 58mm filters.
I bought the VXIA express model, and don't recall the warranty. I've had it over a year, and haven't had any problems.
Power Extension Cord is around 9 inch. As for IP Camera Model TriVision NC-336PW, I checked this item on amazon however I can not find any information about IR Light Wave Length which is used by manufacturer. Please contact with manufacturer directly if This camera is sensitive with 850nm wave length, our ir illuminator IR130 should be fine.
any 1155 socket /1156/1150 all can work with this
3.8ghz
I don't know, worked great on a 5th gen with a 64gb Silicon Graphics CF. Check this for more info.... http://www.head-fi.org/t/566780/official-ipod-video-classic-5g-5-5g-6g-6-5g-7g-ssd-mod-thread
None that I know of. Likely limiter is throughput speed, but don't know what that rating is. Hope this helps.
sure paradise treasures has white red pink and grey
I used it for bike riding, hiking, deer hunting, I think because of the fast movement you might have a little blurring, also the sky is a little bright, watch out shooting towards the sun but should be able to get some good shots and good luck on the hunt
The wall mount (the part that looks like a rectangle) is 7" high. The arms holding the TV are 17.5" but you'd have room above or below the wall mount for an outlet to be hidden behind the TV.
It should! I have a macbook pro 13" non-retina display though I don't think there are any dimension differences.
There is no sticky, more like a static cling kind of thing.
If it's a 15" model then it will fit. I use this docking station with a 15" mid-2014 MacBook Pro Retina. If you have the 13" model then you'll need to get the 13" docking station.
Hello John, thank you for contact us, is not included.
Yes. Both tv's have to watch the same channel or recording from the box. My box Is In the master bedroom. I split the hdmi to the mbed and kitchen tvs. I use a universal rf remote in the kitchen to control the box from there, and the cable remote in the room. I also have an antenna and roku boxes on each one in case we don't want to watch the same thing. Or should I say, in case she doesn't want to watch football.
Yes, I used Cat 5 wire and ganged a pair to each screw.
Home
Absolutely yes. Using it with Windows 8 as I write this. Works just fine. No problems with Win 8 self installing it.
No it doesn't. I had a seperate Garmin GPS unit. I prefer two seperate screens so its a plus for me.
I don't know, I never got my computer to recognize it because even thou its advertises as being able to fit, it didn't and was sent back immediately.
No reason not. Howevery double check to make sure your flash is on the compatible flash list and sometime if the flash needs specific cable to fit the data port then you will need to have the right canon cable to fit it. The trigger itself is a reliable device to send the sync signal.
5.5inchs (23.6inch long, 1.4inch deep). It works amazingly well too.
Yes
yes it will
I can have you use it by having you change the imaging range of the camera to DX format on the occasion of the use with "the FX camera such as Nikon D600". But thank you for your understanding beforehand because I cannot have you use imaging element (FX format) of the camera to the maximum.
yes, just a regular sd card
It does both photos and pictures
I usually rinse with tap water and dry well. Have used a little WD-40 because sliding tabs stick and become difficult to slide open. Works fine as long as I do that though.
Yes it does
I have never had a problem deleting photos or editing directly - before or after I have downloaded them to my PC
http://support.en.kodak.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/32108/selected/true try this sight
Yes you can. In fact it's incredibly easy. Here's a video showing you how. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyUfs788cJk Just as an fyi, the max is 2gbs.
No you either set camera for still photos or videos
It's OK. But my recommendation will be upgrading the ram memory. If you add more RAM will be fine
5 1/16" X 3" X 1/2"
approx. 5 feet. I expected it to be 6. But it does the job.
Yes it does, I found it handy and easy to use.
I don't think so.
I looked and it didn't say that it did. Here is the link. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004FLR2EW?ref_=pe_527950_33920250
I use this adapter on my Acer Aspire 6920. Here is the info on the supply: Input:100-240V-1.8A 50/60Hz. Ouput: 19V-3.42A. If the power matches up with your existing power supply and the tip looks the same, it will work. I wasn't sure about the tip fitting my PC, I took a chance and it worked. I hope this helps somewhat.
not sure. I wouldn't recommend buying it unless you are 100% sure about it.
Yes. I used it in mine and it's been a great tool. Much better than the optical drive. I did have some connection troubles with it and therefore it was not stable enough to be the boot drive. I therefore use it for all storage material and the internal HD just for applications.
not sure i put it in a macbook pro
Yes, it does. And with Ubuntu, and with your phone...
Plug into DVD/CD slot
It only accepts SATA drives (I installed a solid state drive in my caddy).
I only know that the A32-F82 fits my Asus K50IJ laptop. That is K50I (as in India). If yours is a K501 (as #1), perhaps you could contact Asus @ support.asus.com. They are very good at helping Asus laptop owners, even if their computer is no longer under warranty.
I have not had to replace the lamp and there has not been any degradation to the quality, or at least nothing noticeable. This thing has been good to me
I couldn't say for sure. The use I had in mind for my cable didn't work because of other issues. Good luck!
Yes
yes
No
Yes, Franklin, it does.
Yes,it does.
are yoyu refering to back connections?
They are compatible with anything that has a headphone jack, this does not have a mic though.
No
Theoretically yes. I bought them for Cisco 8941s and while they worked, there was a high pitched squeal for every call. I ended up returning them.
we are using this 2.5mm with a Plantronics T-10 as long AS YOU HAVE THAT 2.5 STYLE PLUG IN IT SHOULD WORK.
it would not connect to my Samsung, but I don't know if that's because it's Android rather than Apple, or the connection cable is not compatible - in the instruction manual it says "Not all brands of USB flash drives are supported"; and I haven't tried recording back to flash drive, but other than that this is an amazing little unit, well worth the price!
Hello such! in my management background study of 3 meters wide, work great. Greetings.
I don't know on a 50mm because I used it on a Nikon 500mm mirror lens and found that it physically adapts the bayonet mounts, but it changes the focal length of any lens mounted to it and it did not make a practical adaptor for what it intended to use it for (America's Cup photos).
B. Brown I'm not sure since I recently tossed out the box that they came in. However, on the side arm of the frames it has 3DTV CORP on it.
If you have this adapter. It will let you mount any A mount lens to the camera. You will have manual focus only.
Push to talk. But once activated it like an intercom. I have now bought the scala rider g9 shark works but if you can find the money get the scala g4 or g9 you won't regret it. The 4 is cheaper but works well just not as many option as the 9
email sharkmotorcycleaudio
Yes, the adapter will work with the DSLR 300 flash for the Sony Alpha 55.
no but i use a wireless usb driver. Works great! And i had to carry this thing to work to get it hooked up so i can work from home. It is SOOOOOO easy to carry. You know...when your too damn poor to buy a laptop! :)
Specs from Cooler Master are 65-97CFM rated by 1200-2600RPM. For as much air as it moves, it is really loud at doing so; but nothing else compares.
As long as Micro$oft still supports USB with Win 8.1, the Kanguru drive will work. Whether or not the program you use to actually burn CDs or DVDs is a whole other question.
Yes this phone Supports up to 64GB microSD Card
I agree with Thomas T. It works on Windows 7 which shares hardware drivers with Server 2008. You can use the 64 bit Windows 7 driver on Server 2008. When in doubt check the manufacturer's web site. The spec sheet says it works with dang near every Windows version. OS Compatibility: Windows 8 (32/64bit), 7 (32/64), Vista(32/64), XP(32/64), 2000, ME, 98SE, 95 Windows Server 2012, 2008 R2 Good luck.
Most certainly
Sorry to say, it's only 1440x900. I use mine as an external monitor for an old laptop.
No Difference at all!. BDT215 is packaged for large warehouses like Costco, BJs and Sams. This is to avoid price match wars with mainstream electronic products dealers. It includes a cheap HDMI cable ( not worth more than 5 bucks) in the box. The Avatar 3D offer is good for both models. So whereever you find it cheaper and convenient to buy (remember Amazon for most states is tax free) you can get it.
I am also having this issue. Contacted amazon instant video customer service. They said they have been having this issue with panasonic blu ray's but I still don't have an answer on the fix. Now my blu ray won't connect to the internet at all.
Takes two 5 1/4 slots so if your 450D has free full size slots you are golden.
It comes with the 3 SATA cables. What it doesn't mention is that it requires 2 std power connections and a SATA power connector plugged into the rear of the housing. It Seems to work well so far running a 3 TB JBOD. Hope this helps.
I do not know. Tom's Hardware says that SATA III only mkea a difference with SDD drives. If that is tru you will not see any difference with a SATA II enclosure. SATA II enclosures are hard to find.
It has a built in flash. Works great, nothing else needed unless for normal type flash photography. It pops up.
I find my monitor calibrating every now and then, flashing various colors and lines across the screen, but it usually doesn't look for input. I'm guessing it's getting a mixed signal from your computer, or some device it is plugged into? If you hit the "Source" button (the + sign), you can select a default source and turn OFF the auto-select source option. This might also help.
Really, it is all about pixels and display resolution. The monitor size often means larger pixels, not more of them. I bought 4 HP2011x monitors that I intend to use in a rotated fashion. However, The standard back mounting are not present on the HP2011x nor can you rotate the monitor on the stand that comes with the monitor. The HP2011x is a poor choice if you are looking for a monitor you can use rotated in portrait orientation.
No, no HDMI.
Starter has quite a few limitations, But all limitations have a way around them right now.. A easy way around it is to go to: instructables(DOT)com In search put in: Windows 7 Starter: Easy way to change wallpaper and it will tell you how to change it and get around the limitation. Or http://www.instructables.com/id/Windows-7-Starter-Easy-way-to-change-wallpaper/
yes but you would definitely need speakers or headphones...

It has an aux in so as long as your CD player has aux out (or just a headphone port) you should be fine. It was made for a phone/mp3 player to be plugged in and kept safe so the holder isn't large but you can leave the door open and just run an aux cord to whatever you are playing CDs from
The volume control is audio taper and provides a smooth, static free progression of volume.
By golly you can :-) Had to look cause i didn't think you could .
never tried it but the sound from the speaker is good. as far as i know there is only one speaker in the radio so not quite hi-fidelity but a nice sound with the ability to control bass and treble.
We don't have many weak stations with this radio. We live quite a ways out of town and we love it. I am very glad we got it as we listen to several stations we couldn't get before. Henry listens to music more then I do and he says it is good
Yes it does. There is a connector for both an AM and FM external antenna. The AM connector is a single wire clip connector and the FM connector is a type F connector.
The M-2 comes with a POE power supply. The POE is about 4" long, 2" deep, 3"wide. One side connects to the wall. The other side has two RJ45 connectors. 1 is designed to be the POE that powers the radio. The other is the LAN port that goes to the router or computer. It's slick.
No it is not.
Not that I'm aware of. But if you keep the stylus in a pen loop, the tag catches so it won't fall through. Also it helps me to not drop the stylus when I'm absently fiddling with it.
Yes, the battery pack comes loose. My Magic Mouse disconnected every time I moved it. Something I did not experience with the standard Apple mouse (with batteries). It was so annoying that I stopped using it after a couple of days. It looks nice, but it doesn't work well at all...
Yes, you just need to order it from a seller that has international shipping as an option. For example we do, and based on the weight you can check shipping charges at check out.
Not sure but just search g60-635DX replacement battery in Amazon. Several choices show up.
Yes it is. Battery works perfectly
Sorry out of my league. I ust this to on ECG iPhone 5s to charger. K
The card came with two brackets. The smaller one is 3 1/8" wide. The one I used in my desktop is 4 3/4" wide.
Hello Au R. Yes this cable is equipped with 24AWG power conductors which are blazing fast compared to most other cables on the market. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@mediabridgeproducts.com
Hi, the best brand of discs are Taiyo Yuden, HP, and Phillips. The worst brand of discs are Memorex or any low grade discs that are not recognized by most drives in the market.
Yes! It burns dvd-r & dvd+r.
No. It requires a wired connection.
Depending on usage, this battery can last up to a few days w/out charge. Good bang for you buck!
Yes
Yes. 1 Year standard. But important part is only 12 ports are powered.
Andy, take a look at the Cisco Small Business SG500 series. They're easy to use and they have everything you'll need for voice, data and more. I've had 3 of the SG500X-48's running my network for over a year now. http://goo.gl/IbQQpg
Id like to know this also
I do not think they are compatible
Absolutely. I have had zero problems with mine and I'm so glad that I didn't waste my money to get the Microsoft brand!
If you have Xbox 360 slim..it will ..as long as the game isn't more then 117-120 gigs (I don't think games are that large yet) its fine
If the Micca doesn't completely power down just turn it off with the power switch on the back.
No Netflix, it can copy data from the USB to an internal drive but it is slow. I have been using it without a drive mounted internally and prefer to use external drives.
Not without substantial modifications. It designed for the LG Expo only, and fits into the battery space for the Expo. It had no cables or connectors
Not sure mine didnt work. Waste of money.
You get two tube rings and a Vixen-style (narrow) dovetail bar this allows you to mount the telescope. For additional information visit the Orion website for this product. http://www.telescope.com/catalog/product.jsp?productId=99369 Hope this was helpful and you have clear skies!
I purchased this exact item last year. Yes, the two mounting rings are included. Lawrence.
If you plug in any drive or add to nas it would work. Make sure all drives are same speed but I wouldn't. It's not a good idea. Use internal drives for nas
I priced single components and found just a little savings. Not having to worry about riser card and getting everything packaged in there nicely was why I decided to go with complete system as identified here. I ran Untangle in a VM on ESXi 5.0 without issue - currently running Sophos UTM Home in same configuration for well over a year without issue.
I drives 2 for sure but it has been my experience, that if you plug in HDMI it turns off other 2 ports in other models
Yes, this power supply will fit inside your case and is rated with enough power for a stock configuration. If you've added additional display adapters it may not be sufficient power depending on what you've added.
This is a little large for the Coolpix. There may not be enough area around the LCD to attach the viewfinder - you know this is not an EVF, but an optical attachment, right? It's as big as the S9500! Mainly used for DSLR videography -
Yes, it does.
We ship to Mexico by Fedex. It costs approx $50. We do not ship by mail to Mexico because packages are often delayed or lost.
Depends how old your Mac is. If it only supports 1067MHz I believe the maximum you can put on it is 2x 4GB modules, so a total of 8GB max.
Well, it worked for me. I have 2008 imac. I ordered 4gb memory(2 chips). I pulled old memory out n inserted the new memory, one at a time. I turned on the computer n i could see the increased memory right away in drop down menu "about this mac."
Yes
I have not tried it with Linux to this point. ..I have a feeling it won't automount as it did in windows though. ..
1. Yes it displays whatever is on your latptop screen and shows it on the TV or projector. Everything shows very good, except when playing videos the texture and color is a lilttle bit faded. 2. No you can not play an external hardrive directly with out it being connected to a pc.
Yes and it's not a problem.
It is a little heavy. If you get 3M VHB and treat the surface you would probably have success. However, you may do better finding something with adhesive already and less weight for a vertical mount.
You push the cord it in and then it gets held snuggle. It work well.
I'm not sure. I have it on a horizontal desk. It doesn't weight much. If you were planning to use heavy cords, it doesn't fit between the slots. Sorry I wasn't able to answer your Q.
Probably not.
No adhesive, weighted to stay on desktop, cords pull up and out easily . I think gravity would work against you if you use it upside down.
It's not for a mouse ... it's to hold your cords in place so they won't fall off your desk
No it will not fix the green. That color problem is the blue filter on the projector. It is also replaceable ,but requires a bit more work. Go ahead and replace the bulb. Then start the hunt for the filter. An electronics shop will charge a couple hundred bucks to do it. But you can dons a how to video on YouTube.
Yes make sure its for sony rear panel TVs.
I don't believe so.
I have had my tv for 5 year and replaced it twice. I want to say around 2000 hours.
Sorry , I did mean to hit send , anyway the resistance is not the same so you run the rusk of overheating and this could definitely cause a number of problems. However, I am not an expert in this area, so I'm just talking from reading and experience. Hope this helps.
Dear Customer, Thank you for your interest in our BlueRigger HDMI cables. The 50Ft cable does support the latest HDMI features such as 4k resolution. Please feel free to contact us at service@bluerigger.com if you have any additional questions. Thanks! BlueRigger LLC service@bluerigger.com
Not sure if this helps you but, I've had mine for over a year now and have had no graphics issues. I really only play Diablo III (Reaper of Souls) and I've had no lag at all. I just have internet problems due to I am connected by Wi-Fi.
The camera has 1 (one) Stereo 3.5mm input jack on the front for the shotgun mic. I'm not sure how well the splitter idea would work or what the quality would be like, but in theory it should at least be functional. I know they make battery powered interfaces for that sort of thing that can combine two XLR inputs into a stereo signal. Good luck!
Yes. Standard treaded mount ready...
It is a hair or two shy of 4 3/4" OD (outside diameter)
I installed it about 6 months ago and am satisfied with it. Clarity is acceptable in general but seems to gave a better picture than my other 3 outdoor cameras at night. I will buy thus one again when and if I need another. WS
Yes you do , is not battery operated so it must be plug to power outlet
No its 4.99 shipping too
yes it does
82"
Chih, I have a D7100 myself, and it did not work. My suggestion is to pay a little more and buy the Amazon Basics version. It costs a little more, but it worked perfectly.
Makjic60, you should have any problems. It works on my D5100, D7000 and D600.
These are both highly rated but I went with the Sound blaster USB 24 bit DAC after having driver issues with the sound blaster internal card. This may have been related to my computer but you can't go wrong with any of the 3. The speakers are awesome in 24 bit.
No it does not.
yes you can. it has a wiring harness that you can have hooked up to the factory wiring of your stock stereo. I recommend having it professionally installed. Its a great amp, clean sound for mids and highs. I have bought two. I recommend this amp.
Only if you can use a standard external antenna coax port.
NO, there are no provisions on the controller or anywhere else to allow for mono output. Suggest instead, that you get a cheap Audio Mixer and configure that for MONO. Good luck
When fully charged it has lasted a whole weeks vacation using it on and off. Not sure in total hours how long I think in the book it states 4 hours.
Hi Donald. Right click the volume icon of the computer and go to 'Playback Devices'. Choose the TV as the default playback device.
No & no, it's mostly a matte black so it hides things pretty well.
It uses Razer synapse 2.0, like most Razer products
Disable unless using more than one device to link.
You can change the language in the camera, by default it is in Japanese, but no problem. The users manual is also in Japanese, but you can download it in english.
Yes it does.
I wish I could help, mine quit working a month after I received it
I've tried wmv, mp4, avi, mpg and work very well.
According to Google there is an update for Windows 8 so yes.BTW after at least several months I still love this card for streaming video
says on side of box works with windows. and 350 watt power supply req. so no mention of linux. says directx by ms. so might not work. email the mfg if want to.
no. It uses memory cards only.
good quality picture and sound quality is good
if you go on to a car stereo shop's website called crutchfield.com, it will walk you through what stereos will fit your make and year vehicle. their sizing chart works like a champ. you cant go wrong.
Any time you mix brands you get into unsupported territory. That said as long as the upset settings are the same on both ends you should be ok but no promises. Fortune should have a Soho router similar to this though, why not go that route and have one throat to choke for tech support?

You;ll need a 110V cord plugged into a wall outlet and an USB at the other end that will plug into the SONY Bloggie
I don't believe it would work. The video output from a 5 or 5s iphone is digital, 4 and 4s video output is analog.
17 Watts RMS per channel into 4 Ohms, 4 channels driven from 20 Hz to 20 kHz with less than 1% THD+N.
micro usb connector and cable
Hi Amazon Customer, the camcorder does not have a mic jack. You can only record audio with the built in stereo microphone. Thanks_Mitch
One thing I can add to the other excellent advice given here is - after you press the MW/LW button, press the ETM button. This excellent feature will scan across the AM band and store found stations which are then accessible by slowly dialing the tuning a click at a time. Enjoy!
Make sure in charge mode by holding "battery" button while radio is off. Should say CHA ON and nimh battery image should be in upper left of display. I haven't had any problems, but the 1000 ma batteries don't last long.
Theoretically a little over 3. I have not seen over2.2 usually just under2. 2.2 was ideal sun exposure and cleaned panel.
I'd say it boosts the signal about another 10 miles.
Sorry, Marian. I don't know. Mine didn't have advanced instructions with it. It only came with the connection instructions. There are a LOT of symbols on it that I have NO idea what they do.
It's quite small. It has the old type (wide) Apple connector. Yes it does charge while playing.
You would need an adapter. It will work with 4S and earlier though.
no it don't
No it does not. I guess I have never even noticed because i use my Iphone for my alarm. It is a very nice radio/charger, but the instructions for using it were hard to figure out.
The area where you place the iPad, or anything, is 10x10 inches. From the surface under the cabinet where it is attached, to the bottom edge of the rack when it's hanging, it's about 12-1/2 inches. Hope that helps.
The literature I have....as well as the "System Info." on Control Panel just lists my computer as a C650D The 018 part isn't on my. My most educated guess is that it would. These keyboards are close to $50 from most places....and this was far more reasonable. Install is quite easy too.
Garmin discontinued the service for this unit, from what I understood from their " Disgusting customer Service" "It was too expensive" by their provider . They offered no compensation and I was told by their customer service rep. that quite frankly " my devices don't last more than a year anyway". My suggestion is file a complaint with The Attorney Generals office of Consumer Affairs and definitely don't buy another Garmin product ! I got sucked into their Nuvi products also ! Real pieces of Crap ! Tim Shaw
Yes it does. Alerts when it's 20% & 10%
A smart tv is kinda of like a smart phone with apps and stuff and yes smart TVs come with build in wifi
FT7900 RX 108-520 MHZ continuous plus 700-999.99 MHz and can do steps of 5/10/12.5/15/20/25/or 100KHz so the answer is yes to your question
There is a video on you tube that shows how to modify the ft7900r to operate on gmrs. Looks pretty easy. I haven't done it yet but plan too. "Winter project" lol;)
No
No, the noises does filter in, but considering the price, they do a fairly good job, I actually purchase these earphones for going on bus trips, and not wanting to watch the DVD's they show on the bus, I listen to my audible books, keeps noise down to a minimum.
For the price they're most comfortable headphones I Think. Mostly I like sound loudness and quality. Also they are not too big or too small.
Agree - the blue color did not match the photo.
50 pounds? No its maybe 3 pounds.
If by engine noise you mean the annoying sound that started when I originally installed the satellite radio, then YES. This product has worked great for me so far. I don't hear any of the noise that was originally there.
When I used the will it fit function it said it would fit. Fit will be the dimensions. It may physically fit not taking into account for screen out and dashboard position. Alterations may be needed
It doesn't have an optical in.
It probably can or if not just get it put in there by audio people
Yes with the proper instillation kit
NO.
I do not think you can this is a base unit. I wold go to a custom shop they would be able to give you the best advice.
not sure sorry i no that this is the same size as a regular car cd player and if your pt cruiser has a regular size not factory cd player then this will work. i never saw a pt cruiser original radio so
Yes. That will work just fine.
I can't honestly answer your question, but I have a mixing board with 2 tower 15" running off of it and do not have to turn it past half volume.
the amp has 1/4 and speakon inputs but the outputs are speakon and basic wired. you can get speakon to 1/4 cables pretty easily or an adapter to go from speakon to 1/4 inch. The amps works very good, I have it running my monitors.
Not enough info about speaker
Front viewing is depending on the mode your setting with the monitor unit. This has does not come with the bracket but this item stays still by locking it between the hole with its washer. LED does activate when d surroubding r dark.
Not submersible but water resistant.
because the lens is a medium telephoto, no, and there is no zoom in or out feature I can find. extension cords are available to place the camera farther away.
From what I can gather, you still have to pay for the channels and a card. This only allows you to stream to all the other devises in your house without having to pay the cable co for other boxes.
No offense, but when you compare EEE slate with iPad, you already put one foot in the wrong hole... EEE slate is a full feature Windows 7 computer, while iPad contains wheelchair iOS. (I mean, there are just so many limitation on iOS, why people are still liking it?)
I don't believe so.
Plugs will, the pouch will not
No it works directly with your android device. You don't need the polar watch with it. I run most every day using it. Every run lasts about 1 1/2 hours. The battery gets replaced every 3 or 4 weeks. But I do use it a lot.
Possably, its ment for a car, and has been on my truck of my 2003 crown vic.. It holds up at 110 mph. So it should be good in your house.. The signal is sometimes sketchy though.
David - Yes! As long as the width of the TV is no more than 32". The mount is about 16 inches from pivot joint to pivot joint, which means that if your TV is double that width (32"), it will be able to turn without hitting the wall.
Yes.
I own a Rebel T1i. I'd say E-PL2 is good on its own and definitely not a step down. I'm taking only the EPL2 with me these days, and I couldn't be happier by travelling light. I recommend the Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 lens for use with E-PL2. The 20mm focal length is equal to 25mm on a Rebel. It's a cool walkaround lens that will give you superb shallow depth of field at f/1.7.
It is a fixed lens, but has a zoom lens, so you can go from close-up to telephoto.
Do you mean continuous autofocus? If so, reference page 41 of users guide. "Press AF c-s-m button" (bottom button on left side of viewer screeen) and "rotate command dial" (top right)
Sure. But the tripod-style legs could get in the way and cause a tripping hazard.
NO! BG-E14 is for the 70D
The information you are looking for should be in your Cobra instruction book, If not e-mail Cobra.. Get on their web site. If you have the cable? Should work.
it comes in black or white
Yes, I purchased two and it worked ok with the Iphone 4. I had issues utilizing this on a Samsung S4.
Yes I have been using this screen shield since June and it is fantastic. I can sit outside in the sun and it reduces the glare! I would recommend it!!
it is antiglare....anti reflector.....it will help you.
I bought this for my samsung laptop with 13.4" display and I cut some part to use it since it was wider than my laptop display.
Yes. Not severe, but noticeable.
The 560LMT shows moving time, stopped time and total time. Has 2 trip meters, A&B, moving Average speed, max speed, elevation. There's no on or off duty, or off duty at well, or anything about wells at all.
Have not done the camera; but with radio in hand appears all that's needed is camera.
Only with Iphone.
Yes
It doesn't come with the interface, you have to buy it separately
Yeah
yes
I was able to upload my files on my Macbook Pro straight into iMovie by clicking on the video camera icon.
Yes. If you use XLR you need an adaptor to ??? small, stereo (can't think of the name) kind of plug.
I believe it came with one, so I bought 3 more and a wall charger for use overseas. Trying to charge the battery thru the camera and powercord is VERY slow.
The CX760v is newer but the low light specs, bigger sensor size, and smaller size makes the HF G10 still a very good choice.
The only items in the box are the head unit, the wiring harness and the microphone for Bluetooth. You will need a vehicle specific harness, and any accessory cables, like iPod, seperately
I would go to crutchfield.com to see if it fits your vehicle then purchase through amazon if it does. I have the pioneer back up camera as well. It works great but it does not have a grid.
Sure, the cable is called a CD-IU50V cable. It will also charge your iphone while playing. I have this cable and works pretty good.
Yeah. Any double-A batteries will do.
I believe it does, although I haven't used it yet.
Yes There is a mike plug on right hand side towards front near the strap. I have no experience with any type of external mikes. The onboard mike works fairly well at distances
also wondering why.
No
I actually bought it for someone else. I know that they were very satisfied with it.
There is an energy save setting in the menu. Make sure to turn it off.
Not sure. But measurements are 3 1/2" X 6" with an opening of 3/4". Sides do stretch a little. Fits my nuvi 2597 perfectly.
As fare as I know it does. This item works with any B G or N routers U might have to look at you're router box to find. Out witch u have.
There is a limit for the shaking and velocity.
it is made in Taiwan ..
Hello. I read a article about it being used on a canon 50d. It fits my rebel T2i and SL1 cameras. It should work just fine. I did notice that the camera hunts when focusing more than with the standard lense. Takes longer to shoot sometimes. It may be the way I have it set up. I don't like to swap lenses when on vacation and that is why I bought this lense. I haven't used it much. Hope this helps.
Would not recommend this USB modem, it has no instructions or clues as to how to use it other than it specifically acts as a dial-up modem for Internet access and for fax/data applications via a land telephone line (includes the telephone cord for connecting the same). You said you have a "modem wire" - suggesting you already have a modem and thus no need for an external modem. Maybe you need a USB connector, not a modem? Best to due more research for your specific need.
yes but it will interrupt the fax transmission. I'm not sure how you are using the modem. It connects to the computer and then the wall. The fax and/or phone are connected via a splitter from the wall jack. But regardless it will disconnect when a fax or a call comes in.
Michelle; I believe that it should have come with a mini-disk in the package (both of mine did). You can go to the Conexant website (http://www2.conexant.com/Product/modems/Pages/default.aspx), although there's little clear info there. If you can't find the answer, try the "contact us" option. If all else fails, I could always mail one of my 2 disks to you!
I would look elsewhere. I bought this modem and it would not work and had no support. Went to Best Buy and am happy!
I would not buy this product! No support. Did not work once! RUN!
They are exactly the same as the originals.
to find speaker grills for your car google speaker grill covers for your car many that fit your car will come up
I am not sure but I think it should be good so long you have a 2.0 usb port. It is not a very strong kind of cooling pad, so don't expect years of service. I have bought it twice both times they were good for 6 months. They are not very well built but sort of does the job ok. I just bought it because it was the cheapest.
The darker the room, the better it looks but you can still see good colors in a normally lit room.

I do not know. In case others might, here's what that means: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD_region_code
We bought this and use it for car rides with the kids. I don't think it holds a charge or has any batteries. It plugs into the wall, or in the car we plug it into an electrical converter (converts power from cigarette lighter to a normal outlet).
The drive shows up as a network drive but you should be able to install programs on it. If you just want an external drive to install programs on you wouldn't need this network drive. You could do that on any external hard drive that is not networked. You would only need this drive if you wish to have access to your files and data while away from your computer say on a laptop or other desktop computer. Hope this helps. uspilot
No, of course not. You will only find made in Japan in super high price tagged items like high end cameras. It is made in China. Country of origin should be mandatory in product description in the copy for every item. The power of living group s writing against consumers' interests.
Do you have a family member or relative or great friend that live here in America? Have them buy it for you and ship it to you? (just an idea) don't have a solution to this question really.
Yup, works great!
It's not for any Android phone. I still have it in I can't tell you what it's for.
Mine is a fifth generation Ipod and it fits perfectly. I would, however, strongly advise not to get this, unless you have an Ipod that is lighter or you keep it in your pocket. The "lanyard" is practically worthless, as is the hook on the back.
I'm actually not sure which is which with the display ports but I have a macbook pro and it works. I've actually found that to get the sound to work, you'd have to change the settings on your computer for the sound to come through the adaptor (to the tv) rather than the speakers on your computer. Hope this helps.
You should have a plug-in at the back of your tv, and it usually is blue. It has the same shape as the one on your computer. The wire for the volume plugs into a slot right next to the blue plug-in.
I don't see why it wouldn't work as long as the projector has sound. I use the cable to connect my Mac to TV and use the little Auxilary connection so the sound comes out my TV Speakers.
You probably could--we just set our 60" on top, and there was still room on each side. Since the mount is in the middle, it should work. We really like the stand! Good luck!
Should fit easily.
It should I have a Garmin GPS with a 5 inch screen and there is a little room to share
sorry not sure we had brought it for a TomTom XXL 540TM 5-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS Navigator, it worked good for it though. It stated it works for 5" GPS Devices, the Dimensions are: 6.7 x 2 x 5 inches our TomTom dimensions were 0.9 x 5.2 x 3.5 inches.
They are wall charger units.
works perfectly, I use it on my pc with that voltage
Correct. It's a sturdy bag.
it will work at up to 1600mhz on any motherboard supporting ddr3 desktop memory... or it should. i use it on ivy bridge which is 3rd gen before hazwell and after sandy
Yes they will work. I currently have a Hyper 212 Evo and they fit just fine with plenty of clearance.
Correct you are right.
YES TOI DOES COMES WITH A CABLE T
I really couldn't say. We use them in the kitchen and they are usually just plugged in. When we've had them other places it seems like it only takes an hour or two. Hope that helps. They are great little speakers and we're happy with them. The only issue we fou d is that the switch is a little cheap but otherwise a great buy.
Yes there's a charging cable and all the cables you need for this item.
No an adapter is needed.
Not marked on binoculars or case, don't have the box.
You want ounces? Look it up. But with the right harness, these are PERFECT! Great in low light. You will be amazed how well you can see in low light - both early morning and late in the day.
yes!
No
I didn't make it work with my galaxy s3
I have this monitor. We use it as a prototype monitor in our rapid designs. It is easy to work with. The colors, responsiveness, and brightness are poor. I won't recommend this as a regular use product. It is great for rapid prototypes.
I doubt it, it lines up with existing screws in my wrangler and i am not sure if you have the same holes? I am sure if you did a mod it would, but would not recommend it.
If the monitor has two tabs on the back side of the bottom of the screen, it will clip to the bottom of the monitor. The question remains if there is a power connection for the speaker. This will also be on the back underside in the same area as the other connections and the speaker will power on and off with your monitor. If you don't have this connection port, it will need a separate power supply and be manually powered up or down.
Your Dell monitor should have "hooks" on the back if it is compatible with the speaker. (you could call Dell and verify your monitor model is compatible if uncertain) The speaker has built-in holes aligned for these hooks. Great buy for the money if you're not an audiophile expecting Bose sound. Looks good, unobtrusive. Clutter off the workspace, floor, etc.
Yes..it would
It should as long as the screen is 15.6" . I switched mine and it fit in my laptop
Yes, all USB 3 on front.
I think a medium can be anywhere between 34 to 38. It depends on who you ask. Is the dress for too small? When I got mine I had to adjust it for my figure. I got a small but had to pad it with fleece because I am 34 28 35. I'm built kind of like a boy. lol...You might try padding it unless you have the reverse problem and then I think if I were you I would send it back for a smaller one you can adjust to fit. Hope that helps...I love mine....
Not sure how good it will be. I have only used it in a "smaller" way. A large TV may need a more powerful range, but you could probably try it and if not to your satisfaction return it. The speaker is wonderful with the computer -- more than adequate.
plugs in via USB port; no battery.
Not sure.
I really do not know. I just went off the info on my old battery when I ordered mine. Sorry I could not help you.
Yes, fits perfectly!
Yes, it does. I bought this about 2 months ago for my 2014 Air. Fits like a glove.
We got the purple case and the keyboard cover is like an iced purple. It is color coordinated and fits perfect.
Yes! It's brighter in person. Very cute
The keyboard cover is a lighter pink.
It has a standard digital coax port and a optical port as well you just have to make sure you turn it on in the settings under Dolby digital
YES. You need the Slimline Type to Receive HD Channels unless you don't want these type channels.
No. It's strictly for entertainment.. Not a tracking device.
the camera is not included, sold separately
I lost a couple of those years ago, I hang onto them now like my life depends on it. I honestly have no idea!
Unless they have fixed the problem with this tripod - the head is glued on, NOT screwed on, I would stay away from it. I had my camera on it and it almost fell on the floor. The company did, finally, offer to replace it, but I declined the offer and did not get my money back. I would not risk putting an expensive piece of equipment on this tripod. It's possible the company has a better build one which you might look into.
No, but it has a 4" sub built in. I bought a 6.5 powered sub that had RCA L/R pass through and went from that to the CSMP88. Works nice.
Not mountable. If has tiny legs and sets on a surface.
You would need a car charger similar to http://www.amazon.com/Wasabi-Power-Battery-Charger-Canon/dp/B004VTAVLE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1393704177&sr=8-1&keywords=car+charger+for+canon+lp-e8+battery. I cannot speak to the batteries included in this package, I am just sending it as a reference. I have the T3i and have 2 Canon batteries like the one about which you are inquiring but only have the house charger. It would be the charger, not the battery which would be compatible with a car. Hope this helps.
Not according to Panasonic's web site. Comparing my ZS7 to the pics of the ZS9 shows a slightly different shaped front and different button placement (in two cases). That means the buttons on the waterproof case won't quite match up with the camera inside.
I don't get a cracking noise when I open and close my Mac. It's actually pretty smooth.
According to http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook-air/macbook-air-faq/differences-between-macbook-air-early-2014-mid-2013.html there is no difference in hardware between the mid 2013 and early 2014 models. Early 2014 models are the MD7600LL/B.
I can't imagine why not, it has the same body style. But I haven't handled a D700 myself
Dinosaw, I've used these star filters in astrophotography to highlight bright stars. They don't add any distortions at all. Zero chromatic aberration, no vignetting as long as they are stacked with other filters, and no detectable edge distortions. If you want to create highlight effects on bright objects, I highly recommend these filters. Best wishes, Ron Smith
I am not sure about iPhone 5. I only have an iPad2 which I won in a drawing. My other products are Android. The box the Sanoxy item came in has a photo of iPhone (doesn't specify which version), iPad, and iPod, along with cameras, TV, laptops, and keyboard. It comes with connector, AV cable, and 2Mini USB cables. Hope someone with your iPhone 5 has a better answer for you. It works like magic on my iPad 2. Good luck.
I don't know the answer to that
I tried to use it with my IPAD and it wouldn't recognize the device so I am sure that this will not work with IPod touch.
I think you can, you could plug it in sound output in your PC. But you will be able to listen only and not talk, because it's a transmitter only and doesn't receive. So it's not very practical to use. If you have a Bluetooth headset I recommend Belkin or Asus Bluetooth dongle which you can plug in an USB port and you will be able to communicate both ways and listen to music. I have both and both are excellent.
no. and ours broke about 2 weeks after we got it. avoid.
To be honest, I don't know if all that would fit physically but let me warn you this case has pretty bad airflow.
I can only guess that it helps to keep the battery life from running out faster instead of keeping the touch screen lite up all the time while you are listening to music.
There is no viewfinder, just LCD.
Well Canon is a japanese company if that helps you.
It has a battery.
Yes it works on Mac just plug in and it will download your images from camera
I am also facing the same issue, I have just purchased it. Was worried if it can damage my camera or I will return its a problem
All I received with my camera was a CD. I would contact Canon and see if they have it online that you could print out.
yes and it works perfect
Just VGA and DVI no hdmi
Yes
im not sure what dvi-d output is exactly. i have two dvi cables. one of them is regular and the other one is super thick and fat. the super thick and fat one, has an extra line across another one to make the "+" sign where the connecters are. i checked the monitor and it does not support this cable.
I would not recommend mounting to drywall. If you need to mount other than between two studs, I would attach a piece of 3/4" wood 24" x 12" and attach it with lag bolts to the studs. I would then attach the Full Motion mount to the wood.
19" W x 12-3/4"H
I'm running windows 8 and the drive gives the option to format to exFat. This allows you to use the drive on both PC and MAC without the 4GB file max.
Yes it does, I have a Lenovo y580 and this charger was a perfect replacement.
Yes, the Lenovo Y510p and Y410p share the same adapter, meaning the same input jack, volts and amps. Power In: AC 100 to 240V, 50/60Hz Power Out: 19v Plug Shape: Hollow Cylinder Shape
Yes. It has a 3 pronged for the ground. You would have to have a 3 pronged outlet to plug it into.
Yes, it works fine.
It's only a case with usb keyboard. You put an already owned G-tablet into it to protect it and give it a convenient keyboard accessory when opening it.
It's been working great with mine.
I would go with the 6-8 and then add padding if you need to increase the size. Like I said in my review, the waist is closer to 27" than to the listed 26" but if it had been too small I would've made a duct tape dummy (google it for instructions) and then taped it on top of the form to make it conform to my measurements. Better too small than too big-- it's not like you can shave down the form to make it smaller.
You have to buy the external equip. But then u st just plug and play
Strictly a manual mode lens.
Yes, it will work on the D90. Just make sure you order it for a Nikon, so they send the correct T-mount. Remember that this lens is a fully manual item, that means you have to focus manually and set ISO and Shutter speed yourself.
hi, its not a heavy lens the camera tripod mount is sufficient.
I guess it will. I'm using this on my olympus e3 with a nikon to 4/3 adaptor and it works fine. Just have to get used to manual focusing.
Yes it does. As a manual and fixed aperture (f:8) lens, it must be use in manual mode. Al D Nikon models with the traditional bayonet mount accept this lens. For the price, it is a very usefull lens for amateur and semi pros, photographers.
Works with most tablets. But check with your tablet manufacturer.
I successfully used it on the Nook HD+ to root it. I now use it to boot from. They don't recommend the faster ones for that task.
A regular address card
6000
No. It doesn't work with stand iPhone Bluetooth. You have to jailbreak your phone and download a third party bluetooth app. That should be spelled out before people purchase.
PC software is not good, use a usb cable. download the software from polaroid website or use your android phone, download the app from google play, BlueTooth password is 6000.
Yes this AC charger will work on your eMachine. Check on your eMachine the voltage is the same as what the output says on the charger. It's either 12volts or 19volts not sure but it's printed on the bottom of your eMachine.
I would contact Amazon or the seller and let them know. You could always contact Case Logic as well and let them know that the rain hood is missing, I'm sure they will just send it to you. Also, not sure if you checked, but in the top of the bag, in the compartment where you would put food or a drink, that is where the rain hood would be. I almost missed it.
Orange
No, there is not room for a laptop. Sorry.
Material is the same as the rest of the bag but It does have some padding to protect your gear. Not a lot though.
I am not sure what you are asking. You plug one output HDMI and up to 3 input HDMI into the switch. So for example a gaming console and Blu-ray player would be 2 inputs, and the output goes to a TV. A remote control for the switch is provided. What would an IR sensor be used for in this situation.
A wireless USB receiver. I think it included some second rate AA batteries but if it did, they didn't last long.
Yes, there are outputs for: digital coaxial, composite & component, one of each. The resolution in component is very-very good. Buy it with confidence.
This memory is not for laptops!
All buttons work on mines includling call wait , volume. It may be defected
No
PXE boot is set on the motherboard. So I don't think this would work.
The device operates on AA battery power but is supposed to draw power from a USB port that connects it to the PC. If an AC adapter is needed, I would look for a 3V universal adapter at Home Depot, Radio Shack, or Frye Electronics: take the unit in with you but save time by calling them over the phone ahead of going there..
Nope. Nothing to pay after you purchase the device.
Yes, the 722k can be connected via wifi to use the sling adapter. That's how my 722k is connected.
If your tablet has a micro USB, then you'll need an adapter. Also if the USB hub is on the bottom where the case folds, it can be a problem when trying to use most adapters. I wound up returning the one i bought. If they made these with micro usb and designed the tablet holder with enough space for the plug, it would be ok. Also- this isn't a 'dock' there's a very short cable from keyboard to your tablet.
It will but you will need a micro to usb adapter in order for the keyboard to work.
i assume you are referring to Terabytes? However many you put in it. You supply the hard drives, pick your TB's
Hi Christian, Thank you for your interest in one of our products. We would be more than happy to find a screen that is compatible with your laptop. In checking for screen compatibility, it is best that we go by the "part number" of the screen to ensure accuracy. You can find the part number at the back of the screen once it is taken out of the laptop. We look forward in doing business with you. Thank you,
Yes it should be!
This is compatible with dell inspiron 15 inch, Wats your laptop?
Yes. I have an ipad2 and they work great on it. They should work on any device that has a standard headphone plug.
Yes
It doesn't connect to the radio it plays through the car sound system by sending the music feed to the car radio using an FM signal. It does play music from my ipod very well. The radio/ cd player etc play independently. This product is very well made plus it charges my ipod and my phone simultaneously while in use.
I use this web site as a guide when traveling. http://prepaidwithdata.wikia.com/wiki/Prepaid_SIM_with_data
It means the SIM card cannot be voice only, but needs some data plan associated with it. Majority of SIM cards have some kind of data plan.
I used http://www.keepgo.com to get a SIM card for my mifi 3352 in Europe but you can probably do better price wise by finding a card when you get to Europe.
I believe topographical maps are available in a desperate package from Magellan for a fee. Check with them online for details and pricing.
No it cant. It doesn't "speak" or provide turn by turn directions
No, when i press the button i can stop the music from playing but it does not control the volume unfortunately.
Yes it can! They're great.
I am not able to answer your question with direct experience, but I am doubtful that it will work with your model. You may want to check with Nikon to see if Coolpix P80 has a wireless remote capability. If it does, this may work.
No
Yes
This camera matches every Nikon F-mount lens, so if your lens matches any other Nikon's SLR, it will surely match the FE.
Every shutter speed works either manually or in aperture priority.
Ummm, it isn't a digital camera so it doesn't have a main battery. All it requires is a watch battery and you can buy thoes for like $6.
Yes
I think it is all solid circuitry, without fuses. I had a lot of trouble with this system, and returned it.
Check out the Logitech Remotes, Harmony series. Very easy to program and will replace ALL of your remotes with one!
I have no bloody idea mate
Not sure about that one but I can tell you it is much easier to setup then D link. The GUI is easy and I am not a tech guy.
Hi JW, I'm not quite sure I understand your question. There are quite a few counterfeits out there and typically they take several weeks to ship because they're shipping from China. If you order through Bluelounge then you're guaranteed authentic Bluelounge product and will ship in a timely manner from a warehouse in the US.
There are 8 USB 2.0 ports in the back There are 2 USB 3.0 ports in the back 1 USB 2.0 port in front 1 3.0 USB port in front
X79 intel chip set
Yes
No it doesn't but it should. 2 AA batteries are depleted by half in 2hrs of continuous use. I may have to invest in rechargable batteries. Looking to upgrade to a Tascam but need to do the research.
Yes they will. I checked with Crutchfield.com before answering to confirm. You can double check by going to the website and clicking under Car Audio&gt;Find What Fits My Car.
If They will fit then...... Yes!!!!! Super Great Speakers!!!!
It would be a tight fit. Remember, the speakers are 6"X 9" but the mounting brackets take even more space. You effectively need a 7"X 10" area to mount them. Kicker also makes a smaller round speaker that will fit. It may cost a little bit more to get the sound quality of the 6"X 9", but it is an option. I have both in my Jeep, and I'm very happy with them. You will need an amp to really make them 'kick'.
Mine are about 4.5 inches deep. I didn't measure them though, I'm just judging based on pictures of when I installed mine.
I've hooked up my snes to my LG via the coaxial cable and didn't have any issue. Hope this helps.
Has SIM and Wifi... SIM works in America for sure.. it comes with a T-Mobile SIM... not sure that'll work somewhere else.. ask T-Mobile.
This one already comes unlocked. Just in case, you can send an email to: UnlockCodeRequest@Dell.com With this information: Order number: IMEI number: Service tag: Country of Purchase: You'll receive a reply with an unlock code usually in about 10 business days.
I'm not sure, but I guess it won't, because it is for T-mobile. You can try to unlock it though. I suggest that you just don't buy it. It's not a good product.
it can be anything from the motherboard having a wrong setting to a driver issue or a video conflict. you should call an it pro. if you are in the tampa, fl area or can at least get on it and go to the internet then tampacd.com they can remote in and fix it if you have internet.
Possibility. Is is a simple card should do ok
Yes it does
Yes, It is a board, CPU/GPU all in one. I currently use it as a storage server, and another for a desktop OS. Never had a problem with it. Only thing that I wasnt happy with is the plastic SATA connectors on the MOBO come off easily. I just put it back on, but it works great.
No, not really. It's barely passable. It will work OK on older games and not really on newer games. It's nice because there are no moving parts on it so the fan never dies like on many of them. If you want a gaming adapter, look elsewhere. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107-7.html
The card isn't powerful enough. You'll have to go a lot more high-end for a card that supports more than two simultaneous outputs. Look for a Quadro.
Yes. As long as you have available PCI slots, it will mount to the motherboard. In order to get it to work, you would have to set it up from the set up menu(F8 or F10). You'll find it under your graphics or video settings. To change your audio to your HDMI, you'll have to go under the same menu this time looking for audio options. You would change the setting from auto to both. That should do it.
Yes it should
Not sure Aaron it might, I purchased this for a Colby tablet. Sorry I wasn't much help.
Top to bottom, it's a good snug fit. Diameter-wise, there's plenty of room. When I put on the lens hood reverse, it's a properly snug fit.
That lens is 1.5cm (about 3/4 inch) longer than this case. However it is also 1cm (about 3/8") less than filling up the full width so there's some possibility that this case just might stretch that far including a little give in the zipper. But if you don't want to risk it or don't want a tight fit, you need a case that fits at least 8cm diameter by 15cm long / alternatively a minimum of 3.5 by 6 inches.
Dell. To confirm this go to Dell's website at http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/19?~ck=mn Look on the back of the monitor for your Service Tag or Express SVC Codes and enter either of these where asked. A Product Support page will come up, select your monitor. On the next page look for view warranty. This will tell you the start date and end date of your warranty.
http://bit.ly/19DPu73 short answer is yes.
Transcend 8 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC10E Buy a brand name one. Dont go with a generic and risk losing all your pictures.
The camera acts like a flash drive when you connect it to the computer, and you can go into the folders and copy all the pictures and videos. They should all be there and copy easily. If you use the software for downloading there is a video option to download into that tool. I do it using drag using Windows Explorer and drop to MY PICTURES in the folder I like.
I'm sorry I have no clue on how to use that. I've only used the camera twice and I actually don't know much it since I've barley used it, but it does take nice photos.
Yes it will.
The legs fold together.
I am not familiar with a product you're talking about. Sorry, I cannot help you.
Yes. That is the exact same scope I have mounted to this tripod and it works fine for me. I only use it for viewing objects and not for any type of photography though. Hope that helps. :-)
The power supply is dual voltage, all you would need is a US-European plug adapter like this: http://www.amazon.com/CVID-Grounded-European-Adapter-Adaptor/dp/B0098B5GN8/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1382032929&sr=8-5&keywords=us+to+european+plug+adapter
It plays mp4 format per instruction manual. Our Viewsonic, however, does not...that aspect may be defective
We certainly can, we can place a factory order with HID and have them programed to the format, facility code and fob numbers you need. Please note however, while there is no fee for this, HID does have a strict minimum order quantity of 100 pieces for such orders. There is also a 2 week lead time while they program and ship your fobs. We recommend you contact our technicians for ordering advice, 516-812-0917. Thanks and have a great day!
That depends entirely on your reader. In many cases, the system does not pass that information on or look at it, and only forwards the main code. You will want to check with your reading system. Since you have no control over the code on these keyfobs, there is little harm in ordering one and seeing if the reader will acknowledge it and say it's not a known card, or kick it out. At least if finances allow.
I have not attempted to use it in that manner. I am an orchid grower and use it to measure natural light as well as full spectrum grow light.
Platinum Tools 100054C Clamshell EZ-RJPRO HD Crimp Tool I went with a higher grade crimping tool that did everything I needed. Wasn't sure I wanted to spend the money when I was shopping around, but after cabling my entire house I was happy I went with this model instead of one of the lower cost ones. It cuts, strips, crimps easily and quickly. Hope this helps, Dan.
Yes definitely and no you don't need anything else to use the device
yes it could. it's about 2'' by 4 ''.
Yes
Only if you have an adapter. However, I STRONGLY urge you to avoid iHealth products. If anything goes wrong with it once the warranty expires, you are totally out of luck. They will not repair it, they will not let you upgrade, they will do absolutely nothing to help you.
Yes
The one I purchased doesn't have a recharging option at all. It's battery powered. You simply replace the batteries when they run out. Obviously you could use rechargeable batteries. But it's not a rechargeable unit.
Only power cable to wall wart. You will need to supply digital output cable. The good news is you have three options. I lean towards the balanced xlr.
There is no two sides camera but since the screen does swivel 180 degrees it's like as if it had 2 cameras. You can download and install any Windows application or game as long as it meets the requirements needed by the game or application.
Yes. I'm using it with Windows 7 and have no issues. Little calculator button, forward, back, reload... all work. Volume control works great too.
If it has a USB port it will work.
To be honest, I don't know for sure. I use it in my garmin and it works just fine
Yes according tohttp://www.amazon.com/Chromo-Inc%C2%AE-Android-Capacitive-Multi-Touch/dp/B009W49ALA unit will take up 32 gb micro sd in slot (I got 16gb for my Samsung Tab 3 just in case I want to download a couple of movies for travel); still havent used up the 8 gb card in there now.
Yes it will, I've been using it on my GR since I got it in August of 2013 and I highly recommend it.
There's a mismatch in LCD dimensions. 3.0" vs 3.2" for the D750. It's gonna be smaller than what you need, and will crop your display image. Best look for a 4:3 aspect ratio screen protector. Try searching "3.2 inch lcd protector". Good luck.
Yes it is
Yes it swivels. It also has great manual control. Unfortunately it will not communicate with camera brain as far as intensity function. I've found it to be an excellent sattelite flash as the sensor works great for wireless fill. The hot shoe still works great but intensity has to be manually set on back of flash
I use it with my NEEWER 180W Strobe
I've been running these for about 2 months now and I have not had any issues at all. This is probably my 3rd time purchasing a G. Skill product and they have always functioned wonderfully.
Yes
Yes, Sandy Bridge.
this CPU is for socket 1155 motherboards, and it will only fit socket 1155 mother boards. you will need to check and see what socket your emachines motherboard has.
if its the same number of the one thats in the computer yes
Take out your old one and get the model/item number and look it up to see will fit most likely would be a go but I always check the component or manual first not many people will take electronic returns so its important to be sure its compatible . Keith
Not wireless. And my personal opinion is it isn't that loud either even with volume turned all they way up. I returned mine.
Very easy to move the bracket around. You won't have any trouble with your tv
Yes FE is compatible with AI-S lenses.
No, this lens does not come with a lens hood. Hope this helps. Thank you for shopping our store. We appreicate your business. Blue Penn Cameras
This should fit about any decent sized TV. It has lots of holes on the two units that attach to the TV, at least 32 or bigger.
I use this very cable daily with my IC-7000, primarily for CAT control, not programming.
Jeff, I'm not an antenna engineer so really can't answer but would suggest try both wires to the single screw just to see what happens. Next step would be to disconnect the telescoping antenna and try one lead to that and one to the screw connection. It seems there should be available a good boombox equivalent to the mini-stereo systems of yesterday, let me know if you find one. Cliff Gollus
No. You can plug in an auxiliary device for the sound to come out of the boom box.
not me / but if it has the same plug as head phones it should work signal is signal
NO! It is limited to the MP3 format.
No it comes with an ac battery charger.
Negative! However, it is still an awesome camera -- I use it a lot and love it!
Yes, it works. Read the full review below from Brian Dudenbostel - he describes very clearly how to program this grip; much better than the instructions that came with it. In fact, I printed out his review to keep with the original instructions.
Product Details Product Dimensions: 3.9 x 3.2 x 8.7 inches Per actual item description, see for yourself.
It is in the battery compartment. It took me an hour to find it because it look like part of the compartment. Since I had put the batteries in, I did not think the usb could be there, but it was.
As far as how many gigs? I personally have used as high as a 32 gb in this camera but I'm sure it will go as far as a 64 gb. The brand I mainly use is sandisk, but I have uses many others as well.
yes
Does your other backpack have D-rings to clip on to?
The dual bay raid is not wireless capable by it self. I have a pogo plug that i connect it to that also has three usb 2.0 hubs and a slot on top for a seagate free agent go drive. The dual bay raid in itself is a great bay the best i have bought i currently have two 3TB HDD in with the second being a backup(raid 1) since i have a lot of family photos i do not want to lose.
Nope never had any problems with backwards compatibility, other than the obvious slower speeds. I would however suggest buying a USB 3.0 card if you do not have 3.0 on your system. They are not that expensive and they help improve the speed of the drive transfers.
Yes! this is the same computer I got this for
This is belong to your network speed please check your router or modem and make sure up to date , and are you useing wifi from your PC or TV ? if yes you have to check wifi configuration if you would like to test you DS Network speed connect cable back to bake and do transfer
It has no angle I wouldn't recommend as in ceiling. As In wall it's great but I wouldn't recommend any non angled speaker for in ceiling. At least not for L C R you can get away with using non angled for rears.
I
This is in wall speaker..everything that needed for installation is included
Hello, Amazon never received any of the recalled Sandy Bridge N53SV-XV1, so all of their stock is the new "good" Sandy Bridge. Thank you for your interest!
You can just decline the package, and Amazon will issue you a full refund. And you can reorder the new price one.
I haven't replaced them since September and a lot of the time I forget to shut the keyboard off.
I don't know about the specific model number, but there *are* number keys on the right side on this keyboard.
I can't say I have the 1000 us and it fit perfect sorry I couldn't help.
Two AAA
I have previously checked LG site for this product before I bought it . The only operation systems supported (as they were listed in the site)are: Windows 7, XP and Vista . But although there is no mention of Mac system at all this burner actually supports it.But don`t rely on that fact and take a chance to buy it if your laptop runs Windows 8. As an advice , try to contact Lg or the seller about that issue ...
It was at least 12ft
I would imagine so. It works on car windshields so I can't see how it wouldn't work on a single pane window or door
The shelves are 40 inches across at the leading edge -- much better dimensions can be found on the manufacturer's website (included a link below). http://www.transdecointl.com/td560bch.htm Very good stand overall, easy to get together, very sturdy, and the tilt/swivel features are very convenient.
It will ask you what type, but best is JPEG if you want to print some later! But it was SOOOO slow I returned it to Amazon and took my slides to Costco to be put on a DVD. They formatted a slide presentation with titles,music, graphics etc. It was painless and efficient as I had hundreds of slides for many years. I now am able to take the DVD to friends and family to show.
I believe, NO.
Absolutely, more detail and warmth in the sound.
No it will not pair well. It will have a problem with driving them since the amp is OTL. The output impedance is too high for 30 ohm headphones.
These are very good lens you would have to google a M42 threaded adaptor mount for your model of camera - I know that Fotodiox have them for Cannon EOS
There are 3 choices. I have 2, black and silver. Great product either way
This is external hard drive. You cannot insert DVDs into it.
120V.
It doesn't have an audio in to my knowledge. Only audio out. I would download the instruction manual to be sure, but I would buy a separate receiver. Sony receivers offer the most bank for your buck in my opinion if you are on a tight budget. I currently have the Sony STR-DH820.
As far as I can tell - it does not have any 1/2 zoom increments. I have used the Zoom a few times and haven't seen those type of increments. Hope that helps!
Yes. You set the player for PAL or NTSC in the Settings section.
Mostly thin metal with some plastic misc parts
Hi J. Wurtenberger, Yes, it does use Com port. If you are uncertain which port try each COM port one at a time and use the one that successfully allows the program and your device to communicate. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support
I can not really give you a specific answer about the HD-s9, since I do not have such a headset. This USB however connects to ALL of my bluetooth devices without a single problem. I bought this product, am happy with it, recommend it, but unfortunately can not say anything about hd-s9
Everyone is saying it is very responsive!
No, this only allows you to receive the WiFi signal from a wireless router.
YES.. light weight and ez to carry individually or in LARGE purse. Keeps dust, etc. for most part off the camera. NICE for travel when you have your car or suitcase for any other items you are not using.
Yes, it works.
I had this similar problem as i was doing like UberSerge and deleting things i dont need. What i noticed is that you open back e-Driver and install ATKPackage (the first item) alone it appears to have fixed this issue. Regards
This processor will not work. If you look at the processor's specifications, it says it's a socket AM3.
I'm not familiar with your specific components but if your tv has an HDMI output connected to the receivers HDMI input you should have HD video and digital audio going from the tv to the receiver through the HDMI cable.
I believe Mediabrigde is the better of the two? But like most everyone has there own opinion.Happy Hunting!
I did - no problems encountered.
No it is not. The dell d800 Takes DDR 2700 or 3200 ram.
No, it is not.
Newer modes are but this model was not. Plasma is best! You can purchase a "Smart" DVD that will be the a=same as a smart TV
The cooling pump already has the Termal compound on it. Use that. If you apply any extra it may cause create a *bubble* increasing heat temperature and cause overheating. Make sure to clean the cpu from the old termal compound. Hope this helps.
I plugged into one of the two 4-pin sata terminals on my Asus P5N-D M/B. These are not the colored SATA sockets. I can't remember if I used the provided disc or downloaded the cooler software from the manufacturer's website. In any case, the program didn't start right away. After a couple of repeated computer shut downs and start ups it suddenly began working, and has been ever since. Keep trying.
I find that the the connector piece is important..I've purchased many that do not fit but are otherwise the correct voltage. Look closely at the piece that fits into the device and see if it will fit. Hope this helps.
Yes. The large unit between the 'phones and the plug has a rechargeable battery in it. Turn the unit on and the background noise is reduced. The unit has on/off for the noise cancelation and a button to start/stop/forward/rewind the music player on a smartphone (iPhone) but there is no volume control.
Not this model. Three feet is about as short as an extension chord gets. You can get plug multipliers that plug directly into the outlet.
The cable that comes with this is detatchable. As long as the cable you plan to replace it with ends in 3.5mm, you can replace it with whatever you like.
The only way to disable it is to have it on the off position.. hope that helps
Yes it will. I would guess it works on all GoPro Heros, but may have a backdoor issue with the 3+.
Yes It fits
You can buy one here: http://www.newremotecontrol.com/magnavox/catalog_item.php?catnum=NF801UD Though just about any universal remote will work.
HSM systemhas virtually silent auto focus function, very quick responsive auto focus function and "full-time" manual focus, wherein AF can be overridden. I use this lens with Nikon D7100 and I am glad with it.
Yes, it does include the two keyboard riders. I don't use them myself.
It will work for this, you simply plug in the DIN connector on the included wireless RX to the back of your head end unit and all is good to go
It fit my 2014 Cruze wiring harness. The problem is finding a spot behind the dash for it to fit.
Yes
There are several companys that offer a warranty on electronics Square is the best and they will do refursibshed
I don't see why not. Amazon sells the protection plan.
I would go to Amazon and buy it through them. As I remember you have 30 days from the time of purchase from other retailers but you have 90 days if you purchased you tablet through Amazon.
Your tablet order is tied to your plan automatically, assuming you purchase both in the same order. That way, SquareTrade can associate this particular warranty plan with the particular tablet you pair it with. Hope this helps.
I assume if they offered during the purchase process, the item is cover regardless.
Starts at time of purchase but covers much more than factory warranty.
No, only the Square Trade coverage. I bought a Google Nexus Wi-Fi 7" tablet for my 7-year old grandson. The Square Trade warranty was offered on the tablet for an additional fee. With three younger siblings in the house, I subscribed to the 3-year warranty after calling Square Trade and spoke to their rep who,confirmed that I understood the warranty correctly.. I don't normally buy extended warranties, but the price was right and the warranty would replaced the tablet no matter what went,wrong with it, or how it was damaged. I have piece of mind.
I only had a one year plan, so your plan might be different. If you read what the plan coverage on their website it states it says that if your item is irreparable, they will contact you to discuss options for replacing your item. It doesn't say anything about replacing it with a better model, but maybe your plan is different from the standard one. You should log onto the Square Trade website to review your plan for that specific item, then contact them with your request for the upgrade replacement instead of the refund. Good luck.
I purchase squaretrade warranties for all my electronic products I putchase. Doesn't matter where you buy it.
Yes just go to their website or purchase through Amazon.
Yes it does. My daughter dropped her tablet and got a crack in the screen and they covered it.
I believe any tablet,Squaretrade could better answer that question
I don't know specifically. Simply the kit screws on the lens if they are 58mm in diameter. You'd check the lens diameter and if it allows accessories (like filters) to be screwed on it.
No, sorry. They are not available in the USA.
Yes it works well for me.
I bought mine last night. The OSD is a bit weak and archaic. We can only hope that future software upgrades improves the look and feel of the OSD interface. Honestly, I believe it is easier to navigate media with the iphone app. I hope someone can upload better quality photos for you :) http://img695.imageshack.us/slideshow/webplayer.php?id=32272981.jpg
Disappointing - first they said "no sorry it won't ship until Friday April 1", then the call center folks can't explain why Saturday delivery isn't an option, and then the email support person cancels orders without first ASKING if I want it cancelled. Yet another aggravating experience with Amazon and their inventory management boobs and offshore call center.
what ive done in the past is take everything apart from alpha to Zulu and had masking tape with different colored markers or crayons per connect or contact that's what helped me and I also had contacted pioneer too in the past and that's what ive done to my vsx-51 bon chance mon ami and do take care bud lucas
Are you asking if my model has icontrol?? Yep
Not that I'm aware of.
Yes, you can make regular DVD or blu-ray disc.
No
Bump. I'm in the same boat, don't care too much about 3D, just picture quality. Is the ST30 significantly better PQ than the S30? And just to confirm, the ST30 comes with the WiFi adapter while the S30 does not, right?
reasearching this myself it seems that the big distinction is wether you use blu-ray or not video games and broadcast are 720p
No it doesn't

It is but mine lasted about a week before it quit working. Good luck.
I would guess so but I haven't tried this. My usage is simple: I rip CDs to MP3 files on my laptop and transfer them to the Philips.
Not sure what you mean by hard copy. If you mean a CD or flash drive copy, you can get that off your computer after you have downloaded the recording from your Sony recorder with the included software. If you mean a transcribed copy of the text of the recording, you have to get software such as Dragon Naturally Speaking to transcribe the digital recording which you download onto your computer, edit the text to make sure it is correct, and then print it out.
yes. I use it to adjust tyhe recording volume as there is no indication otherwise
An old version of the GoGear I had, had a fast FF and fast RW, because I mostly listen to podcasts, too. And this version does not move faster than 1 min per second when fast-forwarding. This is my least favorite thing about this product. Everything else is good.
Yes it is, if your phone does not have a case. With a thick case, I used a Patuoxun Black Exension Dock Extender 30pin Adapter for iPod iPhone 4 4S to give me an extra 20mm in length so I don't have to remove the case. Hope this helps. Kevin..;~)
no it shuts the image off after a few seconds
The one included in my order is a 'table model' with apprx. 1/4 inch (perhaps) machine threads. Hope this helps you. JA
I have had this problem. Very gently wiggling the lens seems to retract the lens, with no observable effect, at least in my case. But do so at your own risk! This camera has become useless to me for a different reason -- dust has collected on the lens inside the camera, with no obvious way to open the camera to clean it. I get very bad blotches on my photos, especially when using the zoom.
Nope... it just has the connector for the 4S and below.
Regular batteries work - I think they're AAA. Only two & they last for a while! From what I know - rechargeable batteries and regular batteries work the same way - it's just that the regular ones are discarded after they loose their charge.
None.
The 500 mm f4 IS II lens has Canon's standard one year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship. The warranty does not cover damage caused by the user.
Yes, it does. The lens includes the hard case, carry straps, lens cap, and also ships with the basic gel filter holder; the lens requires the filter holder be installed for optical reasons, and you can swap it out with (not included) a circular polarizer or a 52mm filter holder insert (all of these filter inserts go in at the back near the camera mount).
320 but I had it and the screen messed up with in a week other than that it was a bad Ass stereo
yeah no, they are enormous. good tweeters if you can find a spot for them, i couldnt. lol
yes it will I had it on two mtx 12s in a ported box and did just fine at the time i was useing the 2ch i had no problems with this amp go to my youtube ch masterblaster735 my nissan sentra is 85% pyramid and it sounds good for what it is these amps are alright for a daily driver I just wish they would make a d class amp by pyramid they use to but not any more good luck with your setup
Never did on me and thats in the denver dry heat all summer dependable amp
Positive on left channel and negative right channel
750
You need a mounting kit and a wire harness just like every other after market radio.
There should be a small hole on the back ov the unit. For some reason the unit has frozen up. Use an unfold paper clip to trigger the manual reset. That's all I can suggest other than return it where you got it for refund!
You CAN'T! It is not recognized as a mobile device. Send itback where you got it for a refund for that reason. Wish people would stop buying this tablet it is SO OUT OF DATE!!!!
It doesn't send it back and buy a better tablet! This one is a cheap piece of crap!
Well, indeed the batteries eject when you change SD card, but I've just checked that the date/time setting nevertheless remain the same. Looks that the settings are independent (at least for a while) of the the presence of the batteries.

No, farmville has a mobile version called farmville express, it does not play at all. Also cannot play videos or movies unless converted. I convert with an app called AVS video converter. It formats for different devices, phones.
The one they sent me recently had 105 key "international" layout - had to send it back
As Larry said, it's not. However, the Logitech K800 keyboard is backlit and is pretty similar. I own the K800 at home and use this K750 (Solar) keyboard at work. Personally I think that the K750 is much more comfortable to type on, but the K800 is still a nice keyboard. If you require a backlit one then perhaps you should look at the K800 instead.
No. It fix iPad 1 perfectly but w/o the sin.
14 gauge would fit, but i wouldn't recommend 12. it was intended for running to small to medium size speakers i think. the internal amp was only meant to power the sub and two surround speakers ( L Sub and R Sub i'm guessing). also, since my receiver only has 1 RCA input for the subwoofer, i needed a Y adaptor. you can use one side, but you'll want both plugged in. it is a great speaker, well worth the price
I dont think it matters. It depends on how powerful you wanted it to sound. I live in an apartment and the sub above is what I have and it rattles the whole complex and thats not in full blast. Its a good purchase on my end. It depends on your sound tolerance. Sometimes the bass is too loud it feels like youre having a heartattack! I kid you not!
Well that depends on your preference. The Sony HT-CT550W provides Dolby TrueHD and dts HD enhanced audio codecs while HT-CT260H gives Dolby Digital Pro Logic II and dts Digital Surround. One good feature for CT550W is that it has 3 HDMI IN and 1 HDMI OUT while CT260H only have 1 HDMI IN and 1 HDMI OUT. -Ely
Run your cable connection through your receiver first then from your receiver to the TV. Then you avoid the TV's sound altogether. you could also run a splitter on your cable connection with one going to the receiver and one to the TV and keep the volume down.
Mine sits in a drawer. The internet browser crashes making it somewhat useless. I should have returned it when I had the chance. It does YouTube very well though, so I kept it. I have a Barnes & noble " novel" I use instead. I'll try the Cruz again when the novel dies. So far though I still use the novel everyday for E-mail and reading news and weather. In fact I used it to type this response.
Yes, you can. Depending on your location, the reception will vary. The website - antennaweb.org/ - can tell you what type of antenna to look for, to work in your area to get certain channels. I have a pair of these http://www.amazon.com/RCA-ANT111-Basic-Indoor-Antenna/dp/B000HKGK8Y/ref=dp_cp_ob_e_title_1 that work well for my purpose, but I do have to move it around every now and then when the signal breaks up.
It can be used with any camera that has a 1/4 x 20 hole on it's bottom plate. However based on personal experiences, I will never use the quick strap for anything again. It is cheaply made and there is a very real probability that your camera will end up on the ground or worse. The original Rapid Strap is a much better product.
This unit has a "SINGLE" cassette player. It is located on the "LEFT" lower side. Kind of of inconvenient, But none the less...IT WORKS GREAT!!!
There is an Auxiliary plug in where you can plug a cord up to listen to an MP3...
The AUX is an isolated line level pass through. The pre-amp is only connected to TT to raise the weak phono cartridge signal to a line level signal. This set-up reduces the number of inputs required on your reciever or power amp since many do not offer a phono input anymore.
Yes
Yes. This is a very sturdy and secure tripod. I love it.
Yes it would perfectly.
This should be what you are looking for... http://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-MH054M0-Q2-Magnesium-Quick-Release/dp/B004MKNJ6G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1393731145&sr=8-1&keywords=MANFROTTO+Q2
It should if there is a screw in the center of the plate.
Unfortunately, it does not come with a bag. The rubber foot cannot be removed, there is no spike.
yes
PLASTIC. but has worked well. WRL
Yes, It will. I bought the product and I don't have a webcam.
ebay
Yes
It comes in a white box item.
From what I have read, yes, it will work on the SL1000.
Probably. You would connect the 'headphones' or 'external speaker' jack on the TV to the 'aux' input on the Panasonic radio. The TV acts the same as an iPod would as a sound source for the Panasonic HC55
Yes, I just bought a new iPhone 5 and it works fine wirelessly. But with the new plug that is on the new phone it will no fit into the iPhone cavity/pop out.
I don't know
its the regular theatrical release, not the extended edition.
Here's a CNET link that discusses some of the differences: http://reviews.cnet.com/flat-panel-tvs/panasonic-tc-p55gt30/4505-6482_7-34468658.html
I just finished traveling for a year with them, we used them every single day and they are just like new.
Yes they come with controller, and it works fine on ipods and iphone 3GS (on the ip 3GS the shuffle button doesn't seem to skip the the next song, for some reason...), it may work on iphone 4, but I'm not sure if they work on the iphone 5. Although they sound very good, than other earbuds...
It seams more of a on the ear kind. My ears are kind of big and they don't fit all the way over. It is a good product. Sounds great. Priced right. Looks good. Endures well. I cant think of anything bad to say about it.
Yes, on ear style. I suggest not buying it. They sound ok but are flimsy. My pair lasted a little over a year and each ear piece broke on the same day! Sorry to say, Panasonic quality just isn't in this product.
It works you get 5000 watt . Mixer dont use that much
There was no sticker on the battery. Using NirSoft's BatteryInfoView program, the serial number shows as "0001 03/27/2014". Guessing that is the manufacture date.
it fit my cq-62. check the part number on your original battery. original part number is 6 digits a dash and 3 digits. got my battery april 2013 and still using it. hope this helps. if its wrong amazon has a great return policy.
ThHobbes is wrong, you can't watch Hulu on this
No. They need wires.
that's a good question. I'm wondering if there is a warranty too. Since no one responded it doesn't seem like it does.
Yes actually it did . Believe it or not but the cord was decent quality too ..even better than some of the other ones I had here at home. Its also very quiet too if you are wondering .
Two.
It will monitor two channels with each channel supporting up to 4 cameras
NO - this has an analog RCA video input only.
This amp is really designed to run midrange and highs, but I have one on a pair of 12s and it does just fine.
No
Yes the sound its very hard. . When a was used Just a cople minutes its tooooo much bump bump
You can just buy two subs. That is perfectly fine for the wattage being brought out.
I think they got the picture wrong because the L3 should not cost no $300, they only run around $150-$200. But if you do get it and it is the L3 and not the L7 then you can just send it back.
Depends on how big the mountain is but most likely yes
Each satellite speaker is connected independently to the bass unit by a single RCA connector.
The wires for the speakers are connected to the base unit via a single mini plug for both speakers. They cords are 5 feet long. Speakers sound good for the price.
There is no fan. It is quiet. Keep some space around the heat sink, as it runs rather warm.
Yes, it does have Amazon instant video app installed into TV. Personally I found the OS on the TV to be to slow to use enjoyably and just bought one of the Amazon sticks which works great.
What is the problem? You can't shut it off?
Yes
No. It's designed to work on PCs running Windows XP (SP3 or greater), Windows Vista, or Windows 7.
I would recommend them for a compact or smaller binocular, 16 oz or under.
Yes, it is compatible. Also, you can check Microsoft's Windows Compatibility Center if you're looking for other models and wondering if they are compatible.
Yes
Is it happening to both wired and wireless connections? Send us your response at BelkinCares@belkin.com, together with your contact details and the link to this post.

yes, was on phone and and changed password with gentleman, now both show up,
Yes, it's included in the package.
I'm not sure I live in Washington, DCA I use the device with Verizon home network. It's so simple to use it should work fine. hopes this helps 1
I have Time Warner also and it works fine.
Hi Evelyn. We suggest that you perform a computer clean up. After that, you may download the setup software here: http://www.belkin.com/us/support-article?articleNum=4736
Yes it does. My sister has the new IPad 4 with Retina (same dimensions as the IPad3) whereas I have the IPad2 & 3, this case fits both. It fits the IPad 2 better since it's little slimmer but it fits the IPad3/IPad4 more snuggly. So if you want to take it out to clean it, it will require a little more effort.
Yes
No
I've used it on two Dell laptops with no connection issues. You might try "ignoring" or otherwise inactivatng other Bluetooth devices so that only the keyboard shows up as a Bluetooth device.
BlueTooth is good for about 30ft but walls and metal will reduce this distance. This may not work well!
I would say no this is a very snug fit for the 13 inch MacBook Pro
It will fit just fine. If you have issues of it slidding around when it's zipped up all you have to do it put it under the center safty band. I've put smaller laptops in it that have slid and they were fine. I trust this case 100% with anything. I even put my iPad and my MBPr in there at the same time.
Never tried, so I don't know
not my tv
Avi Farah, A computer with an HDMI will connect up to 1080p resolution. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Yes, clockwise and anticlockwise each 15 degree.
Now it's back up to $3149. I don't like the fluctuation in prices. It makes me think that if I buy it, I might over pay for the TV.
Few thin horiaontal black lines on the top 1 inch. Samsung did not help as my warranty just expired then.
Yes. That's what WiFi means.
Yes, it does have one HDMI out jack.
Yes
The first unite had defacts and it damaged my new smart TV and the second unite worked but after few months when I got a chance to watch a 3D the 3D is not working right. Samsung is a good brand and I never had any problem with them but this model I would not recomand
VHF and cell phones are pretty different animals. I would be very surprised if they could be connected together.
Seems like an odd question as the description clearly indicates it floats & it is waterproof. ?????
Yes, it is. Sure
It should work. Check on pcpartpicker
Sign in to your Amazon Prime account and find Amazon Instant Video settings. Then paste in this url: http://tinyurl.com/kk5hwfp for a list of compatible tvs. If yours isn't here, I don't think you'll be able to watch Amazon on your TV. I can't get it on mine. Maybe someone else knows something I don't know.
Yes
Sorry I have not tried all share as of this date. I did purchase a usb for wifi and watch all of my videos etc on the tv which is fabulous!
No. It does not have that app as of yet. You will need an internet streaming device like roku, Apple TV, wii etc.
This is an extender that requires its own SSID and password as it is transmitting its own WIFI network.
Sorry, I don't know. You could try calling the company. They were very helpful! If you leave your number they WILL call you back.
Yes
It is really hard to open! On one side of the battery cover there is a little tab and you push it over toward the center and you pull the cover back at the same time! You can push the little tab over with a small straight screwdriver if you can't get to it with your finger!
No it doesn't attach to a TV! It only has 2 ports 1 for the charger and 1 for ear plugs!
I have only charged it once because you have to have it turned off to charge it and I always have it plugged in when I use it! The one time I used it on battery it lasted almost 2 hours!
Nope, it comes with a charger for both home and car!
Nope, it comes with a charger for both home and car!
No, it only accepts cable input. The cable input of mine did not work and I would have returned this if someone had not thrown out the box. The item has a very cheap look and feel it it. I was not impressed and would sugegst another brand or model.
May be the component is aging or some dust inside between outer cover and mini-projection device. Just my guess, haven't use it that often.
this does not have the lightning adapter, it has 30 pin adapter. BUT if you purchase a 30 pin to lightning adapter, it works perfectly. we use it with our iPhone 5s.
The phone line is from the wall but initial set up requires you to plug your computer into the router using an Ethernet cable. After that you don't need to plug computer into it.
I don't think it would...this fits my Macbook 13'' first generation very snug...
No, you have to plug them into the wall socket.
At best it's USB 2. Definitely not USB 3.
I have only used this for charging devices but would assume it should work fine.
it will plug into anything with a headphone jack.
I don't have a wi-fi speaker. Not sure.
No, you can't (i guess you're talking about RAM). I'm not quite sure about the SSD, but i have a 64 GB Micro SDXC Card in the slot, that's the same amountn :-P and it works perfectly.
Sorry I ended up selling it. Good luck
No
The best way to figure out what remote will work with your unit is to look in your owners manual under "optional devices". If you do not have your owners manual you can download a pdf version of it at JVC.com. It is best to use the recommended remote so all the function are available. If you get the wrong remote some or all of the functions may not work.
It is a pair of speakers and with a amp they really sound awesome. I bought 2 pair and run them with a 600 watt amp and they are crystal clear. Good luck.
Probably not. Just replaced 3 year old Pioneer with faulty HMDI connection with Pioneer VSX-523-K....pissed that it required a different model Bluetooth adapter. Should have purchased Yamaha.
did you ever home the handset with the base station? This issue has nothing to do with what's in the wall. The handset and base aren't talking over the wireless. (check the instructions -- you have to push a button on the base station and then put the handset in the seat.)
This phone comes with a rechargable battery pack.(2.4V) and adapter. I keep the phone plugged in at all times and the phone is always charged. I've had this phone close to a year and have yet to change the battery pack.
No you need the lightning to USB Cable
the log m6 screws. I believe it was m6 x 30.
For that purpose you would probably use an HDMI cable or do it wireless.
No, we just put ours on pvc pipe
I think it would be great for that when you're stationary. You'd want to remove it when you were driving though, because I don't think it would stand up to the winds, but it's VERY easy to remove and install.
Yes, the EF-42 is a dedicated flash for the XT-1 according to Fuji literature.
Yes, it is a standard 1/4" thread.
Yes, as long as you have a standard 1/4-20 unc. tripod mount on your camera or long lens.
With all due respect, you should call the company and ask them. I don't know and I didn't look for that type of camera since I don't have that type of camera. Good luck.
I think this case is specifically designed for the 300 HS - call Canon Customer Care and ask - I bought this case before I went to Hawaii. I took fantastic underwater shots and it NEVER leaked. I think the case is terrific. You need to call Canon and ask because the case is set up with same configuration for all the control buttons.
Hi; The picture quality is great. I feel the optical qualities of this camera are superior.
Refer to page 34 and page 69 for self timer instructions. If you have not copied the manual from the CD that comes with the camera, do it now.
No
I had the same problem for a while. it was some sort of "zoom lock". Finaly came on and displayed the warning "Zoom Lock". Eventually had to replace the camera. Sorry if bad news.
Yes, however this is a 4 channel amp.
Yes you can record and watch another station at the same time. Your manual should tell you to select channel 3or 4 on your tv and then set your VCR to record after programming. Then switch your station to whatever you want. If your going throgh a Direct TV box you have to make sure your cables are on the in and out part correctly. I hope this helps.
Yes, it has cable in and cable out to TV. We bought the actual cables at Amazon, but other stores have them. They are under $5.00!
The don't line up they have a button on the keyboard for the power button but it's not on the keyboard te letters are correct but the top row isnt
Not sure if the Asus notebook will fit or not. I have a 10.2 dell tablet and it fits with plenty of space left over.
Yes, it will fit. The Case Logic laptop sleeve is 14.5" x 1.7" x 10.5".
Don't believe the other answers. The ASUS G750 is wider than most 17.3" laptops because of the fact it has two fans in the back (Seriously, why bring up an HP Envy?). I bought this sleeve for my new G750 and found that I could not get it zipped up more than halfway. It might be possible to get it to fit, but the stitching was heavily stained and I didn't want to tear the sleeve by trying to force it. Going to have to return it now because I trusted comments such as these.
It is not real thick. Each side is about 1/4" of foam and there is a zipper that runs along the top. I am not sure I would put it in a book bag. I was just going to use it for protection at home.
your laptop is 15.08" and the inside of the case is.... Internal Dimensions: 14.7" x 2.2" x 11.2" ( L x W x H) So I would think it would be a tight fit or not at all.
Yes
They will not work in the skin of the ship as there's too much interference. They do work outside as they are line of sight walkie talkies.
Good Morning Dolly B: The manual I found says that this camera Fuji 3800 came with a (XD-card). This is the only format [style of card] it will accept. XD cards and SD cards are different. I hope this helps you. God Bless.
If you have an Air model with an SDXC slot (most 13 inchers do), then it is compatible with SDHC cards. I don't think the 11 inch Airs have an SD slot.
If a phone can plug into an RJ11 receptacle, the device will sit on top of the signal and respond. If not, it will not monitor that stream. The regular old phone companies converted to a standard digital signal (POTS), probably sometime in the 80's. VOIP converts the Internet into POTS at the end of the line in
Yes
Sorry, I don't know the answer to that question. Good luck.
this is a bass speaker only and designed to work with full range speakers and a home audio receiver.
You have to use a Sony Blu-ray player or any brand that has a deal with Amazon. Samsung and Amazon seem to NOT play nice together and will likely not come to an agreement anytime soon.
No. I bought some self taping screws at a hardware store.
Turn switch on and use a small pen to push the button beside it on the keyboard
IS6100 DECT 6.0 accessory headset is compatible with DS6671-3. Thanks!
No, you will need to buy HDMI cables separately.
the radio its self without box is 7 1/4 in wide 8 3/4 in long about 2 1/4 in tall
Can't say for sure but it's possible. I had one do that for a few days because the wire was breaking inside and when it did, it obviously quit working.
I think so.
It has an ac jack, but you'd have to buy a power car adapter, separately. This model may skip in a car, though. Not positive, but I don't think it's advertised as a car-ready model with shock protection.
I don't think it's backlit. But I haven't found the need for it. Sound fidelity is amazing for such a little tool. Connects via USB cable.
There is no built-in battery recharging function from USB, and it's likely the unit gets no operational power from USB either. So this answer is pretty surely no. They say to use an alkaline battery, but I found it works fine with an AAA rechargeable battery (even with its lower cell voltage). However, you have to recharge that battery on your own separate charger.
Sorry, I dont know since mine is Huawei E1556 and works perfectly
I can confirm that it is compatible with Nexus 7. Actually I`m writing this comment using the keyboard connected to it.
Yes, 890, UIO and JKL double as the number pad if you have numlock turned on. Just press numlock to turn it off. Once done, reboot into your computers bios and turn off the auto numlock switch. This will stop it from turning that feature on every time you boot. Either that, or you can get used to turning it off via the keyboard every time you reboot. Up to you.
I am only talking about vertical scrolling with the scroll wheel. From my understanding to do side to side scrolling you have to have a track ball type mouse or some kind of multi-touch mouse/track pad. I would not suggest this for someone who wants to replace an Apple magic mouse as this is not a touch or gesture sensitive device. So in short, no. No side scrolling with this mouse that I am aware of. Hope this answers the question.
The mouse is defective. Doesn't work with Mac or Windows. Gear Head knows this. Return
These can be used with any device with the standard 3.5mm audio jack.
Yes, these are fantastic for on-stage use (you may also want to check out the MEElectronics M6 if you want a memory wire (over-ear design).
I'm sorry - I have no idea...
We have dish network and we never have a problem in that area. As far as internet -once the television is turned on, it may take a minute for the wireless internet to connect. We have seen this happen if we try to immediately go to Netflix, but it's not bad. It really doesn't even take a full minute.
My wife has an iPod 5 and we use a 30 pin to lightning adaptor on the cradle (which you can get here for $25). It's just like using an older pre-lightening iDevice. No issues whatsoever....
I've had my Sharp Aquos 60" LCD for 28 months now and there hasn't been a single issue with it. The colors are still vibrant as the first day!
It measures the total for the strip.
Five feet, eight inches. Give or take kinks in the cord.
Max input voltage is 108v AC to 132v AC
No timer
Yes
I am not sure. But I bought Canon VIXIA HF G10 Camcorder Battery Charger (110/220v with Car & EU adapters) - Replacement Charger for these models - Canon BP-808, BP-809, BP-819, BP-827. That's working out well for me.
Roughly 240 watts. Because 12V *20A= 240 watts
Yes, best to use a DC/DC dimmer after the power supply. Such as https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IYXGEEQ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.
W 4-3/8 x L 8.00 x H 1-7/8 inches
I really wish I could answer that, but I thrashed it right after the review.
Yes, Netflix has a search function of their streaming library on the 42LV5500.
Hello the only time I get a black screen is when I'm in a non HD channel. I tried to duplicate your problem, couldn't . I suggest you call LG support # is in your manuel
These recordings are stored in Intelligent Recording's propietary "xtr" format. You will not be able to listen to these calls on your PC without first installing the XtR Desktop software supplied.
Hello the only time I get a black screen is when I'm in a non HD channel. I tried to duplicate your problem, couldn't . I suggest you call LG support # is in your manuel
Yes, barely...but there is no room to carry any extra lenses
email the seller the model of your mini ntebook,ask seller its compatible.
this item includes transducer, mount, hardware. the cable is built into the transducer and runs about 20 ft. with a black plug end and a separate power cable.
I'm not 100% on this one. I believe that it will because going to the Lowrance site and clicking on accessories shows part number: 000-10260-001 http://www.lowrance.com/en-US/Products/Fishfinder-Chartplotter/Elite5-en-us.aspx
Yes but I have only recorded cd to cd.
Yes it will.
Negative
Yes...any lens 9mm or higher will be great fir terrestial viewing as long as you have an erecting lens...good luck
Only if you're a level 6 wizard. Otherwise the remote has to be in line of sight.
Hi Jean, you can go to the following page from Logitech and confirm if your devices are compatible. http://www.logitech.com/en-us/universal-remotes# On the bottom right of the page you will see "Check compatibility". Click on that. Please keep in mind, anything electronic has to be maintained by humans at some point. These remotes work very well, but need to be updated with new software every once-in-a-while.
No. I can't get it to anyway.
I got it to work on an LED TV that was about 3 years old. I have since sold the upgraded because the TV updated the software and I didn't need it any longer.
No.
It is VESA standard 600x400 (M8 bolt)
Amazon has a LOW PRICE GUARANTEE on this item 47LW6500. So if things are cheaper on black Friday or within 2 weeks of the purchase, Amazon will refund the difference to your account.
3D content has nothing to do with active shutter or passive technology. That is just how the TV handles the 3D content. So go ahead get some 3D material and enjoy!
Yes
Found the box! 2.4 GHz Digital.
about 9 inches length, 7 inches breadth and 2" tall
Yes it does. I bought that also on Amazon for $10.
If you have cable you shouldn't need this box. This is for a regular antenna to convert digital signal back to analog on the older tv so you can view
No, you need to buy the cord separately
It sure looks like the device I use but you have to have the proper UBS cable to go with it. You should seek better advice than I can give. Good luck
YES!
Yes, it's a little over 5 and a half feet.
yes, it can start the auto scroll depending on what you configure. There are is a button behind the wheel also. I like it for the size and shape as my hand is fairly large. It will take a beating too, as I have dropped it several time already. Hope this helps you.
I play games on my xoom, probably about 6 hrs straight. Ive also used once or twice a day and it stays charged about 4 days. But i cant say weeks.
yes we do
My laptop is 13" from left to right and it fits in the center laptop pocket just fine. There is space on both sides of the laptop pocket for paperwork and you could fit a small binder maybe a 1" binder but not much bigger. I really like the bag, it is lightweight yet sturdy and perfect if you don't have to carry an excess of paperwork in it. Hope this helped.
I have a 15-inch Mac Book Pro and it fits really tight in the pocket. I don't think you'd be able to squeeze in .6 more inches.
No, you would need to buy an adaptor
The version I got after buying is 3.8. Dunno why the picture is different. Maybe the seller ran out of 3.8 cause I believe I got one of the last ones.
Any legitimate PS1 game can be used to Swap for PS1 games.. Just look up a tutorial on YouTube. The PS1's security is much weaker.
I just got mine today and they are .63 (3/12/2012) So for anyone reading or wants to know, Amazon still ship out .63 as of the date mentioned.
Ths player uses an AC 110V/220V power adapter that would support the wall outlet.
Depends on what you want to do with the radio. If you want to listen to hams, you need SSB capability to listen to virtually all voice communications and CW. SSB is also good for more narrow band listening to shortwave stations - using SSB is about same as synchronous detection with this radio, from my experience. It's sort of a generalization, but SSB capability typically involves more selectivity and sensitivity that may be lacking on a less expensive shortwave. Overall, this is a decent little radio for the money - lots of fun.
Yes
You can compare dimensions between the Panansonic FZ200 and the Nikon D200. I wouldn't recommend this camera sleeve for a camera any larger than the FZ200. DuraNeoprene makes a larger size, it's made in the US and so far it has stood well protecting the camera. And for anyone out there, it is not waterproof, and never was meant to be. I use it to protect the camera from other objects while hiking with it on the shoulder, or in a day pack.
Cybershot Rx100ii Product Dimensions: 4 x 1.5 x 2.3 inches ; 9 ounces I use it for: Cybershot DSC-HX30v Product Dimensions: 1.4 x 4.2 x 2.5 inches; 9 ounces I think there's enough room to fit.
Mine died after 2 months of use
Yes.
No it doesnt sherl but you might be able to put them on, also it would be beneficial to youvto by a brand new one.
Yes, off course they work on ipad. I use these for iphone5, samsung S3 & ipad aswell.
It does a pretty good job of reducing the sound, but does not completely cancel it out.
Charges my iPhone 5. It will.
John, We have this cam in our one year olds room. Cam about 10 ft from her bed, I can zoom in pretty close. With that said, the closer you get the more distorted the video becomes. I would not recommended the cam for surveillance, you would not be able to identify anyone. Hope this helps.
You can plug whatever you want into it and it works fine, but not quite as good as if you route through a receiver first. All depends on your application. In my case - I run the sound to it from my TV and it works great.
Each would have to be connected with network cabling to an adapter that's plugged into an electrical outlet. And a network cable would need to be run from your router to another adapter plugged into another electrical outlet in your house.
Yes, I have a 4 port in the living room area and a second 4 port in the master bedroom. Works just fine.
The same thing happens to me. Make sure you have updated the firmware once connected to the internet. It still hangs up from time to time after I did this, but much less often. Now it just requires a reboot of the system.
We have the same issue. We turn off the player and re-power. After the re-power Netflix will load the movie. We also found the movie needs to be in the instant queue to play. Good luck
Apparently there are two similar screens, the one I had didn't work because it was a HD screen and the laptop was not HD. I am not sure how to determine which is which, but I could not find a screen for the laptop that I was working on. Best to call the supplier to be sure you get the right one if it is available.
Yes.
can't tell you about the model number compatibility, but it does exted past the original profile of the laptop.
looks that is one of the phones melhres i've ever had, have a philips she8000, but not for comparing to that. my note from 0 to 10 is 9! phones that very good!!
No it does not have a mic. They are only earbuds.
On the package, it says the frequency response: 20 and impedance: 16 Ohm
kids or adults
Andy, I use this with my iPad 2 and it works like a champ. It is a very solid piece of hardware and I couldn't be happier.
The end of the antenna is 3/8 fine thread
It depends if it is the same thread pattern but u will get a better skip if run it on the side or on te mirror and have it tuned to ur radio
Yes it does
Solid purple represents that it is connected to wifi with the power on. Make sure the volume on the source media is up/unmuted. You may have to search around for a way to turn on airplay. I have not/do not/will not use an aux cable with this system because it bypasses the DAC in the unit itself. to take full advantage of this unit youll want to use the actual 30 pin/lightning connector or use via wifi.
yes. All pieces attach nicely
Hi - My camera is an SX40 HS and i was rather disappointed with the products, since it does not attach very well to the camera - i was kind of busy and unable to do a proper review, but my recommendation is to check if it will attache to your model - for the SX40, i did not...
No you do not need an adapter&gt;
NO!
I believe so. We bought it because I accidentally bought whole set DVD from Australia. Lol. It played fine.
yes it works with ps3 and ps4 consoles
Yes it will. It's very strong enought any kind of laptop
Thank you for asking and these speakers sound amazing and are also a standard 6.5inch speaker I am not 100percent sure about if will the depth work or not but the diameter will
This case fits however it covers some of the ports in the sides
Yes
This light is invisible! You cannot tell if the power is on or off by looking at it in the dark. You will need a IR camera to tel if it is actually functioning.
No, it comes with an AC adapter which need to be plugged in an available wall socket.
Works on my A57 that has minolta type hotshoe. If A390 has this type shoe mount it should work but is manual only. No TTL or HSS.
You aren't supposed to have flash turned on in camera, leave it off, test the light by pressing it manually. Typically doesn't work on full auto.
It will come with the earbuds, the detachable kevlar cord, a padded case, multiple sized ear tips (though they are extremely form fit and compress well, I've never changed mine) and a booklet with some info on the earbuds. I believe that's everything, at the very least a simple answer is that they come with everything you asked about.
I put an I5 processor on the board I bought because it is LGA 1155. I7 processors are LGA 1366, 1156, 1155 and 2011. The Core I7-2600 is shown on Wikipedia to be LGA 1155 so it might work. My I5 processor also operates at 3.4GHz.
Supervisor or Setup password might work if you have any. Also, could try removing the battery or short the CMOS clear jumper. Good luck.
I doubt it. That was my original intent and I ended up just building a whole new system from scratch. Couldn't be happier, best system I've ever owned.
Yes, but... Apple lists all of the 2009 MacBook Pros as using PC3 8500 RAM. This particular module is PC3 10600. For more capatibility info, see apple or get mactracker.
Pairs.
Specifications: * Power handling: 15 watts RMS/30 watts peak * Impedance: 4 ohms * Frequency response: 80-20,000 Hz * SPL: 88 dB * Overall diameter: 3-1/2" * Cutout: 3-1/16" * Mounting depth: 1-3/4".
I believe it fits all teh 100 Hp Printers. Hope this helps.
I am not sure, but when I look the USB-B-Male end it looks a little bigger on the "USB Printer Cable for HP PhotoSmart 3210 with Life Time Warranty" then on the one for the HP 1000 series. The one I copied and pasted should work for yours.
No
Its big enough to cover the opening of a 50mm f1.8 lens. Havent measured the disks. This is a nice set but the plastic is really hard to cut for new shapes in the blank ones even with Xacto tools. To make your own, i would recomend thick black construction paper. Its inexpensive and easy to use.
all it does is couple two cables. no more no less. not a converter or upscaler
I dont see why not. Just remember its an adapter for HDMI to HDMI Mini.
Yes
These headphones are paired with the remote base and you connect the base to a video source via a 1/8" TRS cable or a RCA cable or a optic fiber cable. This is not a bluetooth device that you can pair with another bluetooth device!
No. It works regardless. If you really want to great sounding headphones, check out Sennheiser RS 170 Digital Wireless Headphone with Dynamic Bass and Surround Sound. I have both of these headphones and the Sennheisers are fantastic.
I don't know, I have a vizio tv that transmitt's to my headset, seems to work OK. ... but, I have since bought a sony headset that works better for me. I paid $70.00 for the sony. It is more comfortable to wear, and has better audio from TV . It does require a cord to link to the TV then wirless to the headset ....I hope that helps ......Bill Bramble, Caldwell, Idaho
Yes
Program the keys individually from the original remote control for that device. That's one of the best features of this remote--it can control nearly any device, even if you can't match it to a code. I control two smart Blu-Rays, 2 HDTV's, VCR, and a sound system on one, and have more options available.
Probably if you have the original remote. The remote is programmable so it can be programed to duplicate the original remote commands.
Hi Really depends on the age of your machine. This version is for system builders, meaning you'd have to wipe windows xp and install win7 fresh. This won't upgrade an existing windows installation. If your machine is older than 4 years, I'd suggest a new machine. The install took 15gb of my hard disk
You must do an clean install. Vista Ultimate was upgradeable to Win 7 Ultimate. Truth is you maybe able to do an "Upgrade" but your License Key is not likely to work even on an upgrade. Your best bet is to backup, verify you have your drivers and your applications at hand, then delete the partitions. Reloading to clean partitions is your best chance of success.
You need 2 separate keys, so will need 2 copies. I had the same challenge, but since this is oem it is only 1 license for 1 pc.
Yes, Yes, Don't know about flash player but if adobe I assume yes
Yes, this is the standard part for all 2009-2012 MacBook Pro 13" models. Verification: http://tinyurl.com/bb7tdny
Yes, everything come in a package. This is a good deal.
A marketing term. All Hdmi cables work excellent.
go to www.service.asus.com. put in G73sw as the model number. then download the driver named "ATKACPI driver and hotkey-related utilities" which is under the utilities section. I would send you a direct link but it is not directly linkable.
ships in 1 to 2 months , nope got it from amazon in 1 week ordered march 31 recieved it april 5th ,thanks AMAZON
I have used various distances but usually about 1/2 to 1 inch
On the same day I and a friend ordered. I received 1.3 and he received 2. There was not a significant difference in the image quality.
They are made in China.
It's a matter of seconds. The key to recycle time will be your battery choice. I use high energy battery designed for electronic flashes. This is a great electronic flash.
With the Panasonic, it relies on the focus assist in the camera body. No assist from the flash unit. In the manual, all it says is that some cameras only support the AF illuminator in the camera body. It doesn't mention "which" cameras or models.
Works fine with the FZ200 - should also work with the FZ70.
No
Yes. The flash works perfectly with e-TTL on my Sony A6000.
Nop. Works fine out of the box
Wish I could answer but I only use it on the camera and don't have another flash.
It works with us coax
Not very good
It has a microphone input and a earphone input at the top.
4 ohms: 150 watts x 1 chan. 2 ohms: 300 watts x 1 chan.
this will work if the sub can handle the power at 4 ohms: 150 watts x 1 chan. 2 ohms: 300 watts x 1 chan.
no you need other bigger
It's black. Not shiny and not really flat. Top is black too, not like in the picture. It's really solid and heavy material. Don't know if it's wood or something else. It looks really nice.
Yes, as long as it is 11".
It does on my Canon EOS 5D Mark III. I see no reason it would not on other models.
I think it only has a one year warranty, as is standard for this type of product. However, you can purchase an extended warranty of 3 years like I did. Also is a very good product for this price considering all accessories including ...
Excellent scope, does not take pic's on a mac unless you have lion installed. The better one with adjustable lite is better on windows system.
There's only one in this pack. I think they do sell them in packs of two though.
Yes, all of the UClear helmet communicators allow you to skip forward, skip back and replay tracks. It has large buttons that facilitate easy one hand operation even when wearing gloves.
Yes and no. Here's why: Yes if you are storing your FC project on the drive for long term storage or archive. In this way, you'll used the Macbook's internal drive for editing and the external drive for archiving. No if you are directly editing video files on the external drive. In all cases, the resolution of your video files will dramatically effect how your machine/drive responds.
As long as your machine has a Firewire 800 port you should be okay. What matters is the hardware you are using and not the operating system. You can just drag and drop files to the WD, but I use Carbon Copy Cloner and Super Duper to automate my backups.
Anybody?....we have tried everything. There is supposed to be an option for av out in the quality video settings. However the options in quality are the same as in panel quality. Very dissapointed right now. How do I get them both to play video as well as hearing the movie?
Yes, but the Z906 speakers use 1/2" 20 thread screws, not 6mm. You'll need to buy your own screws since the ones that come with these mounts are too small for Z906 speakers. Also, the screws you buy will be very snug in the holes in these mounts. You can either force them through (like I did) or drill the hole slightly larger. Also, beware that mine (and a lot of other people's) only came with four mounts, not five. So If you're planning on mounting all five speakers, you'll need another mount.
Not sure about the wiring for an e34 but I think you should be OK. Getting the stock radio out will be the biggest challenge as you'll need the special five-sided BMW allen wrench.
park slope llc has one like that under the USED LIKE NEW
If I understand your question correctly - The ferrite bar is surrounded by wire that increases the conductance of the antenna, which increases efficiency (gain). The effect is that the antenna has better sensitivity to weaker signals. Hope this helps.
Thanks for asking ! No, this radio doe snot pick NOAA, but Kaito made many NOAA radios, search for KA210 which is a great NOAA radio ! Kaito Customer Care Team
It is original and it comes in the original white box just like you get in the store. It isn't sold directly by Apple but it is the Apple brand and NOT a cheap knockoff.
To be honest mine never died playing airsoft, in other words it last a really long time, long enough that mine has never fully died before I charged it.
It is I think. The leather is very soft, and smell like real leather.
The program operates with 64 bit, yes. But it won't copy protected DVD's...which is pretty much every DVD. Buy a better product than this junk.
i want to say yes/ have not tried it but i believe the program is capable...hope it helps you go for it!!
There are no screw holes on the back to indicate it is VESA compatible. If there is another way to mount it, I have no idea what it is. Fortunately, I don't need it mounted.
I don't know, but they simply have a standard type plug in that works with my iPhone and my mini-iPad--and probably works with any standard earphone receptor on most types of equipment.
Let me say this, do not even think to purchase a Coby Kyros Tablet, it is the worst brand in the technology. I bought three Coby Kyros and they crash within three weeks so if you do you will regret it!
No, there is a small zipper pocket on the inside, two zipper pouches on the front side under the flap, which are fairly roomy themselves, two button pouches on each side, which can fit a regular size water bottle and a pouch on the back side, which is big enough for a small notebook or thin laptop. I can put up to three text books (2 inches thick) in the main compartment and have room to spare.
Yes
Yes it should be but make sure you check the CPU chip set because it may require a different processor and heat sink fan
I would avoid this MB. It has serious video chip failures. If you are intent on replacing the AMD cpu, I have one.
You can run 5.1 on it and either upgrade to 7.1 later or hook speakers up to Zone 2 and use them elsewhere.
Yes it will. That's what I'm using it on :)
Yes, it will work. It will work to any devise that has an 1/8 stereo jack like your ipod, iphone, tablet, cell phone, laptop, etc. The same place where you normally plug in your headset/earphone, etc. And by plugging this device into it, you'll have more volume when listening with your headset/earphone, etc.
The FILO comes with a y adapter and will work fine on both headphones.
I have a samsung tablet and a pair of beyerdynamic dt770s which run at 250ohms. The amp is needed to drive them and it more than does the job. Totally different with them at such a cheap price. Actual sound is comparable to systems costing 5 to 10 times as much.
Probably. These keyboards work in all of the T410s & T420s that I have worked on. But I've never seen a 2516-DCU.
Sony has a real issue with their panels failing after only a couple years. Great TVs until they fail. Ive decided to look elsewhere for my next set.
The swivel stand is made of 2 parts: base + stem. The stem is inserted and drop-aligns with the hole in the base and one (1) screw is tightened from the bottom of the base. This will secure the stem to the base. Now you must also attach the adapter behind the TV and secure it. Lift the TV and drop-align into the stem. You need only secure the assembly via the Hex-screw and Allen-key provided.
This is a router... not an Access Point. Google a bit.
Yes
9, if i remember, but take a look to this page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewire

The computer comes with a pair of 3D glasses. You have to set up the 3D viewer on the computer. A wizard will guide you through the set up. The built in disc drive is Blu-Ray and will play and burn Blu-Ray discs.
I have a Galaxy 3 tab and my Snugg fits perfectly. It is designed with side openings for volume and power buttons and has an opening in the back for the camera. It is leather with a velvet interior, which I think is wonderful. It slides in with ease and the corners are protected by corner flaps. It is no bigger than my home address book, which makes it easy to handle and is very light-weight. As far as refund, all I can say is to keep your receipt.
yes! It just needs to be 'charged' first via the usb.
Yes
Yes it does. On the front panel next to the USB input there's an opening and above it it says: 3 IN 1 CARD. On the box it shows an illustration of an SD card and next to it it says Card READER. I tried it on mine and it shows a great photo on the TV as taken by my digicam.
There is a code in the box that you register with the serial number of the Mac on the apple website. It's very self explanatory once you get it
Yes this will work for refurb iMac purchased from Apple Store if it is under warranty.
Yes. That's exactly what I did. I'm from the Philippines too
If you're asking about the fit, yes. These soft boxes use standard bulb sockets. I'm currently using omni-directional LED bulbs in mine just for lower power consumption. The only concern that I could envision with a higher wattage bulb is the additional heat, though by design, the materials used for soft box reflectors are fire retardant.
You are correct. The height is controlled by the light stand. The softbox is mounted on a ring. The ring attaches to an adjustable swivel. The adjustable swivel arm is mounted on hot shoe. The hot shoe is attached to the light stand. You can control the up and down direction of your light with the swivel arm, and the height with the light stand adjustments.
I would assume so. They are very bright. I use them to photograph pets.
Yes it does. Apple has only a few SKUs for AppleCare, and this one covers everything 15inches and above.
Yeah, I would like to know that as well. Guess will have to wait until the new iPad comes out.
It is possible that the module that came with this unit is not compatible. I had to purchase a different bluetooth module for streaming audio. The Alpine tech assist were helpful.
Yes and I didn't know that it come with small tripod, and an additional mounting plate.
Tripod in travel bag will fit into a 19-1/2" long space. Width while laying on two of the three legs is about 5". A few small items could fit along top side in spaces left each side of third leg.
The manual reads that the memory card is sold separately. I got mine with the camera bundle. It is a San Disk Ultra, 30 MB/s, SDHC, 32 GB. I haven't had any problems with it. I hope this helps. Anna H
The height of the tripod without the extension and without the ballhead is 44.5 inches tall. With the extension, but without the ballhead, the height is 53.5 inches tall.
yes, you can rotate 360 deg panorama with this tripod. there is a water level indicator as well to ensure you keep a steady position of the camera
The OS for this unit is Windows. The unit I received had Windows 7.
I'm not sure. I haven't used that tablet at all in over 2 years. I actually gave it to my nephew. Sorry, I don't remember.

This particular shield is for the iPad 4 with Retina display; the company's website does list one available for the mini (http://www.armorsuit.com/tablets-screen-protector-full-body-skin-protector/apple/apple-ipad-mini.html); I think that Amazon does have the mini one available: Here is the link for it: http://www.amazon.com/ArmorSuit-MilitaryShield-Protector-Lifetime-Replacements/dp/B009OS4WBC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1356993084&sr=8-1&keywords=armorsuit+ipad+mini -- I think you'll be happy with it!!!
The solution used in the initial application of the protector can be used to clean it after removal with the same microfiber cloth provided with the kit. Keep them both after installation.
Wow, so many clueless answers here. Why post if you do not know!!!??? But to answer correctly, there are 3 for stereo, no mic. 3 = left/right/common for audio stereo. a 4th would be for the mic but thios is not a phone type earbud, just music/audio.
Mine did not.
It probably will but the earphones makes cracking noise regardless so i would advice not to get it for a old ipod, the wires are very weak and thin of the earphone.
It has a white RCA connection that plugs into the audio in port on the DVR. We mounted ours next to onevof the cameras and just pluged the power connection in line with the cameras. You will need a RCA cable to run from the mic to the DVR because it does not come with one.
it could use a wind sock
It is just Bluetooth audio. No video. Should work no problems with any Bluetooth phone.
If you are able to plug this into your until it should, however I doubt you have the necessary wires exposed from your unit to hook this system to it.
Only basic controls: forward, reverse, play, pause, & fast forward/reverse. It does not transmit any tag data to the receiver.
The 775 socket supports a wide variety of CPUs, but it's the chip set which determines DDR2 vs DDR3. There is no physical difference between DDR2 and DDR3 RAM cards.
Not very much Crop. If it shifts it cuts off a small part of the top or bottom: But I tell you what, it's a small price to pay with how awesome it is for Video shoots. Focusing is a dream.
You might need to look for a LCDVF that is suitable for Nikon D5300. This is made for several Canon models.
No it doesnt. Its all rubber
Yes I have that as well. It seems to be fine, after some searching CM mentioned that it was just a mixup.
Yes it can. It has a normal 3.5 mm jack which allows it to be used with most standard audio devices
Very comfortable. Good padding on ear muffs and on strap over head.
Hi, this Sony Headphone System uses the standard stereo mini plug (3.5 mm headphone jack). If your kindle device supports 3.5 mm jack, then it will work.-Ely
Definitely will!
Yes. All smart card readers can write smart cards *if* the card allows it. The term "reader" is a misnomer. The reader allows your computer to talk to the processor within the smart card. The smart card's processor then decides whether or not to allow the computer to read, write, run code, etc. For a basic explanation of how smart cards work, see: http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question332.htm
5.5 inches depth............... to raise lid completely vertical - 7 inches.
No DVD. Just connect the speakers to your receiver and you will be ready to go.
I would say yes. My husband uses his there
No. The Cobra 9370 and the similar 9470 must be plugged into the 12 volt power port or lighter socket of your vehicle. EXCELLANT detector by the way.
What are the features of the detecter n question .
Exact dimensions are as follows: 7.25"wide (across the face plate) 8.5" deep&#127904; (face plate to back of radio) 2.125" high
Comes with it.
Dont know but i wouldnt buy this one even if i can wire it
Nope.
I'm not really understanding the question. Do you mean you have to keep turning it off and on throughout the day? What do you mean 'what happens on the full day'. Please advise so we can more appropriately respond
the only difference is the XRS9370 has tone alerts .... the XRS9470 has tone AND voice alerts. The range for any of the XRS series is 1 1/4 miles. Heck ... I'm thinking of upgrading myself!
It does a very good job with distance when your traveling on highways, at times when my detector went off I saw nothing in the area but I slowed anyway and sure enough there was a patrol car just ahead. I'm guessing that the distance would vary with the amount of "gain" the police have there radar set at. I have had mine for over a year and it works great!!! You wont be disappointed
No. The Cobra 9370 and the similar 9470 must be plugged into the 12 volt power port or lighter socket of your vehicle. EXCELLANT detector by the way.
I think they're pretty good at noise isolation. If I'm playing music at normal volume through my phone speaker and put the headphones on without plugging them in, I can't really hear the music at all. I do this every morning when I'm leaving for work, and I'm always surprised that it works so well.
My husband wanted these to use on plane trips. When he uses them, he can hear clearly over the engine noises and I can't hear the book he is listening to.
They are not wireless, but they do sound surprisingly good.
Yes it does. It takes about two and a half hours for a full charge that lasts for about 2 rounds of golf.
I wouldn't recommend the World. It picked up courses pretty well, but the screen locked up after 11/2 years. For $250, I expected more. I recommend the Bushnell X watch
The battery can be easily accessed from the back. No screws to deal with, just push down the plastic retainer clip and a back panel will open and the battery is fully accessible and easily changed.
My First One Lasted Nearly 3 Years.
No, it does not, and since most surge protectors are very temporary, if you use one it should be a separate unit. Most units of this sort do not use them. I do not.
They do fit iPad 2 that is what I bough them for
I put it on my MacBook, I think it's like 2008 model and it worked fine. think all lap tops use the same size HD, but only way is to find out what yours came with when you bought it. You can also Look in the MacBook's information found in the apple menu under about this Mac then click more info then click get detailed report and look in the hardware section for what the SATA spot says
No. The 430 series flashes do not have an external battery connector. There is no batter pack available for them.
mine didn,t work at all. IT over heated had ot take batters out to get it to shout down .
No. I own this tv. It does not have a Prime app in the marketplace.

I never used them in that application, but I would know why they wouldn't.
no offense but there are better companies to buy off of than this one. I believe it was a bootlegged copy from china. only half of it worked. for an extra 10.00 I would buy it local. less hassle to return
The opening is exactly 6"
I used it with Alien Bee's 800 and it worked just fine.!
Yes. I have the Viper 5704v alarm system and the remote fits snuggly in this case.
Yes, the doubling magnification lens is included.
Dear Denton, Thanks for your kind inquiry! Yes, we are able to do that. Best Wishes, Sunny, FIVEstar Accessory
Yes, but it's sold separately, which is nuts considering the price. It's a good unit though!
It had a 3.5mm jack. You can always buy an XLR adaptor if you need to though.
Dear Customer, Thank you for your question in regards to our HDMI to DVI adapter and Apple TV. As long as your TV has a DVI connection, and from our research the Apple is HDMI out, the connection should work. To confirm this we would need the make and model of your TV. If you would like confirmation , please email us at Service@bluerigger.com with the make and model of your TV. Thanks! BlueRigger Product Support Service@Bluerigger.com
Dimensions are 9.21"X10.43"X2.25"
no heating issues have had it hook up since jan
The manual doesn't say... it just says MAX power at 300 watts/channel at 2 ohms, and RMS power is 125 watts/channel at 4 ohms. The manual is available on Boss Audio's support site. I will say we had 2 subs rated at 600 watts at 2 ohms, one connected to each channel of this amp, and the voice coils separated out after 2 months of use... Not sure if this is was an amp or speaker failure, but I am not going to replace them 2 ohm subs.
You will love this one......it hits really hard an the boss sign lights up blue nice.
No no handsfree blutooth
Yes, the 637UA is a CD player.
No I would't think so, It big and bulky and is only held down with velcro straps. and when I say it's big it's big
No it's a terrible amp.
Yes. Plus when the deck detects power from the camera it automatically switches to the display.,.unfortunately any audio u may be listening to is temporarily muted while in reverse!
Yes
Hello. The RMS power at 8 ohms is 25 watts, and its peak power would be 33 watts per channel. You will need to wire a speaker at 2 ohms per channel to take advantage of the full output power of this amplifier.
I know this does use RCA input. That's how I have mine wired up.
Hi Mate, I didn't understand correctly your question, but I'll answer about the quantity....Its sold one piece and I bought two including one with DVD. I answered your question?
Apps are available to convert Itunes files to MP3 or 4 files. Once you have done this you can put them on SD or USB drive. I use Synctunes.
Can't think of any reason it couldn't. Standard size.
Hi there... I bought the boss indash stereo, for my Hyundai elantra 2002, it does not fit well (maybe the intallation as it was in the upper compartment; however in looks fine, sorry I cannt tell about your Douge, I can add that whenever the screen is open, it covers the AC vents blocking the flow of it. The device works perfectly and its features, i love it, teh intallation is a bit complicated but with an expert surely can be just Fine. Please le me know if you need anything else.
hi Dude, in my case i never received the radio by the seller.
is it compatible with a 1998 BMW 318ti?
Sure it will
this is an awesome amp for the priceI would highly recommend this and yes
Individually yes, but all on the same system it won't have enough juice. I would suggest running the 6x9's and the 4x6's off this and then doing something else for the sub
No this cable will not concert from vga to hdmi. You need a converter box to do that. I made the mistake of buying it for the exact same computer and reason which was a waste of money. Do not buy this cable to convert from vga to hdmi. It won't do it.
That's what I bought it for, and was incredible disappointed. No it won't. It will connect them both, but it doesn't send any signal though. For that you need a converter box.
If you are referring to a lens with a 77mm filter ring, then yes, you will need a step-down kit to get down to to 52mm. I haven't used one so I don't know if that changes anything as far as image view or corner fringing.
DIRECTLY NO , YOU NEED STEP-UP RING TO MAKE IT WORK
I suppose you could, but as the front element is really convex, i wouldn't. You are likely to scratch the glass.
It's suppose to twist lock into position nice and snug.
I had an EPL2, the II kit lens and the wide angle lens, which twisted on for the right fit. My suggestion is to buy the II because the wide angle is that good, inexpensive and sure is useful. What to do the I lens? either keep it, give it away or sell it.
Works great with Windows 7. Not sure about 8. Great buy. We are pleased with this purchase. No issues.
Not really. I don't think it was designed to collapse but, it could be folded down a little.
It has bank of blue lights above the number pad that indicate number lock and caps lock. Don't know if they are LED but there is a lighted indicator to let you know.
no - USB only
Yes, it will. My wife and I got this TV for our Wedding in May. 6 months later, all we've used this for is the Roku 2 XS. It's attached with an HDMI cable and works great (in 1080p, despite the TV advertising 720p only).
Yes
I'm sorry but I don't know. It was a gift to my daughter and she no longer has it
Not entirely sure as it has to be physically connected to a computer via USB cable in order to aim and fire it. I have not tried connecting it to a tablet as of yet.
They are proprietary, but refills can be purchased on Amazon as well: http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Cheeky-iLaunch-Missiles-371/dp/B00DN6PRYM/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1395540627&sr=1-6
17 inches when not stretched.
Yes, it does. It might be different for some other phone cases, but my case (Melt for iPhone 4/4s) didn't interfere with the fit of the cord at all.
I'm using the Caliber CaseMate for my Galaxy S5 and the plastic is too big, blocking the plug from being fully inserted. I'd recommend browsing for a cable in a physical store where you can compare the width before you buy, like I now have to do.
This needs to be mounted and because it needs to be mounted your standard 6ft cable is not going to do it. So make your own or buy a longer cable
To find out just go to Dells website and look for Widi capability. Or ANY if the i7 processor chips will have it... So get a laptop with i7
I am sure you can do it. Your tv will act like a big screen for your computer.
If the Mac has a WiDi capability built in then it may. I would look for an Apple product to meet your needs. I would not use this Netgear product.
Only if the tablet has an INTEL widi graphics chip
It does come with the Keyboard Dock in the US
radio shack has almost any adaptor you can think of
Sorry, still in the box waiting for an emergency. However, I did crank it up and it worked well. Good luck on your search.
A Technician class amateur radio operator (HAM) license is required to legally operate this radio. You can check out www.arrl.org for information on where and how to obtain a ham radio license.
The antenna connector on the FT-8800R is an SO-239 (also known as "UHF-type female"). You would use a PL-259 ("UHF-type male") on your coax to connect to it.
It worked perfectly in London and other parts of England. Northern Ireland wiring is the same as England so it definitely will work.
I don't recall but info want you to know that my 72rx35u died randomly about six months ago. In retrospect I'd just spend more money for something that will last.
Don't see why not?
yes. it will work with any ipod that has the older (larger) charging dock. but if your dock is older/worn/loose AT ALL, you will likely experience intermittent connection losses if the adapter is moved even slightly.
NZ501 is a single DIN.
yes, microphone works great, no issue. small echo as we are in a Tahoe- but not bad at all.
fits any double din application.works great,make sure you inspect the condition when you receive it,mine was cracked out of the box.now stuck with it
Yes it will it goes on the top but its bigger than it looks in the pictures.
depends on your strap, but if it connects via the tripod screw hole, then yes you can still attach it through the Spider
Yes, I use it for my 100-400 you're fine with your lens and I highly recommend it.
I am not sure what you mean by mount, it fits any standard light stand and uses a standard flash connector used by all cameras. I hope this helps
I haven't tried so I don't know
I only see an one HDMI port and that is an HDMI output. I don't believe it can be used for input purposes but have not tried to use it that way.
Yes for sure because I'm using playing on this mod all the time. I have not player here with me to explain exactly how to find but is very easy.
Nope. Not that I noticed (bought for a friend).
No, you need to buy a GSM Sim from any of the Service Providers in your Country, PAY TO ACTIVATE THEIR DATA SERVICES, then enjoy Wifi services.
I think so It will give wifi signal to any device working with wifi
yes
you mean se 215? I don't try se 215 before.But they has there own advantages. What kind of music you prefer? For IE3, the quality of human voice is great. But the bass is a little bit weak. I have already used it for more than 50 hours and the bass quality became much better than before. If you have more questions, feel free to contact me.
Does the hissing noise occur solely on that Android device ? If the answer is no then you likely have a defective unit.
Return it and get a replacement or refund. You have a lemon.
Yes this can plug into your DS4, making any headset effectively wireless, by only tethering it to the controller. I own this exact cable and use it with my G430.
6ft
I only use it to play music off a USB key .
No. It was a complete waste of money
14X11X6.5 inches
No it is not. I looked on original box and it says just for the 1300 series.
No it does not have a white panel for it.
No I'm afraid not. The only issue I have with this product is that the mouse click is veeery loud.
I have an 08 but it's a simple plug and play connection I'm pretty sure they didn't change it.
I did some research and the 1390 accepts Micro SD cards, this product should work fine. One thing to note, once you insert the card to expand your memory, you have to leave it in in order to use the unit
Provided you have the required space left on the card, it should be no problem.
I'm not sure. I have one 12inch kicker comp. It's rated at 300rms, it kicks hard. I love it.
I have it running to two dual 2 ohm 10 inch subwoofers and it sounds great it's very loud and there in a custom box made by Bbox that goes under the back seat of a 013 F 150 SuperCrew sounds great
Sounds like one or more of your car speakers may have a short or be blown. The issue could be faulty wiring, which get shaken around with the sudden bass drops and have become loose. Have your car speakers and their wiring verified.
I don't know. They are quite versatile thug. I mounted a 400 x 300 to a 200 x 200 with them.
Fuji film ease to find and cheap too
I didn't have one. Sounds more like a power strip to me. I had the same equipment, each on its own adapter, outlet. I didn't have surge protection, it an was fine but could have been luck of the draw. If you want added peace of mind, then get it.
I've had two of these exact same adapters and both stopped working after about two months. The first one crapped out after a month and it took the company about two months to send me a new one. Same thing happened to the one they sent me. Seems the electronics "cook" after so many uses. When they did work they worked well.
The chord is attached to the adapter but is non functional. Looks just like a regular adapter
Try plugging it into a lead and make sure the power and record light come on, if so the problem could be with card. The lights are located under the removable back cover.
Don't know for sure what your Midland has, but my midland's in the past used a 4 pin just like these come with. (just look at the plug on the side of the radio and count the pins were the mic plugs in)
No batteries required.
Sorry we don't use DHL service it's not available in usa
You would need one for each TV.
Yes
I would go with the t1000bdcp. It is rated 1000 X 1 @ 1ohm. You can wire your (2) P3D4 down to 1ohm. You will have (2) 500 rms subs for a total of 1000 watts rms with the t1000bdcp pushing 1000 watts rms to them.
There's no reason why it shouldnt. I think the iPad 2 (which I bought it for) has the same dimensions as the one with the retina display.
I'm not sure about Panasonic products, but it will pair/work with Apple products
Maybe, I think if the device has a bluetooth it can be used.
Yes
Sound *Output power (RMS): 8W *Sound System: Stereo *Volume Control: Volume Control up/down *Sound Enhancement: Dynamic Bass Boost
I think that you can add apps from the store
This tv is not worth buying.I own 2 other Vizios which are fine.But this particular model stopped working in less than a year of use.
hi I don't think so
Yes and the stock GE' s sound the best in my opinion
Well, not sure what you mean by "good enough". I bought this camera for the hi-speed fps. However, the HD is excellent in sunlight. Not sure about indoors.
Yes.
Does this unit cover: Brookwood Golf Club in Rochester Hills, MI?
I don't think so. The rechargeable battery is a AA battery. It is soldered in. My swami is a little over one year and won't hold a charge more than 6 holes.
No it's not the unit is sealed. I bought the 'membership' and it's been the greatest thing. Doesn't work no problem they send you a new one, doesn't work no problem phone Customer Service and they say the 3000 is no longer in production and they send you a 4000. Life time service and replacement for $20 at the time. Worth every penny.
Did you charge the keyboard? The connections is easy. I charged the keyboard for a couple of hours the first time, then i turn it on, went to settings, turn on Blutooth, the Ipad began to scan for bluetooth connections, the "Bluetooth Keyboard" appears, type the password and it's ready to work. When you are not using it for a long time, you just have to push down any key for a couple of seconds and it connects automaticly. Good Luck!
I don't know. It should say in the product description.
Yes
Sorry I don't know. I had to call HP to get the number of the HP battery, then search Amazon for an equivalent.
I can't say specifically about your model, but I can say the battery doesn't last long.
Probably yes, but I'm not 100% sure that understand You correct. Could You please explain what do You mean?
Good Morning, We have it listed for $40 which includes postage right now. So, if that is good for you you can buy it. Thanks, Heith
If you're asking if the plug is primarily meant for an American voltage (~110V), yes. If you're asking if the plug can also handle different countries' voltages (eg. ~240V), then also yes -- you'll just need a plug adapter, which is usually quite cheap.
Compatible with today's most popular cell phones and portable devices.. from the description.
The camera is powered by an AC power pack you have to plug into the wall. Any wire less camera will have to be plugged into some power source, be it batteries or AC. I recommend you look for a different wirer less camera. I bought two of these and both of them went out inside a month. The picture quality is not good at all.
I don't think so. The receiver has to be hooked up to the television to receive.
If the tablet is running windoes I think so, not sure if it's running android.
If your mobile 2m/70cm antenna is properly tuned and resonant on the amateur radio frequencies, then an antenna tuner is not necessary.
No, it does not have a stand.
I don't the specific specs for each IPAD model. I ran my serial number and google told me which generation it was and I ordered the skin.
Thanks for the question. This 4 zone speaker selector actually has only 1 input. The output is to connect to another selector and then there are the outputs to the 4 sets of speakers. There are models that have 2 inputs so you can play two different sources at the same time in different rooms. Contact AV-Express for more information.
No, it's strictly a switch to select speakers in different areas.
I have Nikon D5300 with 3" display and the Foldable 3" LCD... works fine, if Nikon L830 have a 3" display then OK else the filed view is reduced ...
If the screen dimensions are compatible to my Canon T4i then it will work. I have the flip out screen also and in outdoor light this will work great for seeing detail on the screen. I would recommend this very highly.
I'm sure it would.
If the GPS is built in, sure.
Yes, it has a clear vinyl camera port. However, I find it difficult to align my iPad's camera so it's in the center of the hole. It usually ends up with the edges of the cut-out interfering with a clear view.
I think you mean washer. A round flat plate with a whole in the center. Yes a washer is included.
Surly will.
This battery fits and works great in the Vixia HF M40. I brought the charger and batteries with me on a recent trip to Europe, and rarely had to use 2 of them on a single day. LOTS of capacity and charged quickly, too. Great product!
I used these speakers to replace/upgrade the door speakers in my 03 Nissan Frontier. I believe they are 6 1/4" speakers. Sorry I'm not sure as the fit in your application.
My husband has been using this since the update of 6.1 and hasn't had any problems charging. The only problem thus far is that the cord is so thin that it is starting to need some electrical tape where the power cord connects to the USB plug. I have also ordered one from the same manufacturer for my ipad4, sure hope it works, haven't received it yet.
It works about the same, maybe a little slower. I like it because it gives me a little more from the outlet.
It is for 7 inch tablets. My son has an 8 inch tablet he uses it for. It works good for the 8 inch also.
It works on my Pro. Seems to have a little lag in some applications though.
All I can tell you is I have the MT294A3 model , which is 28 3/4 " long. If your model is 29" or longer:It will not fit. 28 to 28 3/4 is perfect.
Not sure - I have the MHX Pro 3W and it fits fine. The top portion of the bag is a good size. Hope this helps some.
Yes, with room to spare.
Yes, they help a lot, even if not perfect! Don't expect miracles.
No, this is a simple switch. It does not have DHCP capabilities or any advanced routing.
Hi, Moukhtarbek. The router should be connected to the modem, then your switch and magic jack should be connected to the router for the magic jack to work correctly. Your router should have a separate internet port for the modem's connection and another ethernet ports for the wired devices.
I have, and it works
You may use crossover cable to connect it to another switch. All the ports in the switch have the capability to determine what kind of cable is connected to it but it is recommended to use at least CAT5 type of Ethernet cable. For more product details, visit this link, http://kb.linksys.com/Linksys/ukp.aspx?vw=1&docid=e062d392db844e80b5cc3287efaf94e3_SE2800_FAQs.xml&pid=80&respid=0&snid=2&dispid=0&cpage=search.
Yes, of course you can.
These two switches functions the same especially with their speed and the only difference between them are their distinct features and specifications. The SE3005 have the Powersave feature that detects which ports aren't being utilized and minimizes their power usage and auto-sensing Ports maximize the data flow rates 10/100/1000 Mbps.
Hello... Robert P.. Yes.. they work! I know exactly what you're going thru trying to find glasses that will work.. If they are packaged like mine they will say for LG tv.. ( now the ones at a store that I purchased said they were for an LG and they didn't work ) so I was unsure.. Happy to tell you these did!! Enjoy !
Don't know about radio shack, OK for my V tech
Yes it can do a 2 channels split side by side ,pic n pic,this Quad is nice,zoom,the work.i recommend buy ing it.
Yes
Nope,if you need we would give u,please mail us let we know
i'm still waiting for it
Been having the same issues but usually only on my cable box. Never on movie or on radio. Think it's a signal issue on hdmi
Not.... I just order the same battery of my sony vaio. ..
A pit bull would help. Also prophylactics.
Li'd suggest looking at the dimensions of the case and working out where you would put things, given the top to bottom height, distance between PCI slots on your chosen mobi, etc.
it has a rechargable battery built in. I charge it every week seems to do the trick. Memory and battery are built in.Plug to USB port or USB adapter
They just think it is an outdoor thermometer
Yes the directions do suck!!!. From memory(away from home), I believe, I connected usb cable to PC and held down the black push down button on the back till I saw the green light flashing from the front, then disconnected it and placed it where I wanted. After a few minutes I connected it back to PC and saw an avi file recorded.
I did and after three months they work just fine, never had a problem.
No I don't think you can do that. You can only select one source to be the i/p, either AUX1 or AUX2. Hope this helps.
So, what is your question?
Some one else told me of one. You just have to search. One that fits another radio works with this one.
don't think it has a USB
data is all still on there, all we have noticed is that the date and time will have to be reset...
Every Item listed and shown in the photo. Excellent buy
I was actually contemplating replacing the CFLs with LEDs. I would think Amazon or even Home Depot.
Yes, they are seamless (just large cuts of material). The backdrops have been folded to fit in the box, so there are creases. You can iron them out.
It might. You're going to have to open your aspire and compare the edges of your screen, and your screen's hinge brackets, to the edges of this product in its picture. Without knowing which screen is in your aspire, then you can't really make an informed decision about whether this screen being sold will fit with your particular aspire. Good luck!
I dont know .....I dont have the paper work anymore
The best way to get the proper wiring size and type is to use a wire chart. It will depend upon the current of your source as well as the length of the run. You will need to know the ratings of your solar array to get the proper size.
Doubt that it will fry the inverter, but it definitely will not work. The Inverter will not turn on if the voltage is above about 28 volts. If you wish to use that inverter you need a 12-18 volt panel.
The machine comes with a standard Sony warranty of 90 days labor/parts for refurbished computers. This warranty is for the hardware.
Yes it does with fast speed downloading and uploading.
Remote came with mine. If you're buying an "open box" or "factory refurbished" unit, then it might be missing a component, such as the remote, however it would have to state that in the description.
So if I want to watch TV the receiver must be turned on? How can I hook up the cables so the TV and it's speakers work with the cable, and the extra speakers work only when the receiver is turned on?
In all honesty yes you do need to buy a powered subwoofer. Though you can run lines from the receivers left and right front speaker outs to the sub and then to the front speakers, you are asking way too much of the reciever at 75 watts per channel. But don't fret. You can find decent subs pretty cheap. I just ordered a Pioneer sw-8 from newegg for $79. They also have a 10 in Polk that goes on sale a lot for $89.
i bought thru amazon. i had same question as well. i habe 4 satellite speakers 1 center speaker and a sub+woofer. fyi i love it!
Do you have a smart TV? Try to send the content to that device instead. On another note...you can connect the optical audio from your TV to your receiver and no matter what you watch on TV you can get dolby sound by goint to that source. I had the same problem before when trying to use my itouch and the content would not stream. I ended up plugging the USB to my smart TV and it worked.
They are plastic, not paper.

according to its website: Timing 9-10-9-28
Hello, Like where almost everything else is made.... China For the money, I think it is still a good choice. Happy new year
My guess would be 'yes' as this tripod has a standard size 35mm camera mounting screw ("?).
I have not had it wobble. It is fairly stable. I rarely extent it all the way up. It would depend on the weight and lens size.
Yes, it still available.. I'm on my iPhone now. I can not check it on Amazon. I will do that later It's also available on eBay Under starlaptop also. Thank you
I use it on a Lenovo running Windows 7 printing on my old HP1100 that had a plenty of ink left. I can't speak for MAC OS. Contact the maker. On Win 7 it self installed AND found the HP 1100 driver. I would take the chance If I had the MAC and then download MAC drivers from HP which I found on their site. I've made worse financial decisions. Hope that helps.
It works but with limited function. I can print but do not have the scan function or other custom options on on my psc 500. I am happy to continue using my old printer. Without this cable, it was usless.
I think you'd need to buy one for each location. I have a second driveway system from a different manufacturer, and it chimes three times when tripped, as opposed to twice, as this unit does. This way, I can tell which location is alerting.
yes, It is a radio transmitter.
Google is your friend dat sir, XDA developers has many Roms for your outdated transformer, just search the forums and find the tablet. Running KitKat on mine about to get lollipop soon.
I ordered an Amazon Basics Netbook Bag with Handle for 11.29. (B002VPE1Q6) It is black with an orange interior made out of a foam padding covered by microfiber cloth. The ASUS tablet and docking keyboard fit just fine. It has a pocket in front to carry the charger and cables.
It's about the size of a credit card :)
Roughly 3X2 inches. Including like the white strip 3.5X2.5
I believe it can be replaced by Sony. I leave mine plugged in all the time so that it's ready to go when I am. I didn't like having to charge it every time I wanted to use it.
it has a built in battery if it doesnot hold the charge then you would have to take it to a sony service center to replace the internal battery
It's not out for the Tabs. Just a select few phones.
yes
No.. This is the wifi version. No monthly contract. You can use anywhere that has a Wifi hotspot (including your home).
My DVD player didn't work from day one. I sent it back and waiting on another one.
It's so hard to know. Yes it says Lenovo....no it doesn't look like the power cord that came with my W530.
You connect the device to a computer using an Ethernet cable and temporarily change the computer network settings so that it can interact with the device. Next you change the device settings to match those of your wireless network and then you can disconnect it from the computer and restore the computer network settings. The device retains its settings in its built in memory so it becomes part of your network from that point onwards. This is all documented in the user manual that comes with the device (also available on the iogear website http://www.iogear.com/support/manual/GWU627_Manual.pdf)
I've not tried, but I don't think so. They are made to program directly to the Sony TV.
Hi Jack, Sony TDGBT400A and TDGBT500A are the compatible 3D glasses for the Sony XBR55X900B TV. -Vincent
Yes I believe they are
Yes
It has a pretty standard 80mm computer case fan in it. They're not silent, but they're not loud.
Yes. Here is the full Drives & Printers compatibility list for the NSA320: http://www.zyxel.com/us/en/ProductTab.shtml?pid=20091110160301&idx=8&c=us&l=en Info page is here: http://www.zyxel.com/us/en/products_services/nsa320.shtml?t=p Always make sure to update firmware to the latest.
There are four 240 pin slots. You may use 1, 2, or 4 slots, with a maximum of 8Gb in a slot.
I guess that would depend on the processor you used, the graphics card you used, the harddrive you used and the memory and how much you had. I've never measured the power, so sorry, I can't help.
Yes. You just need to have 2 inputs on your camera, or an external recorder. Another way is to run one left and one right.
No it only works with one person. If you need to use a wireless mic set with more then one presin. I suggest you go Amazon or B&H for that..
It will only pick up one transmitter.

Not sure I have a G42 but if they say it fits, it probably does. It is thicker than the original so the PC will sit at an angle but it has more cells so it lasts longer.
This stand is for the old connector, you will need lightening.
I didn't use the case controller but instead installed a separate LCD controller...mainly just to fill another bay and have the controller at my finger tips. The best option is the MB controller, which I have but didn't use.
The 650D is slightly larger than the 450D, but the 450D is able to fit an e-ATX motherboard as well as a 430mm long graphics card. The 650D has 2 extra optical drive bays and 2 usb 2.0 ports in the front. The 650D also comes with dual 200mm fans, one in the front and one on the top.The 650D also comes with a 3 mode-4 channel fan controller. The 650D also comes with a built in hot swap dock.The 450D also comes with SSD tool free cages hidden behind the motherboard tray. I hope this helps.
I think so. Your best bet is to go to pcpartpicker.com You pick all the parts and it'll tell you if it will work
An L plug
I run a mtx jackhammer on mine in 2ohms running 600 RMS all the time. This sub will take the power. You willve working that amp. It will push the sub...but maybe for about 4-6 months before heating issues take its toll. It will work...but I would put a mono or 2 Chanel amp.
if you are going for sound quality then yes. If you want to get loud then go ported. A sealed box will save on space too. But the P3 subwoofer is made to work perfectly in both.
This particular amp can't produce a thousand watts, it's only a 500 watt amp. I think it's best since you're only running one sub to get the 2 ohm and just run you're amp at 500 watts rms. the p3's are 600 watts rms.
I use the vertical keystone feature all the time as the screen I show on in different rooms are at different heights. But I don't think there is a way to do horizontal keystone. I have to make sure the projector is at the right angle to the screen by manual means.
Yes. Im sure this will work just fine!
Not an electrician, but it might be the wiring of your home. I've used both these and Belkin brand adapters in both a 2-story and 3-story home, which share the same electrical connection and circuit breaker.
the black side boarder is about 1.5" so you can add that to the view area to get the total width of the screen cloth. It should be around 133". This screen does not come with a trigger. Thank you.
not sure. I bough it as a gift for someone who had an iphone 4 and an ipad. If the the pins are different for charging the mini or air (like the iphone5) then you will need an adapter.
Just tried this, and got this to work. Rotate the lens so that the iris is fully closed. I.e. counter-clockwise until it stops. Under the "p" of "Optic Swap" notice the stop ridge on the under side of the ring. It has come to rest on the retainer spring. Now push the lense in firmly so that the spring is fully depressed. Continue rotating the lens. That stop ridge will now pass over the retaining spring releasing the lens. Hope that description helps. -Brian
I am honesty not sure what you mean. We were remodeling our kitchen and I showed these to my father in law who is great at electrical work and he said to buy them...
yes you can access your email...the blackberry playbook comes with an email application...once you create your account...you get your email....don't need a blackberry phone for that!! Hope this helps!
Yes. There are some prerequisites, but yes.
The website claims it does support top and bottom but I have this and I cannot watch ESPN3D because they use top and bottom. this device does utilize side by side and frame packaging.
No provision for wall mount. The receiver will fall.
You can't set anything on the extension, it's only a tube with pieces you can take off depending on the macro you're looking for. Of course you can set the aperture to what ever you want on your camera. But this tube is great, and can't beat the price.
Yes, a dust cover is included.
yes in this bundle, all lenses are canon
I Googled and found out that there is no difference. Cannon changes camera names for different parts of the world. Google/Bing to verify.
Email Microtel what it need to upgrade . And under what order number
YES. BACK OF THE POWER SUPPLY 110v - 220v.
It will work but only for 2 days! Do not buy!!!
Es it is te sims must be from at&t i live in Mexico AND i couldnt use the sim, i try to search how to unlock but ACER didnt want to help If you need something else, just ask
i have the exact same question, and the only things i noticed different is the information next to the name in the accer page: Aspire One 722 AO722-BZ454 (LU.SFT02.002): Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium - 64-bit version - AMD C-Series Processor C-50 (1.0GHz, 1MB L2 cache) - 2GB DDR3 Single-Channel Memory... (beyond that point is the same in both netbooks). Aspire One 722AO722-BZ197 (LU.SFT02.068) Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium - 64-bit version - AMD Dual-Core Processor C-50 (1MB x 2 L2 cache, 1.0GHz) - 2GB DDR3 SDRAM... if somebody knows anything else, please let us know.
This system will ship with an AC adapter.
Well you DO have a warranty don't you? Call them and get a rma number.
yes
Hello Paul, I purchased the Onkyo TX - 8050 as a gift for another. I do not know the answer to this question but, this is the website for owner manuals for Onkyo products: http://www.onkyousa.com/Downloads/manuals.php?source=globalnav Go down the webpage until you reach this model and click to open the manual. The answer may be in there for you. The model is about half way down the page. Or, go to the Onkyo website: http://www.onkyousa.com/?m=TX-8050&class=Receiver&p=i and click on SUPPORT. They have a Support Forum, How to videos, and Frequently Asked Questions that are answered. Best of luck.
As long as the battery number is L 190, which I believe it is, you wouldn't have any problem.
Yep, there's a microphone built right in. You can't see it so if there's a problem with it (I have had zero issues with it so far) I'm not sure you could repair it on your own. It's great for the price if you're using it for Skype and not much else.
no switch, no input cable. the speakers don't last that long. I had them for about 6 months.
I don't see why they wouldn't all you need for them in the audio port and they should work, I like these speakers a lot- never had a problem with them.
it's about 20lbs
Try this website http://www.lpgear.com/category/PYLESTYLUS.html
The CD drive is not able to write. I suppose if you had a CD:RW drive on your computer you could rig something up to write to a disc after routing it there, but that would take a bit of legwork. Aux cables work just fine though
Yes, it does record to a memory card. In fact if you don't have a memory card it will not record.
The 2' Firestick is thick and stiff. I have not had a chance to use it outside but I have tested it indoors. Reception is so much better with this antenna.
Sorry, we do not do international shipping on film.
yes it will theres a video on youtube of that.
It will fit yes. But it's cheap. The turn lock to link the battery to the camera. Broke the first time I tried to install it.
yes
mi Mine is win7 Professional
Is the player BDP-95 (purchased on amazon store) - DVD Player - "Region Free"?
I think it would but not 100 percent sure.
There is no internal storage. The sd card is the only way to play music
It does require a USB connection, but it comes with a cable that has the audio jack and the USB input, so you can charge it while you download, or , there are A/C chargers and car chargers for USB.
As long as you have an optical output on the cd player.
No, it doesn't have headphone jack. It's better option The Bos solo tv. Check it. Don't confuse with The low price of Boston quality sound is awfull.
I have not been able to remove mine and I have had it for a while
I am not sure. However I have a Range Rover and I put it on my dash and it works great. It doesn't move and its holds my GPS just fine. I haven't had a single problem with it.
Yes. And with a bigger aperture, in other words a F1.4 or F1.2 --50mm (18-55mm) if you can find it but it will cost you. For low lighting conditions you want to have a compensate with the iso (speed light sensitivity).
Yes, if you have a camera Nikon D80 that lens will work great. You could even get the Nikon lens 18-105mm VR which is very good. Use a lens accordingly to the type of pictures you like to take most.
yes its adjustable so it will hold all the ipads
It would appear that you can if the TV was bought within 30 days.
It is not ati glare.
You can use as big a hard drive that you want, for example I use a 2 TB.
It's in our camper as well. Just at a place w/cable hook ups and tried it. Seemed to only pick up the analog channels but I'm not totally sure I'm doing it right!
We can not answer because this tv was too big for where we wanted to use it and it was returned for a smaller tv. Sorry :-)
The one I received was wired, which is what I expected.
Search for "Mouse and Keyboard Center 2.3" and that should work, but honestly I haven't installed a single driver for it and it works exactly as I thought it would. Volume, pause/play and calculator all work perfectly.
There's really no difference other than the packaging. I bought this keyboard because it was what I had at work and it has been 5 months since I started using it and have no issues at all.
it has a wireless usb conector sorry
Yes, but it won't be very wide angle. Use your kit lens now and zoom to "24" that's as wide as it gets. If you're upgrading your kit lens look at the "Canon 17-55 f2.8 IS USM EF-s" it's specially designed for your camera body.
No radio
It's double the thickness of a new iphone.. Highly recommend! Makes good headphones sound great and great headphones sound even better!
This cable never worked, I was trying to use for mi ipod ipad and never work. I don't say nothing because I was buying since Peru and my friend resend to me since Usa, sure de price to return do this more expensive. Resume: this is not ok, no function
I would say so... It sounds better with an amp
Hi, My mac book pro was purchased in 2010, but appears to have the same keypad as the 2009. I have 6 skins for under $11.00, which for me is awesome, as here in Canada they are $25.00 each. This seller could not have been better to me, they sent to friends in Seattle, no problem. IF you would like me to send you a skin, I would be glad to put into the mail for you.
Well my computer is from 2009 or 2010 and it is a 13.3 too and it fit. It is a rubbery material. It's a good product it really does keep like dust and crumbs from getting into the keyboard
Not quite, but it holds up well on middling high settings and even on the max on some slightly older games. I also have 4 gb of ram and I don't overclock or anything. On World of Tanks, for instance, I can get a solid 30-40 fps on a lot of maps, and many with water or fog sometimes dip into the 20's. And this with all the stuff on max. I could probably do better with some optimization and OC'ing, but I'm good for now.
Both are two ohm outputs; however, if you are only connecting one sub, use left - and right +. This was confusing for me also, at first.
If they are subs and not regular speakers than no if they are regular speakers it should do fine it wouldn't push my sony explode 12" sub but it pushes my brothers 2 10" speakers good
It doesn't unfortunately.
If the Canon camera has a mini-HDMI port or a regular HDMI port this monitor will work with the proper cable.
Yes.
Yes, it's adjustable and it will fit. I have a Google Nexus 10 and an iPad Mini and it fits both easily. It works great especially if you have kids.
yes, this is a high resolution projector.
I would look for a Terk indoor antennae. I bought one and helped a great bit. I think you will have tosplice the wires.
Your pin and puk code are provided by your phone carier , you would have to contact your carier service.
mine is running on android 3.2.1 and there is no update right now.
All day long
The dimmer does provide good control of the light output but we can not determine whether it can be adjusted to exactly 1Lux or thereabouts.
Yes it fits
Canera cost is as variable as food prices. You can spend as little as 15-20 bucks for a camera or several thousand, depending on your needs. In general for a good quality picture, look for CCD based cameras and the more TVL lines the clearer it will be. If you want sound, be sure and buy the extra mic and get the cable with audio. The mic is around 8 bucks and the upgraded cable is 3 or 4 dollars more.
Well RMS is the root mean square of a continuous waveform from positive to negative, it is the square root of the arithmetic average of the squares of an original value. In the case of lets say an amp or subwoofers if it claims a maximum rating of 6000 Watts, you multiply 6000 x .707 (the square of half the waveform) = 4242 Watts your continous root mean square or value.
First response I think of is whether there is adequate signal and if the lights light up quicker if you move the antenna to a different direction? Next thing I think of is a loose connection from the side mounted switch to the antenna power line at the antenna itself? It is good to test the connection before sealing it all up, but I really don't want to go there! Good luck!
I am not an expert at this. I put out one camera at 150 feet and it seems fine. What I have noticed is that in cold weather (zero outside) my images don't seem as clean.
No
If you go to setting you can colobrate your screen sensitivity, hope that helps!
No it does not. Also note it does not charge the newer model iPhones (5&6) only the older models.
I don't know for certain. I can tell you that it did work with the iPhone 4S even though the packing materials seem to say no. Please read my review on the issues I found with it - I did return mine to the store where I purchased it. If nothing else be sure you can return it.
The port uses the same connector as was found in iPhone 4S and iPad. It's not the same as the iphone 5 magic wand
If it is pre-installed, it is an added plus. I had to install Microsoft Office on the machine I purchased.
Not the 5 series
I am not sure what "a predictable order" means, but it does have the sequential play option which is a straight order from the first to last song in the list.(and to some the "shuffle" mode is also predictable, albeit much slower to repeat) As for returning to the previous song after being turned off, under normal shut downs it did return to where it left off even midsong. hope that helps
Yes xp pro
It connects to anything that regular headphones plug into!
Yes and an extra battery. There is EVERYTHING you need included and more.
We ship UPS. We offer free ground shipping (1-5 business days) If your order is placed before 3:30 PM PST, it will ship out the same day.
No, your rifle is a short action.
I mounted my transmitter under the lip on the side panels. Seems to work for me. As far as I know it is waterproof.
Check here: http://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets/
Yes it can. That is exactly what I am using it with. My room Demi sons are 22feet by 13 and it sounds great.
We have a Russian distributor. Lease visit www.cellblaster.net to find local contact information. If you still needed assistance please send me your private email and I will contact you shortly. My email is joe @restassured. Dot. Com.
Our UV tubes are rated for 5000-10,000 hours. They will not explode when used.
It will work with any capacitive touchscreen. I looked up the specs on the Asus TF700T and it looks like it's a capacitive touchscreen. You should be good to go! (P.S. Most newer tablet/phone devices are capacitive - this even works on my older android phone)
Thanks for asking.... I'd have a sturdier tripod for any/all telephoto lens. Just not good enough. The extra weight makes the tripod "slide" downward.
Have not tired but as long as the adapter on the bottom has the same threading it should be fine. My experience with Amazon order it and if it does not work u can return no hassles!
Yes it most certainly will. This set is great for the rebel. Bare in mind however that the tripod can sometimes feel a little flimsy but it's really good for the price.
Yes
I DO N OT KNOW MY BATTERIES SAYS DMWBCK7
Yes it included lens caps for both of the lenses and the body of the camera
i dont know , and dont think so.
I have not try on android TV, but it should work just fine. For mine android TV I use some similar device but with air mouse, and it works fine, so this one should work as well.
I think that it comes with basic charts however you need to purchase the charts separately in order to have high resolution charting. We bought this unit for our son so I am not 100% sure.
It runs always connected. Internal battery only to keep data stored. The unit works extremely well. Very frendly. I recomend.
I only see one option listed in the user manual. It is model GSU-5H. My CP190i is mounted on the flying bridge so I don't use an external antenna.
I don't believe it can be mounted flush. I mounted mine so it looks flush using the pedestal in a resets.
I bought ir for my moms tablet. I thought it was compatible with Samsung galaxy tab 7. It never worked. We threw it away. Sorry.
If it's just a printer (not an all-in-one), then it will *probably work if you follow the instructions posted under the reviews page. I say probably because I have never tried it with a Kodak, but have had success with Brother printers and have heard that others have had success.
This TV is "Energy Star" rated. The output wattage is 10 wats. The off wattage is less than 1 watt. If you check the various OEM's you will usually find the "Energy Star" rating and wattage. The LED HDTV's can usually be considered as being energy efficient.
To my knowledge, there is only one port. Since I never had the need nor interest in looking further, I cannot be certain. devh devh
I wouldn't buy one as one of the batteries didn't charge or work and I have not heard from Amazon on a former comment.
They are 4 ohms
The technical details indicates below: Comes with Hard drive bracket and Works with: Macbook Pro (13-inch, early 2011) Macbook Pro (13-inch, late 2011) Macbook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2010) Macbook Pro (13-inch, Mid 2009) No, I wouldn't chance it.
No. You just use the charger you have and charge them one after another. It's pretty amazing how much charge you'll have with 2 batteries powering your camera. It literally lasts for hours. I still consider it the best money I've spent on my Canon.
no
Yes it does both the T3 and T5 uses the same battery and configuration.
It works great and was easy to install.
No, the highest res that I get with the screen is 1366 x 768 and it is a hard cover glossy screen... I was a little disappointed when I turned it on and found out it had a glossy finish, it causes glare... oh well it's better than a big hole in my original one...
About 17 inches.
yes I use it with my kindle and it works great
Neither. Spend a bit more and get a better product.
Yes iris new or reconditioned
No I would not purchase these but if you did they will refund you
I've not had any Crucial M4 units for more than a year but thus far they're all working perfectly. I've installed all sizes from 64GB to 512GB in PC laptops, desktops and an old-ish Mac Book without issue.
Yes, see the following link: http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/alienware-17/CT5481002
Im not sure, it didnt fit my nook completely. I had to do some alterations to make it user friendly.
Flo, I chose not to buy this because I thought it was expensive. I ended up buying (from apple) for my macbook a cord that plugs into both the TV and the computer and watched tv that way. I understand the Apple TV is wireless and is 99.00 and Apple states it allows you to watch all your downloads on your tv. some man reviewed apple tv on amazon with great detail. I would refer you to look that up first. Good luck.
Yes it is compatible with Windows 8
Yes, you can. It is a fabulous computer.
Yes
http://www.amazon.com/cost-real-tracker-advanced-features/dp/B004W3NYJA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8
yes
Yes
no it does not. It is very basic with one automatic exposure setting.
Yes.
Hi Sue Q, the support and the lip is one piece, made of rubber. The lip does have a hole in the bottom so the iPad can be charged while sitting in the iProp. The iPad can sit in the IProp in either portrait or landscape orientation.
Don't buy this MP3 player. There are better ones available.
One CD...
No it does not have its own hard drive. It sits almost 5' with the stand
Yes it does.
No--nor to they make a tele-converter. Samsun is a leader in cameras but a laggard in lenses.
At the 2014 24 Hours of Daytona, Racing Electronics said that they could not program the Pro-444. They will sell you a their frequency list on paper, of course.
No, this projector operates through direct wiring.
That would be the plastic on the bulb getting got which means you have ran the TV too long these televisions run got when left on for extended periods of time. I only run mine for three to four hours at the most then I give it a break so as to let the bulb cool off. If you find the light blinking on the front after doing so unplug it wait a few minutes and then plug it back in and the light should be off I hope this helps
I've got one on an older D40X. I'm pretty sure it is compatible with the standard D40.
Yes, with my Hitachi flat screen TV. Consult your TV manual for hookup. Very easy to install as the adaptor plugs are color coded to the TV audio outlets. I am very pleased with this headset and I think you will be too.
Hi. The item comes with two plug-in chargers: one for the headphones and a second one for the box that connects to the TV.
I believe the laptop I replaced the screen in was the model you're asking about instead of the 15r I mistakenly typed in my review. Check the back of your lcd panel and see if the numbers match the numbers listed for this product. Mine matched exactly and it fit and functioned perfectly. Hope this helps.
Yes, they are included. These sound better than the Alpine ones well, I bought also, should've got more of these...
Dede, I don't think that T-Mobile even sell this one anymore. This one is being sold by a 3rd party and the software is extremely old by Android standards. If you want a decent Android tablet for about the same price then go directly to Google and purchase a new one from them. You can get a 7 inch from Google that does WiFi for only $229 and will be much faster have up to date software and have better resolution that this old tablet.
Yes, this product can have sim card, but you can use it just for internet, you can not call with it as mobile phone
My plan was to let it charge for 24 hours, but it seemed to work right away. I ended up forgetting about my plan and using it even before it had charged for 24 hours, and it worked fine. I have had this for a few months now with no problems. I have even had the phone with me for several hours while being on call for work, and it has stayed charged.
I don't know. All I can tell you is that my original battery is identified as "BT-17333/BT-27333" 3.6V 400mmAh Ni-Cd. So, I guess if your original battery reads the same, it may work.
I can't say with 100% certainty but I highly doubt it. It's pretty much a perfect fit - so best case scenero, I think if it were possible, it would probably either put unnecessary pressure on the screen or stretch out this case. And I mean that with the snap on cases. Anything bigger than that and I'm 100% sure it wouldn't fit.
No. It isn't really compatible with any. Notebook except for MacBook Air and it says,"MacBook Air" on it and it's made out of the crappiest stuff. You are better off literally buying a mailer like it looks like and it will work better and be better made
I use this lens/adapter with nex-f3, and there isn't any lens correction needed imho. The edge when wide open will be fuzzy-ish, but that adds a nice uniqueness to what you shoot with this lens, at least for me. It ain't a Leica, but that doesn't mean you can't get great photos from this fun to use lens. I bought a different adapter though, this one is a bit skimpy
E mount. The lens is a 'c mount', so it comes with a 'c-nex adapter' which adapts it to your nex 'e mount'
There is no threads for the filter on lens
This mouse should require no setup. Just plug the wireless USB adapter into your computer and it should be ready to use in a matter of seconds.
I just popped the sensor into my USB port and it installed itself.
Haven't had any issues with condensation. It has been used on runs in very high heat and on cool mornings and so far so good.
Is your processor duo? I bought this thinking it could support i5 without reading it.
Yes, It will take X/P pro with no problem.
It depends on your video card, this is not related to monitor, I believe most of video cards have the option to hook up more than one monitor. the monitor is great, I use it for 2d, used it for 3d gaming once or twice.
All you have to do to is plug your USB into the computer and view it on the monitor. Why do you want to plug the USB device directly into the monitor?
Yes
I can't answer for the D700, but it works fine in a 2004 vintage D70. I think you'll be fine, mine has made my camera worth keeping for backup.
I have a Ford F-150 and they are long enough to reach from the cab to the battery with no problem.
Depends, the login page is passed through to the first device to connect, but I've had a few where it didn't work
It's a lens no? It's not good in low light, it's f6.3 or f12 therefore you really need full sun or really bright light to make use of this lens. I have successfully used it hand held at 1000mm ISo 1600 In noonday sun. Otherwise you will need a tripod even in sun.
I use it some. It is hard to use without a tri-pod and focus is a problem unless what ever it is that you are taking a photo of stands still. I got some pretty nice shots of animals and birds but it is a cumbersome lens and it would be much better if it had an electronic focus. The doubler is very difficult to use because of the focus problem. I still use it however and am sort of happy but not ravingly happy with it.
I've been running mine well over 12 months 24x7. Rebooting only with Microsoft updates and when I'm doing things. Hardware has never given me any grief.
Works fine with Windows 7. Not sure about 8.
Yes it is!
I use it with S3. But S4 is a little bit larger than S3. So I think this one will not fit.
I've had TONS of issues with charging. The charging nodes corrode fairly easily (on the charging cradle, not the watch itself) and the 610 has a nasty habit of DE-charging when plugged in (e.g., you will see it go from 90% to 85%...etc.)
Yes, it will. It can be used to take any kind of shot once you adjust the camera settings to get the required shutter speed for fast action shots. Me personally, its a piece of CRAP!!! A TRUE WASTE OF MONEY!!!
Windows 7 and Outlook compatibility I'm planning to upgrade to Windows 7, which version of Outlook are supported on it? The following versions of Outlook are fully supported on Windows 7 (32-bit and 64-bit); &#9726;Outlook 2003 &#9726;Outlook 2007 &#9726;Outlook 2010 &#9726;Outlook 2013 It is recommended to always fully update your version of Outlook directly after installing to take care of any incompatibility issues that have been fixed already. Note: The 64-bit versions of Outlook 2010 and Outlook 2013 also requires the 64-bit version of Windows 7.
Yes it will work
Hi Julia, yes this battery does work perfectly for the laptop. I brought one for my daughter last year and it still works great and holds the charge for a good amount of time. Depending on how much you use the internet.
It will
This wireless lan adapter will only work on onkyo models made from 2012 and up. It is nit the same as DLMA. The onkyo adapter lets you connect to your home wireless network.you can connect slacker or Pandora's radio
Not really. It's only protective. I unpair my devices before stowing the keyboard, but if you leave it paired, I don't think that it'll keep keys from being pressed when stowed away.
its about 4 pounds hey is very light
I think it work very well w a stylus. I put mine on as soon as I got my iPad and haven't taken it off. I have a regular and a fine point stylus and it responds as quickly to them as to my finger
SORRY IT IS A LISTING ERROR.
It is not necessary to connect the camera to the reverse light, but would have to operate the camera manually. The radio has a wire for reverse that would connect to the reverse light for automatic operation once in reverse.
Why would someone compare a 50mm to a 35mm? Its not even the same focal length..
Im pretty sure there was a warranty card in the box. Its a really great lens for the the money. The bokeh and dof is excellent
The neck strap is ok, but get yourself a harness instead they are the way to go. No neck strain and your bios won't flop around
Snds like a faulty pair. Mine are equally clear. I would contact amazon or dealer asap
You won't if your PC has a Bluetooth receiver built into it. If it doesn't, then you will need a small "USB Bluetooth Adapter", that slides in one of your PCs USB ports before it will sync up the speaker. These can be found at any elec store for around $8-$12.
The case is designed for an Apple wireless keyboard and that snaps in very nicely. I do not know about the Logitech--it may or may not. The iPad air would fit just fine. This is a great product and several friends have purchased one on my recommendation are very happy.
I bought it for an extension to an iHOME portable speaker because I could not dock it with my OTTER case. It is perfect for that! Not sure what a lifeproof case would be unless you are talking about an OTTER case? I am a teacher and I use it all the time in my classroom. It is a quality extension cord.
I use 60 Watt Bulbs no problem. I have been using the same sockets for 6 months and have around 15-20 hours AT LEAST on each. I wasn't able to find any label on the bulb itself or packaging that says what wattage it is rated for.
mine does not do that if you got the insurance make a claim
i have a much older model and it does notplay Mp4 but it's great
I have not tried it,but it does have a repeat function on the remote.
yes
Yes use it everyday with 4s
No idea. But there are better products out there. I'd say to avoid this sound bar.
The AV10072 may or may not work with the Amazon Fire smartphone since the cable's compatibility list includes Acer Iconia, Asus Eee Pad, Motorola Xoom, Archos 10.1, Blackberry Playbook 9800, Blackberry, and Playbook 9860.
This may be possible, but it depends on your Monitor's capability. If the monitor has a plug and play capability that can automatically detect the HD Fire, then it's possible.
Yes, I upgraded a Dell Inspiron 530 desktop (Celeron 2.0 GHz 440 processor, 2 gig DDR2 667Mhz RAM, 250 GB harddrive) with a step above this card: MSI HD 6570 and it worked quite well with stock OEM Dell power supply.
Sorry, don't know!
Sorry, I do not own one.
It in fact only has DVI-D, i had to return several and went with another brand.
as this card doesn't have a fan onboard, auxiliary power is not needed. it should be fine with your system. I use the same OS and it is working very nicely.
Oh absolutely. I can run a lot of games on my PC with this card. You might be even able to run it on higher setting but it all depends on specs of your computer
Yes It Does
3 patterns FYI 4 of the LEDs already burned out on mine...gotta send this light back.
I would suggest going to like a radio shack that might be able to help u. I know wat u r looking for but i dont have clue on wat the thing is technically referred too. It should not be difficult to find its basically the same type of cord that was used back in the old days of desktop computers.
yes
A light cream color
Sewn
Yes
Most definitely. We use it in the GH2 for the same reason - video - with canon and rokinon glass.
Do not use with zoom lenses only primes. I half 6 adapters that I use. there is not enough clearance. by the EOS-m4/3 works. hope that helps.
It's lamp&housing
If the drive is the standard 9mm and not 11mm
That's what I would love to know!
yes, it does.. i've had mine for 2 years without any problems.. the SSD is an amazing boost
Probably, but they do have an extremely small opening. But if you work with them you can get them to work by folding over.
Yes, they will be a bit stretched, but they'll fit.
yes
it would be way too big. i bought this one for my 14in Toshiba Satelite and it was way too big for it. a 13in cash should fit yours.
This device didn't work for my car. Not sure about any other device.
Yes the cut outs are slightly larger than the plug ports themselves. If it fits in the iPad you won't have a problem with the sleeve.
This is a back cover protector that works together with the Apple Smart Cover. They fit together very well.
It's a film camera.
I did receive the goods and was perfect, excellent quality and everything was like they offered. excellent seller!
Yes. It comes with a cord to connect to a computer or you can put the SD card into your computer. It does not come with an SD card though so make sure you purchase one or the camera will not store any pictures.
I only used the camera for snorkling, 3 to 4 feet. It did very well at that depth. The specs say it is only good to 10 feet.
yes
yes, that is all we use.
I have the 70-200mm F2.8 (no IS) and it fits in the bag. I think in my review I only mentioned the 100-400mm and that lens longer. I also had the tripod mount on it when it was in the bag. It will NOT fit with it ON the camera body in the compartment.
If it's a typical connector and the power is enough (see the output on the item description), it should.
If it is the first time charging or the battery power is low or dead it will blink green for what seems like an eternity. Patience is required. You may or may not be able to type while it is charging. It depends on the power in the battery. Also, check to make sure the battery is intact. Mine was loose after the keyboard fell several times. I fixed it. If the battery is dead when you unplug after 12hrs or more you need a new gadget. Otherwise, the charging unit will power off when unplugged. Hope that helps
I don't think so. When it's installed, they will register it.
This is a add on for vehicles with a existing remote start alarm system it adds cellular control to them
No
You dont need a tripod for the light, but you do need a ligh stand, if not you can place it in between the camera and the tripod screw :)
DOA. sent back. Did not replace. Using a ring light makeup light that works fine for my purpose. Don't remember about stand, to long ago.
Your taking a 50 50 shot some are pinned different
Yes comes with a remote
Microphonics IS a common problem. These Monster iSport Victory earphones do have that problem but it's no worse than it is with any of the other earphones I own. I mostly use my earphones when running. My solution to the microphonics issue is 1) to thread the cord under my shirt (through the collar to the waist) and 2) to use a Klingg cord holder to secure the cord at my collar.
If you have these plugged in your ears for optimal sound quality then you will only hear background noises that are considerably louder than what you are listening to. If you have them plugged in your ears and the sound is off, I'm guessing they cancel about 50% of the background noise levels.
L shaped
You can connect AP-1 via wire to a Router or a Switch. Connect AP-2 to AP-1 via up-link (without wire). Then you can use the port in AP-2 to connect PC, Device or a Switch. I would recommend only one wireless hop. It will not allow AP-3 to connect to AP-2. You could put a switch on AP-2 and then Connect AP-3 to that Switch and AP-4 via uplink. What are you trying to achieve?
It depends on the type of traffic. I would say 12-20 users per AP, depending on whether the users are streaming video vs. just surfing the web.
Yes you can fit at least 2 (1 on each side) standing upright in the widest portion of each storage slot
It plays both DVD and BluRay - WHEN it Works. Not Dependable!
No. I put this player in my kids room since I could not get it to play half the newer videos that I bought. I checked for an update and Visio did not hAve one. So I went to sams club and bought the Sony 3d player that they have. It asked me to update as soon as I connected it to the Internet.
Yes you can. Both the new and the old extension cord are compatible.
just enough to reach from the plug to the car ceiling without going around the front glass
The FM transmitter is strong and easy to use. I have used other devices with an FM modulator (transmitter) and some stations tend to override the modulator. I have not had this problem with the Jabra Freeway. The sound quality is excellent through the FM. Phone voice & strength is also excellent when not used in conjunction with the modulator. As a musical speaker it is ok.
I use it with an Android and a BlackBerry at the same time and yes it is able to be used hands free... but not all functions. After it is all set up you can answer incoming calls by saying Answer or Decline. If you want to make a call you need to tap the main button once and then it goes into Voice Mode... all you need to say is a simple command and it goes to work for you... very cool system!
I have 125 apps on my A500 and not showing any limit
I had similar problems and even when "they worked" they were not reliable. They cut in and out all the time. I used them to talk to my wife on the bow of our boat when we are docking and she is throwing lines. I threw them out and bought a set of SPH10 from SENA. More expensive but completely blue tooth wireless, hands free and very reliable. You get what you pay for.
the lens has an aperture range from f1.8 to f22. you'll need to be in A or M mode to select your own aperture. if you're in auto or S mode, the camera will choose it's own aperture. the camera body is what actually changes the aperture, you dont do it on the lens itself.
Yes they screw together along with the brush screwing on. I have to tighten all the "joints" or "screwing" with every push. Had to stick my arm up the pellet stove pipe to fetch the brush. The brush is not big enough for my 5 inch pipe. It does an okay job but would not buy it again.
I sent it back so I don't know.
no they do not, you to buy a powerline ac adapter. you will need a 4.5v
If you have a very thick case, I wouldn't know. However my hard silicon case fits perfectly with the jack on this headset.
I'm sure answers will vary , one the memory used and the battery, mine records for approx 2 hours , and it make a file at 59 min , then it will automatically begin a new file . I don't know why it does this but it works fine. it does tend to get a little warm when recording for a long period of time.
If it is set for continuous recording as we have it set up it will keep about 30 days.
I don't know if they have changed or not, but the cameras I received with my set are the actual 600tvl. Hope this helps you out.
2.5mm yes. i don't know what is 12.5mm
Dear W. -- I wish I could tell you with absolute certainty -- but the trays I see selling for Ultrabase 3 bay sure LOOK the same as what I got for my Ultrabase. The various Ultrabase bays support the SATA 2.5" form factor, so I don't SEE why it wouldn't work -- but again, I can't tell you that with absolute certainty. Good luck, and hopefully someone else on Amazon can tell you that for sure.
Absolutely. I use these when I use weights and treadmils. They stay tight on your head. And not having a wire that gets caught in weights is a blessing,
Maybe turn it off and turn it on. It sometimes glitches.
The headphones should work with any Bluetooth-enabled device. I have used these headphones with two Android phones, an Android tablet, and my laptop, all without problem. It will likely not work with the Xbox 360 unless there is an intermediary device which converts the signal to Bluetooth. The Xbox 360 does not have Bluetooth functionality built-in.
Backtrack and Kali Linux have been plug n play for me with this.
There are 300 led lights, each of the led lights has R G and B capabilities. The remote adjust their intensity to create the color you want. So in short 300 lights on the roll. .. And as with all led strips you can cut the strip every 3 lights to shorten to what length you want. Additional steps needed to make waterproof with this set. FYI
It will work with any amplifier, hope that answers what your asking, which is brief.
Hmm... I personally don't know this either (I too would like to know -- in case anyone has tested it out). However, the product picture show the "SERIAL ATA" logo with "1.5Gb/s" below it -- making me believe it is not SATA 3Gb/s or SATA 6Gb/s. I am looking for one that supports 3Gb/s.
All skullcandy headphones have a warrenty. Check out there website for more information.
Motor is NOT included, But if you goto the Konova website they have a couple add on options. You basically have two options, just a regular slow moving motor or a higher end key framable( I think ) time lapse motor.
No it's not a gimmick. It wotks very well with my hearing aids. It has a volume control and multiple adapters for use with an iPhone or Droid phone. I am very happy with this unit and recommend it.
Keep them on, but position the cup over the microphones on your hearing aids.
This mouse is 3 7/8" long
No it still stays on
Hey! The device does have an Aux port but no cable is included :(.
I have successfully linked it with both ipad1 and ipad2.
Hi Steve: Yes this does work just fine with Ipad Air. That is what I have and have used it with since I bought it a few months ago. Mark P
Im using it with a r9 280x its just fine It dos have all the juce and conections you need Youll be fine with it
There are two solutions I can think of. One is to buy 2 "3.5mm male to female audio cable". As of now if you search it on Amazon there one that sells for $4. Or you can buy a HDMI male to female extension cable for $9. The latter is a bit more expensive but it also means extending only one cable instead of two.
Hey there. I had bought this for a friend. From what I can remember it's 3.5 h ope this helps.
Yes. IR remote commands work just fine for my system
this cable suited me for the reason my radio in my camper only had a 3.5mm port. if you can utilize a coax or hdmi cable then i would do that, but if you have no other choice, this cable works great. nothing to tighten, just plug and play
i would assume that it would, as long as the adapter is working correctly. the cable is very high quality. i am using it to plug my computer into my Stereo Receiver so i can't answer with 100% certainty.
pdf books will load nicely
Mine works fine on my a65, a33, and a230 so you shouldn't have a problem with the a77
I,m not sure what your meaning if your saying two separate monitors then yes
YES!! It works perfectly with my A100. Logs on instantly, has special function keys and I love it. Wish I had bought it sooner!
The mic works great no cd slot just is your iPad. Use pandora or shazam or google for lyrics I only sing song I know the words to or hum
I'd really like to know this too. Anyone have an answer?
Been thinking about this myself...at time of this post Corel had raised it's price to $350 while Amazon had dropped theirs to $200, normally this would be a no-brainer except that a lot of the comments referenced serial numbers not working and dealing with Corel customer support for a product not purchased from them directly. Still $150 is $150
Should not need to buffer very much (except when switching stations). I am on slowish DSL also.
I personally have it set up wireless through my router; but the instruction book states that you can use an USB-Ethernet adaptor and plug it into the USB port in the back of the unit. If you get it, hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
Batteries last pretty long on this thing. We put Duracell batteries in it and it lasted us a full weekend of camping using it most of the day
Yep' for me, except would like to change viewing angle for table heights.
Does the tablet side of your Thrive still work on battery? If the tablet side still works as always I would look for a camera/software problem and not a battery problem. If on the other hand the tablet side runs out of battery faster than before and the screen is much brighter when plugged in, then I would replace the battery and hope that it also fixes the camera problem. You know, the camera may work if you uninstall and then reinstall the same battery, it may reset the system. Good luck, I hope this helps!
Yes. No problem whatsoever !
Yes due to the Samsung being 10.1" it has the same general dimensions as the thrive and is just about as thick. Only issue is the placement of the camera holes you will not be able use the cameras neither the front nor the rear unless you drill holes in it. It is a very sturdy case I like it for my thrive.
My 17.3 inch laptop fits like a glove. Yours might slide around, backpack does a strip to hold it in place.
This is a backpack that can hold alot of stuff. It is one of the largest that I have seen. Yes, it would be very good for a college student.
Work or not, don't waste your money!!! Many have posted requests for parts that have fallen off this product that aren't available and haven't been for a long time! It was poorly designed and falls apart!
Not sure if this helps but, it works with the iPad mini and the mini with retina.
No. The yoga 13 has two msata slots. You do not need a sata adapter. Check Lenovo forums online for more info.
Yes. Our daughter plays it all the time on this computer. No problems at all. Also, just as an fyi, we recently upgraded the memory (RAM) and also loaded the Mavericks operating system. It runs great. She also does her First in Math quizzes on there as well.
No, it operates via a keyboard and mouse
No. There is no DVD drive at all. You can buy an external drive (with Blue Ray) for about $50 or less to connect to this Mac.
It does not. I purchased, through Amazon, a separate 3 year service agreement. It was offered at the time I purchased the Mac.
No
Newer version recently released....more flash memory, newer chip sets for same price...better deal
Yes it is.
No problems at all with mine, 1 1/2 yrs old. Love my mini. Geo. Alameda,CA
The new Mac Minis (I own an older version) discuss replacing memory within the owners manual--warranty would probably be ok provided you used authorized memory chips. Hard drive replacement would probably be another issue that Apple might frown upon (you might want to consider an external drive for data storage).
windows 7 in bootcamp has no sound out of HDMI. I bought this for my media center and have tried everything. So far Apple has not provided drivers for it, The sound works great in Apple Lion
Yes, you can go to the apple upgrade program to get the upgrade code for free.
In general performance, there is no difference. If you are using photoshop or music software very heavily, then you will notice some time lag during rendering. Most do not notice the difference at all. The i7 usually comes in the 27" iMac and not the one listed here.
No unfortunately it doesn't have a DVD/CD drive. You have to buy it separately.
There are numbers on the keyboard above the letters, just as there would be on any keyboard, but there are no numbers off to the right side of the keyboard as you would find on a calculator.
No
Length = 30.5", Width = 25.75", Depth = 6" (one end) to 10" (other end)
Ronald I'm not 100% sure, I know there was some items that allowed to be upgraded, been a while since I bought, I use an external drive for tons of video and pic's, works like a champ got a 1 terabyte drive with USB
It is just an opening and there is no shield to protect the lens. With that said, the case is thick enough for the lens to be protected from breaking, but it is not protected from the dust.
Zagg. They are the best!
Never considered weight an issue.
Yes it does
I don't believe this model comes with anything but USB.
I can't evaluate it's functionality with an I Mac. I have only used it with a PC. I do a weekly radio broadcast with it and it works beautifully.
Yes you just need a lighting to 30 pin adapter. I got mine at Best Buy and works perfect.
If I understand your question correctly, the jack for the model only fits the specific Nikon cameras listed. The only flash units you can use are standard hot shoe flashes.
I used them on D700, works well. There should not be a problem on D800.
Yes
Yes, I have it set up on a Panasonic VHS/DVDR and it works fine.
I am not 100% sure but I think it would? However to be certain, you should shot an email to support@xdimax.com! I hope this has been helpful.
Hi Matt . They are different variables to your question( spk -rms)but from technical point of view if your component set spk have a crossover you can run the 2 front outputs from the amp FL AND FR to your spk crossover and the 2 rear outputs in bridge mode for the sub.
No. This am is use for door speakers
No i really doubt this is enough for that kind of system
The One i got Was new. This one is being offered as new
I am sure it will because the hot shoe mount is the same size. I have the D90. They work great but i havent tested the range yet.
Most definitely. They aren't TTL but they will work.
Yes I use it with windows 8. You will need to go to the Logitech website and download the drivers.
Intended for use with a laptop or desktop computer with the software installed on it--I think not. I have an LG smart TV, and I wouldn't even try, as there is no software installable to the Tv to run the camera--unless you fed video to the TV from a laptop or PC, with software installed. The camera's USB will plug-in to the TV, but is not intended for a camera.
Yes. It's fully adjustable to fit most any monitor.
Yes
64 bit
Nope
It has 250GB HD.
no it was not charging it was not compatible
Yes, I'm using my Seagate 1TB External Portable Hard Drive with this media player. It will power the HD just fine.
Would say it's better for running through out the car because it's flexibility but only consurn would be the heat resistance on the plastic coating to get hot and crack from the direct motor temp maybe if you put a heat garment around it should be good
have a harmony remote denon amp works flawlessly from logitech remote....
Yes
I like it quite a bit. It's adorable. I have mine wall-mounted and I can comfortably see it from anywhere in my room (master bedroom, quite large). The color is good and the sound is as well. I only use it for Roku, but I've not had any problems.
Yes. My son has a Wii system and Xbox. We also have his blue ray hooked up as well. This TV was a great buy.
The dock i have is adjustable to accommodate the battery (and i guess different sized computers). Can't find a model number, but battery adds about 3/4 of an inch to the depth of the computer.
I would imagine so. I think all the k60's take the same battery. A lot of companies will add a letter to the model when they make a soft variation. Another battery type would typically mean a different model altogether.
The battery should be compatible. K60 and K601 are the same model. Seems that the 1 was left off.
Tom, Mine came from Amazon and had the docking station included in the box. Not sure on your question. I am not that pleased with the docking station in any event.
No
Yes it does.
Yes anything with a 3.5mm plug.
No they are not wireless
You can skip the current track back or forward. You can also fast-forward through the current track. And it will answer your iPhone calls with a click of the button, and then resume whatever you were listening to automatically when the call ends.
this card should no issues using a PCIE 1.0 slot. all video cards are backward capable. this is a single slot wide card and using very little power. it runs off the PCIE slots power only and is a short length card.
It will run it with no problem.
No, there is no ac jack.
Yes this Chromebook will work with a wireless mouse.
I have not placed books on the Zen. I do not know if it maintains a location on the data or not. Sorry! Not much help on the books. I use it for music and read books. No batteries on the books and the soothing music from the Zen sets the stage for hours of focused reading.
If I were you I would send it back and buy a different model. The one I had was a piece of crap. I threw it out.
I have not needed to look for a sleep mode. There is some system documentation stored on the memory of the device, and I'm sure the website referenced in the documentation that came with the player should either have that information or a Q&A option.
I couldn't figure it out. The touch screen is also so sensitive that it's too easy to lose your place. I returned the one I bought and ended up with Sansa Clip which has easy to operate FF, reverse, etc. controls.
This would probably work with a Kindle 7 inch. You charge it, then plug the little jack into the tablet. The sound is good enough for me. It is not a Bose system, but it makes it so I can hear my You Tube pretty well.
yes this is a great pair of speakers for the money
These are really cheap. I returned the ones I bought for my school. We bought these: Professional 72-inch TRIPOD FOR All Canon Sony, Nikon, Samsung, Panasonic, Olympus, Kodak, Fuji, Cameras And Camcorders + BP MicroFiber Cleaning Cloth https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ONSZPI/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_xyOhvb1FF1FZA https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ONSZPI/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_xyOhvb1FF1FZA
That is the collapsed height. It easily fits into my bag. Of course there is a shoulder strap on the carrying case.
It only works on keyboards connected to a USB port, so of you have a keyboard connected to the labtop via a USB or one of those labtop station things with a USB keyboard then yes.
Yes.
Did you try typing "vmp" as instructed in the instructions?
Yes
very nice to use this item! very very fine with youtube. if you already have other external accessories such as keyboard or mouse, one external driver. this is very good.
Yes, but it is limited to whatever apps Vizio partners with. All the basics are here like Netflix, Hulu, amazon, Facebook, Twitter, I heart radio, local news. The tv is fantastic I just bought a Roku 3 for 99 bucks to compliment my tv in our bedroom because of the lack of updates from Vizio. Hope this helps ;)
You can get DLP type but they do not work well in day light, they are however supposed to be the best for that type of TV. I have the other type, I do believe IR, here is a link to the ones I bought, they work great, good luck. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0088R95X0/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Not sure Clifford. I have a Sportster 5 I believe.

The actual LEDs are about 11.5 inches vertically, so the gel could be rested on the lights (no heat) and taped, or simply be left loose. The horizontal measurement is about half that, so there is no problem at all side to side.
3 Years on the Unit. $100,000 connected equipment protection. You go on-line to register and you are even eligible for a drawing (I guess, I didn't win). You can go here and scroll down for the warranty on the unit (if Amazon will let me put it here). Basically go to Tripplite Com and search this model ECO 850LCD and then the specifications tab (scroll down a bit) http://www.tripplite.com/en/products/model.cfm?txtModelID=4862

I believe that one of the reasons this monitor is lower in price is that it badly needs calibration upon arrival. I spent about an hour and a half calibrating it to match what you are asking. So, the answer is yes, but not without some effort in calibration. Some of the calibration I was able to do with the monitor itself, but the rest I had to do with my video card to compensate. After being calibrated, however, it has performed perfectly.
There is no software. Its plug and play. You can use window OS to burn to and read your non-movie blu-rays. If you are talking about a Blu-Ray ripper software for movies, make sure it can remove/handle the security stuff otherwise it won't copy it and you could have playing problems if your monitor doesn't support security stuff.
Almost all blu-ray discs are encrypted and therefore you will need software that can decrypt the disc such as DVDFab blu-ray copy. I have found that the most economical blank blu-ray discs are called ,"Optical Quantum". I believe Amazon carries them. no. Blu-ray is 25Gb and 50Gb in size, most Blu-ray is 50 Gb. DVD is 4.7Gb so you can't fit Blu-ray on a DVD disc.
I would not use them on my 3-4 month old baby. We used them on our 4 year old and they were a little big for her. I would think that they would not seal correctly on ears of your 3-4 month old.
Package states that it conforms to UL Std #1363 and certified to CSA Std. C22.2 #21, whatever that means.
Sorry i missed the part that you need to buy a convertor to USB since IPAD has to USB port
USB 2.0
the clear plastic part of the case is some what flexible. You can use "push" buttons but if you need to "turn" anything you are going to be out of luck. all I did was turn the camera on and off and push the shutter button so I didn't have a problem.
You will probably have to adapt it with a file, its soft and shapes easily. Thats what i did.
I wouldn't recommend this to work at all. Ruined my camera even though it was designed to work. Was not water tight. Leaked about an inch worth of water into the case the first few minutes of use at a depth of only about one foot.
Yes
Yes
I think it would work. My only concern is whether or not the bracket that mounts to the tv would be bigger than the tv and would be visible on the edges.. It's a great mount..
I put 1 on a satellite Dish bracket ,whatever that is ( 1.25" )?????? & 1 on .75" pipe!!!!!!!!
I'm using this board right now and it's pretty good. I would say any nvidia gtx hight than 600. It might be old but it performs great. Just be very gentle when installing it.
Yes, they can be removed and reconfigured. They are basically a rubber "funnel" that is stretched over the ear bud.
You cannot justify a $170 price for this mouse. When I purchased it a couple years ago, it was only $30-$40.
iPads do not have a cursor so i do not believe that it will work.
I thought the reception was pretty good with rabbit ears (in the city), though some shifting and orienting may be necessary for particular channels. No A/D (analogue to digital, I assume) converter was needed, and so never tested.
The DMc G2 use to have a mic jack. The DMC G3 does not. Not even the newest G6 cameras have a mic socket. It has a build in stereo mic on the top of the camera. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoLEOLYYhMc. I went and looked at my DMC GX1 and it has a stereo mic on top but no mic jack. I did find a mic socket on the GH2, GH3 and GH4 cameras.
Indeed! That is the exact same model Macbook that I have, and it works great.
Dato -- Like Barb, I had help from an Apple expert. To be on the safe side, I'd look on the Amazon site for Microsoft compatible memory sets and use them.
Running Yosemite on it now - no issues whatsoever. It's a clean install of the OS though, rather than an upgrade. That seems to make a difference in general, and upgrading to Yosemite tends to be glitchy. RAM has performed just fine.
You need a spare "video out" from somewhere to make it work (the typical yellow, red and white rca plug combination). Either from the cable box, or maybe if you have a surround sound system it could have more than one output. I guess if your tv has a video out block that would work, though I don't think that's typical to have that.

It's all depend about the transmitter not the receiver so whatever how many receivers u have they are all will watch tha same channel that the transmitter send it to them
It works fine. I just hooked up a USB hard drive to my Acer Chromebook and it can navigate all the files and folders. I played an MP4 video file and an MP3 video file which both opened in the Media Player app. I've read it will play anything that Flash / Chrome will play. I don't think it will play offline avi's but I'm not sure.
Yes, you can. Chrome has a Kindle App available which will make it easier. Just go to the app store from the browser. Make sure to buy your Chromebook through Amazon since Acer's customer service is less than stellar and if you need to return it Amazon handles things better. Hope that helps.
yes, in picassa i. e.
Yes
According to my 13 year old gamer son who we bought this computer for, though he does not play guild wars, he checked into it and believes it is capable of playing on this computer. He is a minecrafter and does experience some occasional lag but it does fine otherwise. It's been a good gaming computer for the price.
Yes it came the power, monitor, keyboard and mouse cord. I had to supply the network high-speed cord and the sound cord came with the speaker sytem. Had it set-up in ten minutes and working. My wife loves it.
Hi, Yes we install a USB WIFI. Please make sure on checkout your getting the item from RECIRCUIT. Any questions contact us at 844-889-1070
I looked up the SIE2 and am sure that they will fit just fine.
Just used as headphones, wont work for conversation no microphone, can work with any music device or phone able to play music, I use mine with the I4S as well as on my computer or laptop when needed. They are just noise cancelling earbuds.
If the lens accepts screw on filters it will work.
What voltage is the battery pack. This device is designed for 250V AC. Melted contacts are a sign of over current through the conductors. The. Fuse may be to large for this device.
Yes
Hello Dorothy, We only sell this model in Blue unfortunately. However, we have this other Kodak camera in red:
I'm not sure, but kodak should be able to anser that question.
No, it does not go with any of the Kodak printer docks.
I am running a 2200 watt amp at 4 ohm load, and I haven't had the least amount of a problem. I did a ton of research before I bought this kit, and the only thing that I would suggest is that if the amp you are hooking up has fuse of 80 or above to go to their 0 gauge kit, otherwise, you will be fine. You won't find a nicer kit than this! Worth every penny and superfast shipping
I got it out of the box and couldn't get it to hold a charge. Perhaps it was just a bad battery but I sent it back I wouldn't recommend a Veho product as such. Buyer beware it may not work.
Don't think so - I looked at the back of mine and there are no holes for mounting brackets. The screen is very thin and is permanently attached to the base, which has all the electronics and connectors, so even if you could just clamp the monitor to a bracket, the base would be hanging below it.
Mine did not, it is great and work great. Have had no trouble at all.
Its adjustable
Yes it is if you use the included adapter. I have the Sony Nex 5R and it works just fine. Keep in mind that it is manual focus though.
Most certainly. They are so good, I bought 2 sets and have used them regularly for over a year now.
Yes, the ET 50 series television if an RF (Radio Frequency) based 3D television. You need RF glasses for this model. Thanks, Steve McArthur Dimensional Optics Thanks, Steve
The kit worked really well for me. The TV works like new. I haven't had any problems since I replaced everything. So not sure if its underated or not. Seems to be fine.
No, they come in a package, very well marked and the solder is easy I have never done any circuit board repair, but get the solder tool and it will be easy. Getting the back of tv turned out to be the hardest part. Well worth it to have a operating tv back!!
It does with my new iPad 3rd gen - carefully! Hold it landscape position, main button on your left, slide it fully down under the lower corner cleats, then snap the two upper corners. It is so close that I had wondered if a careful hair dryer heating might be necessary, but it holds!
i can monitor it on my iphone and my windows pc, so my guess would be yes. But call them, they are very helpful.
Sorry, I don't know. I used Linux with this. I would imagine that it would have support for Netflix & YouTube.
Probably, but don't expect full speed.
No you can't. Because it only takes one you can not program two on the same Playstation
I believe it does
Cardboard back board.
If I remember right it came with a 3 Lnb and I purchased a 5 Lnb
Yes, I used the D12 with this dish at the end of last year. The system setup menu will help you fine tune dish positioning. It worked fine.
Yes.you only need the glasses and activate the 3d sbs in the projector menu.
Using an xbox 360 I have seen no lag. It gives a wonderful crisp image. I have mine set at 720 on gaming mode with a throw of 100 inches and my son's love to game on it.
Yes

If you are looking to charge, I'd use: http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-ACP-12U-Travel-Charger-7250i/dp/B000K27I8U/ref=pd_bxgy_hi_img_y/176-4941025-4947366 I ordered this USB specifically for my laptop cooler. Huge warning: It took me a very long time to get this cable....almost a month!
Yes
When my internet goes out, the connection gets lost and I get sn error message until it comes back online.
apparently it has no harddrive. You can easily purchase an SATA harddrive and it will work though. Search on Amazon for SATA harddrive you wont need a big drive I got a 320gb and works fine, more then plenty of space for tons of video 24/7
Yes you can add 4(four) more cameras to a eight channel system. Also you can connect the video out from one DVR to camera input and add more channel.
I use "IPCamViewer" for my mobile. There is a free version, or you can get the premium for four bucks.
Yes, works for me.
to add books lately i have had to go through "Adobe Digital Edition" as my source to tranfer the book to my kobo reader..and then works fine..this is definitely true when I download a library book to my Kobo.
The surface of the sliding touch pad is hard plastic. Also has a slight depression to the mouse pad area.
I live in Costa Rica and it works here.
"A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment." (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_address.) Think of it as a SS# or DL# for your Zoom router. It is often printed on the label on the bottom of the device or should be listed in the router admin panel. It is not something that can be changed on most devices. I can't offer you any useful advise on your problem. Good luck with that.
Yes, you can. The quality of the unit is fair.
I bought one and I couldn't get on more then one item at a time, Cradlepoint is the only system I have found that works with Verizon usb
i will check this . because yes it is listed as free shipping
Probably not soon. Samsung is notoriously slow with their updates. Also, I would assume they'd push out their TouchWiz update (which is not out yet) before a 3.2 update so I would expect it to be a while... Pure speculation though.
Putting ANYTHING electronic into a freezer for 10 minutes will leave you with a rather expensive frozen piece of electronics. The oil slick ring is a chronic problem with the Galaxy Tab. Replacement will be the only option for you, unless you can live with that ring.
I wonder about this too and will not purchase until I find out.
YES,
It does not come with a GPS downloaded, but im sure you can find one in one of the app stores.
Yes, they are actual physical buttons and respond to a light touch with a distinctive click feel and sound. The center strip itself has 3 buttons in it plus horizontal and vertical swiping for page navigation. Altogether it has a total of 5 buttons that can be custom programmed with the Microsoft software. A terrific mouse with the best battery life of any of the many mouses I have owned.
They are all physical. Left, right, middle clicks will be felt.
I know this works with a regular pavilion g7 just fine.
It is alwsys better to use a heavier guage wire for any application you encounter. As far as this speaker - it will work on standard guage for speakers - I made sure I picked one better than standard.
Works great on my Nokia 920 Windows Phone running ODB Auto Doctor, which has a great feature to send an email with the codes and descriptions right to my Mechanic - very satisfied with both.
Who cares even. Nothing contained lead any longer. Besides it is covered in a thick cloth covering. Will you or your dog be chewing on the holder. If not then don'the worry....
no and no, all included - well its not a bullet per say but the AP, POE, and Grid are all together in this unit.
out side looking at the router, my house is 250 ft from garage with steel walls and it works fine.
Headphones will work and mic will work but no volume controls or skip/repeat track or increase/decrease volume -- those will only work w iPhone
Yes it rings through the unit and the music will mute
I have used one placed in a small aquarium for over a year, to recirculate water to a small hydroponic garden.
Yes
Yes
I do not know, I have had mine for a couple of years (and it works great), but Amazon instant video was not around then. I may try it and see. It looks like you need to be a Prime member, which I am not. I tried it anyway and it said that I could buy the movie for a couple of bucks, so I would say that it does work with AIV
The highest upgrade available is Android 4.0.3, which is Ice Cream Sandwich.
I am not sure what you mean joint?
The Wasabi battery works perfectly well in my LX7k. It holds charge as well as the panasonic and it also sows bars indicating the level of charge. As to service life, I have yet to have one die (over two years service). Earlier models of the Wasabi did not indicate battery level in my LX7, but the recently bought ones do. I now have 5. (I'm a heavy video shooter.) Hope this helps.
no
Arduino boards use Atmel processors. AMD does not make a functional equivalent of those chips that I can find. You will need an AMD development board or one of your own design and an IDE with the requisite files defining AMD chips.
The board is counterfeit of the Arduino Uno. I'm sure it works just as fine though....I hope. I just got mine today.
Im sure the battery pack is replaceable, if u take it apart. The crank broke on mine the second time i used it.
update -- i just read the prior answer -- important!!!! the prior respondent said the output on his charger said 6vdc. if that is correct my response is incorrect...and output of 12vdc will indeed harm the batteries. don't use 12vdc output charger.
Go here: http://www.fischl.de/usbasp/ OR go here: http://hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__27990__USBasp_AVR_Programming_Device_for_ATMEL_proccessors.html?strSearch=usbasp Scroll down to where you see FILES tab, click on it and the top choice is the Windows driver.
its driver specific
Yes. There were 3 fans already installed in the case. One in the back top (small), one in the front bottom (large) and another on the top (large). The one on top actually has room for another one beside it, but with those three plus my cpu fan I didn't bother.
All of it. Use them with an LGe phone daily
Shot answer is yes. I use it to burn Blu-Rays of our vacation. I've been very happy with it. My only complaint is the on/off switch is in the back. I recommend this burner.
it takes 4 D batteries.
It says Ipod/iphone...I haven't had a chance to check yet..
It looks like it will work for moving photos but do not belive it will work for charging . Good Luck this cable works on a lot of the sony cyber-shot models
It is surpose to be able to but use a DC BatteryCharger + Data Sync Cable cord forSony CyberShot DSC-TX-20 L TX20 from Ebay seller myw-tech at around $5.77 its a 2.0 PC High Speed Data/Lead Cable Good Luck
An active speaker system means that the power to run the speakers is built into the speakers. You don't need a separate amplifier. And by the way, the M-audio speakers are a great choice. Everyone that hears mine comments about how great they sound.
Yes it does. No problems. It is the right voltage and the right connector. Hope that helps.
But they should work alright when you first get them. Make sure you have the speaker wire leads in properly. if that doesn't work and take the RCA plug remove it and then bend the little clips in a little bit,and then stick the RCA plug back on
No. There is a red and white RCA-to-Mini (3.5mm) cable to connect master speaker to your PC, and then a black-and-red speaker wire to run from the master speaker to the slave. Hope this helps.
I don't know, in feet and inches, but it can tell you it was long enough to install it in my SUV.
Flat 3 pin connector
From what Amazon has supplied on their website, I found that this will fit the Neewer TT560 Flash, 3.9 x 3.2 x 8.7 inches ; 1.1 pounds. Your Neewer TT680 has the dimensions of 8.9 x 3.9 x 3.2 inches ; 1.2 pounds. So it looks like it will fit but I'm just deducing from what given. Hope this helps!
Works with anything that has a tripod mount. Can handle pretty heavy lenses on a dSLR so I imagine it wouldn't be a problem for most camcorders.
Hi,you will need to go to Get My Electronics.com and buy a RF antenna adapter. There is a place for the adapter on the TV and then you will be all set to use any antenna you want.Jan
No sorry, It is not gold connections. they are standard metal.
It sure will. I have the same printer and it fits perfectly.
I honestly don't know. I have the HP 8500 & 6500 series and both covers fit very nicely.
I would guess that would depend on exactly what type of pictures that you want. I find that my 18/55 has become my go-to lens for a lot of my photographic shooting because my teacher wants us to "get close, close, close". Another weapon in the arsenal couldn't hurt.
I know that this was recommended by ATT when I did not want to buy one from them!
Thank you for your inquiry. In regards to your question, yes, this is compatible with the Sony A550. If you have any additional questions or concerns please feel free to contact us directly at 800-991-3350.
Hi I had the 10' tabloid and it fit perfectly fine. I believe there is a case for the 9' tabloid
Browse Amazin.con
I don't want to overshoot the size but I can see it here in front of me and with the adjustment brackets you can likely spread it a good 3 1/2 inches open to do the clamping for the mount.
The arms are held in place by a clamp with a large screw. The clamps can be loosened and the arms moved up and down so either arm can be taken off the pole or placed anywhere on the pole.
The $100 is good for a year unless you use your money up on calls. The advantage to this card is, if you don't make a lot of calls and have money on your card when your year is up you can renew and the balance will go over to the next year so the money will acumulate.
I never received this order.
One year of talking/texting .
Hello,friend&#65292; Thanks for your message. we have right one ,you can see if it's you need:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00990OQRU waiting your reply If you have any question,please contact us freely We will try ours best to make you satisfied Best regards kath
You have to ensure the internal battery is charged or ensure that you have a good connection to the vehicle power source. If you have the USB connector you can charge it that way, although I never have been able to operate solely on the battery for any length of time.
yes
I'm sorry I can't help you, I didn't buy it for myself. I brought it for a friend and that was as far as my involvement went.
One of the.speaker cover screens busted out on the freeway from a bump also My left channal stoped working aftrr a month or.so but hey you get what u pay for not really worth.the 60 tho buy some thing nicer unless you dont care if.its janky
It will depend on the application you are using. Netflix and Hulu should give you audio and video, but I know Hbo go does not support video out. What app are you using?
It works perfectly with my iPad. I have an iPod touch and would need to try out and let you know. I will try to check this evening.
Not that long about 3 feet
I'm not sure
Sorry--I meant it has an aux IN. Apologies.
The plug in the back is used for input from another source, to use your player as speakers. You would normally use a wire with a male plug on each end so you can plug one end into (music/sound) source and the other end into the (AUX IN) of your player. There is no outlet on your unit for headphones or (AUX OUT.)
The paperwork we received stated it would hold 125 lbs. We have 4 year old 52" 85 lb tv on this mount and its been on it for five months and we love it. The instructions only included mounting for concrete walls but we mounted in drywall with oak support plates screwed into studs,
mine is already mounted, so I extended the arm and measured. The arm is 16", the base extends 1", and the arms are 3" apart. So 16+16+1+1+3=37". I would say there could be some variance in manufacture of =/- 1" but even so I'd think it would work. You could use some wood blocking behind the mounting bases and use longer lag bolts. Like the other reviewers state it is best to buy better/ longer lag bolts from the hardware store, cause the ones included are not the best. Hope this helps!
Sorry I have not
I would think so. It's not a tight fit at all on my lap top.
Sure, its only a case just like any other brand.
About two years old. Many quality issues reported with this device--ours died within a week. I would not recommend it.
Yes I have one and use it with external speakers and it stays the same volume as it was when I turn it off. My wife and I use it all the time on back deck and camping great radio. -mp3
I cant measure it but I can tell you it blows my samsung surround system oyt of the water. I bought them at the same time and never used the passive bass that came with it. This sub has never been overloaded, never let me down. Rattles the windows. I have never turned it up over half volume. It thumps!
None what so ever very nice bass!
I don't have an arrow on mine, but the arrow on cables should point to the monitor.
Cut it should be alright
Yes this is a price for a pair.
Each sub is 400w rms 1200 peak
No the speakers are svc/single voice coil. They get hot and smell like they are burning, good subs but I would recommend save your money and buy a speaker that cost over 100. You pay for quality.
I have the mini and it doesn't seem to charge fast on anything, especially comparing it to my phone. I like the fact that I can charge my iPad, kindle and phone all at once though! Hope this helps!
No there are 2 cables, one optical and one HDMI
Hello, The unit comes with the Logitech address that will download all the software needed to run . Thank you
Get info from manufacturer website
It should. Definitely runs fine with my 2010 MacBook Pro, running OS X 10.9.2. I use it for Skype when I use my Mac in "lid-closed" mode, tucked on a little shelf under my desk and attached to an external monitor. Both the mic and camera in the webcam work fine for me. If I remember correctly, it just worked right away - didn't need to install any drivers.
This is a good computer for the price. I watched alot of youtube on here with no problem.
No. It is only a Walkman with a pre-set tuning feature and a weather band. Worth getting for the pre-set alone, and the sound and reception (at least from where I live) are great. Highly recommended.
Mine did. I Think it might depend on the seller. I bought mine from someone in Japan. It did not come with the English manual, but the adapter was american. The manual I could get from the internet.
Yes the ring this comes with allows you to attached the wide angle lens to just about any lens I've used it on three different lenses just by putting on the right sized ring adaptor hope this helps
Bought for my daughter and she says you can plug it into an outlet.
yes.
YES!!
Hello I can please contact me at carparts777@ymail.com
I run in the rain with mine and so far no issues, my current pair is over year old. I sweat in them daily.
Radio shack or Walmart
NO. Your filter ring is 49mm. This rig is 52mm
It is very good. I am an investor and I use a lot of charts.
Honestly, I don't remember. I bought it awhile back. I think it comes with the charger but you have to buy the extension cable.
I don't know, I( tried to use it on Mac, and didnot work it did work on windows. i think it would stop if the light goes out. sorry i could not give u the ansewer u are looking for.
Your cable channels and your internet package literally have nothing to do with one another. This is for cable internet, nothing to do with cable television. So yes, it will work, as long as you actually have an internet package with them.
the usb cord is included :-)
Yes
yes
Not totally sure. The camera shape is the same but I dont know if the buttons are located in the same places.
Here's what you are looking for, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CQRP5CI Amazon doesn't allow us to include links to our other products... don't know why...
it folds up to about a 3 ft circle.
Soooo....I can't answer this specific question....what I can say is you are better off buying a good underwater camera. I want to love this mask.....but I don't...hard to use..impossible to check while using...buy a good camera. You will be far more satisfied.
This should work just fine. If the player has a earphone jack it does the same as a phone. It works well too... I would recommend it. I love mine.
Yes
I have heard some sets have bugs...I bought this set on Black friday and working flawlessly...none of the problems people mention. I would talk to Amazon....get a new set if its not too old...they are awesome for returns...so easy...I would check about replacing because things could get worse on that set you have....hope that helps!
Really I don't know. But I am impressed cuz it works in a Samsung captivate and samsung s3. So I guess it can work in the Samsung Infuse
Yes , it will work. As long as you have Bluetooth and pdf, it works perfectly!
oh no no, that's fancy! never heard of one that needs body heat. no this definitely doesn't need body heat it's just a normal stylus.
I don't see why not.
Yes
Don't buy this unit it is known to malfunction after a good amount of use
Yes. About a 6" cable. I wanted a longer cable to give me more flexibility to move around with it.
Yes. I have it formatted Half for my Mac and half for my PC. The Mac can see both partitions, but the PC can only see the NTFS partition.
Does not streach too much,just a little.
What I bought was 1" in diameter.
Yes it will come with your codes. Even if you buy it second hand you can go online to get a list of the codes for all makes of tvs if doesn't come with the list.
Installed on my 15-inch early 2011 Macbook Pro few months ago. Everything fit just fine and no compatibility issues. Routinely read and burn DVDs without issue. Good replacement.
Nook Glowlight takes microSD or microSDHC memory cards, so they probably will take the N2A cards to make it boot up as an Android tablet.
Yes it does.
The sound may be uneven with one speaker positioned differently, but I see no reason why both couldn't be on their side. Frankly, it might not even matter. When using them the sound is very uniform when they are spread with the listener in the center. Great, crisp speakers unless you want booming bass.
It could be done, but there are far better scanners for scanning books. It's great for small things like business cards or a small image on a page, but not whole pages. As l said it could be done, but you would go insane.
Yes it comes with all the software required
Theres' not enough memory in the scanner to scan much over an 8.5 x 11 page. I tried scanning a larger music book page and it had problems. I never did get a good scan, so I doubt it will do a full newspaper page. Disappointing, I know.
It works with any product that uses a USB cord to charge. It's great!
No. They are just the normal multimedia combo keys (Fn+F Keys) not programmable.
Does it have a USB port? Then most likely will, not a MAC user, but USB=USB, I think.
You'll need a single extension cable that has both power and an RCA jack. The power plugs into the red power input on the mic and the RCA jack to the RCA connection (female) on the mic. Other end of the extension cable goes into your DVR audio input (RCA likely) and to your wall plug power unit. These cables are available at most electronic stores or online.
Hi Phil. All you have to do is either call the seller you got the protector from or you can call Armorsuit directly. If you have your Amazon order number handy, either place will want it for reference. If you don't have it, I'm sure they can locate it for you. The seller will ship you just the protector and solution bottle (no cloth). The seller will just alert ArmorSuit that they are doing this per the lifetime warranty. I'd just contact ArmorSuit directly and save the time. Hope that helps!
No, it's switch box and you can only veiw one monitor at a time
yes - it will work with your fridge if it has an Ethernet port on it. That said, I have junked mine as I find it too unreliable
The relay is working great on our Kenmore Fridge Model # 106 74252400.......very close if not an exact fit
If I remember correctly, you can't (I don't have the unit anymore). I think that all you can do is transfer data. Here's the URL for the Samsung page and your model. You can download the manual.
Yes, being an internet capable player, it does have the Cinavia protection.
Sorry but not Wifi compatible as far as I can see you may try with a USB wifi stick but our would have to do a firmware update to get this feature it is a very basic blu-ray hope this helps you
Yes, its exactly what I purchased it for.
I tried a wireless Logitech keyboard with my Xbox 360 and my Xbox One and it didn't work with either. Make sure before you answer a question you know what you're talking about. "It should work" doesn't mean anything. This is very simple: Yes or No or DON'T ANSWER AND WASTE PEOPLE'S TIME!
As long as you have an available USB slot. I have 2 of these, one on a windows 7 machine and another running 8.1.
I believe I installed it right to my ps3 and it worked great. Any formatting was done by the ps3.
Yes
Yes It's for any kind of laptop. I bought it for a PS3 though
They are compatible with all of wacom's standard pens.
I don't know for sure but I suspect not. The camera adapter kit is designed for optical instruments with a provision for interchangeable eyepieces with a 1-1/4" diameter barrel. If the eyepiece for the Bushnell spotting scope is an integral part of the scope, a screw thread or a diameter other than 1-1/4" diameter then this adapter kit will not work.
Yes
Any support program from Garmin that is designed to run on a 32-bit Windows machine should run fine on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems, as 64-bit systems have a compatibility mode that lets them run programs compiled for 32-bit systems. The program just won't run as efficiently in compatibility mode, but should perform adequately.
Yes it will if u start a track when u start out..
Yes, very easy and works excellent.
there is little margin for this product, but there is discount for bulk order. please contact us and let me know how many are you looking for.
No, it doesn't need anything else. Just plug in the USB and it gets the power from laptop and start working. It also has 2-speed to choose.
Yes it does..
It never worked. I pent money, but I can't use it.
Yes. This is an external hard drive enclosure, it will come with everything you need to use an external hard drive minus the hard drive itself. Which in this case the enclosure comes with a plastic stand to let the hard drive sit on its side on a desk instead of flat, a USB 3.0 cable (completely compatable with a USB 2.0 port, unless you have a new computer you probably have USB 2.0) and an eSATA cable and yes also an power supply cable.
No, it is compatible with other Honeywell family products only.
It's neoprene, great case
Just simply attached the remote to one of your key chain, of course install the batteries to your remote and to your transmitter and you are all set. If you misplaced your keys just press your transmitter and your remote receiver will beep. That's it.
I use the velcro as it is the strongest for holding the receiver on, but it does make it a little bulky.
About 1 1/8" X 2 1/8" X 3/8"
Mount a tablet like an iPad next to your monitor. It attaches to the Ergotron monitor arm.
HDMI carries all information, both video and audio. I run HDMI from 2 sources (cable and Blu-Ray) to the receiver, run HDMI to my TV. No other cables needed, unless you have legacy components, such as a CD player, Tape Deck, VCR, or Turntable that use RCA connectors.
HDMI will deliver A\V
But the unit works properly otherwise, right? Mine did the same thing. I contacted HK Customer service and I was told there is no simple repair and I should return it to the vender, Amazon. After begging for a no cost replacement I ended up getting an account credit but had to come out of pocket with extra money because I did not buy from an Amazon authorized Amazon dealer, whatever the h that means.
Vsx-52
Did you use the remote control?
There are multiple sellers on this product. Mouse over the seller name and it should let you know which state or country that the seller is based in. If the seller is FBA, then it will be shipped from one of Amazon's warehouses in the US.
I don't believe so. Have not tried with the GeForce GT 520 but an older, similar GeForce would not.
I haven't tested it with those games, but I'd imagine you'd be lucky to get 30 fps on low settings with this card. It's not the greatest thing in the world.
Yes, each bottle is 90 gm
Yes
It should. I know it works with in my Samsung Galaxy Prevail and in my Samsung digital camera. It's also adaptable to most of the new smart TV's.
Nope- but it does come in a great case
Yup, no problems!
Hi, the mount is the same. I use an old Konica Minolta that has a shutter release option to allow the shutter to be activated with no lens attached. I don't know if the A35 has that.
Yes !! Everything is ok !!!!
If the lens has a Nikon mount, yes.
I chose a Sony camera with an A-mount and found my 28-200mm lens in a thrift store (the lens came with a 1980's Minolta) REALLY cheap.
Yes
The AC adapter provided (Kingwall model AS300-120-AA250) has an input rating of 100-240V AC @ 50/60Hz, 1.1A. Output is rated 12.0V DC, 2.5A. To use with 220V, one should only need to use a plug adapter, the adapter will automatically switch voltage.
Nope. It did sporadically when I first bought it and now not at all. I bought it mid last year and really have been able to enjoy it. It could have been a bad egg.
This case is one of the best cases you can get for that phone. I am super glad that there is one on Amazon.
Return the AppRadio. You will not enjoy it even if the iPod magically starts working. There are new built-in Apple Play radios on the horizon. Wait. You'll be glad you did. Here's an article about Apple's CarPlay announced 03/04/2014: http://gu.com/p/3n84n
Nope. The battery is for the noise canceling feature. But can't run them without the noise canceling feature on.
These headphones come with a 1-year warranty. I had an intermittent noise problem and called them after about 3 months. The customer service was GREAT. The send me a NEW set and re-set the warranty back to a full 1 year. So, if you have a warranty problem within the 1st year, it is no problem. I've only had this second set for about 6 months and they have been great. No further problems. I can't speak to service after the warranty period.
The Bose QuietComfort 15 headphones are not Bluetooth compatible. They do require an audio cable. There are two cables included when you purchase these; one was designed for audio and the second was designed for Apple iPhones.
This GPS comes with a car charger, that also serves as antenna for the free traffic update feature.
No
Go-to
yes... three lights were included...
Yes--this is a pretty good set--buy some clamps to clamp the green screen to the sides--gets rid of wrinkles
hello, Yes this kit comes with everything you'll need stands, the brackets, light rings and soft boxes. TIP the rods the hold the soft boxes open bend them a little and it'll help with assembly. These are my number one light modifiers and I've taken them everywhere! Hope this helps
There is not indicator, but the power last for so long.. One time charged for two hours will last for about one month or more with 2 hours daily use 5 days a week(not weekends).
Same thing happened to me!
No I have had mine for a year now and there is no wearing of the top of the PB. The case is lined in a flock material, very soft and it "clips" over the edge of the PB. It's definately my first choice of case. I also use the official blackberry zip case to further protect the BP and the Blurex case goes inside with no problems.
No, there is no switch between 120 and 220. It is only 120V.
Most of the time this remote doesn't work at all. They always come broken.
Ckeck http://pcpartpicker.com/ for the right memory
No, not really. The color is bland and even tech support cannot fix it. I have a nice one that I got from Microsoft. I am just going to continue to use that one.
The connection will not support the new IPAD 4th generation Ipad. It has the older style wider connector. I asked the same question at BestBuy if there was an adapter? They said not that they were aware of, you would have to contact the Apple Store for a compatible product. But this product is pretty nice for the price.
I don't see that it has this capability
Yes
When there is adequate light you will see color. In the dark when it has to rely on IR video will appear to be in monochrome. This is the same behavior you will see from any color camera with IR.
yes, it sends email
Mine will Go Green on Alarm maybe every 8 days but does not stay Green. It will only stay Green for one picture out of 5 it emails on Alarm.
The software is just some basic IP WEBCAM Config software. Its straightforward and simple to use. The camera itself will work just fine with any IP Camera software. Its pretty basic and works like a charm.
Yes u will need to add ur own cable. Since this charger is actually made for adroids .
No it did not fit.
No it will not due to the buttons they added to the bottom of the tablet. Sorry:(
Yes! Once you have 2D or 3D GPS lock, latitude/longitude will be recorded in the EXIF. EXIF is conserved for RAW images.
Yes it will, N is the newest technology but these adapters are always made downward compatible. So it will work with B, A, and G networks; along with N.
No
it does, i have one
no, the note must be removed from any cover because it is a tight fit. If the note is not placed right it will loose its balance. hope this helps
I do not know but I would steer clear as it is a really cheap design and is not even a good paperweight. I would sell you the one I bought if you wanted it. I just tried to use it a few times, but my advice is no don't.
The"l675d-7102 model" is not mine, so I do not know if it will fit.
I'm sorry I do not know the answer to that question Lydia, but in any case I wouldn't purchase from this seller. Good luck in finding the correct part that you need.
At the bottom of the slider there are three screw holes ( like on the bottom of a camera ) you can attach it threw either the middle one for one tripod or to the two on each side for a more stable two tripods. I keep a quick release plate on the bottom of my slider so it's faster to set up.
I do not know. sorry
The fan isn't any louder then a normal case fan. Most of noise comes from the hard drives spinning, which can vary from none if using ssds or very loud if using something that is 10k plus.
Is not fit the EasyN ip cameras
M12 as described in the product details under "format". M12 is also mentioned in a couple of the reviews including mine.
This lens only fits the 904 model camera not the 905.
Nope. No sound. Just turns on for a few seconds. The light isn't that bright. I just use it in my walk-in closet so I can get to light switch.
It pulls 2 watts w/ WiFi on. I have one running on a 200 amp/hr battery and 100w solar panel (other things all use this). It runs 24/7 and have had two of these cameras for almost a year with no problems.
Sorry...no zoom. But it does have some other nice features.
All of them works fine.
No
Yes. You get everything as shown.
Sure, you can easily return things on Amazon if they aren't right for you. From the website, you can print out a return label and tape it onto the original shipping carton as long as you keep the box intact.
It should work fine as long as it is asus laptop. Mine is working absolutely fine...
I don't know. I am a computer novice.
Yes
I used the cord once because it became so heated that I unplugged it as soon as I realized that problem, So I will purchase a new from HP just prevent any damage to my laptop and not start a fire.
This is it. This was the third charger I've bought for my HP Touchsmart Tx2 and this one has lasted me longer than the replacement I bought elsewhere for much more. It's been almost two years and this is still in awesome condition for me.
It should
I checked the numbers which can be replaced by this battery and UM08A51 is listed. I ordered it for an Acer One ZG5 and it fits and works fine. Hope this helps. Another person has disagreed so I guess you might consider contacting the vendor. I can only speak from my own experience but I did check my Acer and it is a ZG5.
I wasn't sure so I checked some sites. Yes, they both use the same battery. This is actually the second one I bought. I have two acer laptops. I have had great service from the battery so far. Also, I saw some batteries priced at 50.00 and higher, so for 8 bucks or so, you can't go wrong.
no the one I ordered was for HP G60-120US Notebook PC
Yes
Video driver has to be searched ion the net but yes it works with xp
This is a small size travel mouse and it works very well.
at 1200 rpm 23.5 and at 2200 rpm 38.15 dB(A) Max
I am currently using this card with Windows 8.1 without any issues.
Sorry, I am unable to answer the question.
No. It is made specific for the Garmin 650t.
Amazon?
The long button on the top. It dims it and will turn the light completely off.
Sorry, I can't recall if mine had a camera or not. The tablet was beyond terrible. The customer service provided was even worse. I've bought a Dell X1 and love it. Didn't have to take anything off it. It worked out of the box and has a camera too. Oh yeah.. and it cost 100-200.00 less than the Aspen X1 too. Really, I can't say enough negative about the Azpen. Sorry..
It can connect to an laptop and it also works as an external HD. You can connect it with usb, the same cable as you connect with cameras, or you can connect it with firewire. It can also be charged with the connection of a computer.
Each card is saved under a separate folder.
The largest it can fit is an ATX but smaller should be fine. There are plenty of pre-drilled holes for various sizes. Someone has already done it if you'd like to see: http://hardforum.com/showthread.php?t=1652756
It comes on with the TV once programmed.
Yes. The Zvox control is for changing the different settings for the desired sound coming from the Zvox. We set up the Zvov the first time we used it but only have changed it once in awhile for a movie or sporting event but use the TV remote for everyday use. The ZVox is awesome. Have not had any issues with it and got it through Amazon.
Yes..you can use 6V DC Power Supply for this unit.
It should. I had it on a 40" Samsung and have since moved to a 47" LG without issue. Make sure you're buying the one for the larger TV sizes, though.
Hello, my english is not good jajaja, but i used this lens with a projector nec v260R and v260x and i have great performance, very good product, easy to use And very good asembly, to use with any projector with chip DLP Link 3D ready, beat regards!
Never triedon a pc but I know works on laptops is not very usefull for what I need it for I saw a video on youtube a guy using the card on a laptop look for it.
Yes, it runs on Mountain Lion. I
The X-Rite ColorMunki Display is manufactured in China.
No, micro 4/3 systems only.
Absolutely. This lens has worked on every m4/3 camera that I've shot it on, and I've been shooting it on the OMD EM5 extensively. The only "issue" I've heard from folks is the rattlesnake chatter, which to me is a non issue, and not confined to the EM5. A beautiful lens regardless of which body it's on.
Its a faster lens and a different field of view. Two different lenses. The 25mm focuses faster in dim light. If you're trying to figure out which to buy, first figure out which FOV you prefer. Both are excellent. Also check out the oly 17mm, another fine lens if you are considering the 20mm, but with a slighty wider FOV, and focuses instantly.
I am not 100% sure but here is a link to the user manual. http://www.vivitar.com/files_products/417/DVR_508_Camera_Manual.pdf
it is 2U
So far all the files have worked for me on My drive
The boom is made of four parts, a weight at one end, the boom itself, and two heads. The first Gobo (or Happy) head attaches to a pin on the stand. The non-weighted end has a second head that holds the light.
No, they don't have in-line volume control.
No problem with the cord. Sound is superb. However, the metal post pulled out of one of the earpieces. Put it back with superglue and has been fine.
I think they would be very comfortable.
Like the item broke apart? Got it the first day, tried it, and it broke on me. Maybe it was a defective product but I just returned it.
It can. You have to buy all the mounting pieces seperately as I did(RAM Mount Universal X-Grip Cell Phone Holder with 1-Inch Ball, RAM Mounts RAM Composite Short Double Socket Arm for 1in. Ball Bases RAP-B-201U-A, & RAM Mounts RAM-B-238 RAM 2.43" x 1.31" Diamond Base with 1" Ball) Instead of the Diamond Base, you have to buy the RAM Mount Zinc Coated U-Bolt Base w/1" Ball so you can mount it on the handle bars.
I used the NanoBridge so that I could use my Mom's internet at my place about 2 miles away. Of course, the line-of-sight path must be clear of obstructions.
I am guessing not more than five pounds. Still have not used mine yet as when we set it up one of the radios was bad and by the time I received the new one I no longer needed Internet out to my guest house as my guest had already moved out.
Supongo que si, al menos que all exista alguna ley que regule el uso de las frecuencias por encima de los 5GHz.
I don't know for sure. It doesn't work with any computers that ask for signal converter.
Yeas, that's what I use it with
If I remember from when I did mine, there are some screws that attach the SSD to the mounting tray. With HDDs it's a simple snap-in into the mounting tray. I have an SSD in mine, and I remember it being fairly simple.
Yes it will work with ATX Main Board..I can say the same for the Graphics Card?
Rev 3.0 has a full UEFI BIOS while prior revision have Hybrid EFI. EFI allows the use of drives larger than 2.2TB, but I am having problems installing Windows 7 64-bit to a 4TB drive as a boot drive. I can't even partition it to only 1TB and get Windows to install/boot. So if you are booting from a drive 2TB or less you will be fine. Anything larger and you want to get a UEFI board instead.
If you are using a corsair/silverstone/thermaltake 650... sure you have enough power.
It needs an external AC supply. It comes with one.
I cant vouch for the performance of the ST-E2.. but the YN works with no complaint. Plain and simple it works
If your touchpad charges with a usb cable this will work. It provides the standard 5 volts that all usb devices use, and it has enough amps to charge any tablet on the market. Not only that but it provides much cleaner voltage than many of the cheap usb chargers.
Yes... I ordered my charger last week and it arrived early. plugged it into my touchpad and it instantly charged it right up
I think so. Thats what I told Amazon and the dealer that sold it to me. I went through proper Amazon protocol and got my money refunded - they were prompt. I just ordered the go pro 1 at only $30 more than I paid for looxcie.
Yes it does, works good as a bluetooth headset aswell!
I can't say it is night vision. But it works very well in low light environment and the out come color tends to be green.
The mobo supports AM3+ socket processors and the A10 is a FM2 socket so they aren't compatible. If you want this mobo than go with FX CPU with discreet graphics. I chose this setup with a radeon hd7870 and I love it. Works great for me with amazing power and didn't cost nearly as much as I could have spent.
Slide the on/off switch to the "off" position. Flip the keyboard so that the batteries would be facing toward you. Then, with the keyboard keys facing away from you, you should slide the battery housing panel to the left. It's not the easiest or most intuitive thing ever, so it might take a couple of tries to figure out if you're doing it right.
"HP TouchPad" is the name of the tablet device that the keyboard is named after.
works on my Nexus 4 so assume it will for Nexus 7
you need to upgrade your intel firmware first. It should be working fine.
This fits the HP TouchPad from 2011. It is custom fit specifically for that tablet, and is not likely to fit anything else.
Unfortunately I only have one touch pad cover and I don't ship internationally.
I honestly dont know which version the board is but I do know that it performs extremely well, I myself have the UD7 in my system and my wife and two kids have the UD5 in theirs and all of them perform really well, combine that with the 965 phenom black processor and its a pretty sweet setup
2 cards will both be 16X. If you add a 3rd card it's 8X.
Yes, it does, thank you!
Yes. I used it on mine. Perfect fit.
This would not fit a Retina A1398. It did work very well on my A1286 15" MacBook Pro.
packaged very well in a Styrofoam box approximately 2.5 inches (6.35cm) x 11.5 inches (29.21cm) x 9.5 inches (24.13cm). the inside of the box is cut out to fit the digitizer exactly so it was not only protected on all sides, but fit snugly without moving during shipping. Oh! and the digitizer itself was also inside a sleeve of bubble wrap. it also came with the pre-cut double sided tape
I assume so but I can not say for sure. Sorry.
You can just pull it out to remove it. I think there is a tab you can pull as well. I don't sell SSD drives. I'm just a customer of the chassis and it worked for me.
the truck body may be a little long. the sensor wires are about 6-7feet long and the module needs to be wired to the reverse light circuit power wire. the power supply wire that was sent with the kit was only about 30 inches, so I ran another power wire to extend it and just screwed a self tapping screw into the interior body for the ground wire(black)
Yes William it does it s ok on plastic or fiberglass at slow speed not on steel good luck . Mike
Yes, I used a spray can and painted mine to match the color of my car.
looks to be about 3ft
If the neoprene case is thin, I think it would fit. I carry my 15" MacBook in it with about an inch on each side to spare and 3+ inches in height to spare. I'd go for it...worst that can happen is you have to return it. but I seriously doubt you will have to. I LOVE this backpack, I really do. I've had a few backpacks and this is one is a leap ahead of those, well-designed, lots of storage, looks good, comfortable, a joy to use.
Yeah, don't see why not.
Not sure to be honest. I have only played 1 US DVD (from library) but all our DVDs from the UK worked perfectly. Sorry I can't be more help. Might find out after renting more DVDs in the US.
Each new pair comes with a cable. It is a standard USB micro Type B and can be purchased any where online, like Amazon.com or Monoprice.com. If you need it right now, most big box stores, like Walmart, Target, Best Buy and Radio Shack will have them also at a much higher price. Hope this helps.
As far as I know the strap can be used with all of the Modulr covers. You can check on the modulr website. I've had 2 different covers and it has worked for both
It depends where the "plugs" are. My daughter hated it because she couldn't control the volume so she would take it off. We ended up getting the survivor case.
Yes! When you take videos you can see a teensy bit of the blue frame on the edge when you watch it back. You can't see the blue in pictures though.
I am not sure, but be careful. These units are sometimes shipped with accessory cords other than the one specified. In my case, I had to purchase the correct cord separately.
Yes, work with canon 5d.
It is 6.8, but none of the 2 batteries that I have hold a candle to the Sony one. The real Sony ones lasts for days and the other 2 I have don't hold well at all.
It records noise, but I wouldn't call it "audio."
motion must be detected for the camera to record the motion.
There is an indicator light on the front that comes on when recording. I put black electrical tape over it so it is not seen.
yes you can charge it by plugging into a computer
This device works only with SD Card. However, I recommend dontbuy this camera. Only worked one month. The, the screen turn black and doesnt work
The drive is just to transport information tho your device. You should be able to print from your iPad screen as a web page our screen shot
Yes. Motherboard says it supports ddr3 @ 1600 which is what this ram is
I think you can do that. There may be a setting on the DVR you may have to find to flip the image over.
yes this is very nice , clear and night vision camera. and this is 100% whether proof plus working fine in low temperature.
Nick, No the product does not. It would be VERY easy to attach magnets to it. Its very light. Excellent scratch pad!
Everything is not attached except the power cable. The power cable is hard wired in to the back of the control unit.
No, it doesn't but whenever I need to charge it, is easy to take off the case. It came in some sizes so it should fit perfectly if you have a 7th generation iPod. (That's mines)
no it does not.
No it is restricted to certain sites and no videos play
it has wifi. If your house has a modem and a router, then yes it does and yes they can if they're tech savvy. If they don't have a modem and router, you're out of luck. Again, depending on how tech-smart your parents are, they would have set a pass code on the internet access already from the router.
This should hold the ipod touch as it is the same dimensions as an iphone.
Yes and is perfect.
IMGBURN 2.5.8.0.
Yes it is
It should with the versions that use actual Windows 8. It might work with the Windows RS but I have no way of knowing.
It looks just like what you see here and works very well. Sturdy.
The standard quick-release tripod plate works with the B-GRIP. Others are more problematic. I recently bought a MePhoto tripod which uses a different quick-release plate and it is not compatible with B-GRIP. Incidentally I had stopped using my B_GRIP after my camera fell out of it. I don't know why or how it fell out, but I was unwilling to take another chance.
Manual yes. I only got two sata wires. Plus the disk. Simple to install. The only thing that I had to download off the internet is was the drivers for the usb 3.0
For better experience with this mobo i suggest you an AMD video card due the AMD chipset on the motherboard
I use it with both, 80/160GB . . So, yes
Works fine with my 5th gen classic.
Yes, it is a pay as you go process just like any service offered by one of the major carriers. I have a monthly plan with ATT. The cost is dependent on the carrier, their data plans and your needs.
This unit will send audio and video if you only are using no more that 2 cameras and 2 audio feeds. You would use each bnc for either video or audio so a max of 4 total feeds. Hope this helps!
I tested it from all different areas of the room and the playback was fine.
Not likely at all. Unless the Calumet is a rebranded Phottix Strato II, it will not fire or receive signals from those devices.
Yes this set is perfectly compatible, including all TTL auto functions with the Nikon D40 and SB-600 Speedlite.
It's a new back for the iPod, it doesn't just snap on, you have to take it apart to replace.
Do a google search for that. I doubt you can mount a second hard drive in there, but I'm not sure.
No
We are sorry to tell you that we could not ship this to Spain. Sorry to disappoint you. Please accept our unreserved apologies. And if you want this to be shipped to Spain, you may purchase it from UK market. Thank you!
Not really The fabric so thin i've already replaced the bag with vanguest bag
Yes, just make sure to keep the screws from the bracket and reuse them when you put the low profile piece on.
Yes you can. Its backwards compatible
Yes, a very bright one under the colored slider.
Yep! Im using an rMBP..works perfect importing into lightroom.
Mine did not
I don't know specifically about the ECO4 DVR. I use it for my Oppo BDP-93 Internet enabled BluRay Player. Also I use it for PC's without wireless. If the Lorex DVR uses any Router Assigned ip then yes it should allow internet access.
I'm not sure as I haven't tried that, but I would assume it would as it has great wireless broadcast. Hope this helps.
Make sure you also buy the CCTV CCD Camera LED Board Single Head 2 Pin Connector Power Cable 5pcs by Gino or you will have a lot of trouble connecting to it. The cable assembly plugs right into it. You connect the red wire to + 12 Volts and the black wire to ground. Alternatively, you could buy a 12v power supply and connect the cable assembly to it.
I used a 9 volt battery to run the lamp. I used it along with my camcorder with nightshot. Very satisfactory results. Illuminated much more than the built in IR lamp. Have not tried with more or less than 9 volts.
Don't waste your money buy an Apple TV instead. Does not work as stated
you have to go into your mac utilities click on disk utility choose your segate drive from the left side then the option you want either erase or partition which will divide the drive into parts. Hope that was helpful. My ultimate recommendation is to burn/throw away the seagate and get a Western Digital.. Seagate has burned too many people.
Yes, however I dont recomend this product, I use Mybook Studio by WD, I had a Seagate and it totally crashed they are too too sensitive.
it does NOT directly fit. i did make it work, but i HAD to MODIFY the frame that holds the screen. i broke the frame in the process, and now have miniature bolts holding the screen frame hinge together. ***The modifications necessary to make this screen fit are NOT something a tinkerer should try*** i am an experienced technician, and even i made a mistake that almost ruined the screen backing.
Glossy
Both AC and battery...that is you can get it to operate AT ALL! Mine didn't.
Yes, it works with my t4i.
Hi it last long but I have my charged sometimes but it's last very long
They will work on any laptop. you can put them in a bag that come with them out of the way I got a Hp. laptop it go into the USB on your laptop, you will like it for the money you pay I give it 5 stars .
I have an Ipad 2 with a thick Griffin survivor case on it and it works just fine. That is one thying that really impressed me about the pop-n-go.
No it doesn't do cassette tapes. It does records, cd, radio, and USB
Shop www.shoptronics.com for Electrohome Diamond Tiped Needle, Model #EANOSBCC-2 Pack. It may also be available on Amazon.
All as one mp3. You can use software like Audacity to break up the file into individual songs. The record player isn't all that great, though. Mine skips a lot. I had better luck connecting my old record player through the line-line-in connection and recording that way. Not the ideal solution.
This creates its own hotspot for devices. It doesn't connect to the Internet or cellular for data.
Error on amazon. I'll try and get it changed. It is a G42 for sale
I have used this with up to a 4TB drive and have not had a problem.
Looks like 2011.
I used it to to connect my security cameras to my tv, I'm not sure if it will work to connect your computer to your tv.
The case is just under 91" wide. The 84"x84" in the description must be the white viewing space.
Yes. You absolutely can.
Normally, what I do in this case I will use the SDXC slot in Viao instead. So this way you will have more speed. Cheers.
Yes, that is exactly what I do. I store my iTunes library on my time capsule so that inhale only one iTunes library that is shared by my PC and Macs and my Apple TV. It also means you don't need your computer on to access your iTunes from your Apple TV.
Yes you can back up other drives to Time Capsule. You just choose them in Time Machine setup. I backup both my mac and a WD 3TB external drive that holds all my video.
I used 3M double sided sticky tape. The recent ones I have gotten gone with it. That allows you to stick it to any surface.
Make sure it's plugged in completely to the iPod. If it is make sure your iPod or iPhone is working. I've had major issues when in Manhattan. It basically becomes unusable because if all the radio towers. If it's plugged in and your 30 pin connection isn't broken I'd try for a refund.
You must have gotten a defective one return it cause it should go on as soon as it connects to to the phone
i just plug mine into the laptop and let it charge. mine stays charge with light on and off usage for about 2 weeks then i recharge just in case. i just opened mine up to see what type of battery it uses and to answer your question it's plug in and recharge internal battery built inside the cam.
This item is compatible with the Nikon D610 viewfinder.
Don't waste your money. It does not stand up as the photo shows.
These work with Alpine's Mobile DVD player, not just any IR transmitting device.
I think so, but I'm not sure. I know it's not compatable with the 210-2000 series, but I think it's made for the 1000. But again, I don't know, since there's also a 3000 series.
Yes, this relay can switch up to 10A @ 220vac or 10A at 30vdc
Out of the box I dont think it will work in UK. You can download UK maps and load it onto the GPS for it to work in UK.
There is an option to change the keyboard to German. There is no German voice preloaded (that I could find), but you can download additional spoken languages for free using the PC software that comes with the device.
It's fairly intuitive; but, I received an instruction pamphlet with the nuvi.
Yes, the device can be charged in your automobile. Purchase the bean bag style mount, it comes with a suction type mount. Connect to your computer and customize it then you're ready to go. Oh yes, don't forget to register it.
Yes, as soon you load Venezuelan road maps and ad memory
I install Venezuela Maps and POIs without problem. It's ok.
The light is bright and the correct color
It is an OEM remote, just like the one that comes with the Visio TVs.
Check the compatibility list.
All my research before buying this one my understanding is all Canon DSLR lens are interchangeable but more people probably have more knowledge in this field.. My honest opinion and knowledge just from my own research is it should fix fine.
Yes they will ship to you 2 x 4GB rams for purchasing one quanity
The specs for the ASRock 990fx extreme 3 motherboard claim the following memory can be used : DDR3 2100(OC) / 1866 / 1600 / 1333 / 1066 / 800 . So it would appear that the Kingston Hyper X Blu 8 GB (2x4GB Modules) 1600MHz DDR3 Non-ECC CL9 XMP Desktop Memory - KHX1600C9D3B1K2/8GX can be used.
Yes. You can use up to 32 gigs of 1600mhz non ecc DDR3. I have this ram and will always use kingston.
It should fit. It's a threaded mount and comes with an adapter for either Nikon or Canon cameras depending on which version you order. It's a telephoto lens, but not a zoom, so you only get the one level of magnification. It doesn't have auto focus capability and will only work in full-manual mode, so it's not really easy for a novice to use. It can be fun for experimenting, but can also be quite frustrating to use. For a little bit more, you could get a 70-300 zoom lens that would be much more versatile.
YES AR PHOTO VIDEO
Sorry I can't help you there as it did not fit the 5100
No it says it specifically on the xbox adapter page on xbox.com that it does not work with the xbox one.
hi, yes, from satellite 101, if you are too far from home probably you will not get local channels. do you have hd receivers? this dish antenna is for only standard definitions channels. it doesnot work model h25 or genies hr34,hr44. thanks
hi, no sorry. thansk
Yes the legs adjust up and down
I would return it. Used mine several times with no problems.
I don't know for sure but it works with a SATA III 6G 500GB hard drive. Chances are it will work with the 750GB with no issues.
Yes it will stop and take up where you left off after you hang up
As I don't have the other model to compare, so I can't really say. But I do like base on my music and I am happy with these. The Extra Base ones were an option for me too, but I went for these instead. I guess it is a matter of personal choice. These ones seem to have a great build quality and should last longer, which is why I went for them.
Yes, this cable run below a door because is very flat, and work very well.
This item is an exact replacement cord for the Bose AE2 headhones....the Jack in the headphones cord is molded exactly the same as the original cord. The only difference is you are not paying for the name Bose product replacement. As long as you have the Bose AE2 Headphones, this item will replace the original flawlessly as It did for me. Hope that helps.
No, they have the same length that the one that comes with the headphones.
Yes, it works just the same way your cassette player would work.
no, There is no screws in that connection
James: It will only work if you have a Video Tape that has three settings. Most of the ones I've seen have only 2 hours and 6 hours or 2 hours and 8 hours for a long playing tape. I have never seen a video tape with a 4 hour recording time but maybe you have. Probably not much help, but that's all i can say to answer your question. charlie
They hit hard but they require a big amplifier and they do draw alot of juice, you'll need a big battery so your light don't flash
Can't give a specific number. You can probably go as small as you want, but you'll need to use additional shims.
Email Bryan in the Arkon customer service department at feedback@arkon.com He'll be able to get you the specifics. My guess is that you won't have a problem attaching this headrest mount to your headrests. Each of the two hooks adjusts at least 3" in either direction.
It should work with any small to medium sized point and shoot. Would not be able to hold larger cameras.
7/8"
Yes it will work. This stand extends.
Yes
hi! I believe it is just in the case size. This one can fit a full size atx board and the other fits just micro atx
Yes, but you also need to make sure your case has the clearance. Check the specs on the manufacturer's website to see what size of cooler it can fit.
No. You should buy it separately.
Ummm... It says 600D and 60D in the description...
hello--unit will accept an adapter but did not come with one.
it is buit in but the quality is very, very poor.
Yes you can. It has the backup camera option and comes included in the box.
No. The screen cut out is only about 6.5 x 4in
My headrest tilts forward as well and neither one of my kids have a hard time seeing theirs. I just pushed the headrest up a couple notches and point the mount downward for them to see tv good. No problems getting it on, very easy.
I had the same question!
Very long. I can sometimes get into some lengthy gaming marathons, and the battery has never been an issue. I estimate 4-6 hours depending on volume and battery health. Also note that you can use the device while it is charging, but the included cable is too short. If this is a major concern consider purchasing a longer USB cable with a Micro-B termination on one end.
Yes, IOGEAR just released a software update for OX 10.9; available on their website / support / Downloads. Works great with my MacBook Pro.
I had never tried before and it does with my logitech mouse...you just have to be sure to connect to it manually on the sharing port screen. Remember however, you mouse only has a range of a few feet so might defeat the purpose of a wireless hub! I am using windows 8.1...be sure to use updated driver. Ihad problems with the one that shipped.
They are labeled.
Yes, this is precisely what I use this jack for, just not with the same brand headset as yours.
Yes the Dvr need internet service in order you could see it on your mobile or using your pc!!!
It is only one DVD player, the children will have to watch the same video, you cannot watch separate movies.
No
Yes
This power supply has 2, 6/8 PCI-E plugs. It should run about any video card you want to use. It will run your motherboard just fine.
The over all size is12inc
It comes with a new peephole
Don't know. It works on my Samsung smart tv.
Sorry don't know. I returned..
You need an LGA1150 socket, This has an AM3+ socket
No, only time you will use the network cable is when setting up. Once you engage the wireless mode, you can disconnect the network cable and place the camera anywhere within the same network. You do need to plug-in the power adapter cable. All our wifi cameras need plug-in power for stable WiFi connection. Battery powered wifi cameras are not reliable.
The camera comes with a software for PC that allows you to record continuously, by schedule or upon motion detection. You can record from multiple locations as well. Best thing about it is that you will not have to pay any kind of monthly fees like other cameras that uses cloud storage recording.
I have had two of these (spilled water on the first one) and both connected to my IPAD fine... No crashing.
I am sorry but I am not sure. I ended up sending it back it was too hard to type on.
The do slide on like curtains but I also bought clamps. The clamps are easier to use then changing in and out.
Yes, two full backdrops, one white one black.
I think yes, The background for this studio is smaller, but I think can hold a larger one :)
yes, 2. and they are great light bulbs
You can use it in an emergency, but it is really too small. At lease the Lenovo T420 that I have takes a 12.7 mm drive but the drive in question is a 9.5 mm so it is not really what you want to buy. I hope that this helps.
The one I purchased works find outdoors. Mine is somewhat under an eve but it has 100% exposure to the elements no problem so far, good price good product. Would recommend it too anyone.
It does, but I found that I had to use a high quality HDMI cable. Cheaper cables did not work. Get what you need from Monoprice. They also have a tutorial about the various HDMI cables uses and specs.
it is about 6.5 inches ... or 7.5 inches with the height of the two pivot joints at each end.
Not sure why I got this question because I decided against buying a policy after further investigation. I decided it was better to buy from a company that provides their own policy within the price of the item and then look for a good sale (if you buy good furniture, it will come with good protection). However, I would imagine that if anyone offered protection for furniture in an industrial setting, you would be paying through the nose. This smartguard protection did not even seem to meet my needs in a home setting.
Yes - you can. I didn't do it, but, I see a hex bolt on the top.
Absolutely, it will work perfectly.
Depends on what you plan on shooting. If you do a lot of wide night shots then this would be perfect.
None otther
Worked good with my cable TV for about 2 weeks then died..sent it back got another and same thing again. We have a lot of voltage fluculations on rural electric system and they are i guess unable to stand these flucations. I just gave up. Think took out hard drive and used with alarm system.
Each phone has a call button. Press the button and the other phone rings loudly.
Hi Ruth, I don't know the dimensions but we have a Canon MX892 printer fax scanner all in one and it fits great. Not skin tight but doesn't hang all over. We are very pleased with it. You'll like it
If you can confirm this is your issue. Yes. Absolutely. When replacing my digitizer I basically cut through this. As soon as I got the part in and put it in. Worked like a charm.
Hardly.
Yes
I haven't had any trouble with mine. I use it in conjunction with a Logitech bluetooth keyboard, with a Samsung Galaxy Tab.
I haven't found a way to
Yes you can use it for a xbox 360 if that is what you're asking.
Mine works perfectly with Windows 8. I have had no problems on any version of Windows.
yes
I'm also a CAD guy and I haven't had any issues with double-clicks. When I first got the mouse, my computer didn't recognize it. I had to update some drivers or something, but I think the problem was just my PC. I've had it for a while and love it. I was having wrist pain with a "normal" mouse and this has helped a LOT.
Absolutely! I've used it for over a year with Time Machine. I never have to think about backing up. It's awesome!
It works on both! You can format it to work on PC and Mac. It's super easy
The description just says 10"
Because of the material it may stretch and fit and close. But I think it would be a little tight. It is the cutest case though!
Yes
This is probably an alarm setting for movement that is triggered by movement in the camera's field of vision like a tree blowing in the wind, etc. You need to turn off audio alarms.
This particular DVR is set up for 4 cameras maximum. Swann does have 8 and 16 camera set ups.
No, but it would work perfectly fine other than not having audio. So if you just want to view, it would work. Most baby monitors would be wireless and let you carry around something that has audio / video. With this system, you'd have to wire the camera to the room, only have video, but can watch the video on a mobile device.
Hello, I did find this for you and it specifically states that the battery is for the SZ3: DMW-BCL7 Battery & Battery Charger for Panasonic Lumix DMC-SZ3 DMC-XS1 DMC-FH10 DMC-F5 Digital Camera + LCD Screen Protectors + Cleaning Cloth. Put DMW-BCL7 Battery and Battery Charger in Amazon's "Search". I did notice that this battery is not listed for my SZ1, though the batteries appear to be similar.
I have no idea. Sounds like a Google question.
The DR-05 was shipped with a pair of standard (john doe) AA alkaline batteries of the 2100mAh variety and gave expected performance. Nothing remarkable -or unremarkable. Just know that playing around with broad bandwidth audio (or video) burns through batteries faster than less demanding applications, so be prepared.
The output amperage is too low to fully charge a Galaxy S3 or S4. The lower the Amperage the longer it takes to charge a battery. In fact, Anker has the following statement on the Amazon web page for this item, "Can NOT fully charge batteries for the Samsung S3 & S4". If it says that, why would you buy it for a Galaxy S4?
It looks like all the HP Mini 210 series accept the same battery. 1030nr appears to be identical to the 1018cl: size, monikers, decals, etc. The Anker I purchased has been "outstanding". Go for it! Live on the edge! Good Luck!
It has over volt protection.been using for a year no probe on matx a10-5800k with hd6570 dual graphics
Yes, it brings its own mini CD with software and drivers, which I copied to an USB flash memory. I ran it undern a Windows 7 system and everything was fine.
These are the speakers that will allow you to hear the music over the bass. They are not bad speakers. They will not be what gives the bass though. They sound good in my car alone but if you want bass you need to get a subwoofer as well.
This fader filter has fit all my 52 mm Nikkor lenses perfectly.
Depends on the android device. The remote/mic/headset spec that iphones recognize IS a standard, but strangely, not all Android devices abide this standard. The Nexus 5 for instance, can NOT be controlled with this device, but the speakers/mic work just fine.
Hi, Per the publishers website: Legend of the Tahiti Hidden Pearls. Systems: Windows 7, Vista/XP. They also provide free tech support if you have any troubles with it. Their support info is on the back of the case. Thanks for asking. Ship 4 Zip
I don't have an LG but this mount is extremely adjustable so I can't imagine that it won't work with your tv. It's a great mount, super sturdy.
Not with this unit. This unit ONLY handles A2DP audio (such as from your music player app) For calls you need something like this: Belkin Bluetooth Car Hands-Free Kit for Apple iPod, Apple iPhone, BlackBerry,and Android Smartphones, US Version http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-Bluetooth-Hands-Free-BlackBerry-Smartphones/dp/B004CLYJ2I/ref=sr_1_38?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1378231367&sr=1-38&keywords=bluetooth+phone+calls
micro usb
If I recall bcorrectly, it contained the USB hub, power cable and USB cable to connect to the USB port on the computer or next USB hub.
If the Jabra is connected via Bluetooth you hear the iPhone ringtones through the Jabra on incoming calls. You can also use Siri with this device by holding down the talk button until you get the familiar Siri tones.
This is for people like you and me that DON'T have Bluetooth in their car. My Ford Focus may not be old, but for some unusual reason my car never had Bluetooth. To have my dealer install Ford's Bluetooth (Sync) was going to cost me over $500 to install. When I saw this Jabra on Amazon, I knew this was what I wanted. And I'm sold on it. So this is the cheaper alternative for hands free talking on your cell phone. This Bluetooth is built into the Jabra. Hope this is helpful.
Remove the Rubber protector (yellow color), you will find the battery compartment cover at the back, unscrew and replace the battery
Do not know what you mean. It has users which you can specify to access it. You setup the user and password. They do not have it, they cannot view. Pretty standard stuff.
I bought it and it plugged right into my laptop
The speaker is the base. You just slid your iPad from top down to connect. You can tilt the iPad forward or backward. Hope this helps. There is not other parts to it.
Not sure. It has the old charger and if the iPad air has the new one like the iPhone 5 and new iPod does, then no, it won't work.
No idea , I tested on iPad 2
The iPad 4 is physically identical to the iPad 3 EXCEPT for the connector. Since the speaker stand uses the older connector .. the iPad 4 will not plug into it and is therefore incompatible
If it's not turning and the blue light is on your turntable might be broken. Every time I put the arm on the record or just take it off the clip the record begins to spin.
I purchased this screen protector for a touch screen laptop and it works great. Reduced the signs of smudges I was getting on tbe screen. There isn't any change in responsiveness (at least not that I can tell). I would recommend this protector.
Sorry. It didn't fit my Laptop so I returned for a refund. Which they gave with no questions asked.
yes
Hi Roge, I used it to charge my Macbook and 2 mobile phones at the same time and everything fine and still working :)
yes, the polarized wider tip common on US appliances will plug into this adapter
I'm not sure about Brazil but it will work in China.
I have the samsung chromebook. I would recommend another case.
yes.
No, I don't see an earphone jack.
If you look at the other questions people have used it to cool home theatre receivers with good results. I use it for something else, but with the amount of air it moves I'd expect it to be able to cool receivers well.
Is it possible to reverse the fan? - I'm not an electronics expert but it might be possible. The only reason I can see that you would want to do this is to pull air "into" the existing exhaust and out the current "intake" making it pull hot air in from within a smaller area. There might be better products to do this. Slowing it down shouldn't take much more than putting in a resistor or two. But, again, I'm not an electronics expert, so that would take some research on how to accomplish this.
go ahead, but if you need 2 of these you're better off putting your Onkyo in a better ventilated space.
Yes. Some apparently think a better fan is available, but this one has worked fine for me.
3.4 runing thew 2 cores i think 1.8 bankswitched thew memory and what ever the video card you are using to set up the real timing or speed look up the specs on amd web site,,, the one i use is in a video mpeg4 storage computer and it works fine for that,,,
Yes your motherboard should support it. But for overclocking make sure you have a 550 to 600 watt power supply.
Hi Patricia, to be honest with you, I have not completely understand the camera. I think it does have the photo enhancements. Hope that helps.
I do not use the camera because of the quality of the picture is so poor.
Nettie, just push a button on the menu and you can use the arrows around the ok to review from left to right
Two AA's.
Hello, I have not tried the 360 holder with any other version of the ipad. I used it with the iPad 2, and experienced problems.
I'm not sure. You only need this power inserter for SWM applications. I'd check with seller
you can use an inline amp. with those you can make it as long as you want. but I'm using this controller to light up 2 16 feet stands of 5050
Yes and no. Yes, it did, but when it basically fell apart, it no longer did. The part that attaches to the Surface fell apart, leaving me to pry it out of the port with pliers.
Yes
The adaptor is compatible with PCIE 1.0 and 2.0 specifications (2.5 and 5GHz signaling, 250 and 500MB/s data rate), however the maximum data rate in the PCIE 1.0 connection will be limited at 250MB/s for a SATA III device. Note that the (supported) SATA signaling is 1.5, 3.0 and 6.0GHz (150, 300 and 600MB/s), different from PCIE data rates. Obviously the lower of the two, in any combination, will apply.
Yes.
Just packaged like you would buy it from a store.
After reading the packaging & documentation the adapter comes with, it'll max out @ 3 gb/s speeds on HDD's and SSD's. No 6 gb/s speeds on this adapter. That being said, I still think it's a great product.
This particular one does not, but I saw many others that did both or some just IDE.
I have tested the Hard Disk with eSATA cable and I can confirm to you that the eSATA cable can be used only for Data transfer and will not power the hard disk. It is necessary to power the hard disk via USB cable. Please note that if both cable (eSATA and USB) are connected at the same time, only the eSATA cable will be recognized and interact with the drive, the USB connection in this case will only be used for power. Regards Marcos Silva - Rio de janeiro - Brasil
It should. My 750gb evo worked. But, be warned that you wont get near sata 3 speed from this enclosure via usb 3. Look at the Minipro usb 3 enclosure instead, it will give you faster performance for a ssd.
I have a 2 it fits.
Answer from Titantech: Yes, it fits your car.
Yes. It does come back on and to the last set channel.
My girls have not experienced any accidental triggering of the accessory. It is designed for deliberate trigger in the event of emergency.
There are no controls on the mic/earbuds, so all phone functions-answering the phone, volume control, making a call-are made from the phone. If you are listening to music and you receive a call, you answer it as if you were just using your phone and just talk. The mic is good enough that you don't even need to bring it up to your mouth to speak.
I would either call the tech support team and ask whom to contact (1-800-362-5703) or assuming that Subjekt is the brand name, google it and see if you can find a website for them and try for assistance from them.
I am not sure it can with the exception if there is a power loss in the process. I tried coping a hard drive that had a problem and the problem was copied to the new drive so I am not sure it can even correct a problem on the target drive if I understand you correctly.
Yes, it will. I have a 1-TB and a 3-TB drive. I cloned the 1-TB drive onto the 3-TB drive with no problem.
unless it has new native software updates within it, it is plugged into a usb connector and functions through the computer imaging software system. Newer "smart tvs" may have some ability to interface with graphics transfer. I believe you still need a computer at this time. Ours works with a laptop.
It's an FM radio transmitter, so if you want to plug it into the pc headphone jack and pick it up over your stereo radio or run powered speakers from the receiver that comes with it, yes. It can not power external un-amped speakers.
It comes with everything you need. If you are using it for TV, the TV must have a headphone (phono) jack -- and most do have them on the side. Now, it comes with two plugs. One for the headphone (earphone) phono and a red one which I never use. It comes with very good instructions. It uses batteries, so I recommend getting rechargeable batteries. I'm 71, if I can do it, anyone can.
"What am I doing wrong?" Trying to save money. Mine worked ok as long as I was within 6 feet of it. I needed it to work at 25 feet so I bought a professional unit from a music supply store and haven't had any problems since. IIRC, there's a switch on the side you might have missed but this is a cheap sketchy little bit of electronica so don't expect much.
Just for the fact that wind is a thing, you would need to weigh it down. Once you put the drop cloth on it, this turns into a huge kite. Your also going to have to clamp the cloth on the sides.
I don't know exactly. I used a black backdrop that was a shower curtain cover and it worked fine. It is a bit "flimsy" but it has worked great for my purpose. I didn't have it fully extended, it was one bar less. It did not sag in the middle. I think this would be good used as a portable unit. For the price it was well worth it for me. I shoot floral arrangements for my web site at my flower shop. Let me know if you have any other questions. Hope this helps.
Mine had a ul stamp on 3 but ive installed 5... so 2 didnt
If your model has the Conon mini shoe and the converter shoe is a power contact on both sides, yes. I have the VIXIA M500 and it works fine. If it is just a fixture to enable mounting, no. I also have one of those including a multiple mount one for just mounting battery operated led lights.
Well, if you go to the Amazon page on this item and look at the list of compatible camcorders, this camera is in the list. So, I would say yes.
No. The latest version of handycam hot shoe is smaller than previous DV units. I ended up bypassing the hot shoe with a Heavy Duty Photography L Bracket with 2 Standard Flash Hot Shoe Mount attached at the tripod mount
no
The FM radio is pretty good, you can program it to your desired stations and listen to the ones you want, the COBY MP3610 has a slightly better radio program, but since these are both manufactured by COBY, both are good..Hope I was of help.. :)
sORRY, i NEVER TRIED. jUST USE IT FOR MUSIC
No it is for a MacBook Pro. Find the Model number of your MacBook Air and type that in the search bar after Kuzy apple case and the one thats compatible with yours should come up.
Yes, surface pro has all the same drivers as a normal windows 8 installation. This hub works with windows 8, so you should be fine.
It should fit just fine.
Hi there, Sorry we don't do combine shipping. Best,
It's all metal, check the other questions before posting dude.
No it does not come in the camera. You have to purchase it seperate. I hope this helps.
We are able to communicate without having to add any additional devices. The literature says that it has a built-in microphone, and our computer has built-in speakers.
My Samsung Galaxy Tab1 10.1 works just fine but for some reason it seems to drains the battery to my tablet much quicker. Could it be that my tablet is not a Samsung. If you can check this Possible problem out and ask if any others having this a same problem and is their a solution? thanks
Yes. I have one and it works perfectly.
It should.
yes.there is no equalization however.still it does ok esp for the price
Yes. Just push the toggle button and it should switch over.
There's no reason why not
I will check. Don't listen to radio any more becausec of too many commercials. USB option does.
There is about 10inch between I have a bluray player , Xbox and external hard drive and
Longer shelf = 14.5" smaller shelf = 11.5" Dimensions: 22.3"w x 24"h x 16.2"d (565mm x 610mm x 411mm) Check out this link http://www.omnimount.com/products/wall_furniture/blade_series/blade2/
If you want to see the same image on two different monitors just split the input .... or if your running on wifi ... just connect it to your router .
No, it wont work on a laptop but portable dvd player will do.
Hi, Is that a question? Like, does it work with Win8.1? I don't have any Win8 at home, but this device uses standard usb driver so I can't imagine why it wouldn't work with Win8. I have it connected to a Win7 box and can reach it from any system on my home network.
According to the displayport website, you actually can have it as the last monitor in a daisy chain: (http://www.displayport.org/cables/driving-multiple-displays-from-a-single-displayport-output/). "And while all monitors in the middle of the daisy chain need to be DisplayPort v1.2 daisy-chainable (since they need the DisplayPort output), the last monitor can be an older DP 1.1 monitor (which only has a DisplayPort input)." I bought one to be the last monitor in a chain of 3, and surprise - didn't work. Bummed.
No its motorized and the entire screen detaches
You have to buy the navi box for the navigation to work and yea it does play dvds
Yes. This webcam supports OXS. You can set it up by selecting your selected camera from FaceTime by plugging into your usb and going to FaceTime and selecting Video from the menu bar then seeing if it appears under camera.
Go to youtube and look up the video, they show you exactly how it works. If yours doesn't work like in the vid, send it back immediately for a refund/exchange.
No. I had a pre manufactured box. I have two wired at 1ohm to a JL 1000.1 amp and they sound great if you keep them within their range. I've had them over a year with no problems. Highly recomend these
I just checked this out and it depends on the application. It does not auto correct in email but the word gets underlined if incorrect. It does work on the Amazon site as I am typing this message I use the keyboard all the time and am very happy not to be using my thumbs. It has boosted productivity significantly and added a level of protection that I really appreciate. For me, the auto correct is a small compromise. Hope it works out.
It should. I have an Acer Aspire 5552-7650 and I used this one to replace my 500Gb HD. It was an exact replacement with all of the manufacturing signs on it. It was a unplug and plug in. The HD worked flawlessly and I still use my Acer to this day. Hope this helps with your decision
Not too sure. Best thing to do is google the item you are trying to replace.
I don't believe so, what matters is the size which is 500GB, the type which is a SATA 2.5 laptop hard drive, and the speed which is 5400 rpm, but the part numbers change as new hard drives come out.
Bout the same footprint as a 17in laptop
No... It can hold up to 4 2TB external hard drives or USB Thumb Drives. It does have a torrent downloader and media / file streamer built in.
Mine did not need any reformat. I put 2 drives on it snd they worked without any reformating.
So long as you have a PCI express slot to install it in then it should work fine in a 2008 Mac Pro
I assume you're talking about the power supply? I'm afraid I don't know, I've never used a DX4840-11E. Mine is an Antec EA650 (obviously 650 watts) and it works flawlessly.
http://usbeasycap.info/support.html driver downloads are here
No, with the dx format(40mm x 1.5) it is equivalent to a 60mm (35mm film format); which is considered a normal focal length lens. The special thing about this is lens is that you can get real close up. It is super sharp and takes great close up portraits as well as allowing you to take close ups of flowers jewelry and the usual stuff you might like to look at up close. No image stabilization :( but a bright f2.8
Yes it should work just fine with your camera.
It will fit but you will not be able to do a full zoom. because the space for the zoom is not that deep.
yes
No, it is not wireless. You can find a wireless adapter on Amazon.
2X75 Watt 6-pin PCI Express power connector. They come from your existing computer power supply. If your power supply does not have those, you will have to upgrade to another more powerful one. Hope that helps.
Actually this projector does not suffer severely from this issue and it doesn't need any adjustment. Nevertheless, I believe you can adjust the settings.
Hello. 110 volts.
Sony website states that it will ship on or around October 7th.
Dear HL S. It is difficult to provide an accurate and scientific answer based on the given input. Give it a try, buy the product, check it out and see if it meets your quality standards. If yes--Great!. Otherwise return to supplier for full refund and learn from the experience when specifying another projector. Regards. Mr. North East.
You can buy any high defination television antenna from Best Buy, Kmart or Target stores . You will receive local digital tv channels.
Hello, Yes, this player does come with a remote. Best Regards, NetRush
Mine had the little metal ring to attach to my phone and then my different lens just went on. Mine did not have 4 pieces. What kind of pieces does it have ?
The red is power and the yellow and white are actually (both) video. If you hook the yellow up to a back up camera, it comes on the monitor when in reverse. If you are also using the monitor for kids watching movies plugged into the white, and the only time it interrupts the movie is when you use reverse!
I'm pretty sure it's a "yes" on the MyTouch. You would need to specify which Windows phone you're talking about... I would look in the technical specs to see if it has a micro-USB port, or look up a picture of a micro-USB plug and see if it looks like the charging port on your phone.
5 volt dc at 2.1 amp
It charges faster than a typical cell phone charger. I've heard that it's been known to ruin cell phone batteries. We just use it for Kindle.
Like the others, I haven't had mine trip yet so I can't answer about the duration of the alarm. According to the paperwork that came with the unit, they say to replace the unit after it's been tripped.
You get a set
All I know is if a snake bites at you I rather have them on. All they do is guard your lower legs below the knee.. Watch out picking stuff up and stepping around logs and stuff. Sometimes a snake get you on the hand or arm if you are not careful.
Hello Zac, We have one of these systems installed and some of cable runs are a good distance we ran our own cat 5 cable and put our own ends on. There does not seem to be a power issue with them at this point.
yes at soltech
Yes
No
Yes, it does. I have ipad 2 4th gen. It wakes and sleeps when opening and closing.
Product is available in Amazon Canada.
its in the description.
Yes, it will work in New Zealand ... however you will need an adapter to plug it in as it has a US style three-prong grounded power plug. The outlets in NZ have a different configuration. http://www.amazon.com/BoxWave-American-European-Australian-Zealand/dp/B000I06JLQ/ref=pd_bxgy_e_text_y is an inexpensive adapter that will work, although you lose the ground. http://www.amazon.com/VCT-VP-Universal-Australia-ArgentinaTravel/dp/B00374I2T2/ref=pd_bxgy_e_text_z This adapter will be safer.
Hi! The stand is quite sturdy. I've had no problems with it. I use it on my lap, and it's fine. The keyboard will fall off if you let the bottom fall down, etc., but if you're just sitting there typing, it stays in place.
According to WikiDevi (https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Edimax_EW-7811Un) this is a Realtek RTL8188CUS chipset
Nope, just wifi
Yes it is.
Yes. The Bluetooth remote is much faster and does not require line of sight. I think the picture is higher quality because of the much improved and more modern processor. You may want to try one in the location it is used the most. Some people have complained about the wireless. I use the ethernet connection and that works well.
Your Internet connection speed might be too slow.
Pretty good, But if you want more details you should consult the product info.
The camera works with 110 - 120 volts.
Sorry. Can't help. Could never make mine work w my iphone. Sent it back.
No
I think ;that you can find the answer to this question in the datasheet for this device - located in the images section. It shows use in a RS-422 full duplex application which should also be applicable to a RS-485 full duplex application.
It would depend upon what transceiver it uses... you might try contacting the manufacturer. The spec is 10Mbps @ 40ft to 100Kbps @ 4000ft. The distributor's spec page indicates 300bps to 921600bps up to 1.2Km: http://www.serialstuff.com/usb-to-rs485-422-terminal-block/ I have used this successfully under Windows 8 64-bit.
Ive used it on my friends mac, so it should work.
The type of dish you have
Mine came with an AC charger. I didn't have an opportunity to try the Google Play Store, since mine refused to load the operating system after about a month's use.
See if you can restore it back to factory form
I don't think so. My husband said there us no "record" button for radio.
I would think so, since it does it from the record player. I don't use it for recording though, only for playing records or radio.
Hi, thanks for contacting us. Unfortunately this part will not work with a mac pro. I am sorry and if there is anything else i can do for you or if you have any other questions please let me know. Sincerely, Chris Nickels Red Planet Trading
It comes with a power supply with the Topping brand on it. The power supply is about half the size of the amplifier, so it's kind of large, and the blue LED on it is so bright it lights up my entire room at night, so I had to put a piece of tape over it.
Yes, it is compatible with the f30gt
I also have small ears, but I've heated up the bend in the tube slightly wider with a lighter to make it a bit wider. Be careful not to melt through! It kept mine from popping out so easily. Plus we use the ear plugs called something like rockets that stay in my ears but let in sound too....good luck!
Had no problems loading driver on my Linux server or my windows server. There should be a Mac driver for it. Check the factory website for a driver update. I bought another one from Microcenter and had to do that
I do believe they will be fine. All the original Bose headphones fit around the ear....that is, the external ear actually fits inside the ear piece. The quality of these is no different from the original. Neither are top-quality. For Bose, their pads are an embarrassment and they seem unwilling to use better materials as the years have gone by.
As long as the DVR you want to install it into can accomodate at SATA 5.25 bay hard drive, then I don't see why it would not work for that application.
It comes with the cam caddie scorpion ex which has threaded holes in the feet to attach a cheese plate (sold separately) if you want, one accessory shoe, little wrench tool for adjusting the accessory shoe, and a mounting knob. You can go to cam caddie's website to find out more.
There was no Voltage, on the connector. So I cut off the end, still no Voltage. Junk!
Yes you can with the right blu-ray player but its alot easier if you got a good computer with HDMI and install power DVD or total theater media player cause those to video players do the checkerboard format
Wow, this is getting ridiculous. I can't imagine Amazon not having it in stock and being able to Apple shipping it "in 24 hours" UNLESS Apple is withholding the supply. I mean, that's their right but it's annoying.
no
If you buy it new it should come with the normal Apple warranty (The MacBook Pro comes with 90 days of free telephone support and a 1-year limited warranty) if you buy it used you will probably need to buy your own AppleCare Protection Plan (which can be extended to 3 years).
It has the Apple trademarked symbol in the cover. It is not a sticker.
I can take pictures later today and i will send them to you.
I've had my Air since early Jan 2013, I use it every since for at least 16hrs/ day. I've had it on MIFI , WiFi and mobile (Internet Tethering) and have never lost connection.
Yes
Do you know the connection type on the digital projector? It should be either DVI, VGA, or HDMI. You can find them by searching for the type of adapter "to Mini DisplayPort" on Amazon.
No, but if you upgrade to Mavericks (free) you will get Pages, Keynote and Numbers for free.
Thank you for your question. This device is designed to allow older Mercedes iPod systems to charge the new iPhone models prior to the iPhone 5. While what you're proposing sounds like it would work, there are just too many variables in equipment and devices for me to say that it would definitely power a non Apple device via micro USB.
You should be able to access most files that have a common app (Mac and PC) - the challenge will be saving any updates. Typically PC formatted external drives are FAT32, which will convert to the MAC, but not able to be write enabled back. The exception will be music and photos, they should be available for iTunes and iPhoto imports.
This is not one of the base configurations for the MacBook Air, and thus Amazon.com won't offer it (it has never offered more than base configurations in the past). If you would like 8 GB of RAM in your Air, the most popular options is to order it from the Apple Store: http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_mac/family/macbook_air/select I understand that B&H may offer some 8 GB configurations, but you're guaranteed to get exactly what you want if you order it from the online Apple Store. That's what I did for mine - I have the 13"/i5/8 GB RAM/256 GB SSD configuration.
I never bothered to find out. When I got mine it was not turning on properly. I would bush the on button and it would immediatly turn on and off again. Next time it would work fine. Two weeks after I got it I went to the Apple store for help. They gave me a new computer in the box and it works great. First rate for Apple.
This product comes with the Fosmon VGA to HDMI Video Converter, Power Adapter and a User manual. Other products may be purchased separately.
Mostly mine just melted. Didnt work right befote it melted either.
I have not and believe I don't need to. So far it is fine
if trigger bad, we do cover replacement once customer contacted us w/valid order id.
Yes, trigger should be compatible w/Nikon. And trigger should be mounted on camera,and receiver on flash lightkit to synchronize to fire flash when camera flashes. Regards, kimoutlet
yes but it will move around because of the extra room for a full sized iPad
I am not sure what Guide Number of the Strobe Flash you meant? Can you explain what that number for. So i can ask our listing contractor,or our engineer to answer your question. Regards, kim
We cover replacement upto 60days free of charge. After 60days, we charge postage,or amount for part which needed to be replaced by customer. regards juliuworldmart2
Really like it , perfect for when I travel and yes it is thick enough.
measured my case according to your numbers. I would not think case would zip shut,too tight. I would go larger
Please call Funai for both, or go back to the store or online source you purchased it from for a replacement that should have the manual and remote. My unit came with both included. The company does have a great customer service, if you need to reach out to them their number is 877-393-8624, or go to funaiamerica.com/support/contact.php Hope this helps. Thom
I have had my Funai netbox for about a year and a half and it works very well today just as it did the day I bought it. I have moved it around the house and even taken it to friends' houses and it travels well, but of course the performance is dependent on how good the wireless (or wired) internet connection is where the unit is being used. I have a Sony Blu-Ray player with Netflix on it that does not run Netflix anywhere near as dependably as this item does.
Yes. I would not, then use it on blu ray player, for the best results use on one or the other.
This should work for that. I have mine set up to work with an old pair of B&O speakers, and it sounds great! It's not a super powerful amp, so it won't get all that loud, but it puts out good sound. It has both USB and RCA inputs so you can hook it up to a computer AND another external input.
Hi Mickey, The information, such as GPS, date & time, etc, are store in the EXIF data within the image. If you're using a Mac, getting this info is fairly easy. Within Preview, go to "Tools-&gt;Show inspector" and then look at the EXIF tab. Lightroom can also read EXIF data.s
Lite should turn green
Sorry, Don't know however it performs very well for what it is. Cheers Joe
I found the charger to be somewhat light weight anyhow. But many cellphone and some tablet chargers fit this device. So it maybe quicker to get one at a retail store that fits. Its nice knowing my phone charger can also charge this device.
Huh?
Not that I can remember. It is strictly an on/off flip switch - but I do like the equipment.
No
To L.M. Priest - Bag is made of Canvas; has nylon zippers & Velcro pocket closures! There is no leather nor does it contain any materials derived from animals. As an animal rights supporter, I can understand your concerns.
Yes, as long as the raid was created by the computer and not a third party card.
Probably not. You have to see if the D LINK device supports port-multiplier on it's own USB out. Should the device have a eSATA port then it might be worth a try.
Don't know what you mean by clear internet but I purchased this for my wireless router in hopes of better signal strength throughout my 2400 sg ft house. I was disappointed as there was no noticeable increase. You would be better off to invest in a high quality wireless router equipment. I'm sorry I didn't.
I ordered one and it will not fit on the back of my GC45 camera. It has smaller threads than the antenna that came on the camera.. I'm going to contact Uniden to see what they have to extend range. Ed
Yes
In my experience *most* consumer wifi devices have the same antenna connector (assuming they have a connector at all.)
Please look for ASIN: B005IUNGRQ through Amazon directly.
No. This is for a desktop. Installs in the tower.
I do not know
I use it when the grandkids are here. I would have to say 100 to 150 ft is the absolute MAX. I have it upstairs and tried to walk next door and it cut out just as I came to the middle of their driveway. I hope this helps.
I've used all three. I've had one issue with the a STK not charging in a Canon charger. They made it right (replaced) so I'm not too broke up over it. If you're just looking for basic battery function and don't care about having it store it's conditioning and use cycles then go with the aftermarket ones. You could buy 4 for the price of a single Canon. I've never figured out how Canon gets the money they do. I've used them in a 7D, 5DMkII and MkIII.
Yes it is. I've bought this model and used it on every Canon brand DSLR camera from Rebel Series, to 50d 60d 70d 6d 7d including Mark II's. If it takes an LP-E6 it will work. If you want to be safe check the battery that came with your camera for voltage and make sure it matches the STK's even if it's little off (as it was for my 70D) it still works fine, actually holds a bit longer of a charge.
Yes, but it's not worth the money. This thing sucks
Yes, that should work as long as you have the appropriate filter on your phone outlet which your computer will connect to.
The keyboard is hard plastic
No, it does not detach.
The lights have an on/off switch. It's not like a off camera flash. So they're constantly on.
It won't be hooked up to the camera physically. The purpose of that is to be used as backgrounds for the photography and the lights are used as lighting equipments so that the output is more better compare to the photos without this stuff. Please check Youtube on how to use this stuff, it's much easier to understand. I hope my answer help a bit.
This kit comes in w/one complete backdrop support standkit,which is, 2 stands,4 section of crossbars. Regards, juliusworldmart2
Yes came w storage bag for lights and seperate bag for backdrop stand
No, only CAP Cisco models.
Yes they do
Mine did not come with any other lights other than what you see presently in the picture.
Box was huge about 36x36x24 roughly everything packaged tightly n secure each bulb was in its own package as well
You can adjust it if you wish.
I have an iPad mini and have extra room for my iPhone and small wallet. I would think this would fit the kindle fire.
If you follow the recommended power termination, no. As the system only comes on when the vehicle is put in reverse. And the monitor shows both the fred from the camera and the distance of each sensor from objects.
If the box has an auxiliary then yes
Yes you can, you have to purchase the European maps, either down load or buy in a SD memory card (buy the memory card with the map in it, makes it easier when you go back to the state and use usa map
If you are thinking that this unit will respond to voice commands from you, this unit does not have that capability. This unit will only give YOU voice commands e.g. "turn right", "continue on route", "arriving at destination", etc.
Yes, we are using thing for last two months...no problems...good advanced feature.
Yes. You have to go to settings, then there is a language menu. Good luck!
Yes it does, and yes you can.
Yes you can it has inputs for digital coaxial and fiber optic audio inputs which then output to rcas to an audio receiver
Yes. I purchased two of these batteries along with the charger, specifically for a D-80. The higher mAh rating means that the battery charge should last longer than the 1500 mAh version. I've had no problems with this battery in my D-80.
Yes.
I Don't know. I don't have the headset.
Yes it does
Yes
Generally, no. It will work on some phones, but phones often have non-standard inputs. Just because it fits doesn't necessarily mean it will work. Many smartphones have converters. For example, I bought a 10 dollar converter for my Samsung S4 and it works perfectly.
Yes it is.
It has the pink and green male plugs. I think 3.5mm
I don't think so. It has a dual jack, but they are marked, one for headphone, one for microphone.
No it won't unless you buy a 3.5mm to 2.5mm adapter it won't work with the phone.
no, its just plug and play
It has a dual voice coil internally wired to 1 ohm
It can handle around 650rms so 1200watt rms amp would still work just don't turn it up all the way and also make sure the ohms match up as well this thing kicks let me tell you
No
It comes with the subwoofer driver and box.
If you are running XP on a Mac and using this keyboard, then it should work.
I've ordered two copies of this software and both times received a download link with serial number. Download will be the latest version as its updated almost weekly.
Yes
Battery will last all day.
An hour or so.
Yes. It will work just fine with that TV.
Yes you can, you just have to download an app that streams it from your phone.
The cable plugs into the shutter release accessory terminal, but you don't need to use the cable. The cable is there to activate the shutter release button built in to the side of the grip- handy for taking shots with the camera on it's side (portrait) but you can still easily use the camera's shutter button on top which would leave the accessory port open for your use.
I have not found this to be an issue.
I don't know the difference, but I can tell you to check the back of your battery for the serial numbers and codes and look for those code on a new battery. That is what I did and it works well and fitted perfect with my laptop 14R (N4010).
Hey Robert From image itself I don't see there is much difference... I guess 8x42 having only one type so you should be good to purchase the other one @180$. I got it in 150$ while massive discounts going on Amazon and even I got 50$ rebate coupon from Vanguard so it same in 100$ .I hope I answers your question
I think they would be a little heavy for children younger than, say, 12, but that is not based on specific evidence.
Yes, they come with both. The case is a soft case.
It allows a wired connection anywhere it is plugged in. If plugged in to an Airport Express, then the Express would be an extended new WiFi connection. If plugged in the a portable laptop, then it would a much faster connection than a wireless connection expanding the existing network. So the answer to your question is that it can be both depending on what you connect to it.
well i havent tested the range yet - the only problem i have is that it didnt come with a driver to unlock/change the encryption codes so i cant use it with my other units - its usually good everywhere in the house as long as its on the same circuit - they are pretty good products
did you connect it with an appropriate HDMI cable?
I don't think so. If you go to Logitech's community forums, there are numerous pleas from owners to enable two-finger right click and three finger middle click. You'd think it would be a simple thing to do - just a quick software update. But i haven't heard anything yet.
Eduardo sounds like something is blocking your pictures either with you finger or the shutter is not opening all
approximately 24 inches
Hi, Although I have 2 older MacBooks I installed this drive on, it seems to be ok on the Mac Mini also. I would suggest you check out YouTube first and search "Mac Mini 2011 hard drive and ram upgrade." You really need to check out the specs on your specific machine too. There are space considerations, not just will it work. The guy on YouTube was using this drive as a secondary drive. Also, try Googling your situation. That's how I figure things out. Hope this helps. Steve R.
Yes
Yes it does, also there's software included and camera manual to assist with this.
It has auto focous and manual focus, this is a pretty awesome camera. I love it.
It's just exactly as the picture appears. There is one small 4pin molex (for powering something like a small fan ) and one larger standard 4pin molex connector for powering a larger fan or a hard drive. Both molex connectors are female.
I guess you could since I think that the AVR only provided 90 watts/channel. However these inexpensive speakers don't deliver really robust bass that you might want in rear speakers.
both use wire like normal.
Yes it does. When I bought I was using windos 7 on my PC and have since updated to windows 8 and even 8.1 (Pre- release) and have found the camera to work with all versions. When using Skype, make sure to go to settings and select the midrophone for the camera as default,
I just installed it in the router. I don't remember how long it was before the light came on by the word "battery", but it did come on and remains lit.
Yes this will lay flat or stand up in multiple positions.
T70P. The P stands for portable. They have a 32 ohm impedance which means they can be driven buy most mp3 players without the need for an amplifier. I use mine with an iPhone and I have to say they are excellent headphones. Far superior to Dr Dre studio headphones
Yes should fit. My EVGA 850W G2 fits just fine and they are near the same size. But you will likely lose the ability to mount a fan on the bottom of the case.
There are filters on the front, but I still bought a set of magnetic DemciFlex filters for the front, side, and bottom that work great and do a good job keeping dust from getting into the case. They're also easier to clean than the filters incorporated into the case.
yes with no problem
Return it if you can. Micca wont help. They stopped responding to my service request. My unit is just sitting there.
It works well with xp, 7, 8, and 8.1
Can't be used that way. The yiynova is just like a touch monitor, it hasn't processor, memory, nothing. It has to be connected all the time. P.S: sorry about my english, it's my second language.
It comes ready to use. However within 30 days you must call and go thru a registering process where they switch all your info over and officially instal the software, but immediately you can add items and info for use
It has and you do not need to use
I have a kindle fire 8.9 and this tablet sleeve is comfortable fit. It's got wiggle room not a tight fit and I had bought 2 just to switch designs. Hoping this info helps...depending on your tablet measurements.
yes
1 meter long; approximately 40 inches.
I didn't notice the claim in the specs before purchasing but it absolutely does not have eSATA on my two that I just received in the last month. I don't need it so not a concern for me and the quality of the case is phenomenal so if you need eSATA, unfortunately you are out of luck but if not, this case is great.
Have you tried doing a complete reset? It could have corrupted software.
If you want N speed it has to be wired. Otherwise, it won't work without manually changing to G speed and that cuts your max speed in half.
I received it new.
Over many years computing, my only mouse failure was caused by dropping it on a hard floor!
Its a great case. Very professional looking and stands up for easy viewing.
Yes it is, I got mine when I had mountain lion and it worked great. I now upgraded to maverick and it still works great.
Sorry I can't help you. I returned it because I had trouble getting it to work with my iPad 3. I don't know much else about it,it's been a while.
This is not a question, but I'll pretend it is :) The headphone jack works just fine with our gt2 my daughter uses it almost every day
I wanted to ask exactly the very same question..i already purchased it and now am back to egypt where the voltage is 220v ..Will it function?
"8x45watt bulb and...one 105watt CFL bulb"
The CP1 Strap is a bit too much strap for such a small form factor camera. Designed to mound on the bottom of DSLR to distribute the weight across shoulder. I can see where the mounting plate could cause the LCD to not open, So I would suggest replacing plate with BlackRapid RFH-1E0 (FR-T1). I use these on large cameras and lenses. I believe this would work perfectly with the sony.
Yes, I have purchased both a black and a white model. Both are no longer in service. Unreliable product.
It's actually pretty amazing. I charged it only once in the past 5 months or so. I don't use it every day, but still...
Caps lock, num lock, and scroll lock all have green lights on the keys when they are active.
The keys are very quite
No
You buy the optional wireless adapter, plug it into the usb port in the front of the receiver and it will recognize it. You'll have to go theough the setting to setup unless your wireless have no password.
I did not like that carrier, I coundn't get it tight enough, it would sag down whenever hitting even minor bumps. But this one works great and can easiy moved from bike to bike, even easier if you buy extra ball mounts... this is by far the best, strongest and most adjustable option available, you will need all three pieces in the "frequently bought together section": http://www.amazon.com/RAM-Universal-X-Grip-Holder-1-Inch/dp/B0055PH0XA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1361030733&sr=8-1&keywords=ram+mount
What was your question?
The cable is about 1 meter and worked OK for me. I had no problems with it.
I couldn't make it work with my d3200 so I returned it.
Yes
Set the no of photos to "---". Which means unlimited.
No, you can not swim with this. This thing fit nicely on my ears. You may need to change the ear piece rubber. It comes with two extra sizes.
You may press and hold forward or backward button for more than 1 sec to skip the beginning of the previous/next playlist. -Ely
If the audio book is an mp3 file sure. If the book is not an mp3 then probably not.
I don't recall these specific earbuds coming with it. There were a pair that came with it, though. I bought this for my husband and he likes headphones, not earbuds, so I think they tossed them to our teenager.
Have not looked. I only use for music while walking.
lol, well, why do you think you need the holder?? i don't use it , i don't need it.. make sure you keep the mp3 player in a safe place !!!! good luck..
yes
Yes, you can. The videos take up a lot of space though, so you probably couldn't fit more than one video.

Drag and drop
I personally feel the 263's sound exactly the same as the 252's - when they stay in your ears, that is! As multiple people have pointed out, these things tend to creep slowly (or quickly) out of your ears, which obviously leads to tinny sound when they're halfway in. Wearing these under a cap or toboggan is pretty much the only way I can get them to stay in.
You canNOT use it while it's charging.
Hi Don. I got the "new" one in it's packaging. No battery is needed, so no wall charger is needed. They give you the usb cable to charge/download from computer although I've only used it to charge so far. Also came with headphones, owners manual. For me, worth the cost. I don't need an Ipod, or other gadgets, this works fine. FM Radio, podcast if desired, videos, playlists. I hope that helped.
it can be purchased anytime if you had it for three weeks you might as well buy it now
i have the 1075 pelican case that allows me to put my wife's 10" samsung note 3 in it with the "rocketfish portfolio leather case" left on. the purpose was for use while travelling in and out of airports and lounges. there is no space left in the pelican case. this is probably a different case than the other customer is talking about. no storage area in the case- just the tablet itself with the portfolio case on.
A memory card. Micro sd card. And charge the battery.
It reads and writes extremely quickly. I love mine.
It works just fine on both. Have connected it to Vista, 7 and 8 without issue. But when a card is in it, the light glows like the sun.
You don't need to get that. It's way easier simply to buy an International Power Adapter and then you have it almost worldwide. I use the one at http://www.amazon.com/Insten-Universal-Travel-Charger-Adapter/dp/B000YN01X4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1365095842&sr=8-1&keywords=international+power+adapter everywhere.
I couldn't tell you. The one I bought charges my chromebook, but I have to connect a usb mouse because the touch pad is very glitchy using this power cord!
Yes I do use the antenna on Maverick I've had great luck with it and I recommended highly for anybody that needs a boost.
You can order a new bulb from the website for about $220 and from what I've seen for videos replacing the bulb is pretty simple
Have never used the g400 but i bought this mouse over 2 years ago and its still awesome and works flawlessly. Has cool lights on the side as well with 6 or 7 different options. Im overly satisfied with my g300
I don't know if it's really stiffer on mine, but it does definitely not go down as far for obvious reasons. How stiff are you talking?
No it's one of the quieter ones.
I don't know about that specific model, but it works well with my LG smart tv I bought in 2013. There's two pairs of childrens glasses that will fit kids under 6 or so, and one pair of "womens" that will fit older kids. (They're too small for me, an adult woman).
I use LG glasses with my LG tv. I don't think there is any difference. I read reviews were customers were using 3D glasses from movies used at the theater. My LG glasses were least expensive.
Thanks for your question. The Special Edition is Gloss Black finish. This is a fantastic sounding speaker system. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Boston Acoustics dealer.
This one will work with just "Arabic" keyboaed the other 2 have few arabic Letters in different places so it will no work properly if you used Arabic "windows" or "QWERTY"
No, but there is a Kuzy product that will. http://www.amazon.com/Kuzy-Language-Keyboard-Silicone-MacBook/dp/B00AVBLGZG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1396222627&sr=8-1&keywords=Kuzy+arabic+cover
Yes, it would.
not that we have heard. all the specs listed are correct.
yes, as long as you are using it with a home theater system and not live music system
Yes its 10.7 compatible, here's the link to the drivers. http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&PNid=48&PFid=48&Level=5&Conn=4&DownTypeID=3&GetDown=false&Downloads=true#RTL8188RU
sorry for my english, my tableb actually have version Android 4.0.3.
Yes it has two cameras one on the back and front and it has Bluetooth. The camera quality is nit very good though and it doesn't have a flash sunction. So you need to be in very bright lighting for pictures to come out well.
It works well with Sketchbook pro, but I ended up getting a used Motion Computing 1700 because the screen size is bigger and as a decent computer, it can run full apps like photoshop and Corel Painter. But for sketching out ideas thinkpad works well.
I ordered the one that's supposed to come with it. It won't work with a Wacom pen, different system. The one you use with this tablet takes batteries.
No
No 1 hour is all I could get.
At Disney world in a show we had some luck with the night time fireworks setting. It wasn't 100% but we did get better shots than we had with other settings
I can't say from experience. I would think it would since it does for our iPod Touch.
this one is not what I have. It Looks mine is on earth but this one comes from Mars.
It most definitely does
I measured 70" but with the kinks making an accurate measurement difficult, I suspect it's supposed to be 6 feet.
COB (Chips on Board) , is a new technology of LED packaging for LED light engine. Multi LED chips are packaged together as one lighting module. When it light up, it looks like a lighting panel.. Bottom line: better light .... less power used.
No. This is not the C.Crane radio that includes shortwave. That is the CC Skywave Radio With AM, FM, Shortwave, Weather and Aviation. Check them out at ccrane.com .
This is a Mitsubishi bulb. I'm not sure if we bought the same one, it looks the same. These bulbs seem to go out more often than others. We have had to replace ours four times in as many years. We received one that just didn't work upon arrival and the shipper and Amazon sent another with no charge and in record time. Thanks, Dan
No
I couldn't find any info on an ad-65743. I'm assuming you meant a WD-65734, in which case the answer is yes. I bought one of these for my WD-65734 and it's working fine for months now.
Yes it is, but it failed within 48 hours! I do NOT recommend it!
It was printed on the piece of paper included when the light shipped to us. Our first bulb lasted about a month and then became very dim. Warranty is valid for 90 days, and I simply returned to Amazon and bulb was replaced. 2nd bulb has been fine.
No. I found that same claim odd. The swappable drives connect to the saga ports on whatever motherboard you've attached them too. I can say that when connected to a SATA 6gbps port on your mainboard it runs at those speeds.
Yes it is. The 3 wire (red,white green). On my motherboard my USB pinout has 4 pins on top row 5 pins on bottom row. I just put it on top row, with writing facing up. Sometimes different boards the thing will connect upside down lol weird right. If after u connect it usb dont work try flipping it over. Good luck
Its a pretty small case. If you look at the height of the cooler then the dimensions of the case, you should be able to tell. One thing I did notice about this case is it sucks for air cooled. 0 front openings.
No not for FM only for TV. The antenna works fine.
Yes there is a clip attached that I attach to my swimmer's cap.
No and yes.... It comes with a rechargeable Li - ion battery. I bought it to use with an IPad, so I plug it's charge cable into the IPad charge "Plug" & leave it until it's blue light goes out. I've found that for a full charge, you've got to do this a couple of times. The speaker will also run with the power cord plugged in " charging" but this, as you might guess, extends charge times considerably, but if you're in the middle of a movie or something, it's a great thing.
Without knowning anything about micro 4/3 lenses, I'll go out on a limb and guess that 1) it is completely different mount type than the Leica M mount and 2) probably won't work for what you want to do.
es . For any lenses have leica m mount.
They worked with my Samsung s3, and my daughter's iPad. I think they are universal.
I suppose you could with the correct adaptors. It does not have Bluetooth.
In the HAFX30 models, the last letter denotes the color. (i.e. "B" for black, "S" for silver, "R" for red) The difference between the HAFX30 and the HAFR36 models is that the HAFR36 has a microphone.
According to the JVC website, 3.94ft (1.2m).
I would say no, you need to plug it in close to the router at first plus you need the security password to the router.
yes they do. you just might need to assign them manually through settings options as the active speakers. that is what happened to me, they didn't work immediately as a plug and play. I had to manually assign them.
Not sure I understand the question. If you mean can as splitter be put on to daisy chain I am not sure. Go to their website and ask them directly.
yes - you can play music from itunes. thier app is like any other radio app.
No. It requires an analog dvr to record. You would need an IP CAMERA to be able to record to PC. However, there are devices that convert analog to IP but at that point why not just buy an ip camera. Simple viewing may be done on any TV with composite (yellow) video.
It can, however there is a square IR filter over the sensor chip in the camera used to block IR light and improve picture quality. This filter can be removed to make the camera more sensitive to IR light by unscrewing the main lens and carefully pulling out the filter.
You can view these photographs (JPEGS) on any regular computer screen, even on your television screen as long as you are wearing the Red/Blue glasses. BTW, you can also make photo prints like you normally would for regular photographs and they come out even better. I suggest selecting your best shots then print those out. Good luck! I bought a second camera after i fell and crushed the screen on my first one. A GREAT buy at $27.99 absolutely, I paidf $100 originally.
I have the same problem. These are broken. We should warn people not to buy them. I just didn't bother to return mine.
Yes work very well
Thats where mine is and it works great!
Yes there is I have a stylus I keep there all the time
Yes, I believe it offers good protection to the corners of the IPad.
You can plug into the unit using a 3.5mm cord from the headphone jack of an MP3 player or iPod, etc, but there is no headphone out on it. The 3.5mm jack is an aux in.
I don't see why it wouldn't work with the IPad air, but it wouldn't attach to it because the IPad air is too thin.
Its not system based, I beleive it's based on what peripheral connections you have on your hardware.
If you are refering to the log in password, the default is either 1111 or 1234. not sure witch if you have set your own and forgotten it, then you will need to reset the whole unit.
There is no monitor included with this, I just used my pc monitor during the setup. Setup was pretty straight forward with no real issues. Only thing I found tricky was setting the system up through my router. Zmodo has a website that was a great help in opening ports on my wireless router. I now can view my cams from anywhere that has wifi.
I am using the modem from Cox.
Not unless the vendor issues an upgrade. And, I suspect that it could involve swapping the SD card for a new upgraded one.
Press the play/pause-symbols button to stop (pause) the recording playback; press the back button to return to the Recorded TV screen, and back again to return to the main media center screen.
yes
Yes it does its interchangeable. As for the sound I haven't had any problems.
White
Definitely
Absolutely. I used it to clean the inside of my computer and it took all the dust off easily.
Can says "residue free, moisture free...great for drying" but it contains bitterant
It's difficult to say because it depends on which laptops. If you are able to take the bottom plate off of your laptop then yes. But if you're just blowing into the vents then really you're blowing the dust into your computer and potentially causing more harm than good. You need to take it apart to a point where you can get the duster inside pointing outward if you want a good dusting.
Yes you can here.... case of 12 for $42.99. Search ASIN (Amazon Part#) B00HS3FMB4 and it will come up.
The battery has 5200 mAh printed on it and it doesn't say it replaces that number. On the battery it only says it replaces UM09H31, UM09H36, and UM09H41. Hope this helps in you search!
Yes constant power to keep the latch retracted. And yes it's Instant when power is removed
I honestly dont know.. I have never seen the E series.. I have the S series and its pretty nice. Its loaded with features, good on battery life, very light and easy to carry. The only thing that I dont really like is the proprietary charging adapter for the device and Bluetooth ear phones.. Other than that, this thing is awesome..
is it possible your headset is not charged?
Yes, they can be paired to BT devices, and like wise other BT headphones, speakers or headset can be paired to the player through normal pairing process.
yes
Yes, it has blue tooth, and I have "linked" it to my cell phone, but I don't use it on a regular basis for that. (I use it for Dragon Medical program.)
Yes, it has blue tooth, and I have "linked" it to my cell phone, but I don't use it on a regular basis for that. (I use it for Dragon Medical program.)
I used this for an AOC mobile Monitor E1649FWU with dimensions of 1.4" x 14.8" x 9.3" and had plenty of room to spare. You should be fine.
No
Dude, they don't make units specifically for each car.. Think about it.. Get a trim kit for your car ($15) and yes it will fit any car that had a radio originally.
I got mine about 3 years ago and its still going strong. I dont turn it off at all. Idk about the usb or the sd, but its a good reciever. Hope that helps
Call 911
I am using the latest version with Windows 7. It seems to work just fine.
No
I don't think so. I've looked at the specs and there is nothing about connecting the headset to a microphone. Simple to connect to most players for listening, but it sounds like you need a different kind of equipment. A quick search of Amazon brings up several specific sets for XBOX and Play Station. Try searching for "stereo headset with microphone" or "gaming headset" -- that should net surefire results.
No it doesn't. That's what I thought, ended up having to send it back.
Yes, this fits all 10.1" galaxy tablets.
With native (included) software, you can only play the formats listed in the description. However, with Rockbox installed (free!) you can play AAC, and MP4 files. It will not display much less play protected AAC files. I didn't have any MP4 audio files, but I loaded an mp4 video file and it played the audio from it. There's no way to play video on it that I know of (but I may be wrong). The video games that come with Rockbox are pretty tiny but most of the work well.
It has a slot for a Micro SD card. So if you want to download all your music, figure out how big all those files together are, and get a micro SD card big enough to hold everything.
It is not bluetooth compatible
negative. Old school but very functional
The only thing I can tell you is to contact the Jabra Customer Support at 1.800.327.2230.
Yes. Using a program like Windows Media Player, Media Monkey or iTunes you should be able to rip tracks from a CD to your Sansa Cilp's memory or an on board micro-SD card.
Works for me on Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.
Yes it does - plus an FM receiver and voice recorder
Hello. It is not bluetooth compatible.
It had the plastic laminate on the screen (the one you peel off) and it was in it's packaging. I had an old version of a sansa clip (that got stolen) so I got this to replace it. I really liked the product for running, which is why I got another one. It does feel light and plastic/cheap, but it had always performed well.
I use it in the car, as my radio does not work. No problem with the volume. I use Meelectronics ear phones. Choice of ear phones can make a huge difference in performance of any MP3 player. I worked in factories many years ago, and it would have been good in the places I worked. As for speakers, I don't know. I have never tried.
Hi Tom, This MP3 player also features a microSDHC card slot, so you can expand its memory by up to 32GB with a SanDisk microSD or microSDHC card**Card(s) sold separately. This is from here: http://www.sandisk.com/products/music-video-players/clip-zip/
Indeed. I did mean USB port, UBC was a typo. However to answer your question, when I ordered my Zip from AMAZON I was also given the option of ordering a accessories bundle. It included a charging cord that has a USB connection that plugs into an include adapter that can be plugged into any 110 volt outlet. Hope this helps you.
Sure you can use like a regular HD. No problem with that.
it does but ive never heard it go off here in florida. i have two of these and the displays are often unable to be seen, but i might have two defective ones?
Correct. The backlight is on as long as the device is getting volts. The internal battery is just an LR44 button cell that keeps the time and temperature functions running.
it takes great Pictures and I will be buying more I have a Cannon Rebel just so you know
No.
No it just has the plastic hole as shown in the picture. I had to scavenge tiny key rings to connect it to my key ring. The hole is just big enough for a standard key ring but it was not free to move. Its better to have a tiny ring or rope between it and your key ring.
Hi Steve, unfortunately we have only 5 pieces available. However we do have high quantity in other sandisk models.
Absolutely. I have last years MacBook Air. No difficulties whatsoever.
Yes this is a thumb drive u can drag and drop any file on this. I use it for mp3 files so my radio in the car can play them.
can't tell about the sony but my 13inch MacBook Pro fits in it comfortably with about 10mm to spare
The case is awesome. It definitely has more padding but yet it doesn't make it heavier. I can't say why but I bought it about 3 months ago and I'm very satisfied.
Sorry I am not sure. I have a 13inch macbook pro so I wouldn't know if it fits a samsung ativ9 plus.
No
Just from the hole placement, no. The hole placement would cover the webcam no matter how you oriented it. On the ThinkPad Tablet, the hole is in the top right for the ambient light sensor. On the Yoga, the webcam is in the middle. Also, the ThinkPad Tablet is a 10.1" screen. The Yoga is either 11" or 13". So it will not cover the screen itself either. Best suggestion I have is checking with armorsuit themselves to see if they plan on making one, or if they're working on it already.
Yes, it is. I fit my hp pavilion dv4 perfectly, AND even arrived with some juice in it. I popped it in and my laptop sprang to life!!!
No. This is only for the original Sony Tablet S. The xperia uses a different connector for charging.
Yes.
In the case of the usb you are able to add some storage space. I infact have a Sunpak 72 in 1 high-speed car readers. I got a cord USB to a small 5 pin. This will allow you to transfer data too and from the tablet. By using this feature it allows the tablet owner to install some apps without consuming large amounts of internal space.
I bought one to work with my iMac, and was disappointed in the sound. It added very little, and wasn't worth the money. I sent it back and got a refund.
Hello Yakov. The unit comes with an installation CD which has the drivers. It's quite an easy install process. In my "original" setup, my laptop was display 1 and my other monitor attached to my VGA output was display 2. With this new unit attached to a USB port, I now have display 3. Yes, it will work. :)
No it does not. Won't even initiate.
i have never tried that, but the instruction state that you can have up to 6 monitors.
No. Most older TV's have a standard AV input (red, white and sometimes yellow), so this DVI to HDMI converter will not work. You are looking for an HDMI to AVI connector. Also, look out for converters that are AVI to HDMI... not necessarily the same thing. You are looking for something like this http://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-Composite-S-Video-Converter-DA-HDRC/dp/B009TC9T7K/ref=pd_sxp_grid_pt_1_1
As long as it meets the voltage requirment for the modem.
Yes, the specs on the router call for 12v 1A, so this should work very well for your Netgear N300 Router.
yes it would work but you have to buy a converter from 110v to 220-240v
Yes it has a plug but I didn't see any rings to hang it up
Maybe 1/2 to an 1 inch. Not much clearance behind the screen when mounted to the wall. Either let the screen flow over the molding(not sure how thick it is) or place a small 1 X 1 X 1 board behind the projector's mounting holes so it sticks out more.
It should, I've used it on my 05 ford ranger
I would send this back to Amazon.Com or back to Car M.D.It's not my qualification to repair this.
No
it does not work at all! what you see on the keyboard is not what shows on screen. . .like if you type the letter g something like or a random number will be what you see on screen and what you get won't even be consistent every time! I returned it the same day it arrived. I might have tried to work with it but there are NO instructions and there is no contact number for the company and they don't offer tech support.
It doesn't work on the Iphone. Only Windows based programs.
mine are running on an input of 120 VAC.
Yes, it works fine in our 2013 A4.
Nope It doesn't work at all with 2012 models and above.
I'm going to assume all the newer VW use the same MDI cables. I used this on a 2013 CC and it worked intermittently, I purchased the original VW cable and it's been working fine ever since. So I'm going assume it's something to do with the cable... I wasn't the first one to have had this problem. My advice - just spend the extra $30 and get the OEM cable
it takes still photos as well
mine came with everything. as you will see with my review I would not purchase one again and have returned mine. Good luck.
yes it does. actually the microphone is quite remarkable as it does pick up voices and sounds from far.
yes
If you upload it to youtube, you can then send it anywhere.
Foscam claim 2A max at 5V
To my knowledge this issue was fixed. A friend of mine bought the same one as mine and it had a wider matte box, good luck with your purchase as I said for the price I do recommend it
Measured inside oval ear pad dimensions are 1 3/8" X 2 1/8". Inside depth is 5/8".
You can add just 1 preferably same make and model, don't mix the 500Mbps and 200Mbps models.
this is NOT a cable compatible modem. This modem is for DSL connection use only. You need to continue to search for a Cable Compatible modem... it should have a spot in the back for you to screw in your com cast cable line. Possibly refer to Comcast customer support for an updated list of compatible modems. I'd hate to spend the money and it doesn't do what you need.
Yes, this is the unit that I have with Centurylink (it was provided by them).
Generic LED key-chain flashlights can be purchased through Amazon; but if you are wanting a Twisted Veins branded one then I would suggest eBay or another online auction site as it doesn't appear that Amazon carries those at this time.
Yes, this cable is supposed to work with any HDMI device, including Apple TV devices.
No! You will have to use another method such as via your vga (video) port or other a/v port if your laptop has one. You may also be able to use USB to HDMI method but I cannot guarantee that it will work with your laptop.
It supports 3D HD - so it will not have a problem with a 2D TV. So, I see no reason why it wouldn't.
2 in the box...but don't waste you money. One came blown. Crackled as soon as I hooked it up.
Update: I saved you the trouble of looking it up...Yes! They should fit. The 94 Civic uses a 6 1/2 inch speaker size. Hope this helped! (^:~
Yes, you can plug it in via the mini usb and get to videos on the sd card. Also the Contour software works fine on Mac OS. I did have problems getting the videos into iMovie for editing though due to the odd format it is recorded in.
Yes it is. Check out: http://opteka.com/vm100.aspx
yup! it comes with a microusb to USB and as long as the USB is plugged into the computer with Lync on it, it will work. It also works with Lync phones, I use them on Polycom cx600's with no issues. I have about 85 users who use this with lync on the pc or lync phones.

They are just lights. What camera you use does not matter. They do need to be plugged into an outlet.
Only if you have archlinux installed and set up to use samba, the software that is preinstalled on the device needs pogoplug's servers to work
Full housing and lamp, you only need to remove the old one from the TV and slide this one into it's place.
11 5/8th inches.
I don't see a name anywhere, but the lamp has been working fine since it came in.
I've bought this lamp to replace my Y67-LMB, it is a Y66-LMB but it will work.
The lamp l purchased, through amazon, was an original lamp, & is performing excellent. R. Hayes
Try pressing and holding to ensure that you're getting both the focus and the shutter.
Yes, it does. You can adjust the balance point relative to where it attaches to a light stand, with a solid weight at the end....and so can tilt a reflector up or down and provide balance with less stress on the clips.
Yes, absolutely.
It will technically work but will not fit the flash hotshot. The a6000 marks a switch in the alpha bodies to the more universal can on-stage hot shoe while the model trigger uses the older Minolta style shoe
Check the company's website and call to verify the model number. I found them to be very helpful. Great piece of gear!
Yes, I haven't really explored it all but everything, so far, works great.
I bought mine on here.....
Yes-This model has two usb connectors. It works very well from my Motorhome to receive weak signals that I could not work with in most RV parks. It will usually bump the signal bars up from one or two to four or five and bring in wifi signals not normally received.
As far as I know it works well with most OS I know it works with Linux & windows 7 so I would assume it would work for 8 as well but I am NOT 100% sure! I would say you have a good chance that it would work. YOU WILL NEED TWO USB PORTS FOR THIS! It comes with a two port USB cable one end for power and one end for the WiFi.
You have to use a splitter to connect the two lines to the computer and plug the modem into the usb and that works for the two lines.
I don't understand the question. If you mean can it be plugged into a 120 volt 60 hz outlet, the answer is Yes.
If your Karakoke player has an HDMI port or RCA audio/video outputs, you should be able to connect your system.
ADOUT A HOUR AND A HALF
Yes it did
Did you select TV Antenna before the scan? IF the TV is scanning looking for Cable channels, it will only find the VHF Channels (Ch 2+13). On air channels above channel 13 are not the same frequency as Cable channels. Hope this helps...................
Sam 2 GB, 4GB, 8GB, 16 GB SD Card makes the recording time. With 2GB card & normal setting I got about 45 mins.
Yes, both screens have headphone hook up. Don't think there is any capacity for wireless.
You can still use it but you just can't go online or anything that require Wi-Fi/internet. Hope this answer your question. :)
Yes. It has bluetooth capabilities in settings.
I use it on a vista ultimate computer and it works great...I'm pretty sure that all PS3's already have wifi capabilities
It should work as long as you have the little discuss attachment on the pen tip.
Yes. The Phillips only wants HDMI signal "in". Your Dish receiver provides HDMI "out"; a match made in heaven.
Try letting it charge for a bit first. It operates off an internal battery as far as I can tell, and the power charges it.
No it won't work with the Logitech Unifying Receiver. You will have to use the receiver that comes with it.
no
6-8 hours depending on volume
Yes
I'll use any Amazon recommends. I bought a wall mount but never installed it. The TV stands comfortably on the base it came with.
Honestly I have no idea about that phone, I used it with my galaxy 3 and it worked great! I also gave up on the adhesives/metal ring which sucked and used crazy glue!
Yes
yes. it works for anything that has a small camera lens that the magnetic ring will fit around.
It does not mute the mic when raised. The mic volume is adjustable if the software you are using to connect with allows you too, but is not adjustable on the headset itself.
Good luck I have never been able to get it to work on my iMac or Mac book.
Yes, the frequencies stored are not lost if the unit is unplugged or the batteries are removed or become depleted.
It fits a D3200 but I don't know if it fits the 3300.
32 gig sd chip or 16gig flash drive
Yes, if you turn the frame, the next picture will display in the orientation that you have, either landscape or portrait. The picture may not fill up the frame if the picture is shaped better to fit portrait and you turn the frame for landscape for example. I hope this helps!
Yes, it will work.
No.
These are 58mm screw in extension lenses. If your camera accepts a 58mm filter. They will work. They go on top of an existing lens.
Yes
Yes
far as I know, if your current lens is removable - auto focus, etc. should operate OK pjc
No. They do not work. I just tried it out. I don't listen to music on my S4 but I just downloaded some songs from my Amazon Cloud Player and while you can listen to the music with the earbuds you can NOT control anything from the button on the wire. It works great on my iPod touch but not my S4. Great buds other than that part.
it's new, not sure about the warranty don't want to say, although i am leaning towards yes.
According to what Nyrius told me, that is not possible due to some communication regulations.
Yes Seth this would work. Remember the home plus has a 100 foot line of sight range. if you are going through walls and floors it will reduce the range.
I have that setup and I haven't had any problems.
Sorry, it does not, it will only duplicate the existing screen, basically just doubles the view... Good for two monitors pointing different ways...
No, this is for a DisplayPort, not a USB Port. Two different things. Unfortunately the HDX doesn't have native HDMI out like the Fire HD had (micro HDMDI).
Displayport, nor vga carry Audio. You need HDMI for that.
All you should need for video is a Vga Cable. You can get them in many long lengths. If you want to use the computer based controls. You will need two Ethernet cables and a cheap router (easiest way)
Yes
I used the USB 3.0 cable on my Seagate drive connected to my Lenovo Leafpad without any problems. If your device has a standard USB 3.0 connector, I would say yes, but, I can not say for certain.
The top of the stand has a 3/8" stud. You would need a 3/8" to 1/4-20 adapter. I would also want a ball joint so you could adjust the angle of the camera. I guess you are wanting to get your camera high, if so you might consider a Cowboy studio light stand which comes with a 1/4-20 stud. Cost on Amazon was $13.00. You would still need the ball joint.
James it maxes out at 10ft wide. I have a 10x24 ft green screen. It will accommodate your banner in terms of weight, but if it's wider than 10ft you will have issues.. This is not a cheap stand in my humble opinion. I love it. Hope this helps you.
Yes you have to buy clamps. If the sheet was large enough, I suppose you could drape it over the top bar but that would mean more weight on that bar and some likely movement of the sheet.
This is not a router. It is a wireless Access Point. You still need a router to control the traffic. You can connect this to one of the ports on the router and disable the wireless from the router. Setup is easy, plug it in, run the CD.
It should. It works with my EOS M, SL1, and 5D Mklll.
Yes, the HDMI does carry audio.
Component videoand Coaxial/Toslink audio have to be the source for this converter.
I've had no problem with the Bluetooth staying connected. Only problem I've had is the speaker volume is very low when connected with another helmet.
I was never able to get the Trio to reliably connect to internet and bluetooth did not work either. I sent mine back for a refund and bought a tablet from Walmart.
Don't buy this
Yes. In fact, according to the specs it supports 900ma to each port. It has an overall rating of 4A.
MANUFACTURER ANSWER: Thanks for asking! We have not test this hub in a scenario like this. Technically it looks like it may be supported based on this documentation from Apple: http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202034 The hub certainly has enough power for your AudioQuest Dragonfly.
Indeed you can, Here is a sample I did http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX88penHsvQ
As large as any house with 1electric meter. It uses the home wires. My house is 5000+ feet and has no problems.
You plug them into the socket and that's it! (They will all be connected to each other, as long as they are in the same circuit panel)
As they said these are power-line intercoms, It should go far as the power-line in the house goes. But the wiring at the house needs to be all grounded. Even if one outlet is not grounded, you will have to do the setup steps base on their user's manual. This is what happened to me. So far I am happy with it. This sellers has a lot of useful information on their page. Make sure that you read them or check with the manufacturer (seller) directly. The made this intercoms, they should know better
it can fit a six-pack of beer with some room left, so yes.
I think so. I've traveled to Asia with it a few times and you can fit a laptop charger bottle of water and a change of clothes in there.
The grab strap and everything else on the bag is excellent quality. My kid uses as book bag for school, i.e. good for everyday use.
Depends on how much stuff is in it and your style. People usually wear across back because it's not a purse and can bike with it on that way but whatever suits you works.

There is a lever that allows you to make the strap as long or short as you need. You can roll up the slack with an elastic. It works great. When I use mine for biking I keep the strap short so the bag sits higher, when I walk with it I loosen it.

Large is humongous. My 17 inch laptop fits in the laptop part of the medium just fine.
Yes, there is a slot on the back of the bag that you can insert the handle of a rolling suitcase into.

The main strap is designed to go across the body diagonally. There is then a smaller detachable strap to connect the main strap, diagonally in the other direction, back down to the bag.

Hi Lawrence. The X2000 works very well with a DSL modem. You would love to have this.
Yes, you can, just as you would without it.
This is a pressure sensitive tablet where the opacity and thickness of the line can be adjusted in the pen. It is very precise and most high end apps - PS, LIGHTROOM, ONONE, NIK, PAINTER ETC - have Wacom ready controls built in. It is the most precise tool available and Wacom has great customer service. There are several models available including touch screens.
You need a sata cabel to connect to it, Other side of cabel to Sata Drive!
You would need an extension cord type adapter. The armor wont allow the body of the card reader to get close enough to the ipad body to make contact. The cords are short and very inexpensive though.
Yes, I live in Korea and charge my American laptop with it every day.
Yes, it fits perfectly!
No. Please do NOT buy this product. It is VERY slow and crashes a great deal until it stops working completely. I threw mine away because it finally stopped working. Save your money for something else. ANYTHING ELSE!!!
I don't know about rhapsody, but I would NOT buy the Philips Connect. The screen locks up and will not respond until I reboot it using the end of a paper clip.
Yes?
This is for servers that has slots capable of supporting ECC fully buffered DDR2 DIMMS. Non-ECC has different slots. Some older mac desktop servers may have this slot, but I am not sure.
No
240-pin DDR2-533 and DDR2-677 FBDIMMs can be used according to motherboard pdf...it should work
It will work, but the results wouldn't be optimal. This is a DX lens and you have an FX camera. The FX is a larger sensor than the DX so you will not make full use of the larger sensor. So if you already own the lens use it. If you are thinking of buying this lens, spend some more and take full advantage of your FX sensor (AKA frame).
Is this a trick question. Whomever makes Tamron lenses.
Yes it should work perfectly fine. The only reason why it wouldn't work is if the actual port is broken.
Yes. it can be used in a 3.0 port, but I don't think you will get 3.0 performance. I can test it later for you if you like.
Yes. Mine is 10" and it fits perfectly. A 12" should not be a problem as it's sturdy enough for bigger tablets plus I've got a heavy cover on it coz I have a 3 yo boy.
I have an iPad mini and it works fine, but anything thicker might not stay on the little leather strip.
I think it's fake leather, but it's high quality and very durable. My pair are 2 years old and look new.
The Garmin Edge 200 does track elevation changes. Plots starting elevation and shows elevation change over total ride.
Yes.
It is very quiet. The keys are almost flesh even with the board so you dont have to press hard on the keys.
No
Yes, it has been a real great headset. It is a little heavier than most, but it won't snap apart easily.
More comfortable than a pair of Beats, I suppose, but....I'm not sure if I would advise sleeping on your side with something jammed into your ear in any set of circumstances...
Yes...it is split in the back up the middle and a flap in the very center of the cover. Once you get it over the TV, everything velcros back together to keep it secure. We have been very happy with this cover.
I do not think they make this model any more. I also love this camera but looks like the FZ200 is also a great model and the price price has dropped almost three hundred dollars. I am thinking of buying it, it is suppose to be so much better in low lite.
Yes, my son has had it hooked up to his flat screen and it sounds incredible!
The bass is really awesome... but I don't know what durherm ds-r4 is?
It's sadly underpowered for the size. I wouldn't get it.
No case. Battery: Sony NP-F550:7.2 volt at 3000 mAh Li-ion
Sure, you can burn the recordings to BluRay ... however, depending on how your cable company flags the broadcast, its very possible that the burned recordings will only be playable on the PC that made them (premium channels in particular with "high value" content, e.g. HBO HD movies, etc.)
No
Hi There. Yes, this headset will definitely work with that Cisco phone system. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Well, you can, but is stands up with the long axis in the verticle, so unless you have a table which puts the open Kindle at eye level, it is not very useful for reading.
According to the Owner's Manual: "The device supports the following file types: Maps and GPX waypoints from MapSource, and GPI custom POI files from Garmin POI Loader." and it goes onto explain how to connect the Nuvi to your computer with a USB cable.
Yes.
Yes, mine does.
very easy to use.. though I thought it plays blue ray.. it does it very nice for normal dvds
fairy easy but don't expect to use the same license you installed on win7 to work on win8, that happened to me and they wouldn't allow me to activate it on the PC I upgrades 6 weeks after I bought it.
I think it should. I used it for a Nikon AF-S DX Zoom 18-105mm lens. The base of each lens seems to be the same. There should be 7 screws in the mounting, if I remember correctly. (and 2 or 3 different sizes, so keep track of which one goes where.)
Yes we ship to Puerto Rico
No
no...but i hear the model above this one may be able to do that. My kid tried to get webkinz on mine already and it didn't work.lol
Yes mine is wired to the boat and yes Its in u.s. measurements as well
You need an elgato game capture to record. This just gives you more HDMI ports.
No, that's not true. But the tiniest amount of WiFi interference will knock out your connection to this thing. I rarely, if ever, have the same problem with an Apple Airport Express connected to some powered speakers.
Yes. Leave it on. In fact, if there is a power failure the whole re-booting, re-linking process needs to start over again from step-1. It's an overly complicated and one can tell Philips designed it, not Apple.
Sure, it'll work
The Samsung Galaxy S5 and Note 3 both are able to charge via the standard Micro USB charger as well. They will both dock perfectly to the Micro USB connector. It will work just the same.
No...On my case, the both wifi and wired connections failed at the same time, no way you can make the speakers to sound again. If you really want a real nice sound at audiophile level, you should check out the KEF X300A Digital Hi-Fi Speaker System. It's the true audiophile speakers for the computers and MP3 player. Google the reviews on the speakers on you own.
I'm only using these speakers with wired connection - cannot make these work wireless !! People writing about these sparkers are difficult to setup is soo right !!,
I'm sorry I can't answer that. I had the 2010-2011 Spring edition. Therefore, I ordered my battery from amazon using the numbers off the original battery. Sorry I couldn't be of any help. Dec 10, 2014 by Terri Burton
I am sorry that mouse you got is not working properly. I think that you got a defective unit. I have mine for couple of years now and it works fine.
Its just a connector. You connnect positive wire to positive wire and negative to negative. Its doesnt matter what you connect to what it just makes that connection secure.
Yes, it work perfectly for my keyboard. I have a Toshiba Satellite L775.
It uses a micro USB port to charge it. I'm sure any device that provides power to the USB will charge the unit.
Hey Joseph, I don't know. It dose not seem to work for me. But I may not have something set right. I was more interested in navigating then anything else, which it dose very good. If you contact Emprum at support@emprum.com I'm sure they could answer your question.
My battery, although it performed well for the first 2 months, has died!
This same battery I purchased did not have a date on it, however after two months it looked like an hour glass, so no return. If this is two years old at this point it might already be dead.
Yeah- double clicking it lets you track forward.
As far i could find on the web... no, you cant use it on your gateway pc. Why? Because your pc's motherboard has a cpu socket type bga413 and this AMD processor needs a FM1 socket, so they are not compatible. Maybe those at frys think different due to both processors are from the APU family... but those were my findings. Sorry.
It fits my ipod. Ipod and galaxy dont take the same plug in. So I dont think so.
I have a 2012 SLK, and I believe this is a standard connection that should work
Yes - this will work. I have a 2009 ML 350 and I replaced my part #18278504 with this. It works beautifully.
It worked just fine for me
It should, I've been getting a little static, and I send this from house right out to backyard, it might work, but I'm just not sure, maybe make sure to plug it in with a ground adapter.....
I don't know about a tablet I have never owned one. It opens like a laptop and the screen turns 180 degrees and then closes again so u can hang it on a headrest.
I haven't experienced a problem with it.
Hello there! Yes, it does. After taking a picture, you can display it, click on the Menu button, scroll down, and you'll see the options for "Trimming..." and "Resize...". Merry Christmas!
You don't have to attach the cable to make the battery grip work. On the low end Canon models they weren't design to work with a batter grip that has a shutter button on it. The cable allow you to use the shutter button on the Battery grip. So if you turn the camera side way, you can press the shutter button on the battery grip instead of using the camera's shutter button. If you don't attach the cable, the shutter button on the grip will no work.
Yes it would replace your current radio and no you can't plug your antennae into the radio. I purchased the SiriusXM - Connect Satellite Radio Vehicle Tuner model SXV200V1 at Best Buy. I believe that it can be purchased on Amazon as well. Installation is a snap, sound is very good and so far no problems with the XM and this radio.
Adjust the location and turn on Dm+, this improved the sound in my car.
If it is the same model. Should be no problem
It works great at night. The view behind your car is illuminated by the backup lights (which also power the camera on my car). Also, the camera I got also works in infrared - so even if the backup lights were burned out, I would still see a picture (I think). But maybe you mean "does it work just as a mirror at night?" Yes, it works fnie as a mirror. When the LCD display is off, it's a great mirror, with a much wider view than the mirror that came with the car.
I would not worry about the transfer rate. There are more negative reviews on this product. Do NOT waste your money buy another brand.
It uses a 7200 RPM drive. Version 1 used a 5900 RPM drive. Both are SATA III with 64MB cache.
Not sure. I have am 04 s4 and they worked great.
I believe it is 110-220 switchable
It worked fine for me for 30 days, unfortunately then I had to flash an unlocked BIOS as it would no longer charge when on. Haven't had any problems since flashing BIOS; it's been 6 months now and everything works great.
I also had a T61 that I gave to my sister. I ordered this battery below and it worked great. I tried the other option they listed from discountbatt and it' only lasted about 45 min. Image 7200mAh 9cell Battery IBM ThinkPad R61i R61 14-Inch Wide - Levono ThinkPad T400 fits 42T5225 42T5227 42T5262 42T5264 42T5229 Laptop Notebook Mai Sold by: BrainyDeal Hope that helps you.
Yes. It works on my R400. I think T400 shares most features with R400n, including battery.
The warranty from nikon is 12 months. Amazon will also sell extended warranty.
I do not have notebook (sorry), however, Belkin Dock Connector Cable F8Z361-NK, allows to connect iPhone and iPad to S1200pj projector to view the Slideshow from i devices. Unfortunately, this cable is not bilateral.
I don't remember exactly, but it included the camera, a battery, a cable to connect the camera to the computer and for charging the battery, some CDs of software & manuals and the instruction booklet. It did NOT include a separate battery charger that you can plug into the wall, you have to charge the battery with the cable while the battery is in the camera. I bought a 3rd party battery wall charger and extra battery so I could charge one battery while using the other battery in the camera.
As far as I know, there is not a multiple picture ability on the model I won.
I have the 12 megapixel camera and I don't think I would take it down more than 25 ft. However, I thought I read that one of the newer models was good for about 50 some feet. They are great little cameras. I took mine to Guadalupe Island for some great white shark "cage diving" and got some fantastic pics!
Hi, this Sony Lens SEL24F18Z is an E-mount lens. Whereas you Sony A7r is an E-mount body type camera. This lens will work perfectly on your A7r. In addition, all E-mount lenses will work on all E-mount body type, like the A7r. Hope this helps. -Ely
Yes, it's wider angle since it's a 24mm vs. a 35mm lens giving you a wider field of view. Compared to your 35mm f1.8 OSS, it doesn't have OSS.
Depends on the lens not camera. Typically a lens like this can focus as close as 10 inches and has maximum magnification of .3x meaning an object must be at least 3x the size of the sensor to fill up the entire screen.
Yes.
More importantly... what doesn't come in the box: A rear lens cap... sure you could argue that you don't need one since you'd always keep the lens on the camera and any secondary Sony lens you buy will come with one. But it would be nice to have a spare. The other thing you will want to get right away is a spare battery. They do last a long time, but that just makes it easy to forget to charge it between each outing. It takes forever to charge an empty battery so you will want an extra.
I don't think there is an actual limit. I use a 64 gb card and it works fine
support
Yes you are right. its a amazing camera
yes, our comapny sends to Asia
This battery is fully decoded.
i looked in my owners manual for my model phst96 theres no other remote available that i know of call their customer service dept at .(718) 535-1800..thats the pyle service center....if yours is under warranty they may replace yours free, if not they will send you one at the reg. price.. good luck....
Please contact our support to better assist you in this matter 1-800-575-9885
Yes it does. I have an Otter Box case and it fits fine. :)
In the auxiliary jack.
Yes, they all do. HOWEVER..... I have also purchased the "Canon 60D for Dummies" book. I've also purchased two "Canon 60D" videos that I highly recommend. I was in a diabetic coma last year and it has really affected my reading comprehension. So I do better now with videos. This is a great camera and lenses, I'm very happy with mine. I got some great fire fighting aircraft action shots using the 70-300 zoom shortly after getting it.
No. It does not support stealth technology.
absolutely, try it and you'll see that really works
If they have a receiver that sees the Mghz that this operates on, I would think so.
It fits my 13" Air in a neoprene sleeve, so odds are it will also fit the pro.
Uhm if I remember correctly, a charger for the device and an Aux cord. Everything you ultimately need is provided
This kit will work with anything tha has a hot shoe and is excellent for its value i bought and I use with both my cameras and as at yet I have not encountered any problems and believe you me I use it do not thin No about it I do not think you gt a better deal, michael El
Yes! I had to buy a cable that will work with the bees.. if you have the sync cord that came with the bee, it works.. this one that comes with the triggers isn't the right mm.. but they work great with the bees!
try the canon 17 55 f/2.8
Yes mine came with Canon EW-83H Lens Hood and the following. Canon E-77U II Front Lens Cap,Canon Lens Dust Cap E (Rear),Canon LP1219 Soft Lens Case,Lens Cap Keeper,SSE Microfiber Cleaning Cloth
I use it on a 40D and other Canon DSLR. It is compatible with all.
I'm 99.9% sure it will. I checked the battery on amazon and it has the correct volts 3.7 and the contacts will match up.
It works on an iPad. Is there another kind of tablet that counts?
I have not used this item on the Kindle Fire.
You need to have a low profile graphics cards. And a stronger power supply.
Yes, it will charge the internal battery as well as powering the laptop.
No
Yes. Both in the mini-tower and the thinner desktop form factors. If installed in the desktop, change the full-height bracket, to the included two half-height brackets. (you won't need the second half-height bracket if you're not using the VGA connector. You'll need small pliers to unfasten the nuts.
It will fit an apple iphone 4.
No... not an eight channel sound system. It is a well-made, compact sound bar that produces good sound for a modest price.
It's only set up for 110v You will need a converter
it costs $95 to ship it
You can connect it and talk/listen using the headset but you still need the handset to open/close the call. So it is not a "full" solution.
It will work but it will only be 11 megapixel and probably vignet on the wide in quite a bit. I think you would be better served with the 24-75mm, 24-70mm or Konica Minolta 17-35mm.
At 16 it could be if it's a big room. However, IMO, I think the 11-18 would work much better to get a complete wall to wall view of a room/several rooms at the same time.
It's actually run inline with the RCAs.
There is only one Tripod and one Camera Carrying case available. I'm not sure about what do u mean by Cap Keeper Carrying case...
Don't know. Only used it to charge iPhone.
I am not sure, it works in China.
It brings everything, including the battery abd the charger. I got it for my son and he is in love with the camera. I recommend it.
Yes, everything you see on the picture you get; although I was disappointed with the tripod because its too lite for the camera.
Yes, everything the camera and the lenses came in the original canon boxes. And the bag and the tripod too. The only thing that didnt come in an original box is the sd card. But beside that everything came great its a pretty good deal.
Not sure. Mine malfunctioned and I had to return it. A couple of the numbers on the keyboard would not type. But the notebook was nice.
Simple answer, yes. It contains a booklet with codes too so you can see exactly what is going wrong during boot up. If it sometimes doesn't boot up, could be dust build up.
Ask the seller a question and make sure he/she understands that you want a PCIE one. It was my first time diagnosing my computer, and it was fairly simple.
No to both. There are three indicator lights - sleeping, charging, and accessing internet.
Robyn Garland, I tried to use an external portable for CD on this Wolvol small computer, but it did not work, so I am just assuming that it might not also work for an external portable for DVD.
no..device only good for output in hdmi format..on device has hdmi output already..only has likerca jacks..not any good for anything really.to hook up any dervice that not hdmi output need hdmi converter
From the Amazon website there are additional warranty options available. I did not need any of them so I cannot offer any additional information.
You should be able to use the projector's menu commands: Extended, Projection, Front/Ceiling. This information comes from the "EX3210/EX3212/EX5210/EX7210 User's Guide" (https://files.support.epson.com/pdf/ex3210/ex3210ug.pdf), under Projection Modes and Changing the Projection Mode Using the Menus (pages 54-55).
Yes it is
No. You would need to buy one, but it does have a built in speaker. However I recommend you find some other sound option because the built in speaker is pretty small
It works with my Deltas and my Tangos with no problems.
sorry impossible
yes, if you use the electronic shutter, the lens should be without any blurring issues. it is the first shutter curtain that causes vibrations and makes most of images at 42mm blurry regardless if OIS is on or off.
It should be possible it seems (I have only Panasonic bodies, so I haven't tested it): http://www.four-thirds.org/en/special/download.html
My android does not work with pandora on the headunit, but I'm still on ICS and I don't have the full version of pandora. Sony's website claims both work.
its not safe to watch any thing and drive be careful on the road just not safe
Nope. It can play DVD's; however, the inlet for the CD/DVDS player on mine came broken so I can't even do that. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS RADIO!! Spend just a little more and you'll be glad you did.
When you plug it to the each computer, and perform the backup you can rename each backup according to its PC. And how do you backup a system. Go to start control panel backup and restore and follow the instructions. Hope that helps
hello. which is buy 1TB or 1000GB but that was the description of the equipment
It is great. I am happy with it. Certainly beats my old external drive.
Gigi, it'a good question. Actually I am installing a Windows 7 in my notebook....
Yes, absolutely. It's a nice feature because it's hidden behind the faceplate. The button in the top right corner makes the faceplate swing open and reveal the single CD player.
Yes, it has phono (record player) and CD input. Your question was cutoff about output. It's a good amplifier, I like it a lot.
Works fine. That is what I too have. I use the Windows 7 Back up program for backing up my computer to the Toshiba Canvio.
Yes, this does come with the USB cable.
Sure you can! I had a Dell a now an HP and its the same. You can use it as any flash memory in any lap or desktop.
It is great. I am happy with it. Certainly beats my old external drive.

I don't know.
I have a Droid Razr Maxx and it would not play music through my auxiliary port on my pioneer head unit in my car ...
Five feet
I havent tried that. I just used it to charge my headphones.
I'm not sure. Why don't you try contacting Sony at 877-865-7669. They were the ones who steered me in the direction of Amazon for the part I needed. If this one doesn't fit, they can give you the correct part number and tell you which third-party vendor has it. Good luck.
I have both. PS3: 60+ watts for BD Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio. Roku: 4 watts - for Stereo Programs, Netflix, Hulu+, etc... of the 470 Channels available, I have new tech & gamer programs that I now follow every week. BBC World News 24/7 is available.
It works on my Mac mini from around 2006 (Snow Leopard). The track pad doesn't work anymore. But the keypad part works fine.
Yes it does
Yes
You have to pop it off its kind of hard. Don't worry about breaking anything it'll come off!
We were not in India. I believe I used this adapter in Bhutan. I think it's the same one. If so, it worked fine. But again, it wasn't India.
Yes you can adjust the length of each leg, like on the old "rabbit ears" for TV, to adjust for the frequency range you want to listen too.
I have had trouble getting it to work at all. it's very flimsy and difficult to mount. You can extend or shorten the arms to any length for almost any frequency band.
Not integrated; you need to buy the add-on soundbar that clips onto the bottom of the monitor. The monitor has a power port for the soundbar, so it minimizes cabling.
We purchased the same kit and my husband replaced them. TV works perfectly.
If the modem needs 12Vdc at less than 1A and accepts a 5.5mm center-hot power.connector, then yes. But Frontier is an ISP, not a modem manufacturer, so nobody can really answer this question. You would have to at least provide a model number off of the modem in order to get a reliable answer.
Yes
Its depends of the year of the mac mini, but in my imac 2010 works perfectly
I have had my system only about 10 months, but batteries are still strong.
Both the flash and battery charger are included in the box.
Depends on how well lit the "inside" is at the moment the photos are taken. I'd used it in museums where no flash was allowed, and had to increase the ISO to about 1600 to get clear shots. Photos taken at ISO 1600 on this camera is acceptably good with a bit of noise but not too bad. Also, do use a faster lens with a wider aperture, such as the Panasonic 20mm F1.7 pancake lens.
I'm not sure-my computer is a late 2011 and it worked great.
No
I got this cable and it did not work at all and there was no way to return it to get my money back. My emails to them went unanswered. Stay away.
Yes this unit will boost your cell head set jack as well.
Yes you can!
Yes, I have the same model and it amplifies it about 3 times my opinion and the bass is insane with it!
Ive used this for everything games, movies, and music going on 3 years. I get about 4.5 to 6 hours a charge just keep additional powerbank attached For extended use. The blue mode is the best overall.
I believe it will; both 1/8"-outputs are amplified, and I think they're individual amplifiers because there is no volume-change when the 2nd headphone is inserted. You might have some trouble with volume, as headphones usually have higher voltage than Audio-IN or LINE-IN (which is 1Vrms full-scale)
Yes, I did make sure that this adapter will fit the SMC Pentax-M 50mm Lens to the Canon EOS.
Approx 5'
It should, but it didn't work for me. I tried it on several TVs. Seems that the cable itself doesn't even work. Maybe I just got a bad cable...
Yes. The only problem I've had with the cam is the USB arm has given out. It no longer stays in the bottom of the cam. I've had to scotch tape the arm down. And now because the arm has been opened and closed so many times, my computer no longer recognizes when it is attached. Guess I wore it out.
Based on a review of the owner's manual for this item, there is a flash/flashlight. In the settings menu, the user can "select a flashlight mode: [On], [Off] or [Auto]." In addition, "the camcorder has an automatic white-balance correction. This enables you to record both indoors and outdoors where the amount of light in the environment changes."
Go on-line to the Logitech web site, put in the model number of the headset if you have it, and you should find the instructions. Otherwise find headsets, and that should lead you to the proper instructions.
No
Yes
I've used it on a gripped D200 and gripped D5100, both worked fine. I think it is pretty universal with or without a grip.
I thik It would, the seting is very flexible.
It's pretty universal. It attaches where you attach to your tripod. The straps adjust from there.
I received USA Gear itself, but have other issues with the product. You would need to open this from bottom every time that you would need to charge the battery.
yes but i wouldnt bother the sound is horrible
No
works with Mac OS up to 10.8
The two speakers can be mounted upright on the stands provided and are 15" long. They can also be connected with the bracket provided and then measures 32 inches horizontally.
Yes,it 's dimension 77mmx44.5mm fit Sony Nex 3/5/7, A35, A55 and Olympus E-PL3.
The LAEA4 gives you all the features below Nex Mount Adaptor? Which one? Need more details to answer. with A mount lenses. Focus Points : 15-point AF system with 3 cross sensors AF Modes : Continuous AF, Single-shot Focus System : TTL phase detection system
No
I installed one for a garage 80' away. It worked for a few months and quit. Same thing happened with a second one installed for a apartment
I have a NEX-5T and the view finder works just fine. I am able to do a better job of framing my shots that when looking at the screen. It is a bit pricey but I'm glad I got it.
This particular headphone is not blue tooth capable.
While using a High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) cable to connect your digital equipment, such as Blu-ray player or digital cable box, it is the best way to get the most out of your high-definition television. You can use your S-video cable, you just won't get the best picture.
Hi Sandy, sorry to hear you're having problems. Make sure your settings on your television are set properly. Make sure what ever port your cable is plugged into is the same port in your TV settings. If this doesn't correct the problem, feel free to contact PlugLug. Thanks!
You can use USB or optical port.
It works for my Intuos Manga Pen and Touch :3
Don't know
I'm not sure but I found their customer support to be outstanding. Very fast replies. You can email them at: care@kdLinks.com
No it did not
Fat32 for sure i dont know bout the rest of them, i would recomend the newest version though, its pricier but def worth it . i own them both
Yes it will.
I don't think so. I have this bino and can't see a place to mount the tripod. Ask REI as well.
Yes. USB 3.0 Standard-B plug to USB 3.0 Standard-A.
The enclosure does not have any power management features, just an on-off power switch. If your operating system supports it, it can spin down the drive.
I was unable to use it. It didn't fit what I bought it for I just kelp it.
I believe it will work for this model.
Yes its a good cable, I have been it for my Acer tablet and Rt Surface.
You don't need a driver, you need a pair of scissors or a sharp knife. The Surface hdmi port is at a slight angle, you need to shave down the plastic around the small connector to get it to align better. Mine works great after this adjustment.
Google it. It should be some where in your setting. I think its under accessibility or accessory for the option to turn on that feature.
Yes it will since that's what I have. Haven't had a problem yet.
Like a charm. That is what I bought it for.
into the tower is what I would do.
they might be more designed for apple devices. they have a volume and mute control on them that work with i phone and i pad. but i have an extra long cord i bought with mine that i use for listening to my yamha stereo with and they sound great with that as well as my apple devices.
None of the headphones compatible with iDevices work with other devices in the same way... Microphone won't work for sure and you won't be able to change volume as well.. The only thing you can expect to work is play/pause button which can also be used to skip tracks.. Hope that helps...
They fit well and look and feel like originals, just built a bit differently. Does not affect their installation onto the headphones.
If I remember correctly 2 gig of ram and a 250Gb Hd were stock. Min is upgraded to 8Gb of ram and an SSD for the system drive.
No! The outside size of the N40L is 9.5 inches, and the vertical space inside is even smaller than 4". This is a server, true, but the possible hacks are very constrained by the server's small size. If the small size is one of your requirements, you must give up the possibility of plugging in large cards. A 4"x4" card is problematic. However, if you want a lot of drives in a file server or peer, this is a great little box. But no large cards.
I have the N40L. I have found it to be reliable when runing Windows Home Server 2011. I have no experience with the N54L.
Nope! New ones are out for the III.
Yes. I have the soundlink 1 that I purchased with the nylon cover. The leather cover fits perfectly and is super easy to install.
Mine did not work either on a later model MacBook Pro and it was brand new. Seems like its a piece of garbage and we should be refunded our money back.
Not sure, bought as a replacement for my son's MB Pro. It is about 4 years old. He said it works fine. Not sure if that helps?
Yes. I have tested this. It may take a while to pull the table of contents if you have a lot of movies on the drive.
It plays everything exactly like a DVD. I have all the DVD menu and bonus features of my movies from the portable hard drive. I asked the same thing before I got it.
aftermarket, but same image quality as OEM part, I had an excellent experience with this LCD.
It certainly sounds like your display is broken. Replacing the display takes some patience, tools, and isn't too expensive. Be sure to keep the internal frame around the old display for use with the new replacement display. The one from Amazon isn't exactly what you see in the German You Tube video.
According to Samsung, it is completely compatible with the MAC OS http://www.samsung.com/au/consumer/pc-peripherals/optical-disc-drive/dvd-rw/SE-208AB/TSBSA-features (bottom of page)
Save your money unless you have an exterior antenna to hook this up to. I can only receive two stereo radio stations and am sorry I didn't return it when I had the chance. Don't know if you need anything more as I can't use this thing except for discs.
Simple answer is yes. But in addition to that you can push the wheel left and right for scrolling left and right.
It will also work in XW8000
what happened now its unavailable
There's only an aux in -- no aux out, so the answer is no. If you go to the Philips site, the have a photo of the back of the unit and you'll see there's only an input for the power and an aux input. http://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/DS8530_37/for-ipod-iphone-ipad
No, but you can get an adapter at radio shack that sits on the 30 pin adapter and converts it to the lightening adapter to fit the iPad 4 and it will make it so your iPad will sit on the dock.
Yes, as long as you buy a "truck style" box. Can be found at best buy or a window tint alarm audio shop. Usually.
The shallow mount will most likely have a smaller magnet on the back for truck style boxes. A smaller magnet can make less bass regardless it's power handling capabilities. But you can fit it in really small boxes.
I do not have a ported box, but these subs do hit really good in my single cab chevy!
It should be fine, you may just have to adjust your bass levels
6 gauge wiring kit
No handles, unfortunately. I wish there were, and actually thought about sewing some on somehow. There was no neoprene odor at all.
i dont know all i know is that it was defective and thwe customer service was lousy it cost me over 150 in usage fees i contacted them many times and got no help when i wanted to return it for a refund they said i had to pay for return shipping i wouldnt reccomend anything they sell
Only if each can accommodate hdmi canl
Sorry we don't
It is not natively 7.1 no, but, I use the software at the "Razerzone" web site under products and software called "Surround" to give just about any headset 7.1 surround sound. Works great with this one too!
Like most keyboards, it has little "feet" that pull out to give it just the right angle.
In my opinion it works exactly the same. The clear button on the number pad is very hand and not found on windows keyboards but works great on this keyboard. Also, the volume, eject, play, pause etc buttons work just like the Apple keyboard as well.
yes it is since in the steelseries website you will see while downloading the upgrade engine there is a mac version
This is probably 1 of 2 issues, either you arent plugging it in all the way and its losing connection, or your usb port is going bad/isnt up to date/is conflicting. I have win 8 64 bit and only the laser sensei fnatic installed for mice and all system drivers up to date, and it works flawlessly on a usb 3.0 port.
I happen to like the keyboard. Yes, added features would be ghood and they might add to the price.
Glossy
Yes it will, I had to do this myself. Its easy to replace, they have videos showing how on YouTube if you get lost
Take your CD Rom drive out and measure the thickness. if it is 1/2" thick this bay will fit.
Yes, any 2.5 inch drive will fit.
Just look up the hard drive caddy with your edge part number, i.e. edge e420 and see what comes up in the amazon search.
Not with the cable provided. Since USB does not support higher voltage and amperage required by the detector it will not typically work. USB is only 5V where the accessory plug is 12V. If there is a resistor in the 12 plug it might be possible but I have never measure the voltage value.
The STi does include an Earphone Jack - It accepts a standard 3.5mm mono earphone plug.
Yes the 7500 has 3 hdmi in and one out to monitor\tv so u should be fine. Great sound on the system highly recomended.
The base unit can. The receiver unit has all king inputs. However, the headphones themselves can only connect wirelessly the receiver unit. There are no input connectors on the headphones.
They are comfortable
The kit that I received did not contain a micro USB plug only type a regular sized usb
yes. i watch tv on it
They will work like normal headphones without batteries. The noise canceling function does require two batteries.
Yes
Yes
Yes it comes with 3 cables total, apple control talk, universal talk & straight thru cable.
There're no wireless capabilities.
Yes, you can talk with them in any phone you use. They are compatible with any device.
Yes, you do.
If you go to the actual crucial website, you can select your exact laptop and it will give you the exact memory that will fit your laptop. It is also sometimes cheaper directly through crucial. Mine was.
Yes. I installed it on exactly the same laptop as yours.
Yes, it can be used with anything that has a HDMI cable. The problem is that the headset become uncomfortable after a while.
No, this thing weighs a good amount and after a while it's not very comfortable.a lot of the weight rests on your nose if its not adjusted right so..I'd keep that in mind.
get a oculus rift or preorder Antvr. this sony 3d viewer is not good and not sturdy when you move. I got a oculus dev kit but I preorder Antvr if you like movies and gaming.
I believe it slides on then clicks. Try that and see! Hope this helps
Hi, it worked with my built in slot in the 2012 mac pro retina display. There is no reason it wouldn't work though, only difference is you might not get the full benefit of the speed of the card if the reader is not as fast. The card is fully backwards compatible with any sd card reader/camera. Hope this answers your question?
Let me first say I am not an expert. That being said, I checked the specs for your camera model and it says it supports SD, SDHC, and SDXC memory cards, so I see no reason why you cannot benefit with this card. I love it. I have one in each camera now. Works great and love the improvement in speed over my older, smaller capacity, slower read/write speed memory cards.
Yes it does!
The Canon EOS60D does not support UHS-I, hence both Extreme and Extreme Pro UHS-I 45 and 90 MB/s cards are redundant, and a cheaper Sandisk Ultra (30 MB/s) should give you the highest speed a 60D can exploit.
Yes
No
50 " height
Yes, but it isn't a Nikon charger. If that doesn't matter you should be fine.
I've never heard it asked like this, but I do like your style. Ill try my best here. Imagine a extra big Kellogg's box, ya know with the bonus or extra in it&gt; 2 side by side. About as high and wide, gotta figure a DVD drive fits in it. its about as deep as it is high. Hope it gives you an idea, if not go to Wal*Mart and grab 2 boxes off the shelf? haha. Good case, just a little flimsy.
Yes it does.
this does work on my apple tv (v3), but it is only meant to carry audio signal to another device with an optical in. I am using it to send audio to an amplifier so I can listen to music streamed to the apple tv without having to turn on the TV. You will want an HDMI cable to go from your apple tv to your TV.
Have not tried in a wall jack, both my ends went into appliances had to push pretty hard to get them to 'set'.
The tv needs to have an optical out and the sound bar has the optical in, that'll send the sound thru the tv to the sound bar. If your not getting any sound from the sound bar it's probably in the wrong port.
Hi. This is what I would look at. I would start with checking your Fosmons' power adapter. Is it plugged in? Is it delivering 5 volts? Is the power light on the Fosmon lit and not dim? If so then you can check the Toslink cable on the Fosmon end. Is the red light coming through it? Did the Toslink cable seat down properly in both devices? They kindov pop when they are fully inserted.
Dear Amber, Thank you for your question regarding our TOSlink cable. The 10 ft cable is not rated for in-wall use. However, our 15 foot Toslink is. Please contact us at service@bluerigger.com if you have any additional questions. Thanks, BlueRigger LLC service@bluerigger.com
Yes
I'm thinking about half way. Looks well protected although if I were using it outdoors I would consider wrapping it with a good water tight tape
Dear Customer, We are sorry for the delay in responding to you and thank you for your interest in our DVI to HDMI Adapter Cable. The compatibility is DVI-D. Please contact us at service@bluerigger.com if you have any further questions. Thanks, BlueRigger LLC service@bluerigger.com
Do not buy this product. I bought two and they both broke within a month. Very cheap and flimsy...
don't know, just measure the screen area that's flat and use the appropriate size.
It is just a monitor so it doesn't matter. Monitor is capable of working with any system. I use this monitor for a larger screen for my laptop and to serve as duel screen.
Most likely. Its merely a screen shade. you probably won't want to leave on the camera full time. When it is needed its quite useful. For $10 its a must have.
No
Didn't keep this item. Didn't work properly.
Hi, the resolution is 800 480
No, you cant download anything to it! Its basically only good for going online and its super slow. Kinda of pointless for anything else. Buy something better! My kids use it just for Facebook
Sure, it should. That's what it's for. I have used mine to listen to music from my desktop to my bluetooth headset.
Here is the Compatibility Chart for your computer: Processor Processor type Intel&#65533; Pentium&#65533; 4 processor 520, 530, 540, 550, 560, or 570 with HT Technology Intel Pentium 4 that runs at 2.8, 3.0, 3.2, 3.4, 3.6, and 3.8 GHz internally and 800 MHz externally and Intel Pentium 4 670 3.8 mhz Level 1 (L1) cache 16 KB Level 2 (L2) cache 1-MB (displayed in system setup) pipelined-burst, eight-way set associative, write-back SRAM So, no it will not work.
I really can't answer. I only had my TomTom for a couple of weeks -- it had issues. I bought another Garmin instead.
I am NOT an expert by any means, however when I am in the tunnels in Boston I lose the GPS signal and it doesn't seem to be able to estimate where we are. The Garmin I had before could. I hope this helps!
Yes it works fine on PAL. It is just standard TV 720 x 576 resolution with no drop out and very acceptable quality
Yes both markings on the cable
It work very well for me. Can say if it the full 300 or not.
I am not sure, but will look in the instructions to see if they state it.
I believe so. I have used the device with a iPhone 6+, and it works. I haven't used the analog output, so I don't know if they are a fixed level output or variable.
Yes of course. The only thing i had this problem is volume control is not working properly that's why I sent it back to Amazon. If u had extra budget take a look on cambridge audio. I prefer this brand than NuForce.
Sorry -- don't know.
Yes, but you need a connector. It comes with a 30 pin, so you'll need a 30 pin to lightning connector.
No, there is no tuner. I use with my Satellite box. It does come with an IR blaster so that you can change channels remotely.
I'm sorry I can't answer, I no longer own this device.
I have used a 16Gb card in it. DO NOT BUY THIS CAMCORDER!! It has a known issue with it's auto-focus.
Well it might be the SD-Lock. To test it, take out the sd unlock the little slider and try to put it back. Then take it out again to check if the SD-Lock is "Locked" (opposed to when you inserted.). With mine i just glued the lock so it does not turn back. (Literally glued)
Yes. The socket is accessible after you flip open the screen. This is a great camera - I've had none of the issues others have complained about. The only thing I don't like is that you can't run it on AC so I bought extra batteries and keep them charged.
It's listed as 3.7V 5.2Wh on my batteries.
No
Hola, yo soy un cliente como t que realiz una compra de este equipo. disculpa no vendo bateras ni se donde puedo adquirir una adicional. si se llegara a daar la que compr , le cambiara la baterias internas del pack. espero haberte ayudado.
I own a 7D, and yes it does work with it.
Yes, I've used it several times to make time lapse videos of northern lights
I highly recommend not purchasing this item. This item is listed as a NEEWER but is actually a cheap knock off brand called shoot. Spend more money and get a quality product. It fell apart 2 days after i started using. With that said, you can look in your camera's user manual to find out what type of port your camera has. Nikon has a few different types that look similar. Once you have that information you can more easily search for compatible products.
The cord is 36" long. But I have not used the unit yet.
Yes we use them on Macs but PC formated
It is compatible with mac it comes in fat32 format I formatted mine in exfat so it works with both my mac and pc. And yes it also has the word canon well my usb did anyways.
I have both the standard and HD versions. And I have never had a rattle in them... Something is definitely wrong with it.
Silver
Dear Customer, Thank you for your inquiry. I am sorry to inform you that we can not make sure that the package will reach you in time as the international delivery is very busy during this time. Please kindly noted.
yes they would be fine for that. I am wrapping them in a sheer fabric as well and have had them on for about 30 minutes solid not blinking. The led lights do not generate much heat at all.
i had the same question
Sure, and it fits perfectly.
This case is for the 10" so probably yours will not work. This one said it was for the Lenovo tablet that I have but it still does not fit properly. I can't use my camera while in case. I looked for one that said especially for my tablet and like I said it still isn't right. I will never order online again. I will always go to the store and fit it properly.
No, with the wire only
No it is not Zwave/Zigbee/BTLE/Lutron (as supported by Wink) it is strictly a 345 mhz alarm system sensor
yes
yeah it's loud might make you deaf.
It is an older model now but it has Vudu, CinemaNow and Netflix. I have Netflix and it works fine but sometimes it takes it's sweet time to connect.
I use it with Chromecast and the text is great no blur
The 80 in has FULL ARRAY back lighting vs. EDGE LIT lighting for the 70.
Yes it does.
Hey Moises, it is. Good luck!
Yes, it is!
Nope! Too big. "That's what she said" XD
No it doesn't...quite strange (and disappointing) really. I recently purchased this and didn't even think to ask about the port since it's so common for electronics to have one. The system works as promised but without the HDMI port I'll be taking mine back. No point in forking over such a large amount of cash for something that doesn't have a port that even my cheap digital camera has!
This projector requires an IR emitter to sync it and uses the same connectivity and looks compatible with one on the Dimensional Optics 3Active IR emitter. The placement of the emitter may require a longer extension cable for placement to the front of the room. The 3D glasses must also be IR active glasses.
This one does not but Here is the link to the one that does &gt; http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004UN6AYI
Certainly no... if u maintain a good distance between both
"The coaxial outlet with no threads"-I'm thinking you are talking about a RCA outlet. There should be 3 spots: red, white, and yellow. Yellow is for video, red and white are for stereo audio. Your analog TV should have this outlet as well. So you just need one RCA cable, just make sure you are getting all three (red, white, and yellow) connectors on the cable.
plenty of room.
If there is an available slot available, it should work. It's also powered from the slot on the mother board.
My impression table stopped working all together 1 day after my warranty ran out amazone would not honor the warranty I don't know what to tell you mine never worked half the time
It most definitely IS rechargeable, and the battery life is amazing. It recharges by a micro-USB port. I have to recharge mine about once a month.
Don't know as I haven't tried any other bluetooth device for my tablet.
If your standing behind the TV, to your right, you'll find the connection hub. Look for the antenna cable connection is it easy to spot, if you move further right from that, you'll find the head phone jack towards the end. It says "h/p". It is right below HDMI IN 1 port.
Not hard at all, very simple.
No would look like reading this review done on this is doesnt http://www.missingremote.com/review/netgear-neotv-ntv200-connected-media-streamer (At the end of the review in the Conclusion they say it doesnt)
I have washed mine on the ddelicate cycle in cold water and it came out like new.
It can, but it does not work well for the kindle fire I have, because the button is on the bottom, and it can sometimes turn off.
The answer is yes. The Lap Pro was designed specificaly for use with books (both hard cover and paperback) by resting the bottom of the spine on the Handle and the covers splayed out, towards you as shown in the pictures on the amazon selling page. We designed it, we know what it can and cannot do and many positive reveiws have reflected this use, with no negative ones to be found to date. The answers below are based on incorrect speculation. -RC-
Bose has an excellent technical support team go to their website and contact them from there you should have your problem doves quickly from there
Hello. I will answer your question. 1) 2) There is a menu of Japanese and English. There is no Spanish. 3) Yes. Earpiece size S / M / L contains two by two. The power supply is AC100V. It can not be used in the area of voltage outside.
Yes, Remote Control WP / F (Optional). Not sure if infrared though.
charger, maybe. Sorry I forgot, but I'm 99% positive that a charger was included. memory card, no. battery, hand strap, USB cable came with it.
I have a Mac and have not encountered any problems.
I repair a number of notebook LED's and usually I end up doing the purchase from Amazon and, have not had issues when they say that the monitor will fit the HP series then I usually have not had issues with getting them swapped out. If you have swapped out a notebook LED before then, I would be vary careful and keep all the screws you remove over on a white paper with some tape on it to keep them from being lost and again just know what your doing.
Very likely, yes-- it fit for my hp pavilion model g6!
no it does not, but it is an awesome case, one of the best one out.
Phones jack bit think this is a knock off cause after I attached it to my amp it went up in smoke......
it should considering the only bass knobs that will work for audiobahn amplifiers are the audiobahn bass knobs I used this bass knob on two different kind of audiobahn amps and it was perfectly fine
I find it quite good even after having the headset for a year+ :-) crisp voice, doesnt sound dodgy, and very clear output!
To switch on/off the device you need to press and hold the power button for some time like 5 secs. Otherwise, it considers to be a pause of played track and may take the battery life even when not playing. You don't need to put the device for charging for that long. I think some 4 hours will be enough.
Hello, You can Google - HP ZR2740w specifications or try this link ( h18004.www1.hp.com/products/quickspecs/14144_na/14144_na.pdf ). Not sure your first two questions, Yes for brightness, No to contrast and color, Yes to HDMI - which I use with Nvidia GTX-550i 2Gig (amazon) for dual HP displays (27 and 23), fantastic for movies and CADD.
The battery on this computer really stinks. I mean REALLY. I've haD to use it plugged in since like 9 months after I bought it! I do not like this computer at all. I hope this helps! Plus it gets really hot.
Yes you can register amazon on this player.
Hi Matthew, To avoid compatibility/functionality issues, we recommend using the remote control model: RMTD302. -Anthony
Nope, the S100 does not have an optical view finder (if that's what you meant). It only has the LCD screen on the back which doubles up as the view finder. It is quite convenient, but does consume battery.
Yes
if you can set the white balance to custom then yes...
They worked great
Yes, for most TV's 23-42 inches that are within these VESA mount specifications: VESA compliant: 75x75mm, 100x100mm, 200x100mm, 200x200mm
I don't know. Maybe call the company??? Good luck
Perfectly. That's what I use it for.
All phones will blutooth, not sure if you could dock it
Yes
I have a Nuvi 40 which is also 4.75 inches wide. It just barely fits. I used a hairdryer heater and stretched to plastic a bit and now the fit is OK. Bottom line a 4&3/4 inch GPS does not really fit in this case without some work.
Yes
No just camera and cable . You will need a screen or av head unit
Get ahold of your dealer, and their svc. dept should be able to provide you with a printout of the wiring diagram of that particular system and the color coding.
I don't think it is made for a cell phone. When I carry my cell, I have a little bag with a long strap. The cell fits in the bag and I wear the strap around my neck.
Correct. AC adapter (not included) is only needed if not powering via USB.
yes, I use mine between different tv's and receivers around the house.
They're real, Amazon.com is an authorized dealer in the sennheiser site so you're good.
China on the box.
Yes they are.
Yes, I am currently using windows 8, and I have full functionality of the mouse.
Yes, it does.
Not sure, but you can look and manufacturers dimensions for your screen and compare to the products dimensions. Thats what I did before purchase of this product and it fits my MacBook really well, especially like the 'gold' side, it provides super privacy when in a large crowd such as Starbucks. Good luck!
You just need to measure the diagonal of the screen and it will fit any 13in screen. I am using it on a 13 in Air.
If someone sitting next to you, they can't see your screen. It's an awesome buy..
Yes it can burn CD's as well as DVD's. I do not believe, however, that the software required to do so is installed from the get-go (I may be wrong about this) but it's really easy to get that software.
Yes.
You have to use the T/W button to zoom in and out. This lens does not have a manual mode. It is quick and quiet though.
I believe so, but this lens is not waterproof.
From reading the nikon website it appears that this could work with the adapter. However I would not submerge it in water. This lens is not waterproof.
This is a "prime lens"- there is no zoom. In general primes are single focal lengths (no zooms) but they are generally better than using a "kit lens" zoom at the same focal length. They are also usually smaller and faster.
It's a great lens on the 1 system but it can't be used on F-mount bodies.
Yes. For rapid charging be sure to use the USB cable that came with the Note 3.
I didn't know so I tried it...the answer is yes. It took a charge from the wall charger as it charged my iPod(USB out). I assume it will do the same for the 9 and 12V DC out. Remember to press the power button to start the output charge.
Yes. My daughter has a 4th generation i pod and it works.
It does require a receiver. It has 7 speaker wire connectors. That said, the sound on it is amazing when paired with a good receiver.
No, it's a flat back with no holes whatsoever. I guess you'd be stuck with double-sided mounting tape or something like that.
I don't think I've ever seen a hub w/ an on/off switch. As Mr. Williams said, a power strip could be used in conjunction with turning your computer(s), if that is what you do. In my experience, this is a very good product, esp. compared w/ the competition and well worth the extra $$$.
You can use it with just the remote feature. No alarm system required.
So far, yes. I have not had any problems at all.
It work on a mazda3 2006 fine, but the system stereo was not Bose, good luck
No the jewel cube speakers are not wireless systems. They need to be connected via wiring.
Yes you can I use the direct/reflective for the rear speakers! and the new jewel cubes for the front! Sounds Great.
Yes it does. I use a Raidon Dual 2.5" drive module in the floppy bay. It is switchable RAID 1 or RAID 0 I use RAID 1 to provide a backup in case of a HD failure.
That's right, you don't need them anymore for decent audio & video. If you want to use the machine for intensive gaming or video editing or something, obviously you'd want to add a card.
Yes it does
I don't believe it would work for a Windows computer, because it has keys that are specifically for Apple functions.
Yes...and no. The mount is the same, but the area covered will be cropped. Sony has just released 2 or 3 new Zeiss lens for the full frame format. I would recommend the new lenses.
Yes, it will, it holds my Galaxy Note 10.1 with bulky case. Same size approximately,
No it won't fit. The iPad is bigger than the kindle.
No its for the regular ipad. My daughter loves it!
Hey there. Your devices should work fine. Just make sure the your ScreenCast AV is properly set up.
On the setup I have, transmitter and receiver are separated by approximately 17 feet with a wall of concrete in the middle and both image and sound work perfectly with no issues at all...I have no idea if it can reach the distance you need - it seems too far as they are not designed for long distances...hope my comment helps.
Unfortunately no it will not.
The idea of it is great but we had a very hard time with this. We ordered 2 and had the same issues with both so I wouldn't say it was just a rare thing.
No
Yes, you can use the Powerline adapters to connect the router and the modem which are both on separate locations.
It is not recommended through a surge protector. It may not work at all or will be unreliable. I do not know if has one built in, but I have three and have been using them for over a year with no issue.
yes ,it is , my friend ,
Mine accepts the key and the zipper under the flap opens to a small (approx. 6-7 inch pocket. I don't use it but I guess you could keep extra cash or I'd in it. Hope this helps
No
I have only used the remote control. Did not try to connect to the item by means of other possibilities.
110 only
It can but I cannot figured out using the ftp feature
No. The iOnly Play is a stand-alone speaker system with an older type iPod dock connector (to use with newer iPods/iPhones you'll need an adapter). This device provides stereo speakers for your iPod. (See comments regarding compatibility.) The device is not intended to be connected to your existing Onkyo system (it was meant to be stand-alone). You -could-, technically, connect the headphone output from any system to the input jack on the iOnly. But if your intent is to connect your iPod to your existing Onkyo receiver then this isn't the device you're looking for.
This worked for me out of the box on OS X
It fits my Note 10.1 VERY snugly and I had to remove about a 1/4" strip along the inner edge of the upper frame so that I could see the entire screen. Other than that it works fine for me.
Nope, without an IR or RF receiver you can't "teach" commands to your Nexus 7, might be a workaround but doubt you want to open up or root your new tablet, and with no Logitech interface for that model you'd have to root the remote also. Look at a refurbished Logitech 650 out some of the higher end models.
I believe so, but the quality will be poor. Given the high quality of the monitor, it would make sense to spring for a DVI or HDMI video card if your computer can handle it.
Yes, I'm a pretty big guy and have plenty of straps.
I'm having a Galaxy note 10.1 (2014), and it fit perfectly. I guess with the leather case you are using it might be a little tight for the V7. I did used COD stpe Stand Leather Case For Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014, its a bit tight, so I change to Poetic type Slimline Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 Edition it fit nice and have room to spare.
That depends..... I would not risk it. If all you intend to do is highly controlled studio work, with little chance of untoward events, perhaps. I wanted something to use in covering college sports, to get a different angle of view, and am happy. However, I use mine exclusively for micro four-thirds cameras, and it works very well. The suction cup on the bottom of the center post is an extra stabilizing factor, but my big Nikons were too large for me to trust one to this.
When I bought mine, "Thrilling Audio" called to ask me if I wanted the newer model and of course I said yes. The newer version did not come with any docking station. If you click onto this one, it will pop up that there is a newer version of the Lifestyle 135. Love it, Love it. I only buy BOSE
I don't think that is a problem. Bose stands behind their product. I have had mine for over a year and it works great like all Bose products! Warranties only count when you buy unreliable components. Bose is not one of those.
Look up replacement cables for your CanonT3 on Amazon. However they make supposedly different units for Canon, Nikon, etc., so by just changing the cord for use with another brand camera may not work. The whole unit is not that expensive so you just might want to get one that is supposed to work for the Canon T3.
I personally use it on a Mark II however my assistant just bought his canon 6D and it works perfectly on his body. I definitely recommend this trigmaster to anyone especially at such a great price.
hello! well, honestly I could not find it in the manual. It's a toy camera, and you can control the aperture yourself by simply holding a little longer the shutter. the focus range is 50 cm to infinity. I didn't develop the film yet so I'm afraid I can not help you by answering the questions precisely. But I hope it helped you a little :)
NO .. never can be used with the softbox, which I have. No silver part to hold you metal rods
This speedring is generic in that it will work with any softbox that uses 1/4" rods and has a 6" opening on the ring. If the softbox has both of those, then this will work. I looked at your softbox but I am unable to find any specs on the rods or opening size so I can not say for sure if it will work or not.
You are correct. I couldn't either and what I did was I got a few wire ties and tied at 12 3 6 9 positions and that did it. I couldn't get the screws to go thru the holes like the pic stated. Unless they sent me the wrong one. Hope that helps...
I use it with my 60inch and I use it with my lightweight stands but upgraded to heavy duty stands and yes with either I use sand bags
I used it on a Sony E mount which was APC Sensor - I believe the A7r is E mount but a Full Frame Sensor so I am not sure. Perhaps you can contact Fotodiox direct they should know.
As long as the filter thread on the lens is 72mm & if the lens it's compatible with Nikon F-mount, YES it will fit.
I used a dental scribe to scratch every accessible part of this device (I have three of these Macro Focusing Rails). From what I have been able to see from my scratch tests, it appears that the parts to which you refer are made of a high density, hard plastic. I have had some extensive experience with this device, and I can say that I have always been able to obtain good grips and reliable positioning of photo gear mounted on these Macro Focusing Rails.
I don't believe so. I used mine on the 13" air. The buttons don't match up with the keyboard back lite. Doesn't look good.
The camera itself is model DC1400
This is just my thoughts. If you have to buy Nikon, then get J1. If you want to get the best among all compact system cameras, then I would go with Sony Nex 5N or Pana G3 for the price range. If you can spend more than $1000, Sony Nex 7 or Fuji X100 is nice. If you want to save money but get better Image Quality than J1, I recommend Olympus E-PM1. I prefer Canon S100 over Nikon P7100
I don't know off hand but it wouldn't hurt to see if it lines up if twice on and try....but the lens dose come off for bigger or smaller lens
I do not have any problems like this.
Yes as far as I know it was shipped off and I attached it very nice camera for the price
Yes
Camera, 10-30 lens, battery, battery charger, strap, cd, manual
Yes. Quite well actually. Get the book Nikon j1/v1 for dummies. It'll show you everything you need to know.
No you can't but it has a built-in flash.
There's a 3.5mm jack next to the mini-HDMI port that's labeled "Mic".
The photos are captured on an SD memory card (not included) which can then be uploaded onto a computer. If there's an SD slot on your computer, insert the SD card into it. If not, you may need a SD Card to USB converter. All photos can be viewed on the provided Nikon software (NX2 photo viewer/editor) which is PC and Mac compatible. Hope this helps
This camera takes any standard SDHC memory card. Class 10 are the fastest when storing information, so the camera is ready sooner to take your next picture. But anything above class 4, which are very inexpensive now, will do for normal shooting.
if you have a rj45 plug on your Ps3 and a USB you can use this product to get wifi to your Ps3!, I have used this device on all my non wifi devices to attach to my network!, I have attached a satellite receiver/xbox/and a legacy PC all work great!!.
this one works fine with it (G.SKILL Ripjaws Series 8GB Model F3-8500CL7D-8GBRL), I hope this help.
MOBO SIZE width 195mm x length 245mm. You need to figure it out on the C431.
I've listened to kings of Leon on them and sound good. Great clarity and not muddy at all.
I'm sure it is. The controls are actually designed for apple products. You get only limited function with android
It screws on the lens using the filter threads.
I have purchased this lens kit for my Kikon 1 J 1, and I dont know either how I attach them to the camera and which lenses I can use in combination. Chun Li
It is absolutely very easy to use, and yes, you can post instantly to facebook or email. Very easy to use mobillink as well, which is my preference. Enjoy!!
yes it does. i own the dv300 model and it has multiple filter and editing options to go with it.
Deborah, Only has Wi-Fi. I can not see Bluetooth in the menu. thank you
Yes it does!
Im sorry I don't have a D3000 so I can't help you with that queston
The Nikon P510 cannot fit inside the Nikon CB-2000SA case.
I don't know, but your camera should add the date to the file information, anyway. That's assuming you've set the date and time of the camera in the menu.
yes it will.
No however with all Nikon J1 they all come w straps, as soon as you place your Camera secured in you'll have that strap plus it's secure even when you use your Camera for pictures.
great choice. Bought one, have used sony's for years and think it is excellent. If you find one for under thirty bucks, let me know. I will buy a back up to my present unit.
Yes
Check your manual or plug in your vehicle and ask google to search and see if this would work for you.
It worked with my Otterbox, BUT the cable is garbage and fell apart
I wish I knew. I didn't realize that it's not PCI express until after my 30 day window for a return had passed (I moved across the country aalnd just didn't have time. I'm now the proud owner of a Brick :(
pretty sure pci. returned it for that reason.
Michael--My bible case measures 7 1/4 X10 X2 inches and the bible itself is 2190 pages long plus the extra pages to include the maps and the glossary. My bible fits fine without a lot of extra space. It is not a large print. The case itself is lovely, the outside pocket is really helpful and I love it. Hope this helps you, happy Easter, Marty
Confirm the connector type and it should work. I replaced the HD in an old HP Pavillion laptop, this drive works properly. Again, be certain the drive has an IDE type connector.
I would try and find 200mm fans if possible. These fans are only 140mm so there is chance the screws won't line up with the case.
It might because they should have same input . Itfits into the charging porton mine.
I'm not sure what the S1 is. I have the first generation Nikon J1, and the filters fit You might measure your lens size.
The WB-135 wall mount kit is designed to be used Cinemate 1SR, Lifestyle 135. It is not used for non-Bose products such as the Samsung hw h550.
A what?!
I believe if it is a 30pin connector, it would work. I bought this as gift for my nephew who has an older iPod and it works great.
Yes, it fit mine.
Asus EP121 is a great Windows tablet with a bigger screen but a lower resolution than the Samsung Slate. To use the full features of Windows 8 Metro including Snap, you need a resolution of at least 1366x768 which the Samsung Slate has.
It happens. The solution lies in finding the good old hard reset button. Here's a YouTube video that shows you different ways: Samsung Series 7 Slate - Reset Methods: http://youtu.be/wP7M5nUNVkQ
Yes
No, it's an auto guider or a camera. It can't send a signal to more than one destination at a time.
It is compatible with Bluetooth-enabled PCs, including the Toshiba Thrive. Please email support@satechi.com for further assistance. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
Metal, yes
Return it. Very user unfriendly device that is problematic at best.
Plug it into your USB on computer and drag and drop to the music folder on player
Mine are different and mine dont
Plugs in
I dont knowhave not even been able to do anything with it
The owners manual is in the back part of the plastic box
No, you need SSD-3100GB, per Samsung website.
I don't think it'll be very likely. But if you don't care about the price then go ahead.
this model only has a VGA port, Matthew
This definitely works on my tf700t. I have tried it with my external 1tb hard drive and it's able to play everything it can as advertised. Keep in mind, you wont be able to charge your tablet while this usb converter plugged in... bummer.
It didn't work for my tablet. I sent it back.
thank you it was the wrong one but it was promp in ship time
Yes. My wife has that case and it works good.
It sends an alert to your phone.. Its very reliable..
notz farz
Yes, it supports up to 8 cores. I'm running an 8320 and it's a great performance.
No it won't. Although the socket matches it can't power the chip. That chip is a higher wattage than this board is designed for. Check out pcpartpicker for boards that will work with that chip.
Sorry--don't know as I haven't used them that way.
No bluetooth and the amount of ram supported varies by processor. It has four ram slots, if that's what you meant.
It worked but did not hold a charge for more than 30 minutes.
Not sure if one base can be used for both sets of headphone, but you can always use both base stations and plug them into your stereo single headphone jack using a splitter available for a few bucks from your local electronics store.
Yes, since these are the specs of the Kindle Fire HD: Audio 3.5 mm stereo jack and integrated stereo speakers with exclusive Dolby audio engine .
Just the sound not the video if your cars receiver has female 3.5 mm connection. You would have to have a cable that hooks to the dock output of the ipad or usb.
Christina: Your camera will not autofocus with an AF lens, as it does not contain the motor inside the camera. (SWM), but will perform all other functions manually. You need AF-S lenses which contain SWM motor. That is why the difference in price from an AF-S and an FS only. I hope this might help.
Yes, it will
No, the key part is connected to the plastic part, that is why it is such a pain to replace these fragile keys!
You use an eyeglass sized Phillips head screwdriver.
Doesn't look like it. Did a cursory search. New Trent seems to only produce iPad products. Closest android case I could find was the Snugg Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 Leather Case It's got a strap but no swivel.
You may have to reset it. Try this link http://youtu.be/KQcQS3OwA48
If you use the Motorola app, yes. If you use Google app on android, no, it will announce the phone number instead.
Plug it into your router and you're all set. I had it set up as a media drive for the tv and all of my computers. It gets it's own ip so functions as an independent entity
The device uses an external power supply. If you have needs other than 110V, you'll have to supply you own.
Yes it will, I currently use it with mine.
If you mean 2 of these in crossfire no. Cpu and this card yes.
It comes with housing
it is much easier to replace with the housing...just undo the old and snap in the new
Yes
Bob R I must apoligize because I have no idea what the difference is between those two lamps that you have referenced other than the fact thye are for two completely diferent TV systems.
Dear customer: Yes, this item is compatible with the Canon 5d.
I am not too sure... they sent me a pair of 6 & 7's to make sure I was satisfied after I complained and those were fine. That's all I can vouch for. Sorry
Yes. Mine came with them.
Makes no difference. I have one on both matte and glossy.
Yes, is a cute remote.. So usefull
Hi Cliff, I bought this monitor and sadly there isn't a compatible mount. I had to MacGyver something together to get this to work. I recommend you buy this Acer product instead as I bought this LED with a dual screen mount and it works awesome. Acer S231HL bid 23-Inch Widescreen Ultra-Slim LED Display -http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003N7P6TC/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and Generic - Dual LCD Monitor Stand desk clamp holds up to 24" LCD monitors - Black http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002R9HQLI/ref=oh_details_o07_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I have had my S3300 about a year and really like it. It came in a box with an instruction manual (actually three, English, Spanish, French), a shoulder strap, a lens cover with a short tether for it (which can be attached to the camera or the shoulder strap), a A/V cable to connect the camera to a USB port, four alkaline batteries, and a CD-ROM disc.
It works perfectly fine in the rain. Nice and clear view..very accurate also. Give it a try
Yes you can. You can wire the camera through a on/off rocker switch. If you have a rear camera also installed there is a liquid crystal display monitor that has a V1 or V2 (view) switch and you can alternate between cameras as necessary.
Not real sure...I would check for faulty wires
I think so. Just be aware it states it is "waterproof", but it is not.
If it has an AUX input plugin you can.
"Technically" they will work from 1GHz to 8GHz with varying results. I don't know how well manufacturer trim/tune the antenna. If you wanna go higher in GHz 5+ use a dome/helix antenna. This should work in the lower MHz range but don't expect loads of gain or range. If you are using a dual band card with 2.4/5GHz this should be adequate. If you are gonna use the antenna for a project, (like I did) it should work fairly decent. The connectors are standard mini coax size so you can upgrade the antenna in the future.
Hi, As long as any PC or laptop has the display port, the adapter should work. I didn't have a problem with a Dell Latitude 6530.
Mine is 2013 model and it's of the same dimension as yours. Am certain this rooCASE will be a perfect fit. Feel relax to try it out!
To power the unit, you must plug two "pigtail" USB plugs into a computer. I don't think it could really be used on much else since the software has to be compatible.
The frequency that stations broadcast their signals are still in the VHF and UHF ranges. The fact that almost all signals are now digital instead of analog has nothing to do with the reception of the frequency band they are transmitted on. Simply put, yes, it will receive both digital and analog broadcasts.
It will probably work (30-pin female adapter end) but it will not charge your i-pod or i-phone.
Yes it'll work with any l iPod dock of it will not work the. For chargerin
Same thing happened to me. I think they sent me IPad screen protectors instead.
Yes. It works fine with the t1i.
Yes, it will automatically charge when you use the amp :)
The Gold Gym has 2 battery areas, each covered by a plastic plate with a top screw to hold them in place. The left-side battery area [when standing in front of the machine] is where you plug in the AC adapter. You must also remove all batteries when using the adapter.
Dear Customer, Thank you for your interest in our cables. The BlueRigger Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter should work with your set up. We recommend that you reach out to us to help you out with any specific issues. Please feel free to contact us at service@bluerigger.com with the model of your AMD video card and we can assist you further. Thanks, BlueRigger LLC service@bluerigger.com
Yes, you can connect to a 3d monitor.
No
I don't have the device right in front of me, but the cable is not very long. Maybe 6". I've never used an extender with it, but I would be surprised if there were any issues with it. I routinely use it in a hub and it works fine that way. The extender probably would not even need to be an active one.
The vertical post on my SwingHolder is 31" from the bottom of the base to the pivot; then from there the radius of the arc holding the attached device is 21".
I believe its 2.8mm. But camera's quality is bad.
Hello. I don't know whether or not this is the right one for your computer, but it should be fine for just about every computer. It works fine for me and I would highly recommend it to anyone.
Hi! I'm from France and I confirm that you can use both Bluetooth and wifi at the same time. Both are totally independent with a blue led for Bluetooth and a red led for wifi.
sorry,but this dosen't going to work, cuz you can't connect an analogo device to a digital device or otherwise without a converter
YES
Hmmm, from what I can gather from your question is that you need a Micro USB male-to-male connector? This cable would work, you would just have to plug your regular charging cable (Male USB to Male Micro USB) into the female side of this adapter. Then you would have micro USB Male connectors on both ends.
yes it fits, althought i would not say it is a perfect fit. the camera seems to have a little play in the case, but not too bad.
The length from the beginning of the plug to the housing is 11.5". The box says the length is 1.5', though doesn't specify what is 1.5 feet. The housing for the outlets is also 11.5", so I have no idea what the box is talking about.
Yes it is.
Hi we did arrive Mac. My oldest son set up goood make every alright dvd and stuff. Gooood no problems that all
Unless your receiver is hard-wired to your modem, you will require this piece of equipment to use all of the receiver's functionality. This is the ONLY way to connect to your wireless modem unless it is hard-wired to your modem.
Correct.
Yes it does
Thanks for your question. It comes fully assembled. It is a wonderful cabinet. Thanks again
I'm not sure if I thougt this was something it wasn't but it was just an empty shell. You couldn't put a cd inside of it. Very strange. Maybe I got a dud?
No, It's a case used to contain a cd/dvd player/burner. Most people use them when they remove their optical super drive to replace it with a second hard drive. They then use this item to contain the super drive so they can plug into a USB port and play media as before.
Most definitely it will. I use it on my Canon 5D mkIII and 7D With amazing results. Go for it!!
Yes, but be aware that it may vary slightly. I have 2 of these, but there are variations between them.
No. That was my situation and it did nit
You could try calling Emerson directly, or just get a universal remote.... there is a good one at walmart that is about $8 that will even program to streaming devices such as the role.
Yes and no. I found the elastic corner straps were insufficient to hold a tablet securely. I found a case for my Lenovo tablet elsewhere, which "works" but is not perfect. I, for one, am still looking.
Best I can tell you is that it fit my Leader Impression 9.7 tablet...which is also a rather thick tablet compared to Ipads. Although this tablet the cool feature of sitting up, which is why I purchased it, we found it difficult to get the "ring tabs" around the corners of the tablet, which hold it in the case. If you have a thinner tablet, it may be a better fit though.
I never had that issue. Mine was going strong for a year and a half and I misplaced it (seriously -- I have no clue where I left it). I loved that thing. Have you tried reaching out to the manufacturer?
I am using this with Ubuntu 14.04, if that helps...
It supports the following operating systems: Windows 8 , 32bit/64bit Windows 7 , 32bit/64bit Windows Vista , 32bit/64bit Windows XP , 32bit/64bit Mac OS X 10.5 Mac OS X 10.6 Mac OS X 10.7 Mac OS X 10.8
The RT-N53 has two modes of operation where it could be considered a bridge, access point and repeater. If you connect the RT-N53 by wire to the other Asus router, then it can act as an access point for that other router. It can also be a repeater for the other router if you want to extend the range of a pre-existing wireless network.
I can't say for sure I have a 60" Samsung mounted on mine. If you do a close up of the box on the Amazon website it says it will handle 132lbs and the bolt pattern goes as large as 820mm Wide by 410mm high. The mounting system is very sturdy, quite flexible and adjustable. I would say there is a good chance it will work
Yes. Keep in mind, however, that this needs to be plugged into an outlet and has a separate wired video converter box that's the size of a remote control. It is not really mobile itself.
Yes, it will take any PCI-E x16 video card, but as to why an Nvidiblow card with an AMD board beats me. But yes it will work.
It should be fine running any single card.
Yes, I am using with a i7 4770K. I am using it in an HTPC and needed the limited height. I am not overclocking, if you plan to you might need a larger cooler.
Don't know i use it like it arrived and fan works pretty well at 1500 rpm amd fx8320 keeps nearly 35-40 temps
No it does not....I bought a Cannon Flash Speedlite 270EX....you need to purchase a wireless flash that works wit EOS DSLR Cannon.
I am currently using 2 of these along with my Lenovo laptop (total 3 screens) in my home office. The USB ports on the laptop did not have enough power to run both of them at the same time, so I used a powered USB hub that I already had. Works great as a 3 monitor setup.
No.
Yes. I believe 300 meters is the theoretical limit for POE.
Yes it does.
Yes, but no display for Frequency?
The official link to this update is no longer supported, but here's a link to a copy of it I sent to Dropbox. Copy the file to a usb flash drive, plug into the 3d wizard until all the lights come on, and you'll be updated. https://www.dropbox.com/s/w75sexrpheuoiof/3Dwizard.UPD?dl=0
Yes it will work on any type of tv, it dont matter what kind of tv u put it on it will work
All come with it
I don't know about usb hook up but you can get new cord
no...only MacBooks 2009 and after
Yes
My Macbook Pro is 15" and its the 2009 model
These are 2 completely different animals. The m30 are over ear and the 239 are on ear. I love my Sennheisers. I have the m50 and they are pretty good, but heavy. The 239 are what I use at the office.
The foot pod would be a great add. Although you do not need the foot pod to get your running speed, but it gives additional information which helps with training, like cadence and indoor speed for those cold days when you are forced to get your training on a treadmill.
Depends on the active use, but I think is very good. For example, last week I used it 4 hours biking & 2 hours swimming and I still have half the battery. Im very happy about the battery and everything. Its great for multi sport.
Don't know what you want to know about the warranty. You can check the manufacturer's website or call them about that. It is a good product, I would buy again.
While the volume buttons won't work, the play/pause button will.
I use them with my iPhone5. They should be backwards compatible with any Apple products.
One button.
there was an extra nib in the package.... i have NOT tried that nib.... i just assumed it was exactly that... an extra nib. I will try it now though, that you mention this thought, to see it it is actually any different....
I do believe it is. Why dont you buy some and try it. They are not that expensive..
In So Paulo, at the PEGATRON SERVIOS DE INFORMATICA LTDA,, call (11) 4525-5151
Not that I can find. From what I have read you can connect it to a larger monitor with av cables.
Only when a cord is plugged into it. Each light works individually.
The AC adapter is included with the unit.
Yes, I'm using one with my 4690k and it fits perfectly!
I have a 2011 mother board and it mounted fine with the supplied hardware. It was a breeze. My motherboard did not need a backplate though. I could be mistaken, but I think most 2011 motherboards come with a backplate built into them.
You do not need SATA III. The SSD drive will run at the rated speed of the machine it is installed on, which on laptops is SATA. It is still a lot faster than the original hard drives that come with laptops. That is why I also install the Samsung 830 series SSD drives instead of the faster (and more expensive) 840 series drives on my laptops. You will be making a Very good choice of SSD drive for your machine. Hope that helps you.
Yes, just press the "more" button and follow through
It seems that any internet provider should work with the Telikin computer. We use a local provider with inhouse router with no problem. If you have a router, the computer will search for the signal. You might need to have AT&T give you some username or password info if you don't have that info already at hand.... we've had no problems with this computer. Good luck, enjoy!
Is there a monthly cost?
No. The stand has an angle to it and as a stand alone item will fall. The item is designed to be placed between your legs for support so that your laptop is resting at a comfortable height
According to the hardware specs I looked up, it will.
No, you would need RAM that is SODIMM as this is just regular DIMM. SO DIMM is designed for laptops, there should be some Corsair Vengeance RAM for laptops though.
I see no problem with that. It is my plan to max out my slots with 32gb as well. I was a windows 7 man myself, listened to all the haters. When I finally did switch to win 8 pro 64 bit. I was very pleased. The architecture of win 8 requires less ram to run. There was a noticeable difference when I made the switch. Something to chew on. Happy building!
Mine is brown on one side and basically the same brown with touches of blue. Not terribly different. The brown that is shown on Amazon is fairly accurate.
There is no IR remote support for this unit.
Yes, you can. It charges through any Usb charger. However, make sure that it provides 2 amps (i.e., an ipad charger)
4 feet, works well as advertised!
120cm
Yes, it works just fine with the Pentax K3 that I use.
Yes.
The RC-201/DC2 Pixel Remote Control is for the Nikon DSLR 7000/ D5100/ D5000/ D3200/ D3100/ D600/ D90...the box does not list your Nikon D5300
No, But the Pro Fit Deluxe version does
Not sure what you mean here. it is probably a faulty switch. If you want to try to take it apart, there might be some wiring problems. If you're not down to take it apart and look at it, there's really no way to fix it.
No, no computer is needed. Just internet (after initial set-up).
This is just the wireless adapter. Which did not work for me and it was only 15 feet from router.
The stand comes detached so you could lay it down
I don't think so, think this is specifically for Acer Aspires.
Download the manual.
Radiation detectors only pickup decaying particles close by. You would need to be close to Fukushima area to detect anything serious. Unless you're going to Japan I would suggest something reliable and inexpensive like the www.amazon.com/International-Medcom-CRM-100-Digital-Radiation/dp/B006C4ZTEK .
This computer is no longer produced. But yes, it does have wifi capability.
It is a land-line connection, not wireless
You need to buy an additional attachment to hook up a USB cable to a camera that goes on the ocular.
Yes
We are sorry we can not ship this case to Australia as our inventory in the US is not under our control but at an Amazon warehouse, but they don't support shipping to Australia at this point. Sorry about it.
This computer doesnt have a wireless card so you'll have to get one seperately. You can either get a wireless card or a wireless usb. Its going to cost somewhere around $50 usd.
The HDMI wire connects the tv to the adapter. The tablet's charging wire plugs into an electrical socket and the adapter. The adapter's plug goes directly into the tablet.
Mounting it on the J1 body allows you to use F-mount Nikon lenses. So basically an F-mount lens attaches to the FT-1 adapter, which attaches to the J1 body.
Yes the Ft1will work for your j4 you may lose some functionality of your lens and your lose about a stop and a half. Birding? A camera is good for what you use it for after that it is a matter of personal satisfaction and sacrifice.
It works with 7 inch Kindles.
Yes it will.
Yes.
Assuming you are talking about the speed booster, which gives MFT about 1.6 crop factor vs 2x.... I would assume the canon and speed booster would be wider... With standard Metabones there is no speed boosting so it's .5mm less wide than the Rokinon.
Yes. .... According to your camera's specs. The mount is the same as Olympus cameras 4/3 systems . Remember this lens is almost all manual settings . You can use the A setting to run auto exposure as for focus it' keep 90 % infocus when set at infinity . Make sure to order 4/3 Olympus .
It does not come with. Battery. Once you open it, the battery goes against your memory card. Remember, all this is is a replacement cover along with the keypadding.
You need to include your model number here in order for us to help. Also, if your receiver has a black color input panel, this remote will not work for it.
Sorry but it don't know if it will work on your v20 like u would like it too but it do work every thing on my lifestyle 18 and it also work's on my Dish Joey without programming
I'm glad you contacted me because you should know that the N-50 doesn't work with wifi routers that require security passwords. You should be ok if you have an older router that doesn't require passwords, or if you are going to use a LAN hard wired connection. I had to send my unit back for a refund. As for your question I don't know, but one reviewer said the two sound very similar. Hope this helps. Phil
This sound dock needs to be plugged in to work. Bulky and a bit heavy to be portable. Does not work with only batteries. However, it charges your Ipad while playing music and it has awesome sound. Hope that helps.
Yes, it will. S5 allows microSD up to 128GB, I use one of this in my S3 and works perfectly.
This is a universal TV wall mount and the arms can be adjusted to fit various size and model of TVs. To ensure compatibility, please locate the bolts holes behind your TV and measure the horizontal and vertical distance between them. If the mounting holes on the TV is less than or equal to 770mm (30.3 inches) apart horizontally and less than or equal to 480mm (18.8 inches) vertically, this mount will fit. The mount has a carrying capacity of 175 lbs. Please ensure your TV does not exceed this weight limit.
You can if you use a series resistor. We use about 2200 ohms.
Mine was 30 amps. Used it for a trans brake and a line lock solenoid On my race car. Keep in mind use a in line fuse I use a 25 amp fuse to be safe.
Hi C. Prendergast, I do believe I have used it in a USB 3.0 port before without issues. USB 3 hubs are supposed to be back compatible with all USB devices, so if it is giving you issues make sure you have installed any controller firmwares/drivers that it may require. Hope this helps :)
nope. It's usb and the transmitter only points parallel from the end of the usb cord.
Yes it does. And it works very well. It's a three color grid , green ,yellow, red. At the edge of the yellow and green your about a foot away from your bumper. All in all it works great.
Hi, there are instruction with it,,they seem to work. Charge it over nite, run your computer until you get a low battery signal, do this a couple of times, mine will hold a charge for about 5 hrs.
In my experience, the slider piece that unlocks the original battery was the problem. The new battery which I ordered was slightly bigger than the factory model, and it didn't allow that slider piece to move completely back into place. I had to make sure the battery was as snug as it could possibly be and then manually move the slider piece back into the locked position; the new battery has charged beautifully since doing so.
I am in a similar situation. The charge doesn't last too long.
I am not sure what a 6 cell is. If you have a dell 1720 laptop and it has a battery that looks like the one in the picture. Yes it fits well and works well
See: http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/8142/~/difference-between-sata-i,-sata-ii-and-sata-iii "SATA III specifications provide backward compatibility to function on SATA I and SATA II ports. However, the maximum speed of the drive will be slower due to the lower speed limitations of the port." SATA II drive speed is 3GB/s, so you won't get the full SATA III speed throughput by using this cable.
Roughly 19 inches.
If your computer has an esata port it provides another means of connecting your computer to the Anker device.
the asus mother board are great and the chip will worck great, but buy an after market cpu fan cool master
Gaming performance is will depend more on your GPU than the CPU, but yes, this should run most games quite well.
CPUs don't limit the amount of ram you can have in your system, what does is the OS you choose, (32/64 bit) and the amount your motherboard states. along with the physical amounts; number of slots and the size of the ram sticks you can obtain.
The Front of this antenna is the side that has all dimples and NO smooth rectangular box with logo. The Rear of the antenna is the side with a smooth rectangular box & logo. Always face the Front of the antenna TOWARDS the area you wish to cover.
There is no guarantee. Personally, there was no dB gain on my router.
I doubt it. It's a "repeater". It picks up the signal from the wireless router/modem at some distance from the modem and "repeats" it. It has to be placed somewhere between the wireless router and the computer/tablet receiving the signal. 1000 ft is about 1/5 of a mile. This device is only 600 milliwatts. 100 ft. unobstructed at best. This is sort of like adding a second modem/router to get better coverage through dead spots.
Hold the "down" volume button and the power button until you see the lenovo logo and let go. It should then boot into recover mode. There is also a reset button next to the jack input. Hope this helps!
Yes, Ice Cream Sandwhich is available for the Ideapad A1 but you have to get the update file from somewhere else (Lenovo briefly put it on their website but then pulled it off not sure why, but some sites still host the file)... do a search on xda developer forums to get the instructions on how to update it. I am running ICS on my A1 and it works pretty well.
Yes, this tablet does have Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth, and many other great features. However, its Wi-Fi is sometimes unreliable if the tablet has been running for a while or just came back from sleep mode.
No. The sub woofer is wireless & connects to the main unit seamlessly via Bluetooth when the unit turns in.
No
GPS function is built into the watch; nothing else to wear. If you want it to monitor your heart rate, then you have to wear the separate heart-rate strap.
The Watch face is about 1.7".
No, the P8Z68-V PRO/GEN3 supports Intel processors only. Please see here for a complete list of supported CUP's: http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/P8Z68V_PROGEN3/#support_CPU.
It has 1/4-20 slots drilled into the bottom and could easily mount to a tripod by attaching a quick release plate to it.
Yes, it can be used to trigger the video function. You will need to set your camera to video mode, enable wireless remote functionality, and set the remote to the "2" switch. For still shots while video is being taken, push the switch to the bottom on the remote to begin getting still shots.
It works great, I bought two of them. Just what I needed. Thanks.
It is aluminum.
Yes, Mine times out after about a minute, but that minute has always been long enough for me to get settled in the photo.
Yes it has a light switch, but no dimmer. It works very well, and you can use the barn doors to get less light, or use a gel for effect.
Yes
Yes
It works with my 60D. The Canon manuals for both the 60D and 70D show that they are both compatible with the Canon RS-60E3 wired remote shutter release. Since they both use the same shutter release, the SMDV RFN-4 should work with the 70D as well. However, it does not work with my 20D or my 5D mk ii. These cameras require a different connector.
I know it fits the CS540 because that is what I have but I cannot speak to the other models.
3.875 x 2.375 x 0.625
This can be CHARGED by a laptop or a computer but I don't think it's powerful enough to charge a laptop. It can charge a Nokia Lumia 928 no problem, even an iPad!
http://www.samsung.com/nz/consumer/pc-peripherals/notebook-pc/ultra-portable/XE700T1A-A01AU-spec
yes
Yes it does .
NO
It works in a headphone jack.
J. Smith, The height is 33". The length (or width) is 54 1/2" and the depth is 3" at the base and only 1" at the top. We have it mounted on a wall and it extends out only 3 1/2" from the wall. It looks very sleek and modern although the wall we have it on is stacked stone - not ultra modern - more rustic, cozy. It looks very elegant on the wall. We're really pleased with it.
This is only a guess since I don't have the warranty paper anymore. I would think for this model, they are only talking about office electronics or similar items though it does say "kitchen" appliances in the ad details....which could include perhaps your microwave. I was taking it more to mean such items as a coffee maker, toaster, etc. Their website has lots more information. I just use mine in the office.
It connects to my computer with a USB connection, so I don't think so, unless you had some sort of an adapter.
No, this headset is not reversible. The mic is permanently on the left side.
I am not sure on the lens size of the Olympus TG-3. I bought this and used it on the Nikon J1 that has the lens diameter of 40.5mm. Check on the face or on the rim for numerical marking of the lens diameter. Hope this will help narrow down on your speculations.
I'm sorry. I do not know. I don't deal in "i" products. They work on my Kindle HD, Sandisk MP3 players, Samsung laptop, Razr phone.
I'm not sure about the one listed as a Samsung card but I purchased the SanDisk with USB and it was well worth the money if you ask me. I've been using it in my Samsung S3 and it's quick and reliable.
No built in speaker.
Yes, networking is built into the motherboard on this model, either 10/100 or gigabit depending on the configuration.
No it doesn't.
It's Ipod attachment now limits sales rather than stimulating them as technology races forward. This is an eccentric but quality built unit with Blue - tooth that makes you ask who needs wires?
yes thank you
Most likely. It should work with any Nikon DSLR that has a hotshoe. I actually use this same product with my Nikon D5200.
I have had the E10 for over a year and have been satisfied. If you are looking for amps and DACs I'd suggest heading over Headroom (http://www.headphone.com/headphone-amps/) to sort out price and quality with audio enthusiasts. Lot of very good detail reviews.
This TV (6003) does NOT have an Ethernet port. It has wifi capabilities IF you buy the usb wifi dongle separately.
The tripod is very light weight and easy to carry. The legs are in four parts instead of the more common three parts. I would recommend it for point and shoot cameras and camcorders. If you have a camera with a gynormis lens the slightest breeze may topple it. If your camera was made for US import it probably has the standard SAE 1/4" 20 mounting thread and will fit the tripod.
The tripod has the standard 1/4" screw thread tha most all cameras have (along with a "quick release". However, it appears that the gopro camera does not come with any means to attach a tripod ... without an accessory see: http://www.amazon.com/GoPro-CHDHX-302-HERO3-Black-Edition/dp/B00F3F0GLU/www.amazon.com/dp/B00F19Q7AC for the latest or http://www.amazon.com/GoPro-GTRA30-Tripod-Mount/dp/B002RCLYXG/ref=sr_1_1?s=photo&ie=UTF8&qid=1383007226&sr=1-1 for the older "less expensive" version. It is a very good light-weight tripod.
n o
Yes, I had the same problem and tried to solve it with the "automatic cleaning" which can be done in settings. But I also will continue to watch this problem.
No
This amp for its size is unreal what it's able to do sound is so nice. Sorry I don't know the Sony. For the price this is a steal. Runs cool all the time.
I have not directly tested this unit with the new iPad Air, but being an engineer and knowing the way this unit is designed, it should work. Worst case scenario is that some single sided adherent foam rubber padding might need to be added depending on the position needed to be used.
Honestly I have not had that issue happen to me but, I tend to have it on the side for comfort and doesn't slide that way
Yes it will hold a Nikon D5000 with battery grip. This bag is very spacious with removable/adjustable dividers
Not exactly in that condition but yes I have. For example when running a game but just in specific parts of the game like in the menu or something. I think the buzzing comes from the fans but not really sure.
I am afraid I can't answer that. All I can say is that it is a strong mid range low profile card. Under heaviest loads, in small form factor boxes, it will heat up. For my purposes - to deal with this I added extra fans and moved the power supply outside the box. Obviously I am a fanatic - and work to keep my system components running under listed normal ranges.
They stay in very well at the gym.
Mine did the same but I love them it well worth it ,I do believe you can send them back and they will replace them w
No,it doesn't.
You would need to use a wifi connection or a dock kit with an antenna
Not sure what you are asking. Are you concerned about the Bose equipment, or whether the Bluetooth will work with wifi reception on the Lynx. The latter is yes, I can't answer concerning the specific Bose issue.
I'm not sure. All batteries have an expiration, but rechargeables have a limited shelf life after first use. In this case 1-2 years.
No
China
It depends on who you purchase it from. That information would be listed for the item.
Of course and it must be 3d nvidia ready not samsung 3d monitor but for examble asus or benq
no, you need a laptop that is 3d vision ready.. the card itself is but the screen is not however if you hook it to a 3D tv via hdmi cable than yes you can use 3d vision through a NVidia program called 3dtv play hope this helps
If it's compatible with your laptop then yes, it's all you need.
N4110 and it fits it. Sorry I am no help.
It works perfectly with my Motorola RAZR. There are three different ends with it.
Great charger but does not have charge thru capability--must be charged individually and will provide up to two full charges for iPhone.
you need an adapter but yes. I bought a 4S to 6 iphone converter on Amazon for $2.50 and have had no issues for the last 3 months
Yes. It uses a full size SD format only. The microSD cards that I have bought come with adapters... in fact I have not found where to get them without adapters...
240
There was only one US plug included.
No. It only works with certain Klipsch subwoofers.
no it is not, i am still trying to figure out how to get my phone to transmit so I can hear my phone through my speakers. It did not come with instructions either. But I have the Galaxy S4 with a Otter box case and it does not even fit the holster. Living Social has a FM transmitter for 19.99 right now
You are actually more successful than I was. I could not get dial tone. My only thought is that if you are not directly connected to your PC, but instead connected via a USB hub, you might have better results if you are directly connected.
Yes, it is plug & play without any drivers from the included CD for Windows 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8.0, and 8.1. I have tried it on all of those operating systems. Just make sure you have regular USB drivers installed (if you can successfully use a thumb drive or printer then they are already).
Yes it will. Try to use pcpartpicker and put your parts together to seek for any issues.
Yes, It folds relatively flat. I find use and nice for travel as well.
1600 X 900 The quality seems pretty great for me, and I edit 1080p videos with special effects.
Fine for about anything mounted in good light, the camera does suck for hand held use, so only buy for 90% mounted use, or pass.
My camera did the same thing and at first I thought it was the camera and I thought about exchanging it for a new one. I instead bought another memory card to try first and since then I haven't had any issues.
Best info can be found here: http://www.pashnit.com/product/gopro/gopro_mounting.html
It came with about 8 diffrent sizes
Hi, I use it for the makeup shoots . But you need to know that it's not enought if you stand as far as a foot from you client. Better use some really good lighting
Generally, most of our external batteries' static power consumption is lower than 100uA, which will take between 3.5 and 20 years to drain the battery completely if they are not used. However, the chemicals within the li-ion battery will gradually become less active over prolonged periods without use. Most will die in 2 years of inactivity. To extend your battery's life: 1. Charge and recharge it at least once every 3-4 months. 2. Do not over-charge or over-discharge it. It is best to keep it charged between 5%-95%.
This watch has an extant sensor that you wear around your chest. However, it is very comfortable and I have enjoyed this product for a long time. Best fitness investment I've ever made.
Yes I do believe it will. It ha s plenty of room which is why I bought it. The only thing I had do do space wise was to manipulate the fins on my ram when I upgraded from 16 to 32 gigs. Besides that I've got nothing but praise for this case. I would surely by it again.
I haven't seen any ATX power supply that wouldn't fit in this case, even the 1000+ Watt units. Do you have a specific one in mind?
No. My laptop did not have a back light and I do not recall there being any wires to plug in to on the keyboard.
No, it is just a case. Power supply must be purchased separately.
Well, I don't have a Mac computer, but I've just run a quick search and found and site where they say it does. It's http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2386039,00.asp - under the heading features you will read " ...works across both Mac and Windows bases systems.
Absolutely, this need very little power, you many connect it to your Notebook USB also
If your smart tv is wireless, no need. If not, you can connect it with the LAN. Just choose the correct connection setting in your TV set up menu.
The one I have/got was black. There was/is no color option that I ever saw.
No, it's not necessary. I have the internal case without drive. It has two USB ports, so I have a 1TB USB drive for main storage, and a 1GB thumb drive for swap memory (totally optional), each connected to the USB ports.
Eyanla, I truthfully am not sure and am not familiar with what you are talking about. What I do know is that when I purchased, MyAkitio support was spectacular!!! To the point of going out and buying an identical drive to mine! If they have gone down hill... I'll be disappointed. They worked with me to the Nth degree!
It fits my Coolpix S6100, and those dimensions are 3.9 x 2.3 x 1.0 inches--- a Coolpix S9200's dimensions are 4.3 x 2.4 x 1.3 inches, so yes. The description also says it will fit an S9200.
We used this converter last year in Paris & Stockholm and had no issue with our iPhone and iPad. My kid used it this year in France and it worked. No idea as to whether Israel would be a different matter.
Hi i plugged my SC6000 into the sub out on the OPPO blu ray player as I don't have a receiver and I have my speakers which are Martin Logan vantage electrostatic driven by a 450 watt ASR amp. The power of this sub is such that I run volume at about 8 and cross over 90 ON THE SC6000 and still sounds good with high end equipment. So yes it will work with any receiver- read manual first, or a good Blue ray player.
Thanks for your question. We currently do not ship internationally. The manufacturers that we represent only allow us to sell their products within the continental USA. I'm very sorry. This is the 110V version. This is a fantastic sounding sub. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Definitive Technology dealer.
No they do not.
I use them with my Galaxy S 3, works perfect. I assume they should work with every device that has support for buetooth headphones.
Mine is 10.75 X 9 inches. There are no gussets in the sides, so you cannot put something thick - like a tblat with a thick case inside. Just won't expand to accommodate much more than the tablet and some paper. Unless you have a very thin case. I have one with keyboard, and it won't fit into the sleeve.
Is that a question....?
I'm not positive what kind of cell phone that is but the headphones seem to have a standard jack....
We have not experienced any interference. Note that this device connects directly to the antennae adapter (inline). When active, it automatically disconnects the car's antennae, making it less susceptible to interference.
It connects at the head unit. With two wires for positive and ground, which I connected at the cigarette lighter. If you have an RCA option on your radio then you can also connect with rca's if not then stream solely using the blue tooth antenna feature. Scale of 1/10, audio clarity is a 10.
Only if the monitor has 3D capability. Here's a link to check if your television is supported: http://www.nvidia.com/object/3d-vision-system-requirements.html
I have tried it with my I-pad and the answer is no.
From my laptop with the Blutooth adapter to my printer with the adapter for it I can print from my laptop to the printer. Forget the Kndle. I tried to print from the Kindle to the same printer with the Blutooth adapter and it would not work. The Kindle will not communicate with the printer. Don't buy the Kindle app as it doesn't work either. My Kindle was a gift to me. I wouldn't have the d... thing otherwise. My laptop with XP PRO does everthing I need to do.
Yes. Any iOS device.
The Canon EOS-1D X is definitely good for any weather, anywhere in the world because I have taken it to many continents for photo shoots, from the high Arctic down to the southern tip of Africa and many places in between. You can read my review of this excellent camera here - http://MichaelDanielHo.com/canon-eos-1dx.html
Canon body sold by Amazon is full warranty bona fide OEM!
Drives that can use these disks specifically say M-Disc on the drive or in the documentation.
You can do any excercise with it. Having said that, it will only tell you how many calories you've burned and what your heart rate it. There is not a function that will tell you how many stairs you've climbed or what pace you're climbing them.
CR2032. I took mine to a watch shop to have it replaced. I was charged $8.
Yes it will work with Windows 8 and it is very easy to use as it is plug/play.
Yes, it works fine in USB 2.0 ports. That said, the main advantage of this drive is its fantastic speed, so I'd consider it a bit of a waste to purchase for use specifically with a 2.0 port.
no it does not
These are great rear surround speakers. I don't know about Bose, except they have lost some steam over the years. You will be happy with the BIC
I have to admit that I don't use it very often, but I have had no problems with it. I did have one problem ... one channel didn't work at all. But they quickly sent me a replacement (they didn't ask for me to return the defective one). It worked fine and has worked fine ever since.
I have no idea. It's been a long time since I researched for a battery for any of my computers, So would not remember all I learned..
Fits my Toshiba Qosmio x70 perfectly. :)
by "top compartment" you are probably referring to that object on the very top of the bag, near the carry loop. that is not a compartment at all, just padding. the bottle pouches on the sides would probably be best suited for sunglasses.
You need to log into your modem direct and check for your password. Or you can also check with your provider to see if they have changed any settings on it as well.
Yes. I am using the modem with windows 7 ultimate 64 bit.
It should record your game audio just fine as long as you have your audio cables, the red and white ones, hooked up properly... If you're trying to record an audio commentary to go over gameplay you cannot do that with this device. There's a lot of ways to do that. Probably the easiest way is to have a video editing software for your PC or Mac which is able to record audio, and then a microphone of course. I would Try Videopad if you're looking for a free video editing software.
Works fine with Windows 8 as far as the compression format. One thing of note that I was unaware of is that this does not come with any software. There is a software suite on their website that you can download for free and it seems to work fine with Windows 8.
This is compatible with Windows 8, I use it on an Acer S7 running Windows 8 myself. But you need a USB 3 port and it does not look like the HP laptop you mentioned has it.
These cameras don't have an audio function that I'm aware of. They are good cameras and provide good resolution. They're are several on eBay that are used but fully functional and in like new condition if you're still interested in one. I've looked into several of these and have 4 installed Pan/Tilt and one fixed. So they're good cameras. Hope this helps.
Hi. No the indicator does not change color when the unit is recording. Remember you can turn the indicator completely off.
I turn it up either on the radio or the device it's connected to...I went threw two of those thing your best bet is to get the expensive one from Walmart..it's like 20 bucks i think and it's lasted me awhile!
I can't tell you about support for a MAC but I had nothing but trouble with this card! Stay far far away from this card! I ended up getting a StarTech card instead. I asked them for a full refund and they said only after I paid to send it back and they decided if it was bad or not. Don't get this card!
no
yes it does
You can add wired front and rear speakers. Not compatible with wireless as far as I know.
some say it great for the kindle and the touch some say its a tight fit for the touch ,i think ill try it for my touch maybe
Yes they do and very good! Def happy with them and the value
My use of the Over the air channels has been limited, but I believe it has the (ATSC) Digital Tuner and Have been able to to bring in channels pretty good and different sites, but it was also connected to Basic roof Antenna In our Rv.
If your tripod has the standard 1/4"-20 stud, then yes. If not, you can fasten it to the tripod with a converter after you deduce the screw and thread specs.
Yes
I believe it would work. That is how we use it for lyrics projection. As long as you can extend the display to another monitor, the switch is no different.
I can't give you the exact specifications but I do know that the beam it projects seems fairly narrow. You'll have to back up a ways to get it up to 10' x 10'. That might effect how bright the image is, so you might be well advised to allow for darkening the room a little bit. The image that I usually project is about 5'x5' from about 5 or 6 yards away. That's because the presentations I make are usually with groups of only 20-30 people.
Yes you can unplug the projector there is no need to cool down. This is a great feature.
Yes
Hi Caroline, This product was horrible. I have since discarded it. Maybe I just got a bad one but it wasn't worth the effort to try another one. I tryed it with a couple of radios with the same result. It would play for a minute or two then make a loud noise and cut out and did this over and over. Don
no.
It Fit With Plenty Of Room To Spare, You'll Need Small Wire Tie's For Excess Wire!
The unit does not have a 12v plug. It has two wires approx 18 inches long with stripped ends so that it can be wired into the vehicle's power.
It looks like the same type of connector, but to be sure, I would contact Uniden support: 1.800.297.1023.
I'm sure it should work, that is what it is designed to do. I'm using mine with ArcaTech and others.
The center hole is tapped for 3/8-16, and a 1/4-20 adapter is included, so it should be mountable on any ballhead, although the level of surgery required on the ballhead may vary. Most will simply require that a screw be removed.
It has been installed in someone's computer. Sorry
Yes it fits apple earbuds fine. You wouldnt want to use this for earbuds that are any larger though

Not sure where everyone reports the Klipsch headphones as overpresenting, but I feel it is very accurate. Good, solid representation on a variety of songs. I tend to tune using Rosa Parks by Outkast and Money for Nothing by Dire Straits and both present very clean and true to sound. Even rock songs using a double bass sound true to life with excellent response.
They arent noise canceling but the ear cups do a good job of blocking out background noise. I've only used these in an office environment and they did well blocking out some ambient and background noise but again they do not have NC technology.
Thanks very much for your question. We currently do not ship internationally. The manufacturers that we represent only allow us to sell their products within the continental USA. I'm very sorry.
It is really good. As an example..it is an 8 hr drive to DC from my home in Ohio and I could talk on the phone almost all the way there without needing a charge.
Yes you can. There are two different styles: One wraps around the back of the head from ear to ear. The other goes over the head like a regular headset. On the Amazon site you can type in Blueparrot head band and it should come up for all the retailers. I hope this helps you.
It can when you plug it in (at the rear of the headset) it turns off turn it back on and it will work very uncomfortable
Use this device. You will need to run single IR eye out of closet and stick it within view of your remote. It works great. You need to know where IR eye is on each device so you can attach this devices tentacle eyes directly over then easily connects to main box. Up to 6 devices depending on version you buy.
It is a one year limited warrenty. If you buy from dell, you can extend the warrenty longer if you need it.
Not sure if you mean the ball point part or the stylus part, the ball point is so-so, but it is refillable so you could buy a better pen for it, the stylus part is same as any other stylus
There should be an Audio plug, it is a seperate cable you need to purchase! If that doesn't work, try an adapter that has an audio/video splitter.
Yes
I have a G6 and it fits and works great I believe the battery is the same for G4
That depends on if you have a USB connection, if so, then I would say yes.
Yes. But, if it is your intention to stream movies from ur S 3 to ur TV, as I understand that I'll not work. There is a different cable for that. I looked it up once and I as I remember, it was a few dollars more than I wanted to spend. As I already have several other options for doing that, it did not seem like the extra money was worth the expense!
6 feet
Yes, I understand that it will from reading the instructions. Unfortunately I have not tried it with a projector but it works through TV feed so should work through feed to projector
With the keypad it's the set or program button very important to make sure the cam it set also
Most likey the line going to the camera from the contoler is compromised an not getting power(low voltage).it is the same camera I'm thinking of the Scott 24 volts for power 2 lines. Hoekstra video need to have at least two more lines going for the controller positive and negative check thatI would start with the plug and work my way up to the camera
You will see a small horizontal black strip at the top and bottom of the screen. It would appear the same as viewing a 16:9 movie on a 4:3 CRT television.
Yes... but without home phone, it won't be able to send you a notice when it gets triggered.
No
It's just a standard 3 foot power supply. I never even used mine,it's in a closet somewhere. If you have any type of protective case on your phone,tablet don't buy this as it's not designed to hold them. I've got otterboxs on min and it wouldn't hold neither of them. They kept falling over. Hope this helps.
I am not sure, however it might work, if you can get it installed on your computer. I couldn't. This is not A USER FRIENDLY ITEM.
I'm not sure, my son has the ipod 4th generation. That is what he used it for.
Has the tools and parts necessary to change the screen (ipod touch 4)
It works but u have to push the return button on the bottom of my iPod touch harder
It depends onthe lense, this camera can accept all types of lenses. The 14-42 power zoom is an excellent lense for compactness. This setup is a very small almost point n shoot size yet provides interchangeable lense and has flash. If on manufacturer says thier camera is 10x, that doesnt mean another 10x manufacturer has same zoom. 10x is measured from min focal to max focal. So 14 - 42 mm is 3. Also keep in mind that this is Micro Four Thirds lense so you must multiple by 2 when comparing to full framed 35mm camera.
Not necessary with built in flash, but no cannot use both
seriously, how about an update? I'd like to order it somewhere else if Amazon can't get any shipped out.
It should I'm not exactly sure
No. This bluetooth receiver is seen as an audio device by your computer, and the chip itself handles the bluetooth connection. This feature is what ensures a reliable connection between your headset and your computer. Many generic bluetooth receivers have difficulty handling headset audio and are often subject to dropped connections or spotty audio. You cannot use this device to connect to bluetooth devices other than compatable Plantronics headsets.
Yes. That's what I use it with
No, the one he sales its BT300c for Calisto 620 (Plantronics Speakers product). It does not going to work with Voyager Legend, or it will work with intermittent issues. You need BT300 for Voyager Legend. I would strongly recommend to go directly to Plantronics web site and purchase it directly form there for $49.95 this is the link http://www.plantronics.com/us/product/bt300?skuId=sku5910022#gallery
Check connection types and motherboard type. If you can't figure those things out. I probably wouldn't by. But I will tell you this is the best power supply I have ever owned. I have built over 10 machines for myself.
If your device has a "Mini" HDMI output port on it, then yes it will work. c
I don't see why not? HDMI signal out from one platform is still HDMI out from another. Cable works great, no issues, just wish I had purchased a 6 foot longer cable.........couch distance ya know.....
Hi Habusake, I honestly do not know; I suggest posing the question to the seller. I use it for video card to LED Monitor application.
Sorry, i have only tested it with a Surface Rt ajd a Sony Xperia S... Doesn't have a special interface to use it though, just plug and play
If It Has A Micro HDMI Slot Then Yes. That's What I Do With My Tablet To Watch Things On My TV
I have a Kindle Fire from December 2012. If your Kindle has the HDMI port, which is next to the USB/Battery charger port, then it will work.
Yes, just unscrew the center and change everthing out to the proper hardware you want use. Works very well for the large boomarang antenna I installed on it.
Tram Browning Magnetic mount #3269 is the one I think you are talking about. check with Tram Browning at: 1-405-359-8243 or email sales@trambrowning.com . they can help you make sure you are ordering the right base for your use.
Hi, I believe Yes. (Mine has a 110v to 240v tag). You might need a wall adapter if your power outlet it is not like US standard. ( TWO FLAT PINS, no ground pin)
I just looked it up online
Hi John, Look for the shape 1 st then see the series of your battery , does is comes under any of this FMHC10 312-0234 TKV2V 383CW YXVK2 W7H3N J4XDH 9TCXN (6600mAh, 9 Cell) , mine was J series . If match , it's a good call to buy.
It does rais the back of the laptop about an inch but it doesn't bother me. It still fits in my bag and it is a very good battery.
I get about nine hours with this battery and Windows 7 starter.
I don't know. But I purchase my batteries from Batterymart. They might be able to help you. The urban batteries fit the Acer.
The DVD slot is along the right side. TV works great, but the volume doesn't get very loud, I use it with a NAD iPod dock anyways, so the TV volume doesn't matte, but hopefully yours will be louder.
This listing does not include the monitor. The box contains the computer itself, power cable, keyboard, mouse, and manuals.
Doesn't matter where the radio is. The antenna must have access to the sky. I have mine sitting on the console with the antenna on the dash in a holder. Works pretty well most of the time.
Hi! This is the best SiriusXm radio. It uses the 120V service plug in my car. There is a kit for in home use that you can purchase. It is on the SiriusXm website. You can get it cheaper on Amazon. Happy Holidays!
Based on the sound I get from mine I don't think you would want two. Actually I believe two would be too much. Of course you could always buy another one later.
Yes. I have been using them with a poweredge 2950 for about a year with no issues.
I don't see why not I haven't tried it myself but I would think as long as the vinyl player has RCA outs I don't see why the card wouldn't work for this, I think the software the card came with can clean up the sound but like I said before I haven't tried it myself.
Car kits are available for every model most of the newer receivers use the same base. Sirius has them for way cheap in there outlet center on their website.
I would not know I would guess probably not, your best bet would be contact XM to find out.
Sorry, I have not installed yet. What is a VPCEH model?
Gary - the keyboard is a simple plug and play devise. As long as you have a USB port, you should be able to use it. I have been very happy with it, as it essentially allows another workstation in my office. Hope this helps. Take Care!
The Cord is 21 Inches long. It comes out of the top of the left side of the pad. I measured it from the top of the keypad to the start of the right angled USB plug. The Keypad has a nice deep groove all the way around that you can slip the cord into to shorten the amount of cord hanging out.
Yes it will help works mine just fine
Yes but it's easy to do. Youtube
Amazon has them for $16.00
the unit was fine but the hardware failed to permit me to screw it in to the frame
If I understand your questiok correctly , yes to both .
Seems to enhance what you want to hear like nearby conversation thereby reducing the muddling effect of back ground noise. Background noise still there but less annoying. Good device.
It's pretty awesome. There's no deficiencies and no haziness while playing on my PS4. Everything looks crystal clear and it should work find on the PS3 as well. Let me know how it goes for you!
Yes they are Canon made in the pack that i got.
About 6 feet.
The box I received was 19 inches wide, 27 inches long and 6 inches tall.
Sure
it has one old style PCI slot and i have an old four channel A/D D/A audio board that i use with Adobe Audition.
yes, its compatible with win 7 32 and 64 bit...use min 4 gb ram, 8 gb is even better, system 7 can use it...64 is recommended for better performance, most apps not all can run in win 7 64 bit..thats what I am using now
It will work but the auto-focus may not. Better to go to the Canon 1.4X extender. The Bower messed up everything on my 50D.
Yes I believe so it is an Ed mount. The auto focus probably won't work Tim
No, they don't.
They work just fine with iPod touch.
No
Yes. It is a USB. I have a 5s
It did come with a 3 prong power cord but no drive enclosures
Title is correct. 8x 2gb
yes and yes
8x2g Fbdimms 5300F
This only supports blue tooth.
i don't remember the screencovers but the batteries did not last as long as the original battery.
Yes. Same setup for me. Worked great.
Work good.
This unit will display typical video outputs in both NTSC/PAL analog signals and HDMI digital signals. If you camera is not capable of sending display signals in these formats, get a new camera
It came with an adjustable post that fits in any microphone/flash/accesory shoe.
I have used it with the geforce nvidia 9600gt and the sound does not come out because of the graphic card. It is not tha wireless responsible, it will not come out even if I connect the pc directly through hdmi with the TV. If your graphic card supports sound through HDMI then it will play with the kit. As I have used it is I use the pc speakers for sound and the HDMI wireless kit four video (which works seemlessly). I hope that helps you.
I do not know. All my computers run windows 7
It comes with its own USB charging cable. Other types will not fit so don't lose it
I have used it to play media on my Roku 3 - you just have to check the video/audio format, because Roku is picky. This is the link to the specs on Roku 3: http://www.roku.com/products/roku-3
Yess depend your tv
Yes, however you'll need to reformat the drive for the Mac file structor..
If the old battery is still in it, then it will tell you the size/type to order. OR go to the Uniden website and if your model is on there it will tell you. Also, Uniden might have a place to ask the question.
Hi, if you mean the Atari game pack on the iPad, then yes, I've found it to work with every game I've tried. Obviously it doesn't work as well with games like Tempest that require a wheel, but it does still work.
Well, it doesn't support Flash, so I don't think so, however, I'm not 100% sure! : )
No
Yes...the turn table has 3 speeds (33, 45, 78 RPM).
Yes it has
Unfortunately, I'm not able to answer your question. I bought this as a gift for my 95 year old mother who does not own and knows nothing of computers. She only uses it to play her 33 rpm records on it.
It has 2 batteries and 1 charger.
During your registration process it will ask you if you want to port over your phone number (keep your old number). You can just select "yes" and go on. After that Magic Jack will contact your phone company and start the process.
It does not need a new stylus. Just unscrew the top portion, separate the pieces inside and replace the rubber tip. Replace the peices in the reverse order and screw together. Just like new.
It's just a thin, clear cover. As long as the actual keys are in the same place, it will fit. Doesn't matter what/where the letters are.
Works on mine :)
This tablet is a piece of junk. Do not buy it!!! Also battery life is 30 mins. Amazon would not allow me to return since past 30days. I advise them i was out of the country. Didnt matter. Again Junk Junk Junk!!!! Dont get ripped off like I did.
It is working with all devices and dose not harm devices
Yes
If a Virgin box has an hdmi port then yes. This is pretty much a wireless extension cable for hdmi. Just be aware that it comes with the U.S. wall charger for both the transmitter and receiver.
Depends on your memory height. The unit is made to fit an LGA-2011 motherboard socket, you may need to contact Noctua for your particular setup.
I stream from my pc to 32" through an HDMI cable and then to a sound bar using an optical cable and it sounds great. It streams it in the format of the disc you are playing (i.e. 5.1) and if your HW is capable, will play it back in that format.
sata is sata, doesn't matter if it is sata3 or sata2, all those only matter to things like hard drive that needs that much bandwidth to start with. sata3 is over kill, hdd can't function up to that speed anyways, unless you are connecting to a high end SSD.
Yes, it is a male pin. By the way, this is a great, reliable mouse!
It is a pretty compact boombox . The dimensions are 10 3/4" long 2" depth and the width 4" . It doesn't play stereo thru the speakers in the fm stereo mode .
You can its just when these things were released millions of people bought it. So hold on and be patient save 100 bucks. The item is for pre-reorder to btw.
i dont know.it was bought to copy audio cassettes.
Sorry no bass boost
Hello, I only tried this on a PC, but it is a standard headphone and mic cable. The mic is positionable, but the volume is fixed. The biggest problem I had with it was the ear pieces heating up due to the lights. Anything more than an hour started to hurt. Hope that helps answer your questions.
You will have to connect it to your laptop
All of it is off-brands that I never heard of and some don't have a brand name on them at all. The tripod I would use with my Canon unless I didn't plan on letting go of my camera as it isn't very sturdy at all, and the lens hood does not fit on any of my Canon lenses.
No. The lights are fine. The Motorola Surfboard does have bright LED indicators but they aren't that objectionable.
It can support the weight but the length is a different matter. The TV will extend past the sides of the stand.
yes it comes with several different ones you have to figure out which set it is but there will be a set that works
Hello, Our mount unfortunately does not work with the late model bmw mirrors. Best Regards, Robert
Yes
I would think so... it spreads out pretty wide... I put mine on a Nissan Altima it worked like a charm. Its very neat and the wires are hidden very well...
I would say Yes... Also it's $89 on parts express website and save05 or save5 coupon codes will save u $5
You run the two speaker wire outputs from the amp into this sub, then speaker wire out to your 101s. This allows the amplified signal to go through the crossover in the sub on the way to your Bose speakers.
Make sure when you go to your receiver setings where you change your speakers to larg or small taht you turn on the subwoofer input
Mine broke too and I found out the hard way that the one I bought was counterfeit. I called Griffin direct and they gave me 15% off a genuine case. It has been six months and so far so good!
Yes, that is what I have is a white 4S and it fits just fine.
There are different color tint settings that may have been changed. It tells you select the wall color you are projecting on and based on that it adjusts the tint and this may have been changed
In my experience, it was just YouTube
Well, I got the same problem ! But after playing with the mouse a little, I realized that it was happening when the battery was weak.... So I buy rechargeable battery and the problem disappeared.
NO
The first set of D cells I put in lasted almost 6 months. I don't use it every day and I don't blast it at full volume but I would rate the battery life at about 10 hours of good solid play time. I've been very happy with this radio.
No.
Line out fixed. Volume control for headphone output.
Hi, I apologize for my ambiguous answer: but it all depends on the spec of the speakers. i.e. Impedance and power rating. I would say that if the speakers impedance and power rate are in the 4 ohms and 60watts. Then it is ok
I have shared documents with iPad mini as long as we could make a bluetooth connection.
I haven't stored games on it. But I assume u can since I have stored movies and all my pics on it. It's a wireless flash drive so I assume so. I love it since I have a ipad and now I can transfer stuff without plugging into my laptop. Really saved me when I was on a trip and was able to transfer my pics onto it.
It uses a SD card that plugs into opposite end. I've used 32GB card I think. I know 16 & 8 GB cards work
Yes It has failover.
I can hear the radio while I mow and drive pretty loud tractors.
This unit has an 8 station memory.
This is true. It only receives FM Stations
I got these for my dad and he LOVES them. It's basically blue tooth. You can setup through the tv, it has it's own charging stand and you just set them on top when you are not using them, then turn them on when you are. It has it's own volume separate from the TV as well so if others are watching at a higher/lower volume it doesn't effect these.
Seems to work on all Canon DSLRs. Did on both my 60 D, and 5DMkII. More lens filter specific, than camera specific. triuggered by hot shoe, and can be continuous or flash, with a few stops of brightness. Not really bright enough for hand holding in dim light, but on a tripod, and a longer exposure quite adequate.
Playback is great. If you have issues it is either the recorded quality that was not good or the Tablet/PC processor. It will also playback on an LCD TV screen if you have the component plugin
I have the standing leather case and it fits, the slot size on the stand is 3/4"
It does NOT work with the radio. Only the phone. Sound quality is pretty decent. The clip is worthless. Get some sort of universal holder for it.
yes
The battery will work it's the charger that is in question.
It will work with any gopro however; go pro is action cam it will swing badly if you are doing sport action stunts...get 2-axes brushless gimbal is much better option
Sure, it supports every sata devices
No
To my knowledge the device allows a usb to esata connection to be established. I used it to connect a MacBook Air to a LaCie Drive at the esata port. I don't see why the reverse couldn't also work if you want to connect to a usb device using this device to bridge to your esats port,
i use corsair xms 3 1600mhz ddr3 ram
No. This will convert paintball tanks to CO2 regulators. Soda stream has a proprietary thread. There is however an adapter to go from sodastream to NPT.
I can't see why it wouldn't. The remote starter is almost always the easiest part to hook up. Finding a good [and properly hooking up/programming] the bypass module is usually the hard part. You'll also need to find a bypass module to use with your Tundra [or any other vehicle that has any sort of chipped key].
All you have to do is plug in power switch to wall outlet, plug in desired item to power switch, make sure that ON button is pressed on power switch, make sure that item itself turned on and then use remote by pressing the corresponding button (1, 2 or 3). I will check to see if I still have the actual instructions to check if I missed anything. ***8/5/13: Sorry --- did not find instructions. I hope you were able to get your devices going. :)
There is no reason that one switch cannot be operated from two remotes, as long as both remotes are sending on the same frequency. The only way to confirm or deny this would be to purchase two sets, and try using both #1 remotes with one of the switches. Although I haven't tried this, I believe it would work.
No, this fit only D5100 and 18-55 lense.
This bag will work with that set up, but minus the L-bracket. With the bracket attached to the camera, you wouldn't be able to close the case. You would have to detach it from the camera and store it in one of the compartments then. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact our sales department at 800-991-3350 EST. We thank you for your time and consideration!
Two (Two TB drives)
You can create several shares that can be used for any purpose. You can also give permission to users (other people) for various shares. the Mirroring is the function that I would suggest you use. I did not and that makes the unit a slower but with more capacity. I am going to change mine at some point, but I like the cloud capability that I have with mine like sharing photos and videos with family, as I am not a avid facebook user.
Yes it has a 110-240v adapter
There is one problem with my book duo. The public file can be used to download as well as uploading. You can create several accounts for uploading only, but you cannot delete the public account.
You plug it in to an outlet. I love mine, use it at work.
Yes, that is what I have. It fits very well.
You should be able to see the part number on the original battery when you take it out. But with or without the part number, you can identify the correct battery on the Anker website using your MBP's model number. You can verify the model number here: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4132?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US You can select the correct battery here: http://www.ianker.com/category-c4-s3-bid1-lid6 Hope that helps.
Yes. It will work fine.
I own this ram it is in a AsRock extreme9 motherboard. This ram will work in Intel motherboard with an Intel x79 chip set. The X79 motherboard will have the memory controller on the cpu. The ram will work in other motherboards as well you might try going over to the Corsair web site and running their motherboard/memory configurator that way you can be sure that the ram that you buy is the one that works with your board.
It comes with other ends I have same truck and its on mine
Yes the device will work on wifi without the 3g turned on
The D600 does have a DC-2 connection. I have a D600 and use the Vellow remote.
When I made my purchase, they were options to how I was connecting it to my Nikon cameras. I have used it on a D90, D7000 and D610 camera body. So, you should have a choice of how you are connecting the physical device.
Yes the remote is wireless. There is a receiver that is inserted into the flash hot s h oe. There is a cable rhat is then attached to the camera. The remote trigger is entirely wireless.
It will work with any Bluetooth computer. I run it with Linux, but if you're a Mac user, you're better off getting a Mac BT keyboard, with Mac keys. This is a PC layout keyboard.
yes! I have turtle beach headphones for my xbox 360 that are USB that I do use for the sound card they work fine
I couldn't get my optical in to work at all, you're asking a lot of this cheap dated little card. I returned mine. I wish you the best of luck on this one. My hope is to save you the trouble of an RMA.
You can use either interface interchangeably. You just don't want them both hooked up at the exact same time.
Yes. If it's a 2.5" SATA drive and less than 15mm thick, it should fit. Whether Apple had the drive manufactured with special electronics onboard, I don't know. But I'm almost certain it will be OK.
Does the Kindle Fire 8.9 fit all the other covers on the market? If not, then this Deft Devicewear is likely not to either. Remember, it is primarily a cover with dimensions of all other KindleFire covers, but with the added feature of being able to prop. So, if you cannot fit the regular KindleFire covers, then this would likely not fit your 8.9 KindleFire either. I would suspect that it would since the case is propping the Kindle & also is a cover. Hope this helps.
No
It's a great sound bar however, but it's only for a Dell monitor.
This case has been a major purchase mistake. It is far too small for anything but the camera, even though it looks bigger in the pictures. It will carry the camera and an extra chip, but for charging equipment and extra battery, forget it. I wish I had not bought it, and had waited for something useable.
Yes
It means that any DVDs from any place in the world can play on them. If a DVD is made for Europe for example it will not play on an American player so a region free players will play any DVDs.
Check the compatible part numbers in the product description and see if any matches your batteries part number. I don't think it matters what logic board you have as long as your are replacing a compatible battery.
I got mine in 08 so you should be alright provided it is the 17in mac book
The one I got is for micro 4/3
laptop hard drive = 2.5 inches desktop hard drive = 3.5 inches cd / dvd drive = 5.25 inches ssd=2.5 inches small can have adapters to fit larger spaces not larger in smaller in this universe with out strange vertical adapters or higher levels of math.
I'm not sure the exact model bit I used wd hdd
Yes it is!
I charge both my iPad and iPhone every single night on it. Haven't had any problems. :)
The green light lets you know that it is getting a good connection, so when you plug in your device it will charge so it is always on
As long as you have the proper plug yes.
This Fan's voltage range is listed on the package as "voltage range 4.5~13vdc". Based on that range, 13 volts DC is the max it can handle. Provided that your inverter's output is at a stable 13.1 Volts DC, then 13.1 volts is overrange by one tenth of a volt. Is that enough to kill it? Probably not, but use at your own risk, or ask the manufacturer directly.
Yes it does come with the piece that slides on th V1.
They are 7.4V 1200mAh Li-ion. Somehow I ended up with two chargers, so pay close attention to what is in the box.
Yes It does fit-in a D3200, not Auto mode in D3200, jut Manual.
I set it up without a mat (included, but not necessary to use.) Unmatted, my screen is 10 inches wide by 8 inches tall. I crop my pics in landscape mode and at a 4:3 ratio, and most pics fill screen nicely with no lost content. I liked this so well, I just bought a second one as a gift.
Sue, which adaptor cord do you need? The regular power supply or the cord that goes into a USB port? If its the usb port I think I have one that I do not need. Would be happy to send it to you for free.
Yes
As long as you buy the right plug for it. (Cigarette Lighter) I have it hard wired on my 2 bikes but I also have mounts for it in my car. Works great. Payed for its self many, many times.
The one I got had the little symbol on it. But then again, the letters "UL" aren't especially hard to forge.
No
Yes, but I think you should pay attention which direction is the exhaust/intake and if you decide to rotate it 90 degrees, check if you have enough space for the RAM sticks.
The fan itself should be silent. If you are hearing noise, it may be defective, or something else may be making noise. The second fan is going to help cool the CPU better but shouldn't impact the noise volume.
The Mid-14 is a Macbook Pro Retina, which uses a different style keyboard. All Retina Macbook Pros use unique keyboards (unique to each model!), so make sure you find the correct keyboard - this is **NOT** the droid you're looking for!
Perfectly
Yes. It is installed the same way as a hard drive. You can even install both of them if you want. But note that, the ssd is for more speed at saving but have less memory. Hope this could help. Have a good day
Only if you plan on overclocking.
Yes this case has enough room for just over full 12" cards. Mine has a sapphire 290
yes, youngnou also sells 'em if you need one.
When you travel one mile the distance changes to miles
The weight is 25lbs /each
The woofer fires to the front. It's the port that is downward firing.
Justin, Unfortunately we don't have a belt clip available for this product at this time, however we will look into that as an accessory for future models.
we bought it as a new item; still in the "wrapper". serial #:co2gx2qedv11
A very small Phillips screwdriver is needed to get to the battery. However you'll also need prying tools (plastic ones preferably) and new adhesive for the screen at the very least
You need to look up the maximum drive size a 360 can use. I believe they just recently increased it. That would be the only limitation.
No, it's output from you computer only.
you don't have to register anything...I am only using it for disc playback
I don't know I just play CDs DVDs blu rays
This fits the original Kindle Fire only, not the HD version.
I fish in less than 30 feet of water, and the unit has fast response, good visuals, easy menu lay out. The built in chart function makes this a great product for the cost.
yes
The Peerless spec sheet says it has a 100lb capacity.
Yes
I don't know. I would also like to know
yes
It will fit both.
It's only for charging. I plug my smartphone into the USB port for coninuous charging, while using the bluetooth feature of my phone to stream music to the car radio via the Azeca device.
Yes it will with the right harness cables for your cars make and year.
it is very good I enjoy using it
No it does not fit the vcc-003. What you want is the VCC- A001ASP - MUVI Extreme Sports Pack.
This IS the cheap alternative to spending $400-600 on something comparable, this is THE BEST you can get for under $300. If you want anything cheaper, just get the focus rings and grab it by the screw and move them by hand as opposed to using the gears.
If you mean just the right angle gear box, they can be pricy. I've only seen "good quality" ones around, and they're $100 bucks and up with just smooth bore shafts.
It probably depends on the software, but I know with Skype you can separately assign audio (mic) and video (camera).
It depends on your system (Mac, Windows 7 or 8, etc.), but you should start with Skype preferences in the audio-video section. If you cannot solve it there, you will need to check your system sound and/or the Creative software program. Good luck.
No. You must buy the Bluetooth adapter separately.
Unfortunately, no. You'll need to order the cord appropriate to your phone. For example, I have a Cisco 7970G desk phone so I had to order the APC41 to get the correct connections.
You need to do an "update phonebook" command
The customer service representatives have been really shady in letting the information out. Occasionally they will tell people they are near the top of the list and it will be shipped out when the next order arrives. Wish both of mine would just ship. The semester starts in 12 days and I really want to use it for everything at school this semester.
My Asus Transformer has been on currently for over 62 hours at this time. No problem.
That is the memory card read just in case if you don't have a reader yourself.
Yes. Works beautifully
Nope you can't do that but that would be nice.
No, it doesn't. But, just bring enough cables/splitters with you so you can just plug everything into the socket (wall/car). It's otherwise pretty awesome.
Yes
The colors match reality very well. Going on six months now with zero problems. For the price it is a great value
Yes
I am using this convertor for a 12 volt, 8 amp Slime air pump which also runs from the cigarette lighter in the car. This was the only converter that I found with this high amp rating, all others were much lower. You really need to know the ampere specification to make your final decision.
mine did a couple of times and then burned out.
Yes... I have a 2T gb installed in mines.
No
Should be about 3 yrs. Runs on 2 common AA batteries. The unit comes with 2 energizer lithium batteries.
yes, your Motherboard has 4 slots and can take 16 gigs, more then that and the forums differ in there success rate of getting 32 gigs to work
It should, But to be certain go to http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/homepage and run the Crucial System Scanner then you will have the exact answer to your question
Green
As far as I know, this will only work for UVerse.
NO
Please clarify, are you talking analog phone ports or Ethernet port? Because you can run 2 separate analog devices off of one of these SPA112's but there is only 1 Ethernet port. Active internet plugs into the blue Ethernet port and up to 2 devices: Fax machine/Analog phone/CC Machine/ will be able to work off of 1 SPA112. It should be able to run separate traffic off of one device.
Probably either the technology to lock on the Bluetooth stream so its in a better sync. If your Bluetooth signal fades, which it does or can, then the clarity and punch becomes distorted . or possibly with the components for the speaker.
Same functionality and cheaper. Works great with my TF700T
No
Yes it can
Affirmative.
I've had one of these for a year, now, and am ordering another. Yes, it will focus clearly on an object at 6ft, and beyond! I have not tried it for portraiture, but have many times used it instead of my $20,000 Nikon equipment for micro-photography, and every picture has been good enough to enlarge to poster-size. I have been a pro photographer for decades.
No, they are very quiet. We use them for green screening all the time. They provide nice, even lighting for this.
It is fit perfect in my macbook pro)
I have two of them and I've never had a problem
There are several websites that sell camera batteries that have compatibility charts or lists. If you contact Panasonic or a good camera shop, they should also be able to tell you if that model battery is compatible with the camera you noted. I would not want to give you a definitive answer about a camera I don't personally use or own.
There would be a gap but I think it would still be comfortable and function okay
I had some just like that and I sent them back. Got my money back. Found something else similar online and bought them and they work fine.
To tell you the truth i don't know sorry i never had that problem you can try completely erasing everything from it and re-importing it hope it helps
I don't think you will have any problems with the arm itself, I have two for a 19" and 22" monitors and they are very versatile, stable, and strong. (I don't think there would be a problem with a monitor at a 90deg angle). Unless you drill this stand into the night stand though, it will require close approx 4" square clearance underneath the top for the bottom of the clamp. And the nightstand should be old and heavy, not a press-board version. The stands themselves are pretty hefty. Good luck and God bless.
Yes
Yes. Look on your battery that came with your T3i. It should be a lp-e8 battery. Charger works great for me and it's 35$ cheaper than best buys
Yes.
No turntable AUX. Wanted 5 disc changer and choices are limited with a portable unit. Still, various limitations are outweighed by price and decent sound, in my opinion. (I play my LP's on custom stereo and use portable Sharp downstairs in my office.)
Yes, you can. There is an audio in jack on the front panel. You will just need to get a cable that is mini-jack to rca.
I no longer have...looking to gopro hero 3
yes it does
I have had 2 of these& havn,t replaced a filter. They do not keep my small pond clean. They are nice for the aeriation for the fish but the pumps that rest on the floor of your pond remove "junk" better. The main reason i have this is because it floats and i can adjust and take it out easy. Also it moves the water but i think the other type is better .
Really easy to install. I ran mine kinda under the vinyl siding on the edges than drilled a hole in the foundation and threw the crawl. To my dvr.
The reader acts as a hard drive for the iPad. It only works with photos. Does not work for documents..
I don't think it is designed to do that. It reads only camera type memory chips less than 8 GB. There are - I think - other ways to do what you wish to do..
Danise, I am not 100% sure if this works with the original ipad. However, all it is, is a blutooth keyboard. Does your ipad have blutooth? I'm guessing it would work. It sure is a great product. You might try contacting the company. I have found that this company returns emails promptly. If this one doesn't work they may have an alternative!
I have 2 of these in a full size regular truck and it sounds powerful and amazing. hits hard, make sure you have enuff amp!
look this product on crutchfield.com It has an online tool that would tell you if it fits your car
http://www.corsair.com/en-us/support/warranty
Elle, your Note 10.1 has dimensions of 7.09 x 0.35 x 10.32 inches. I use this case with my Surface Pro 2, and it has dimensions of 6.80 x 10.80 x 0.50 inches. The extra width of the 10.1 won't be an issue in the case, as the case still has about an extra half inch of room with my surface in it. I also really like the front pouch, as its a convenient place for a travel mouse (or in my case a generation 2 kindle). I highly recommend this case!
No, the solid state portion of the drive engages in transparent caching. The Mac/PC is never even alerted to the existence of the solid state portion. You cannot access the SSD part of the drive, or mount it any any way. Also, the SSD section has nothing to do with fragmentation - you should defrag the drive when defragmentation is high, the SSD will readjust automatically to any changes in your most frequently-accessed files/sectors.
Yes
very useful keyboard. ive had mine for a year amd half, now the k doesnt work, but that is my fault, as its squished with books and leaning back! almost everyday! if it can handle that for so long, then it has to be good!
It charges and syncs. It will work for what you're asking.
I'm sorry, I am unfamiliar with those tablets. I use mine in a Sumsung phone.
I used the PPC Ex6xLPlus, and they work great with this cable. If you have never used stripping and crimping tools before, perform a few test runs, before performing the final installation. Also, this cable does work with HD.
You should be able to. They are wire connected so as long as other speakers could be driven by relatively low output of the receiver they should work. The speakers that come with this system are just fine for a bookshelf system however.
It uses wires
Yes, you have to take the lens hood off and reverse it back over the lens, then the lens will will nicely in the Think Tank Lens Changer 75.
No, memory cards usually come seperately from cameras unless otherwise noted!
You can download it from the nikon.com website
Yes orcourse
I'm not sure if you'd be able to use another carrier since it uses Verizon's network. Also, there are no SIM cards in this device. Just plugs and plays via USB.
I'm not sure, but all Canon cameras are very similar to each other and most likely it will fit for Rebel XT ...
I stopped using it . Pong case had no reel benefits over the apple design that I could measure and one major drawback , after opening and closing it left marks on the screen that were hard to remove.
As long as the go pro has the proper threading n the base of it for the screw on the adapter to screw up on the camera.....but ive been through 2 of these and thier garbage
It comes with 2 eye pieces
The instruction manual has some information about finding objects in the night sky. You are very welcome to call Orion's toll free number (not sure if I can state it here) and our Tech Support will be happy to help you.
It comes with 2 80mm fans already attached.
I mount the celestron skymaster 15x70 on this tripod. It is very sturdy and would probably handle something heavier if I needed it to. The weakest link in the system was the tripod adapter that came with the binoculars. They are made of flimsy plastic. Which was easily fixed with some quick setting putty - http://www.loctiteproducts.com/p/13/6/epxy_putty/overview/Loctite-Repair-Putty-Multi-Purpose.htm
I would think so. We have a hefty, 17-in angular Nikon spotting scope on our Orion tripod and the scope is well supported. No issues with the tripod. It's probably too big for backpacking but we used it when we go car camping or on sight-seeing trips.
Sorry, I don't know-- I don't have one to test. You should call the manufacturer.
Approx. 34" OAL . I carry mine in a cheap bow and arrow case.
Yes it is and I have it and works great
Yes you can, and I have even seen some of the moons around Jupiter. I think the Orion is a great telescope for the price.
Not really. You can see the moon really clearly but as for other stars its not that great.
My suggestion is to contact them through their official site at http://www.telescope.com/home.jsp?gclid=CIyM0PKN78ICFaNj7AodrmQAew they have a chat feature that you may find useful.
It fits mine but it is a model #BNTV250A
sure. mine takes about 15 minutes to acclimate. come to think of it, mine has never had an issue with sweating, or fogging up.
Yes, it works on my 8.1 system.
Yes, mine works great with ubuntu 12.04 . Just install and your done
Yes it does.My friend and I mounted them on our motorcycles we never have to switch them on till we get way out of range.Normaly we leave them off and the radio works just fine.
Yes
Yes, it has a magnetic base
I have no idea if it will work in your 300c since this GPS was for a VW/Audi. I would search a Chrysler forum and see what people are using.
I bought and used it with a single tablet. I have no idea which others it will work with.
Yes, my came with a charger.
I have used them with my Galaxy S3, Galaxy S4, Tablet, Laptop Toshiba and they work... you won't be able to use all the functions of a headset but I'm pretty sure they work with your iPod for listening your fav music :-)
yes, it fits, thanks.
Yes, it has an AUX jack on the front of the face, as well as on the back of the receiver itself.
Unfortunately it does not.
I read the entire manual and it didn't say anything about CD changers find out what kind of plug plugs into your radio from changer or ask stereo shop I think there are stereos that accept CD changers but CD changers are old tech. And may have to upgrade to deck with CD player
The camera is sold separately
No. I ordered me 1 online
Yeah I do. What's the question?
No, just the iPod dock
Not sure I have a 4s. I returned mine as it quite linking over Bluetooth. But it worked great at first. Will probably work.
Should be. I use it with my Mac mini and it works fine.
The approximate distance between the hooks are 6" and the depth is 2 1/2".
Hi Jennifer, It only records video. Although they quality is fairly decent enough for you to take stills from it. Hope that helps. Desi
No. That can be done easily with a free third party software like Frameshots 3.
There are many adapters in the market Here is one : Digital Optical Coaxial Toslink Signal to Analog Audio Converter Adapter RCA L/R You can get it on amazon or ebay
This case only supports microATX motherboards which max out at 9.6 x 9.6 inches. The power supply must be within standard dimensions 150x86x140mm WxHxD where the depth may vary.
It depends on the Amazon listing, but I never did see this case come with a PSU. You also need to research the PSU; most of them have the 24 pin connector that is most widely used by common ATX and Micro ATX boards, but some will not have the external power connector required by high performance video cards.
I haven't used mine with flash but it has been erratic w/o a flash. I had to go back through the start up procedures and reset the frequency twice. Seems to be ok now. Oh and I replaced all of the batteries just to be sure.
It's just a remote shutter release. You need a special flash unit for that.
Should work with no problem on D90 or any Nikon DSLR. You should be aware though that you will need to set flash exposure manually. This flash unit does not support CLS modes like iTTL. I use my two Vello Freewave receivers & transmitter manually with D800 & two old SB-28 flash units I got off eBay. Works like a charm.
Yes work perfect. Just reminder as is common mistake.... You have to have power cable plugged in the adapter to make it work.
Those are the Pixel Kings for Sony. They are large but work well.
Yes they are wireless via a small transmitter that plugs into your phone or device and transmits to the headphones 50 foot range CD-quality sound better than Bluetooth and yes they are rechargeable they also sound great
There are 3 output types you can select from this device to encode to: MP3/WMA/PCM.
if you buy directly from Amazon, Amazon return policy would be applied; if bought from 3rd party (not fulfilled by amazon), then well, good luck and read all the fine prints and ask question to the seller.
No, it cannot power multiple devices from a single USB port. It is meant for providing the required power to a single USB 3 device, when the power source (e.g. laptop, desktop etc) is incapable of providing the required power from a single USB port.
Yes
as long as it has Remote Control Terminal: LANC connection it will
Hi Pam. This didn't work for me on a Nikon 520. The grip didn't allow me to do the things with my right hand that the camera needed. Since all cameras are different, you might give this a try and return it if it doesn't fit your needs. That's what I did.
I have no idea. I have a hisence
DVI can be adapted to almost any other video interface.
the ir blaster gives signal to the cable box so your cable guide show in the revue google tv . it connect the two together. .
if there is an adapter that goes from the regular/classic plug to the iphone/ipod touch one then i don't see why not. i bought because i have an ipod classic and wanted a speaker to play it off of/ charge it on.
Sorry I'm not sure. Think twice about this docking station. It broke only a few months after I bought it.
Yes! i LOVE it. While the onscreen keyboard was OK for short notes, it was way too slow for anything longer. Having this keyboard was one of my favorite upgrade features.
You plug it in. And it has a battery if u choose to use it.
no it will not unless you can load driver to the unit
I bought these, and I don't know where they shipped from, but they arrived very quickly.
Not really at all idk bout the actuation part
Yes it does, in the bottom of the case and I believe you can also put them in the normal slots too with an adapter that comes with it but I'm not sure about that. There is definitely one in the bottom though.
I guess it does--e.g., the LEDs seem to be on the fans, so if they are on.... However, I will add that my case sits near my knees--on the floor--and I really haven't noticed the lighting; it's pretty dim.
Very little! It folds into a small box!
Oh dear...we have no disassembled it as yet. Right now it is tethered up to the ceiling of our dock house for easy take down when getting ready for an evening movie. The weather is about to change of course and we are going to store it up for the winter. But I'll keep your question in mind and respond again if we found an 'easy' trick to disassembling. Sorry that I cannot answer your question at this time.
Yes - this battery will fit the Yongnuo YN-300
I am not familiar with that model of Sony camera. Compare specs on Sony's website. If the camera accepts a 55 type, I would think the 77 would also fit as it's just a bit deeper with the same footprint.
The mic is fine. No one has ever complained about not being able to hear or understand me. My only issue was w the ear pieces and the volume automatically changing
That is the battery that came with my camera and I successfully charged it with this charger but cannot guarantee or warranty the issue.
It fit my iPhone 5 that was in a otterbox defender case with room to spare. Now have a life proof case and plenty of room.
It requires a working radio with FM and a working cigarette lighter socket
Yes it does. You can check the Arctic website for all of the GPU's it will fit. http://www.arctic.ac/us_en/accelero-mono-plus.html
Yes
yes amd radeon r9 270(x), 285, r7 260(x), hd 7870, 7850, 7770, 6950, 6870, 6850, 6790, 6770, 5870, 5850, 5830, 5770, 4890, 4870, 4850, 4830, 4770, 3870, 3850, 2600 xt, x1950 xtx, x1950 xt, x1950 pro, x 1950 gt, x1900 xtx, x1900 xt, x1900 gt, x1800 xt, x1800 xl, x1800 gto, x1650 xt, x1650 pro, x1600 xt, x1600 pro, x1550, x1300 xt, x1300 pro, x1300
according to their website,yes! AMD Radeon R9 270(X), 285, R7 260(X), HD 7870, 7850, 7770, 6950, 6870, 6850, 6790, 6770, 5870, 5850, 5830, 5770, 4890, 4870, 4850, 4830, 4770, 3870, 3850, 2600 XT, X1950 XTX, X1950 XT, X1950 Pro, X 1950 GT, X1900 XTX, X1900 XT, X1900 GT, X1800 XT, X1800 XL, X1800 GTO, X1650 XT, X1650 Pro, X1600 XT, X1600 Pro, X1550, X1300 XT, X1300 Pro, X1300
Do not buy this! It has flimsy build quality! Just disconnected the existing fan on your existing MSI card. And then put a 120mm or 140mm fan on top on the existing fan, secured it with cable tie. Connect it to your motherboard 3 pin plug. Ta da!!!! Good and quiet ventilation!
It arrived as FAT32, but can be formatted to either.
YES, it will fit comfortable.
HD receiver and HD subscription from Directv, does work. The real problem with most systems is the antenna is not able to be connected to a strong signal. Amplifires may help, but is only a poor substitute for a good signal.
YES, That's what I have and it works Great, make sure you buy a antenna amplifier unless you can see the transmitter from your antenna it maintains a strong signal
Not much. Lasted about a month then needed to be charged daily. Very disappointed
Yes, as long as you have Intel Xeon processor this ram will work fine. Mine has been working great since I installed it almost a year ago. It was the best price for RAM i could find.
My Mac Pro is also an 8 core with 8 memory slots. The ram slots worked perfectly. The Year of My Mac pro is a 2008 so it worked well.
Generally speaking yes, but, the "wing" probably will not have what looks like a cover piece. more of an open web design. i found it better in my situation as it may help keep the hot summer heat from building up inside. i live in Las Vegas. I have absolutely No complaints on this setup.
If your Dell had an SSD to start out with then it should be no problem....if instead it had an ide hard drive, then no you probably won't be able to use the SSD.
No tray included.
"Display port" mini or otherwise is NOT natively compatible with HDMI. You would need an external adapter. Search on amazon for mini displayport to HDMI and you should find what you need. Good luck.
Prices are nearly double what they were. There has been mention from a few RAM manufacturers stating decreased prices soon, and I have noticed a slight dip already. DDR4 is around the corner, so they should start dropping then - at least, I would assume.
It must be suitable... but depend on the amount of Ram you already have. If is 4Gb then yes. If you have 8Gb is just perfect. Based on the http://www.shopping.hp.com/en_US/home-office/-/products/Desktops/HP-ENVY/E3W48AV?HP-ENVY-Phoenix-810-150se-Desktop-PC
It works on any laptop compatible with DDR3. If i am correct Sony T series is DDR3, therefor it will work.
There is a docking station available, other than that it has a power cord just like any other LAPTOP. That and having only one type of case available is the only drawback to owning this PC tablet.
you will need a converter
This is a piece of electronic equipment like a stereo or DVD player. Will it stand up to normal day to day use.. Yes. Will it survive a drop from 3 or 4 feet or a glass of water spilled on it, probably not. I don't know if that answers your question.
Hello! Yes, this monitor works with all Canon DSLR cameras. operates from its (monitor) battery. For attachment and use the Rig.
It actually didn't work at all when I bought it.
It's a piece of junk. Your money is gone. Sorry, but I warned people to stay away in my review.
The sound is great. Worth the money
yes, I charge them both (the original one and the other) with the battery charger.
You would have to remove the stereo from your dashboard, cut the current connections that they have installed, and splice the unit into the system. It would not be difficult for someone who is knowledgeable in car stereo installation.
I would honestly ask that question to the seller. It worked well on my alpine radio. Easy installation, well worth it!
yes those cables are 100% good. high speed, high definition. and great price.
You bought the wrong one. The DMW-LVF1 fits on the Lux 5.
No
It did for me.
yes, it works fine for this one.
You need an HDMI cable to connect to the t.v. to the adapter
Options might include: 1. I have not installed custom firmware for this tablet (check slatedroid.com) but it might have Google Market included. 2. Older version of Amazon AppStore used to work. Later one did not. 3. GetJAR website. 4. Download Apks for apps and side-load them.
about 3 hours on the one I had.
According to the manual, this device supports the following: AC3/DTS/MP3/WMA/WAV/OGG/AAC/APE/FLAC and you can find their manual online at: http://www.incredisonic.com/imp150.html where you can see their manual as well. I hope that helps!
It does! It's real small but it does come in handy.
I think so. I use a Canon T4i with a 55-250 lens with a little space still in it
D3200 will fit with one lens easily..if you have additional lens..it would be tough..
I use this case with that model of Coby tablet, and the keyboard does work for me. My only complaint is that the one-size-fits-all clamps that are supposed to hold the tablet in the case don't work very well, and the tablet wants to slide out of the end of the case. For the price, I am going to keep it, but I am going to modify the case by making an elastic strap to hold the tablet more securely in the case.
Yes it works with 2000-2005 VW passats just click on more info and it gives the years and models
I think it doesn't. I cannot start my car with this key. Well, I may miss something.
You can't bit wasn't an actual programmable key I got douped don't waste your money
http://www.amazon.com/EIKONBOX-S-1-WN-EKS-0500-Digital-Privacy-Featuring-Truesuite/dp/B004X8EO3E/ref=pd_sim_pc_5 I just found this answer. I love my laptop with built in digital personna!
Yes
two feet long
yes, just depends on your laptop settings. Have to configure the laptop power settings to not turn off the laptop or go to sleep mode when the lid is closed. That is how I used it. Though I don't use it anymore, because the video output quality was poor. I often ran into visual glitches...
It doesn't work at all....VERY DISAPPOINTED!
No, it is not. They claim it is, so I ordered one. It DOES NOT FIT. It's not the same size, nor the same shape, and the electrical connectors don't line up.
Yes u need ballast
Yes
I DON'T NO BUT IS FIT ON my 2004 Chevy, Silverado ls 1 500
It's for iPhone 4 don't know the voltage capacity I keep at my office.
Thunderbolt has not changed. The adapter will work with any Thunderbolt connection.
If you see the screen that means it's working. Go to the Apple logo and choose System Preferences-&gt;Displays. If you are trying to use it as a Television to play media from the computer to the TV, you should probably click "Arrangement" and then click "Mirror Displays" at the bottom. It will then show whatever is on your desktop. Right now it is using the TV as a second monitor, so you can drag windows over to the tv off the right side of your main laptop onto the tv.
It allows you to take a standard HDMI and shrink it by one or two sizes. If you have an HDMI cable that has the large flat adapter and want to turn it into the one that fits some smaller laptops, or the one that fits into a camera, this is what you would use.
Yes
Sorry but I don't know as I have a Kindle Fire (not the HD one) maybe you need to contact the company.
It does not, unfortunately.
Yes.
I've only used mine with Avaya1X soft phone. It connects via an USB port.
I wear the headset over my ear with glasses. It is comfortable, but it did take some getting used to. Definitely leave on the foam sleeve that comes on the over the ear piece. I haven't tried it without it, but other reviews complain about the hard plastic. I'm sure it would be more bothersome to wear the ear piece with glasses, without the foam sleeve.
No, if you want the ability to answer calls remotely you will need to either have the HL10 lifter or an EHS cable. If you go the EHS cable route, just know they are phone specific so you will need to make sure you get the right cable.
It is in Addition to the existing stock sub. Drivers side rear and was easy enough to install. For the audio performance was very worth it and sounds better than the stock.
Yes
A subscription and wire it up.
Hey Jim! The shoe mount with two screws. Not sure if you would want to drill into your C130 or not. You could use an epoxy as well so that you wouldn't have to drill. The finder bracket itself then slips into the shoe.
You can put it on either ear because the microphone can swivel to both sides.
Yes it does and a volume button and another button that I have not idea what is for but there is a picture of a mic on it.
Yes - but I don't know the sensitivity (threshold that triggers the mic). I use "always on" to avoid a break in the recording.
Connects w/ coaxel cord-round w/prong....& antenna is better than bunnyears but not the best (its hand sized) but u don't HAVE to use it...thinking about getting better one myself. The converter box id GREAT, uses USB to record stuff
no and the antenna is a piece of crap
Hello Francisco, where did you buy from? If you want it quick, buy not from China. Particular through the holiday seasons. You may also buy it with expedited shipping and tight transit time.
When I purchased the Mega it was a genuine Arduino but not a 2 pack
The founders were professors in Italy back in 2005 at some Italian technical institute. :)
I would imagine because they are nearly the same dimensions (1 cm difference). As long as Kindle Fire has Bluetooth connectivity it should work.
You need to plug it into a computer using the USB cable.
Yes!! just rca cable and usb ac adapter to power or plug into computer with usb cable included.
Yes. The Iphone5 will fit inside.
This uses an N17908 DC power adapter. They do make 220 N17908 DC converter. Mine is a 110 converter that came with the CIB
I did not like my Sylvania so I returned it and bought a kindle fire nd. Night and day difference with speed and quality.
I haven't tried using them with my phone. I had bought them to use with my computer to practice language lessons. The volume came through just fine, but the microphone never worked properly with the Rosetta Stone program.
This was a refurbished projector, meaning the manufacture certified seal was still intact. The seller did offer an extended 2-year and 4-year warranty, as well as, 3-year lamp warranty.
It should be it has Hdmi function. This is a very very good monitor. I had mine hooked up to my ps4 and it shows like a pc. It is made for gaming. You will need to get some speakers though.
It is a 2ms
It rotates 90 clockwise so you can have that configuration. Very convenient for plugging in cables too.
yes it has an electronic viewfinder which is a digital screen in a dark box I feel it works well and helps conserve batteries
The S3280 uses an SD card. I use a 16GB Class 10 card from Sony.
No mic jack. There was a built in mic I never used. I would not recommend the item in any case. The sliding tuner was undependable, and the sound was poor.
I'm not sure if the lumix fz200 allows for external mic input capabilities. If it has an external mic input that's a mini jack, then you should be able to use it. I'm not familiar with the lumix, but if it doesn't have a hot/cold shoe mount, then you'll need to rig a mounting location for the mic. Good luck!
This Ultra Small model has only 2 memory slots and supports up to 4 GB memory in total. Despite the 64 bit system that it comes with, the Intel Chipset it has, supports up to 4GB memory.
No. It's not. 2.0 cables are faster and are meant for the 4k TV's. Hope this helps.
Yes, it will work.
Yes it will work with the right hdmi. It will face any direction with the right ball mount.
It is designed to work well with Nikon or Canon. I love it. Very fast response and great color. I like it because I can see how accurate lighting is.
Yes it just does not work if you hook a hdmi to the RCA on the back of the tv but if you are hooking it to the hdmi on the tv it works just fine
if your older TV has the red green and blue outputs it should work. the red yellow and white will not work
When installing you need access to the router settings.if you will be using you personal hotspot you can adjust the settings I connected using an IP camera app to vie from Dubai using the URL I setup
This one does not. The slot spot is there, but it has plastic over it. The internal workings for an sd card is not there.
The models all have the same switches. On the left, there is the power switch. On the right, behind the USB ports, is a fan control. There is a low, medium, and high setting that you can switch between. I generally just keep mine on high. They're really quiet in any case.
Assuming the PS is normal size these should both fit with more than enough room. It really depends on what type of MOBO you plan on putting in the case. It's a big case with plenty of room for even the big graphics cards.
It supports ATX, Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX so yes, it does.
Yes it does
Just tried a 64gb sdxc and no joy. 32gb sdhc OK.
I suggest you use the cone shaped ear piece, but be careful don't push it far inside your ear for good music or it will get stuck inside (it happened to me). If you are using normal round ear buds try to put some petroleum jelly as a sealant because when little drop of water get inside it is quite annoying.
They are plugged into a waterproof iPod.
I think mine is 1st gen- its 2 yrs old. The cover fits well and has held up.
No it has an Ethernet port so will will need a router to connect to it
Hi Ramon, I have not used the Eastwood for Stainless Steel ties so I am not sure if it would work. I have only used it for the Nylon/plastic ties.
It's intended for nylon cable ties...sometimes referred to a "zip ties". I've never seen stainless steel cable ties...and if you are looking for something to tighten and cut steel strapping (as used on pallets and crates), this isn't what you are looking for. No idea about how much force it puts on the cable ties...it's adjustable, but only in numbers...1, 2, 3, which aren't in any specific units.
I should add a link for you http://www.projectorcentral.com/BenQ-W710ST-projection-calculator.htm Regards Greg
Yes, but It died very soon (7 months ) after I purchased. Very disappointing as my original Acer Aspire one lasted years and worked well. Now I using a chromebook and I love it. It works well for my purposes.
No, there is no disc drive. I use a USB one if I need it.
Yes, but It died very soon (7 months ) after I purchased. Very disappointing as my original Acer Aspire one lasted years and worked well. Now I using a chromebook and I love it. It works well for my purposes.
Yes
Nothing.....you get a black case to carry the speakers
Try holding down the reset button for 5 seconds (I believe it has one) with the unit plugged in and while unplugged.
Try a modem reset.
This wireless router will provide a link from your kindle to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) assuming you have one. My Rosewill router connects two Kindles, two cell phones, BlueRay player, and Direct TV box. What you need is: 1) Your own home internet connection (ISP) 2) This (or comparable) wireless router 3) OPTIONAL, depending on your self imposed security requirements, you may need to connect to this router with a PC to configure settings such as Changing Network Name, Broadcast Network name, selecting allowable devices, etc.
I don't think see. I am using rmtp to stream it through a video hosting company that offers that capability. Cerevo account allows for the management and monitoring of the device. in my last event I livecasted 5 simultaneous sessions and it performed flawlessly. Each device used half a meg of bandwidth connected via Ethernet cable (I didn't use wireless just to be safe). I hope this will help.
Sorry, not compatible, because this is a desktop processor.
This is an easy install if your motherboard is an FM1. Very Important, it will not work with any other board...
I think the default on that one is mute. There is only one button and led. Solid green is on Blinking is muted.
Yes
They really serve two different purposes. If all of your equiptment is wi fi, the booster Should work. If you need to hard wire something in and not in same room as router, this is the answer.
If the remote has the battery in place, Turn on your camera, Press the (i) button on the bottom left corner of the camera back, click to change the release mode (below the ISO), choose one of the setting with an icon of a remote next to it.
Be certain the camera selection for shutter release chosen for is for remote. If you can press your shutter release button and the camera takes a picture, you haven't got the right release chosen. Go to menu then you'll need to chose remote release. Mine works on a Nikon D5100, no issues.
I would suggest buying a Battery. Not being funny, but you have very little invested and the Battery being Dead; it stands to reason you should just replace it. The Remote probably works fine, or send it back.
I have Induro BL3 which is a good, robust all around size that can also work for the 500mm (which I have). But I also have the Gimbal Head (Induro GHB 1) that's my favorite for the 500mm.
My Logitech HD Pro Webcam is connected to my Apple Mac Mini via USB3.0 port, it works flawlessly. As I have not compared it with an old USB2.0 port, I don't know whether it is more smoothly or not with USB3.0.
No it gets the power from computer. You need a mini usb cable.
Apple requires a special Apple chip be used for with their devices for MFi compatibility. As for the price, you will have to ask Amazon why they are pricing them differently. Escort Inc charges the same price for either Apple or Android.
Yes. It's very handy.
Don't know
I'm not familiar with the Nikon D40, if it has the 10-pin remote terminal then you can use Phottix Aion Wireless timer without a problem. It is a great remote control. Try to contact the Customer Service of PHOTOTECH.
I used it for about 2 months on a D800. It worked fine, then stopped working. Phottix customer support was absolutely no help. I wouldn't recommend.
I have a 60d and it works great on mine and has 2 different connectors...I believe they are the n3 and headphone style...I love mine and use it a lot.
It comes with C6 and C8 shutter cables for Canon. So yes it should work. It works with my Canon 1Ds and with mini cable, my Fuji X-E2.
I would say probably it's fairly common for usb mice to work with what ever computer. I'm not 100% but I would say yes it prolly will.
The Dell Latitude ATG D630 can be upgraded to a max of 4 GB of RAM; you should buy 2 SODimms @ 2GB each to ensure best performance. You can try a vendor at Amazon ($39.99)--see
No but it has a port for flashdrives.
This machine weighs 5.1 lbs with dvd drive and 6 cell battery. 5.8 lbs with 9 cell battery. 6.8 lbs with a/c adaptor and 9 cell battery. To me this product is very light.
Yes
No
Try pulling the silver lever down while you twist.
Yes it does...
Yes, no matter how low the aperture they can't go past 2.8 and no auto focus.
Have not had any reasonable sensor flare issue on any of my lenses.
Yes it can
Yea it should work wit that Canon...I got tha rebel t3i
Jennifer, HDMI audio is often treated as a separate sound source. You may have to turn the volume up in windows sound settings. Also, you probably already know this: you need a cable for the audio out plug on the back that connects to your speakers.
It should work. I even tested it on a sharp projector with native 800x600 resolution and it worked. My Santo 1364x786 also works with this device.
You can. It converts digital signal into analog. It just happens to have a vga connection. Anything that a vga cable can do, such as adapt into a component, this device will allow.
Don't know for sure, but I had no luck with PS3, PS4 and Xbox 360. Some had a picture but no sound. One, I think it was the PS3, gave only extremely quiet sound. PS3 and PS4 picture didn't work unless I first plugged them into a TV and changed their resolution to 720p. For me this didn't work well at all.
Ours came with the arm that snaps onto the back of the cradle holder; the arm has a suction cup that you suction to the car window. From the picture that is shown, you did not get the arm w/attached suction cup. You will need to order the arm or the cradle will have nothing to mount to.
Yes, and its easy. 1. Menu, 2. use arrow key to go to the icon on the bottom right, 3, select "satellite guide" and thats it
Yes its rechargeable 6hrs in standby and recharge in 8hrs.
It comes with a cord with a small plug at one end (for the adapter) and a USB plug at the other. The cord is about six feet long, though I haven't measured it.
No, it will not work with HDMI switch.
No. This is a VGA-TO-HDMI converter. You'll need a HDMI-TO-VGA converter to connect your xbox to a computer monitor.
No. This device takes VGA and analog audio, and converts it to HDMI. Not the other way.
What kind of pavilion do you have? I have a DV6t-1200 and this battery works fine.
It has a port that allows an iPod to plug directly to it and charge it while playing. If your mp3 has the same connection then it would work
I don't know for sure because I have never used it that way but it connects via audio cable to my PC, so I'm guessing if your MP3 player has a jack for earphones, it should work fine. Sound is great, I would purchase another one.
I have Sabrent HDMI connected up too S-Video in from a Laser Disc player too HDMI out too LED flat screen TV and the color is just fine . If this individual says they only get black and white it's possible they have a bad unit and should return it . If it were me I would try connecting a different input device first .
Yes, it is made just for that.
Mine measures 4 1/8 straight across and 5 7/8 on the diagonal. Hope that helps.
Yes it does record in 16:9.
Yes - and with iMovie (at least the newer ones) you can actually import directly from the camera into iMovie- I can basically do a 90min soccer game and have highlights out that night---
After you plug in the camera with the usb connector, open the lcd screen. Press the "USB Connect". Click the "Playmemories icon on your desktop. On the left-hand side of your screen, at the top, click "CX-210". All the videos stored on your camera come up on your screen. Just click the one you want to view and watch it on your screen. Also, it helps to read your manual. Hope this helps.
Hi Taha, You can only project photos that are in the thumbnails on the camera. No external devices can be connected and used. Actually, you cannot even copy any movie pictures via the computer unless you have a special device sold by SONY, or you can record it onto a DVD recorder.
Yes you can. You can connect the camcorder to the TV via HDMI cable and use it to both record and at the same time display the image on the TV. The camcorder does not come with an HDMI cable, you'll need to get that separately.
I have a few models of Sony - and most do not have either feature - I have one that has an external mic port next to the hdmi port - but no headphone jack and I think the next higher version of this camera. To get both you would need to jump up a couple of levels.
You would have to convert the video to an appropriate format to be written to a standard DVD. They won't "play" if simply burned to a DVD. There are many freeware applications out there that should be able to do this.
Hi Palash, no, the manufacturer's warranty of this product is only valid in the country of purchase. Thanks_Mitch
Yes. I use it with my MacBook Pro (2011 early edition) and with Final Cut Pro X 10.0.9 for my editing needs. I has always worked perfectly.
No.
Adjust camera to use spot focus and make sure background isn't too close
Depends on the resolution, frame rate and movement in the scenes...
I don't know where you found this information, we have this camera and it is not the case. Recorded up to 3 hours non stop without any problems.
yes, i just zoom in on the image until i get what i want and then just save it.
Lithium Ion Type G, which is included along with a charger.
Hello Barbara, the following is what's in the box: Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX20 Digital Camera NP-BN Battery AC-UB10 AC Adapter Multi USB Cable Wrist Strap Paint Pen Instruction Manual 1-Year Limited Warranty
I was looking at buying either the Sony HX10, or the HX20 and saw your question. Although there really aren't any reviews on the Sony HX cameras yet (1 review doesn't count), the Cannon SX 260 has several, and a consistent theme is noise when recording video... to me this is a deal breaker, also the Sony HX 10 is 18mp & 1080 HD vs the 12mp & 720 HD on the Cannon. I'm leaning toward buying the Sony HX10, but are waiting for at least 10 reviews.
Japan
We use this at sporting events ie football games and at practice in daylight. We use the setting that lets in the max amount of light and have not had any problems, but everything is usually well lighted.
The one I use is most like one on the Adorama site if you search for "Sony Nylon Soft Carrying Case-organizer for camera." I had a friend make a little cloth pouch to go around it to protect the lens inside of the bag.
Yes. I had both of them. Just one battery
Yes at http://pdf.crse.com/manuals/4424086131/EN/contents/02/index.html
No, not that I see in the online manual, plus I don't see connectivity on the camera for an external mike. http://pdf.crse.com/manuals/4424086131/EN/contents/02/index.html
Trick question! You charge the battery to charge the camera. I believe the charger comes with the box, if not they are widely available for cheap prices.
Sorry Dong, I never searched for that. Why don't you ask the manufacturer? If you can.
Yes. The image is seen on the large screen only when shooting.
it's night performance is WAY better than I expected, it gives a good contrast with noiseless in low light conditions. use a tripod for better results. but keep in mind that you are not using a DSLR.
Yes, no cd.
I did not use yet
I'm not sure but it isn't expecially difficult to load and use with my "good quality" Dell computer running Windows 7. No doubt a simple custom software. I have't done any editing yet.
u may be able to use the USB port to connect it your TV if your TV has the USB port (i don't).
Yes, it does come with a rechargeable battery, however you must use the proprietary battery charger that comes with it. It does not use AA or AAA batteries.
Yes. The filter size is 37mm. I am using a TIFFEN 37mm UV Protector Filter to protect and prevent dust from going into the lense. I bought the filter from Amazon.
Each occassions lasting several hours. You can charge it in few hours. I have a spare battery. But never had to use it
Yes, it has a rechargeable battery. It did not come with an external battery charger though, so you will need to charge it while it's in the camera (or purchase a second battery).
You can adjust the brightness in a scale from 1 to 5. It's set to 3 most of the times. I used 5 one time when there was a lot of direct sunlight and I could see the screen without any problem. I hope my answer helps!
Not sure of battery size dear, but if I buy the camera than battery and charger comes with it. Hope I served what you needed. Thanks!!!
That's correct (you will not receive a memory card) unless you buy what they call a bundle that includes a memory card and possibly a case. I thought I was buying a "Father's Day bundle" that included a 16G card and fairly nice case with clip to attach but received a different bundle that included a 4G card and a substandard case. It is a nice camera and we like it very much just be careful on how you buy it.
Hey bud, so the earphones are originally and honestly are really amazing. I lost mine after 2 weeks. Very clumsy like that. But sorry, won't be able to answer warranty questions. But earphones are totally worth it. If you have the $$$ ofcourse!
Comes with wire harness, the stereo shop had to rewire my internal wires in the truck because they were blacked taped together. The old wire harness wasn't compatible with the new stereo. As for mounting sleeve I don't know exactly what that is. I was able to install it in my truck because, do you mean that metal cage around the stereo?
Does your current fob look exactly like the picture? If so, it will work. If you don't have a fob, google 2001 Ford Explorer key fob (or remote) and see what the pictures look like.
Micro SD goes in camera.
They do come with an ac adapter, they use a 9v as back up
1 pair RCA, AUX in the front
Yes. I own the KDC-152 and I have played mp3 CDs in this stereo.
Call your nearest Acura dealer, ask for parts and find out if your factory radio is single DIN, if it is, the new Kenwood will fit.
No you cannot
no
i Honestly think i might be its soul purpose, the voice comes int real nice, this portable audio device has a great bass sound to it which means it doesn't sound scratchy (with new batteries) when the music/ voice comes in. i would recommend for all audio uses especially Audio books :)
Forwarded the inquiry to jqleatherman@gmail who is currently living in Africa. He has an older HP laptop, and the battery was sent to Burkina Faso.
i found this feature rather limited.
Yes
Nope, the companion app is in the play store too so it doesn't even need to be side loaded.
From the widest parts of the entire fan - it is 5 5/8x5.5x3.5 (HxWxD)
18 inches to 2 feet
Yes
I would not recommend installing 3 GPUs on this board. The reason being that the 3rd PCI E slot has only x8 bandwidth. You`ll essentially be running the third card with half the bandwidth/performance.
It is more for alerting and not so conveniant. Sorry.
We have not had ours wet, but the part carried by the child does not have a seal on the battery compartment. The sound comes through three holes about the size of the wire on a paper clip. It could not take being submerged, but would probably not be hurt by splashes of water or rain as long as it was wiped off right away.
The bottom of the square is solid.
Sure, it's hotspot only, and you need a USIM card
This is for At&t microcell only, connection is different than sprint's airvana. I have both in my house and a dang xm anntena too. &#128533;
I have not use it for that purpose. I used it to stream Video files from my hard drive to the media player in another room. It works great.
If it states that it is, then it will most likely work. Mine fit correctly, just wouldn't hold a charge, so Amazon gave me the option of a new battery or a refund. I chose the refund. Keep in mind there are multiple companies out there on Amazon to buy from. I hope you have a great experiance. Amazon or their sellers will make a bad situation right, is the best part.
yes it does ether hard coded subs or side loaded subs work fine
It has no internal memory that you can access. I'm guessing that it must have some internal memory for it's OS but you can't access it. Memory card or USB. No Wi-Fi or any internet connection.
Yes...these cables were there. The device still works great,
Use function key to the right of the print screen button( adjacent to F12)
I personally haven't had any issues with phase cancellation, or any other type of interference.
Yes but it is a lousy piece of equipment.
It is not double insulated so suspect not. Ask someone at Home Depot about the Electrical Code Specs.
It does have plastic shielding so as long as the connection is safe from the elements I cant see any reason why it wouldnt work
It is junk I threw it out
This thing sucks just go buy an old tape recorder from the Salvation Army and it will work with windows eight they give you some outdated program from audacity just buy a tape recorder and download the audacity program from their website for windows 8 for free
I'm almost ready to pull the trigger on this laptop but the fact that it's been available since Dec. 2011 and NOT ONE REVIEW makes me very nervous. The ASUS A53E-EH71 15.6-Inch Laptop has been on Amazons Top 100 Best Sellers in Laptops List at #41 for 30 days plus...I just don't get it.
250+ yards? That's tough and it might just make it. It's got the best range of the items I have tried (in a low price range). But remember wifi is a 2 way street, just cause an iphone 250 yards away can "hear" this AP doesn't mean than the same iphone can transmit that far. Laptops will work father away than small portable devices (iPod/tablets/etc). And it would have to be line of sight, not a single thing in the way, no walls or trees or anything. If so, it might make it.
No
Thank You For your question! We currently have 3 in stock For $899.00 and ready for Same Day Shipment! This model scans down and side. This is From Lowrance: "the new StructureMap overlay feature allows anglers and boaters to view and create life-like underwater images of the lake, river or seafloor. With HDS Gen2 networked to the optional StructureScan sonar imaging module, you can easily overlay StructureScan images on top of traditional charts to provide a real-time view into underwater structure and its precise location on the map."
It should since I use very similar equipment (mic pro and same recorder). However, my suggestion is get this dual cold shoe and a the Camcaddie "rig" full version. You'll end up a getting a very escalable solution for any shooting purpose
1 year factory warranty
All sola lights have built in rechargeable batteries so Yes. But it is sealed and you cannot replace it. It's really good quality light have very small form and less weight than most other lights I used. Battery does hold well and seem to lasting if charged correctly
No. It's fitted specifically (and quite snugly) to Apple's wireless keyboard and trackpad.
You could get one here: http://www.mp4nation.net/brainwavz-hm5-spare-cable-3m Sonic Electronix sells them too
Dear Buyer Thank you for inquiring . If you order now, we can deliver you within 10 days. Thank you very much! Have an awesome day! We look forward to seeing you again soon. Best Regards, Samson Trading Customer Service Team Samson
In my case, it's plug &play. I suggest you proceed via My files and tap on the usb drive. Good luck.
Unfortunately not, the gTab2 - 10.1 has a wide plug port, where the gTab3 - 7 has a micro USB port as the phones have. Its just like Epic Touch 4G and the S4 ports
Unfortunately, no. It only does scrolling up and down. Not even left to right. We ended up getting an Apple Magic Mouse because I think once you hit that price range other mice will support the touch gestures as well.
Yes it does! The m600 is meant to run on Windows 7 so all functionality is present
The answer is yes 32Gb is a go!! This is a real nice board but make sure you get the memory off the approved list of supported DIMM's. Hers is a link to the support page at MSI for this board. http://us.msi.com/product/mb/970AG46.html#hero-specification. Also if you go with Windows 8.1 download the necessary drivers form this page as the will be newer than those on the Disc. Good luck this MoBo Rocks!!
It is all self contained. Just plug in the HDMI and ready to go. I don't recommend that you get this one though. The one I ordered worked one time and then just died. I found out that occurs regularly with them. Not a quality product. I got the Logitech 960-000921 TV Cam HD for Skype Calls on HDTVs and have been very happy with it.
No, this is a full frame lens (the image fills the FF sensor).
You will need Sony LA-EA2 E mount to A mount adapter to use this lense on Sony NEX 6 camera body. Remember this lense is manual focus only.
I bought a black one for my first gen. Kindle fire. It fits perfectly.
I would check Nikon's website for compatibility. If I can get my 30 year old manual, film-based Nikon lenses to work with my digital D-40X, I would think this newer lens should work with a newer Nikon digital SLR - Nikon is pretty good with compatibility and they are currently advertising even more modern Nikon SLRs with the same 55-300 VR zoom lens.
The lens that we are selling is brand new.
yes, indeed! that's why i purchased it. i only listen to books
yeah it comes with the head phones and they are waterproof as well
For Mac users, if you are iTunes users, you have to convert your music files into MP3 & WMA format songs, and then put them into the drive. &#65288;it won't sync to your itunes&#65289;
When I recieved the product, it didnt work at all with any of my devices.
Unfortunately we cannot ship outside of the US/Canada for an Amazon order, but you are welcome to check out our website cameta.com for shipping costs to New Zealand.
The key isn't chipped. You should be able to do that. I thought that because you can unscrew the key, that I could just take all the insides out and transfer them to the shell but you can't. Cutting the new key should work, though.
I am sorry, I do not know. You would do better to ask the seller.
No it is not.
No the mechanical Roccat keyboard is the Ryos MK Glow and Ryos MK Pro. The Isku is a non mechanical keyboard.
no, it is not waterproof. and sadly ive had a reaction to the cheap metal and have since had to replace the entire bracelet
I bought this for my Acer Aspire One 722 and it works fine.
yes, the new one is 6 cell (I believe the old one was a 3 cell li-ion) - still working great.
Because the wireless Accessory kit fit's more than one model many of them being much more expensive than $52.
Im assuming you got it by now but incase your still confused:
Connects via wireless adaptor and receiver. Much like Bluetooth, but not Bluetooth. Kind of like a wireless mouse and the USB adaptor. Most aren't Bluetooth.
No, unfortunately it has to be a newer tablets with provisions to accommodate these components internally.
Yes it works with MAC. I use the default driver that loads when I plug it in. I use miXscope software for MAC. It all works great. There are other applications you can use for capture and display miXscope is the one I settled on.
Yes, that's what I use
Yes, it has a wall adapter that will work with 110 - 240 VAC, but it is an American plug, so you may need an adapter to plug it into your wall socket. Hope this helps. Mike
Mine showed up with twin 750's and a 8g ssd.
3.5 pounds / 1,6 kgs. It has been my best achievement within the last IT investments in my life. ;)
I strongly doubt it but you might want to contact BixPower about a 12v ext. battery. I use a large one (about the size of a tablet) from them to power a 12v device and a 5v device all weekend (about 50 hours).
it does charge. it cannot replace a regular socket however and the plugs do not work for plugging something in. It looks very fake.
If you mount it externally and have the clearance behind the handle it should fit
I have no idea about fitting Meade - but a perfect fit for the Vanguard.
The 3 Amp should be a good choice to run that fan. I have a Vornado 510B (which is similarly rated) and I run it between 50-75% voltage to get absolute quiet operation and it works beautifully.
No
I've got the pro700mk2 and they for well
This backback will keep you laptop and notes dry in light rain. However, it will not do so well in heavy rain or when it is exposed to entended periods in the rain. To protect your laptop and notes you should get a backpack rain cover and carry it inside the pack or carry waterproof bags that you can use to internally protect your laptop and notes.
It depends on your habit because it is not so big. However, I think it is enough for Man's weekend trip.
There are no electrical contacts, at least on my adapter, to enable VR to work. Of greater concern is that DX lenses have no aperature ring and when mounted will be set to minimum aperature of f/22 or f/32. Older lenses with an aperature ring can be adjusted.
Useless
Yes, it has the threaded hole on the bottom to screw in the tripod mount.
I use a Duracell CR2 battery
nope!!!!
No, just one speed, but it works very well.
Hi Brandon, I have not compared it to the rectangular, I only have this one. But for the price, I've been happy with it for what it is and what it does.
Yes and this is a great remote.
The controller does not goes of to sleep unless you switch it off. The remote is always up and using the battery. But it still has been running for me for over 3 months.
I have a Sachtler pro tripod which has spikes (when i am not using the rubberized folding spreader that keeps the legs from slipping.) The spikes fit into the unit above the wheels and you tighten a large screw bolt to secure the foot.
You can but not with the multiple wheels. You have to change it to one wheel per leg. Make sure it's a smooth surface.
Worked on my Lenovo G550, not sure about the produce number as I do not have the laptop with me anymore.
No. It has the spot for it in the plastic body, but it is covered. Eg, they use the same mold for other camera that do have sd card capabilities, and they punch out the slot.
You dont delete pictures off the frame itself. You take your SD card and delete pics from that on a computer.
In the booklet that came with it... Pictures: JPEG up to 16 mega pixel resolution Vedio: MPEG-1/2/4, Motion JPEG Audio: MP3 USB ports: -USB 2.0 Device -USB 2.0 Host That's about all I can answer...
Yes, yes and yes. The manual makes it easy
I believe this device needs to be positioned as close to the listeners seating level as possible to be appreciated. The front speakers should roughly be in the same plane as the listener's ears. Don't think you are likely to be satisfied with a floor location. Check the return policy. If you don't like it you may be able to return within 30 days for refund, but you also may have to pay return shipping.
The Zevox can only receive an analog audio signal. I connected my Zevox to the headphone output on the tv and it works without a problem. The fire tv broadcasts an audio signal that is incompatible with the Zevox.
Yes...it will accommodate almost 9, 6, 1 dimensions...so 8.75, 5.5, .75...my nephew loves the case and it is really pretty and well worth the money!
It should, but not sure. You would need the female/male port to connect to it because the keyboard doesn't come with one. If the kindle fire has a mini usb port then it should work, but again not sure. I have a google nexus 2012 & the keyboard works great with it.
Yes Siera, you can pan and tilt the camera in any direction. As the overall vertical and horizontal swing has no more than 50 degree swing either side, so you sould carefully position the camera first to avoid unable to point beyond the overall 100 degree swing angle.
No built in speakers Color is very good Easy push buttons As far as I know it is. Seh
I do not know . SEH
Yes it is a touchscreen. No it does not have Beats Audio. It has something called Waves MassAudio. I love this laptop and have no compaints, but if I had to pick something, I would say the audio is not as good as Beats.
Yes. Of Course... Both questions are POSITIVE. Regards
i hope so, i just bought one yesterday at staples. what a great deal they had on it, couldnt pass it up. with all those features for that price i couldnt pass it up. ill update once i get it in. i had to order it at the store because they were out of stock.
No I do not see one. I got it for my friend she loves it.
Yes. I loaded about 400 pictures to a SD card and inserted it into the frame. Worked great!
Yes, it should, the toner uses only the two middle cables, so in this sense you will be fine.
If you match up the part numbers (battery wise.)you should have no problem. I ordered one of the replacement batteries from Amazon and put it in my VA 10 Sony laptop; and, had zero problems. You need to be sure the voltage and amp rating are equal in the replacement - as a second check.
Yeah, it worked like a charm
No it does not, you'll have to buy them separetly but they are cheap
I bought that kind of memory for my iMac almost one year ago and it improved its performance and is still working wonderfully
The maximum RAM for your particular Macbook Pro model is 8GB (2 4gb of ram). You can also go to this website to find out more specs of your Macbook Pro. www.everymac.com Look up your Macbook Pro and it will let you know the max ram your Mac can hold. Good luck and hope I answered your question.
They are genuine Lenovo, and they get warm to the touch but not hot.
Dell computers come in two flavors/platforms, Open or Proprietary (refers to the motherboard}. The proprietary platforms will only work with hardware bought from Dell. Open platforms will work with any hardware. I can find no information on your computer that tells me which platform it is. My guess is NO, but find out in the manual which motherboard it is.
Yes - It can charge both Ni-CAD & Ni-MH
Device is a receiver not an emitter
Comes with a cord that will plug into any USB.
This device does not support phone calls. Hope that helps! :)
I would suggest comparing the specifications of the xps 502x and your XPS 14 and if the keyboards or the laptop itself has the same demensions then I would say yes. Obviously if you base your decision off the demensions of the laptops, do a visual check to make sure both have standard keyboard layouts. Best,
Yes, it will work with that computer and replace that battery. If you look at the product description, it says the battery can replace the battery you have with the computer you have.
The specs look the same so they should fit I used it for d255e-13111 http://www.screenmall.com/laptop-lcd-screen-for-acer-aspire-one-d2552509-slim-101-wsvga-glossy-led-backlight-p-65685.html Here is a link for a site that shows specs for your midel looks the same as this. Hope this helps the install was easy too
Yes it works like any other keyboard.
I couldn't fine one online but can email you a copy of mine
I don't know - We use it on our wi-fi network only.
It works with any computer that has USB port. It has both USB & audio jack cords. The one in a photograph is exactly what you get.
A drive placed into the GoFlex Thunderbolt can be a boot device.
No cord is included.
With the whole mouse. Think of a regular mouse but turned 90 degrees on its side.
I believe they do. It might bulge out than the std. battery(I think its called NP-FV30) but it should work.
That's a very interesting thought. We are always looking into what we can do to provide DVR service options that can appeal to everyone. Would you mind suggesting this as an idea for us by clicking on 'Suggest an Idea' on this page: http://support.dropcam.com/forums/20768048-feature-requests ? It would also be great to know why you would like recording for just one day. Thanks! David Corea
I believe it is around 3" collapsed.
Yes. You have to go to Settings-&gt;Devices-&gt;Audio devices to set the headphone output to "all audio" and it works for both game and chat audio as well as the microphone. I use these everyday. The only shortcoming is a lack of volume control on the headphones.
I bought these earphones just for gaming on my pc but I got more than that they are amazing I consider you buying these earphones
no, this system is not wireless, it all has to be wired. Now if you are asking if you want view wireless on your pc, then yes
You just pull very firmly. I was a little scared to break it or that the tilt ability didn't work, but it's actually easy if you just pull very firmly. The vertical bars will unlatch from the mount & then you can adjust how far forward you want to tilt the tv.
There are several sheetrock anchors on the market that support up 75lbs per anchor. Put 3 on top and three on the bottom and you have 450lbs of support. Use the spiral auger metal anchors. You can find them at home depot.
I have no idea, but the specs for this product should give you the answer. We put this up almost a year ago.
2"x8"
I really don't know. I have an HP Pavilion g7 that it fits perfectly.
Ummm, am not perfectly sure whether or not the keyboard's model number is important in this regard. I just read the comments & did a little research online abt the replacement keyboard for the HP laptop & decided to buy this for my dad, which is working perfect! Feels even sturdier than the factory one...lol
Amazingly simple, especially in this day and age. User friendly instructions and everything included other than a televison to use as a monitor. We've had it for quite some time now and it's still working great. Not the best picture quality in the world but it fit our budget and we figured it was better than not having anything. If we had the cameras mounted closer to the area we want to observe it would be better, but our particular circumstances don't really allow for that. No regrets in purchasing this product at all.
I don't have a lifeproof case but if the case is thicker than 1/32" (1 mm) it will not work.
I don't know but the side had to be trimmed for an An Asus 10.1 : Tablet
This is a clear cover for the screen, so there is no need for a camera cut out. It does not have a negative effect on the forward facing camera.
Very cheap product. Mine never worked out of the box.
Seems very easy once you figure which buttons do certain thing. Yes you can use all buttons but will need a monitor to see your progress as numbers show up on screen. It's a very nice device works well. Be mindful of which way you insert memory card may need to turn it upside down
I think you can choose to record in 1min 5 min and 10min segments. Also, you choose the quality of he video. You choose the size of your SD card. All of these parameters determine how much video time you can record. It's been a long time, but I recall that 1m takes about 40-70Mb of memory. This also depends on your lighting and camera. Better lighting and camera produce better quality video and the size of the video is larger.
The Canon I purchased came with the strap. I believe most camera's do come with a strap.
The TYT9000 will transmit anywhere between 136-174 MHz. There is a transmit-disable function in the menus to prevent such unlicensed operations. Mine is set up to hear the local emergency services but not transmit on them. Also the weather channels, same way. If I were to be illegal, I could leave transmit enabled on the MURS & Marine channels. If I wanted to be illegal about it. Nils Young W8IJN
They will fit in the 2015 WRX so they should fit in the STI.
I'm confused with the question these are modular inputs and neither 2.5mm or 3.5mm.
On my latest pair it's straight.
Couldn't find my measuring tape, but according the Koss' website, about 4 feet. (which equates to around 121.92 centimetres) http://www.koss.com/en/products/headphones/on-ear-headphones/PortaPro__Porta_Pro_On_Ear_Headphone#Specs
yes. Sr.
yes it fits, it is 17.3, just like my hp computer!
The compartment seems adequate enough for me when traveling. I was able to keep boarding passes, etc. I can't tell dimensions, but it did work for me.
It won't fit, because Asus G750 laptops is huge! and I had tried. fortunately amazon return is super easy to do.
If all you need is a cord, you can buy the plug and wire at Radio Shack. Look at the charger rating for your unit if you need the wall transformer too. This puts out 12 volts at 3 amps or 36 watts. Don't try to use it on a piece of equipment that requires more amps!
It would be tight.
Has one PCI Express x16 (used - for video card), one PCI Express x8 (open), and 3 open PCI slots. Has 3 USB 2.0 connectors on the front panel and 5 in the rear.
Speedilghts have MANY guide numbers, one for each zoom level, and each power level. Plus a GN in feet is simply 3.28 times the GN in meters, so that is another set of numbers. You need to download the manual and look at the Guide Number chart in it. My YN-565EX guide numbers appear to be rather correct. The older model YN-465 was 33. Make sure you are comparing same models.
Yes you need to.
Yes
Yes, it is. I'm using this cable with a c41 wireless genie currently.
should work yes, they are not dependent on the laptop type.
Hi Brad. .. I don't think it can but in all honesty I would not use this ... It drains the battery and rarely works properly
Sorry, but I am not sure if the chip in this adapter works with Canon 6D. It does work fine on my Canon 60D though.
Not sure. Wonder if you need to do a factory reset? Serial number for radio will still be registered with your Grace Digital radio account even after the factory reset.
Hi geezygirl If it is the around the same sizes as i pad and kindle yes I would think so but check measurement first I hope this helps cheers Ray
You have to get an adapter for the newer ones . The iPhone when the charger changed.
you can play anything using the AUX connection. I use both the iphone on the top, but also I use this with the Galaxy S2 slecting AUX in with the control. The Pyle Home is Loud it need some tuning with the control control.
Yes
Yes, it is compatible adapter for your Asus X75A. Thank you.
I had actually purchased this for a friend and subsequently returned it when they didn't arrive on time so I couldn't tell you for certain. However, I believe they're meant to be worn as is. I'd imagine that wearing glasses underneath would be rather uncomfortable.
The unit comes with everything needed except a drill and bit! We have really enjoyed the unit. We fly fish for reds in the marsh in south Louisiana and did not connect the depth finder. Not needed! We are typically in less than 3' of water. The GPS with tracking is a must in the marsh.
i believe either 10 or 15 feet
operation manual NO
yes
I do not know but it would be best to contact the seller to be sure and then have written documentation if there ever is an issue..
The longer I have used them has been on transatlantic flights and they have never died on me, so I guess they go 9 to 10 hours at least.
1) Headphones 2) A/C adaptors for different countries and voltages (3) 3) A/C charger for the headphones (1) 4) Wire to connect the headphones to the music device (2) 5) USB charger for the headphones - Plus instructive.
No, it's for the regular ipad. I do believe there is one for the mini ipad. Just make sure the description states that it fits the mini ipad. I hope this helps
Check to make sure that the drivers installed correctly, make sure that this is selected as your sound output in the control panel, and that volume is turned up there.
The one I purchased did.
It receives a good picture as long as ur stop once you move it goes out.
With Windows 7--yes--XP you have to power down replace drive and reboot.
No. It is for listening only; there is nothing to talk into.
You have to be a student or faculty at a post-secondary school, so I think you should be able to get it. If you have an e-mail with a .edu domain, you should be set.

I activated Microsoft Office University 2010 a week after office 2013 was released without any problems and via windows 8. Microsoft fully supported this product install. Hope this helps.
Hello, You should be able to preview courses when you search for them, without having to be playing that particular course. Thanks
yes it can or let me say that I do with a wall charger for my phone
Yes, this GPS unit comes with a power cable that plugs into your car's cigarette lighter plug. This special cable also has a built-in antenna which allows the unit to receive the traffic information.
Yes. You can remove the center column. They have a separate attachment you use that is about 4inches long in order to still attach the ball head. With that price attached you can get it about 4 inches from the ground from what I recall.
After reading some of the comments, I tried once again to fit my IPAD Mini but it does does extend wide enough... Not sure how the others managed it..
The Guantlet Air Sleeve product is available only for the AIR models, 13'' & 11''. However, they do have Macbook Pro 15'' products too. Right here: http://www.thule.com/en/in/products/sleeves-and-cases/laptop-and-tablet-cases
I purchased for cq56
I can't say for sure. my laptop is a compaq CQ56. I would buy it though cause I would think that it would. This is a good battery and I have not had any problems with it at all. I THINK it will work for your laptop cause it's a Compaq and very similar CQ#.
Yes.
Yes, it should work from 110 to 220V, that is what the plug indicates.
It might, I'm really not sure. It fits mine perfect. But it's made for Asus Transformer. I'm sure you typed in your brand and model and it came up with this case. So I guess it's a 50/50 chance it works. But I love this case. Would highly recommend if your laptop/tablet is close to the style.
I'm thinking that it won't, because these pens are really made specifically for each device. I tried using other drawing tablet pens with my bamboo, and with my experience so far, it really does have to be the original stylus that the device came with.
No
Yes, it does, thank you!!!
Adapter rings are provided for a number of lens sizes. Not sure about the ttl flash function but suspect it would. I use it off camera as much as on to back light flowers, up light and side light. It works great and is very useful in low light when shooting flowers.
yes, this works with nikon and canon it is important that your camera has a standard hot shoe, this model comes with adapters for all sizes of lenses
No you will not.
It should.
China
Yes
San Disk, Ultra 16GB series 10
No, this camera is NOT waterproof.
16
Touch menu button, then touch the outer ring where the flash indicator it located. When you have selected the mode the camera mode has an automatic flash. This should fix the problem. Each Mode has different flash modes. If this doesn't work for you then it may need factory service. Hope this helps.
It's fair but not outstanding. It isn't what I would chose for weddings or birthday parties.
On F770exr self timer can be set for 2 or 10 second delay after shutter button is pressed before either a single, a bracketing of 3 or continuous for 5 shots can be taken with each execution of the self timer.
mac?
It's macro is pretty good, i will post customer images soon. Or I can send images directly through email
No
I dont know because I am not a seller, I am a buyer, I am being using these batteries without Any problems in more than 24 months
Im not shure, Im sorry
Hello Jerome....works great on my Toshiba L505 and my laptop is how I run my home business harveyvickery dot com and it is so nice to have the longer battery life especially doing online screen share and skype etc.
No
Yes. 2 slots 1 for Micro SD 1 for SDXC
The jack, where it plugs into something is a single piece with one pin and the plastic housing it is in is L shaped. I hope that is what you meant... LOL! If not, I can try again.
Yes
Yes, maybe a hair too much,when at full volume they do vibrate. I noticed they have a lifetime warranty,which I thought was pretty cool.
Hi Linda, Its not easy to change the camera is hard to the 5th wheel. Thank you
KenRockwell.com indicates 67mm filters. This is a fantastic lens.
You can but it will want to re-cal periodically as monitors do change in time. It's easy to ignore the periodic prodding to redo it. People who process/print pictures, or anything else that requires rather accurate color from their monitor have the most interest in keeping up with the slow deterioration of colors.
You should always edit your images with your laptop cover opened where you see the screen at its brightes and consistently keep doing it that way. That means you should calibrate your monitor to that specific, upright setting. I would have an image printed and compare it to your screen
It really depend on your system. If your system is OS X, do not buy it
6.5 x 2.5 inches appx.
Yes
The Power source is through the same cable as the signal for the Rotary motor. There is a small battery operated hand controller. It rotates either left or right with a press of a button. Very simple installation. Work's well.
yep
Yes. It will fit both ATX and Micro ATX. It comes setup for regular ATX, but all you have to do to get a Micro ATX to fit is move a few screws which is very easy. There is an online manual explaining what everything in the case does, and how to get each type of M/B to fit nicely. Good luck!
Many. Stand off's are at least 9 to support ATX and all kinds of screws for the rear pci, drive bays etc. There a whole bag of fasteners of which half of them are never used in typical builds. Antec rules.
Manfrotto 504PLONG Long Sliding Video Camera Plate for 504HD Fluid Head will work...
yes. That's exactly how mine is set up, as an access point plugged into my main router via an Ethernet cable. One of the choices in the setup menu is "access point". I then use my same radio SSID and password in the D-link as my main wireless router. When I move away from the main router toward the D-link, the wifi locks into the D-link and I get full strength bars. It works great.
If you're familiar with Belkin entry level routers its about the same. I live in a two story house with solid concrete walls. The router is downstairs and I get good signal on the side of the upper floor above the router. On the other side of the upper floor I have to use a repeater.
No, there is no image stabilization like in some camera lenses.
They weigh 27 to 34 ounces depending on which size you get. Most are around 27 ounces so just over a pound and a half.
Yes, strap is included.
Feels like two pounds.
There is a strap that attaches to the binoculars, not the case.
Yes, it's a standard mount for pretty much any dslr.
I have no idea what you are talking about
I purchased some 'Banana Plugs' much like these: http://www.amazon.com/Connector-Banana-Plugs-Screw-Black/dp/B0093F4ROI/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1357572009&sr=1-3&keywords=banana+plugs+for+speakers They are simple to affix to your speaker wiring and will plug into the fittings on the rear of the Sony unit with ease. Directly wiring the terminals is possible, but tiring and difficult. The plugs are the way to go.
manual says europe 230 vac 50/60 hz but plug is US style and manual says must be changed
Yes it does, but I had to go to the Sony website and read the full specs to confirm that. Amazon is sadly deficient in the specs of the electronics they sell.
GREAT.
Yes, the headphone jack works independently, so you can listen privately or with others.
This model works on both 110v and 240v, though UL certification is for 110v.
As long as it has an HDMI port available, I see no reason why it shouldn't. Use a high quality "high speed" HDMI cable and you should be fine. It also has composite (RCA) connectors for hooking up to older TVs as well. But I suspect you'll only be using it or high def video, so you'll just be hooking up via HDMI. As far as I know, there shouldn't be any issues. It's just another HDMI video source.
No unless it is part of a special bundle set.
Yes it is part of the system
Its a standard 3.5 stereo jack
you will need to purchase a optional bracket to mount the speakers, but it is possible
Hi, the only thing that you needed to purchase is an HDMI cable for connecting this Sony Home Theater System to the TV. Anything else are included in the package like cable wires for the speaker, etc. -Ely
Chris, I believe i have owned mine for a couple years now and I don't see it listed on Sony's website as a current model. It has most likely been replaced by a more current model. If you want just the blu-ray player (without speakers, etc.) I think your best bet is to search for used on Amazon, ebay, etc. Good luck.
It has built-in wifi that must be configured to access your network. It will appear as a device on your home network. After that it can access the Internet for Netflix, updates, etc.
There is no clock function. It is however incredibly useful in ways of marking waypoints. Its battery life is amazing as well. I use it as a hunting/tracking aid. Let's face it... If you are out on a trek and need to know what time it is then you need to rethink your trek :)
No, it is very simple. Just has three locations to mark, and retrieve.
My cover did not have that feature.
It should work with any mobile DVD player that has an IR transmitter. Keep in mind, IR headphones require "line of sight" with the player to function. If your DVD player has two IR channels (like mine does) make sure you set the player to transmit on channel A to work with these.
Write the vendor you bought it from. If you forget who that was, write Amazon and they will tell you.
No. These are typically used for automotive monitors that utilize infrared audio transmitters. Generally, consumer tv's do not use this technology.
Not unless you have an IR port on your iPod or iPad.
I don't know - it worked with my factory installed DVD player in my gmc vehicle.
No, it's a bridge camera, has many features that a slr camera does. But, has a fixed lens, and usually a smaller sensor. This one isn't bad at all, I'm very pleased with it. Just have to understand, it isn't a $1000.00 camera.
It doesn't have a computer cable. I just take the SD card out of the camera and put it in the computer. I don't think you can buy a cable for it. Sorry I wasn't more help.
yes please, I used it in London and Africa
Yes, I have been using it with my MacBook Pro for a couple years now.
Yes. I use one with my All-in-one desktop and one with my Laptop, and it works great.
Yes, and very easy to set up.
Yes, all X lenses can be used on the X-T1
yes
Both of the ones I received were a dark red (as pictured)
I can not say as I don't have the models you mentioned to compare. I can say I was unhappy with SONY video cameras in the same price range.
Unfortunately no it does not
The camera will limit video recording to 10 mins. However, if you immediately press record again you can resume recording right away, you can record an additional 10 mins and then fuse the 2 videos together using the editing software. You can repeat this process for as many times as you like.
I don't use kodak easy share. I just download my picture into the computer and email them.
Just tested, in manual mode, exposure locks into your desired setting. This function does not seem to be available in automatic mode, but is easily found in manual mode.
Yes it can. You can buy an after market one that works fine. I believe I found the one I have here on Amazon.
While saving the image to the SD card, it says "Busy".. if it is around a second or lesser, nothing to worry... however if it is Busy for longer time, it may be some issue with your SD card or Camera... you can try another card and if the behavior is same, you need to go to the nearest service center. If SD card is slow, try with another SD card with higher speed.
Here's a link which confirms the micro SD thingy - http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/520HS/520HSA.HTM
yep
The battery life definitely leaves something to be desired. There is plenary of battery life to take pictures of a party at your house or a short activity (4-5 hours) if you want more than that I suggest buying a spare battery. The camera is definitely worth it. You can play with the settings and get a lot more life out of your battery, I prefer to run it at high energy.
I would go with the 10 mm so it secures stronger good luck
No. The D4 has a special peripheral connector to attach the WT-5A. The D5200 does not.
The padding is quite OK. I have been using this backpack for 1 year and very happy with it. It is of very high quality, the best backpack I've ever owned
Yes, this definitely fits under an airplane seat. I've taken it on three flights and haven't had any issues.
If your router has wireless capabilities, you need nothing else, unless you have a system laptop or desktop that does not have wireless software/hardware that allows it to search for the wireless signal from your router.
Wifi extender, extends the range of your wifi router. Dual range means it supports connections on the 2.4ghz band and 5ghz band at the same time. In laymans terms, the device will extend both bands (wifi) coming from.your router at the same time, so you can connect devices that are further away. Let me know if that answered your question. Please mark my review as helpful.
Do no fit, because the case you mentioned is much larger than the stand permitted size. I have one 9.0 inch hard and forced.
Depending on who you bought it from, the seller should have a return policy of some sort. The reputable sellers will cover shipping if the product is defective, though they're not technically obligated to do so. Have you contacted them to ask?
Yes. The seller should provide a tracking number as well.
You dont need a PC, the Nook have an adapter to connect it to AC power.
Cord comes with it for connecting to computer. Yes
It shouldnt be.Check to make sure the driver is installed.They might have missed that. It should be under network connections.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAfoSVZEn9Q
Yes, this model comes with Windows 7 Pro.
Comes with one Serial Port
No it will not
Yes, 2 boxes of 2 speakers per box.
im note sure i purchase it for my Honda Civic, im assuming it fit to any car that speakers size is 6.5"
I recieved 4 new speakers, grills and hardware packs. It arrived in 4 separate speaker boxes.
# Expansion Slots: * 1 PCI Express x16 (Gen 2.0) * 3 PCI Express x1 (Gen 2.0) * 1 PCI Express Mini Card (Gen 2.0)
Yes it is. No problems at all. It will upload directly into iMovie.
The JVC 1.5Megapixel 1080p is wonderful! Simple to use and you can take photos while videotaping. I have had mine a year and I love it!
Yes it is. Takes great pics!
Absolutely. I used my laptop as a sound board for a local community theater and I used this bag to transport my laptop, a three ring binder which held my script, my kindle, a book light to light the script, snacks, and there was still plenty of room for more and it showed no signs of being stressed by the load.
Locations are shown with address and you can see the naborhood street view. very accurate.
If the vehicle has the OBD-II port connection, it should work. Check the manufacturer's website for a simple 30-second "how-to" installation video. The connection is under the steering wheel area, so unless someone actually knows where and what to look for, the unit is not obvious and is easily disregarded even if seen.
I was able to use it on my mac, however, the you will need to download the drivers as the CD does not fit in the mac drive (it's too small).
Yes but the volume changer only works with iphone. My Android can't operate it.
no it does not have a mic
My Galaxy tab 2 did not fit. The keyboard has a black guide for the tablet which is made to come off so as to put a guide on for the 10 inch tablet. The guide for the 7 inch tablet is too narrow to allow thee tablet to go down far enough to connect with the plug at the bottom of the keyboard.
No, I bought an extra battery!
It was a pretty good deal actually. It included a memory card + case + cleaning kit + a pack of zero ink paper
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BNC_connector , it is a cable type.
We don't have the exact same camera, but we do have a dark color camera that provides 700TVL resolution and 2.8-12mm adjustable lens. Please visit the following link to check out the camera http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005I5LXYE
GW stands for great wall which is in china.
Yes, It can be adjusted to just about any position you can think of. I love this product! I would buy another but, this one will probably last forever.
If you plan on using it in portrait (standing up) it's not a problem but if you use it in landscape (long ways) tablet must be under 10" long from edge to edge not the screen size.

No
Our item location is in California, US.
I have a 2013 Macbook Air (mavericks) and it does NOT recognize the mic part. Headphone works great. Curious if other answers are theoretical or it works for them.
If after an overnight charge it won't turn on, you bought a lemon. Return it
No it will not.
It comes with the harness u have to put it in the plug harness its a black plastic piece that comes in the package it should have one for each plug. If they didnt come with it you will have to cut the wires from the old bulbs and connect them to the new ones
It is not write protected
I don't think you will have any problem. This is a very generic memory suitable for any platform I think.
This is non-ecc memory and I believe servers run ecc memory...but I'm really not sure if it would work or not...just google it
No, that should use sodimms
CL = C.A.S. Latency, which is the delay (latency) while the ram finds the address to read/write data from/to. With lower CAS Latency, seek operations complete faster, and so more read/write operations can be completed in any period of time. Basically, lower latency = faster performance. For Office/home Computers or Home Servers* CL11 is Ok - save the money. For Gaming Computers or low-end business servers*, CL9 is best - spend a few dollars extra. *Servers for critical work should actually use ECC (Error Correction Code) ram, and not this ram, which is Non-ECC.
if the S4 is a "note" smart phone,i.e. supplied with a pen, most probably yes. If it's just a touchcreen smartphone it won't-
It should. But it may have reduced functionality as the tab 3 was not meant for pens .
contact sony or go on ebay
not that I know of !
First you register the device with Sony. There's a process where you login to Amazon Prime and after that it's a matter of selecting Amazon Videos. Hope that helps. The device is great.
Yes you can. Happy holidays.
No this will not work for moto g. I purchased this plug thinking it would but the plug does not fit the phone. I purchased Chrome Cast and it allows me to cast what's on my phone or tablet directly to my TV. I highly recommend ChromeCast!
No. It does not include either batteries or battery charger.
I have a 4s and they work just fine
Yes. They will work fine.
http://www.suntekstore.com/goods-10008917-replacement_ear_cup_pads_for_sony_mdr-v600_mdrv600_mdr-v900_earpads.html use these instead. The 80mm's are a little to small. I still use them on my wireless headphiones , but the other site noted here will be a perfect size for those wireless headphones.
Not that I am aware of.
You can use a cheaper brand from a computer store but you should ask the computer guys when you go there.
Desktop
I own this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005O65JXI/ref=oh_details_o00_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
It should . Check your printer specs . What the printer cover specs . Take tape ruler . Measure
yes
No because the tablet does not have any USB ports.
Cross refill fits
Yes
Yes PowerEdge 2950 power supplies auto switch between 110V and 220V power when either is applied.
No drivers necessary. Just plug it into your USB port and it functions as expected. I formatted mine once by accident, but did not need to install any driver afterwards.
Yes! I use this to dock my iPhone 4 it plays music and my ambiance sound from an app. My sister can use it with her 4s as well.
This keyboard did not connect to my iPod so I returned it. It was supposed to be Bluetooth compatible but it was not. I bought a small nonfolding keyboard that was Bluetooth compatible so I use that.
Works great with my mini iPad. Takes some getting used to. Cannot be used on your lap as it folds in half.
everything except print screen
No. Not on mine anyway. They might be referring to the little legs that pop out to angle the keyboard for easier typing.
My daughter got these last year for her birthday and use on her iPad2. They work fine with it. Keep in mind the little flower near the end may be restrictive, depending on the case that the iPad's in. My daughter had a really thick and bulky kids' case, so we had to carve a little more out of the case so it would plug in, but if you don't have a bulky case (or even if you do and you have to carve a bit out of the foam, as we had to), it should work fine.
It is about 2.5 - 3 feet in length.
It was not for me, so I don't know.
No, this module its no compatible with any laptops out there. This is for desktop
This Hand grip does not float at all. So you would be luck if the backdoor float would float both camera and the grip. The wrist tether is a necessity, because as soon as you let of the camera, with the Granade grip attached, your rig will be headed to the bottom. Save your self the grief and disappointment and buy the Go Pro handle float.
If the extension pole or selfie stick has a 1/4"-20 mount at the top, then yes you can attach it to either.
Yes
No, The T1i Takes a LP-E5 Battery
I dont see why not! I use them for recording and they have a pretty flat response so your amp tone should be pretty accurate through them.
If the jeep is a double din radio it will fit. Yes it also come with the microphone for the blue tooth.
Only if your TV has the appropriate RCA connections. The video will NOT be in 1080 because the old RCA style video connection does not support it.
With me was real bad, at lease you got audio . In my tv no audio no video, just said, the cable not support .
I don't have ipad mini, so I cannot answer this question.
it does
I think another user posted on it, but their post is missing. I looked into this option and all you have to do is purchase a compatible steering wheel control adapter and then it will work. Pioneer makes one , the PAC SWI-PSv1 that should work, and there is also the Axxess ASWC-1 Universal controller that would work. Pioneer brand : http://www.amazon.com/PAC-SWI-PS-Universal-Steering-Interface/dp/B001EAWNVY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389934303&sr=8-1&keywords=Pac+swi-psv1 Axxess brand : http://www.amazon.com/Axxess-ASWC-1-Universal-Interface-Connector/dp/B00B4PJC9K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389934206&sr=8-1&keywords=Axxess+ASWc Hope that helps! :)
The picture shows what it truly is.... a single din. Must be a typo.
I put it in my 2007 Tacoma. I went to http://www.crutchfield.com/ to get the proper face plate and mounting hardware for the radio. Went in easy with the instructions and fit very well. Crutchfeild is very good about telling you weter things will it or not.
connect the memory wire to +12v
I don't know. I only gave my opinion on the product after installing it in my car. I do know that this is a double DIN stereo and will fit in any car with a double DIN slot.
this pioneer is a standard radio.if you do a search on a 99 Corvette for a radio kit for standard radio I bet it would work just fine.
Yes, autofocus will work with D90 and product description says it has Vibration reduction. Mine does not have VR, so this must be a newer model.
Yes
This is un-buffered memory. check what kind of memory your system takes.buffered or un-buffered. If it is un-buffered then its good. First search HP Pavilion 500-281 spec.
Yes, it does. I love it.
Toshiba uses quite a few similar battery packs in their laptops. Best bet is to take the Toshiba part number from the battery and look it up on the the Anker web site (ianker.com) to be sure. Once you find the right one, there will be a button to take you back to Amazon to actually purchase it. Hope this helps.
Don't know. I have a different Toshiba. I wasn't sure about mine and went to the Anker website that confirmed it fit. It has worked well for ~ a year
I do not know. Sorry. You might want to ask the company. I'm just a customer who bought the battery.
No, It doesn't work. It works with a mouse pad.
usb cable, strap, and notting else.
The AC charger should put out enough amps to charge the phone, but the DC adaptor included in the kit will power it but not charge quickly.
Amazon Prime is not an APP offered with the HR34. It would have to be an APP on your TV or other device (Blu Ray Player, ROKU, etc.)
HD 200 hours. SD 400 hours
I also just down loaded SkyPortal. I have an IPAD, but I will test it to see they work together.
yes, but not the 11".
it should work fine, the case comes with removable padded spacers for filling any voids. the only concern I would have is for the diameter of your optical tube, I'm not sure what 130mm equates to in inches. mine is an 8" sct and it fits snugly with a little room. it's a great case, very sturdy with a pocket for accessories and a heavy duty zipper. all in all, a good buy.
Hi there. I'm not sure, but the camera connects to WIFI and there is a free app that acts as a remote. Hope this helps. Dan
The cheap samsung are garbage compared to these. My Samsung Glasses Lasted About 6 Months each. I've owned a pair of these for 3 years and they are still kicking. My nose is on the larger side and it fits me great...not sure if that means you might not like it....but it seems like one size fits all.
This product is designed for 2011-2015 Samsung 3D TV's. It will not work with computer screens.
There are two RCA jacks for the output, just connect them to RCA inputs in the back of your amp and you are ready to go, this is a very good DAC for the price you will not be disappointed with your purchase.
I have a Samsung UN60F7050AF 3D TV and the glasses work really well with my set. If you got the standard Samsung glasses your TV should work OK. The instructions that come with my glasses say that they work with all 3D TVs. I am extremely happy with their operation. I have also found that because the glasses shut out most of the ambient light you don't get headaches like some people do with the other flimsy glasses that come with the TV. I have also used them with a Sony 3D TV and they work just as well.
micro usb, pretty standard
You need to connect its included power adapter to one of the power connectors on its included power/data cable.
yes as long as you have a app for it
This charger needs to plug into an outlet so if you don't have that available in your car, then it won't work. Your camera may sell a car charger, but you'll have to do a search online for it.
i do not know. if it doesnt you could alwas return it. It worked for mine but who knows cuz everything is different. call and ask them
I downloaded and copied the manual and followed it and found it very easy to use for someone who had never used a digital camera before, honestly, don't know what took me so long, I love it.
i've been taking pictures of things to sell online and it takes very good quality clear pictures for that.
Yes it does and very simple to use
No
I'm sorry I am not positive on this, but I recall reading that a 4gb is the smallest amount of memory. But I do know that I love this camera! My 3 yr old got ahold of it, opened the lense and hucked it into the road! I was hocked that it still worked, just a couple scratches. My last camera, a Casio, crapped out on me a few days before the warentee was up and didn't honor the warentee. Did I mention I love this camera though?
i am not aware of this option as i haven't really read the owners manual. i know i plug the camera into the computer and it will download the pics, then i can throw them up on the cloud and use them across all my devices. i just got the camera so i can stick it in my pocket and get a good pic when i travel.
No it doesn't have bluetooth. Much more, I wish I had not purchased this particular laptop.
Not sure, worked fine in my mid-2010 iMac. I suggest going to Apple icon on your menu bar and under "About This Mac" is a pane that will give you the memory type. Make sure it matches before ordering. I was super-paranoid about getting the right one but it worked out okay for me. Good luck!!!!!!!!
I cannot give you a specific time....but, they do not 'run out' or run down noticeably fast. I have had not 'commplaints'....the battery runs the same as the Canon one
No issue at all with ours!! Love having the spare great battery for a great price!
Yes
Distance to the cache can be selected from the menu so that it is displayed on the map along with the cache!
I doubt it. I have found the device very unreliable. Half the time it will not pick up a GPS signal.
As long as it has a current map loaded and you can receive a signal where your going... You should be able too...
It is memory. It reacts faster. For example the Apple Mac book air uses flash memory versus a hard drive. No lag time of boot up
My recommendation is to open your computer and visually compare data from the current laptop. It's the only way you won't have any remorse from buying the wrong battery
Yes - 661-4817 is the apple part number used for Apple models A1278 and A1280 -- which this battery fits.
I really don't know about this, but it has the capability to accept just about everything, so I tend to think that it would accept the sound bar. I would suggest that you contact someone at LG for a correct answer. Thanks!
Yes, the light is always on. There is no switch to shut it off.
I have not idea.
The 47-inch is perfectly stable without attaching it to the table. I've even tested this by pushing gently on the top rear of the TV to see if it tilts forward. I'm not sure about the 55-inch.
Me encataria poder ayudarte pero ya no tengo la caja pero calcula como 4 pulgadas mas de cada lado y de hancho como 6 pulgadas.
It's a 2013 model and it is brand new with full warranty.
Yes it will
It is 120 v, I don t think this will work with 220 but I have never tried it.
Yes! We use it almost every night. Nice TV.
Vol is bad. To hear any tv show you have to put the vol. 100% that is the top is not a great quality.
No... the Microsoft Surface Pro 3 only supports the MicroSD form-factor of memory cards. This is a full size SD card, and will be much too large to fit in the memory expansion slot. You are actually looking for something like this: http://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Ultra-MicroSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B00IIJ6W4S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1408126802&sr=8-1&keywords=128+GB+microSD+card View the Microsoft Surface Pro 3's specifications here: http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/surface-pro-3-specs.
Take your remote and click the HOME button, now place the pointer on Settings and click the middle button on your remote, then place the pointer on PICTURE and click the middle button, now put the pointer on Energy Saving then click the middle button. Now click on Off to turn Energy Saving off. That should do it.
On the TV Remote you press the 3D button to activate it, then you can choose multiple options of 3D. This is so that different 3D Options from games, movies, etc. are all supported. You also have to use the 3D Glasses that are included with the TV to see the 3D.
can't do it either on either tv. wished i new how!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
None. Maybe with an adaptor to optical out
I have the same issue and you have to call LG customer service to report it. There is no fix presently, but if they get enough complaints, they will either offer a hardware or firmware fix sometime soon. They will most likely send a technician to your house to verify the problem but the TV has a 1 year warranty so it is all free. I actually elaborated on this same problem in my review:
Amazon and LG couldn't come to an agreement to add the feature in 2012. Maybe they will both grow up and serve their customers in 2013. When it happens its just going to be an update.
Yes, but not with a standard stereo RCA jack. This TV has a digital optical audio out, so if your speaker system has a compatible setup, you can connect it directly to the set.
One magic remote only.
yes it will work
It should be compatible with both. With a 4 ohm the power shall be exactly what the receiver is putting out. With a 8 ohm recover it shall not transfer the maximum power. I use with Onkyo 529 and 509 and they sound wonderful.
Yes it does...
Pair.
Yes
You can tilt it in any direction really. It's on one of those round holds so you can adjust it easily.
Yes, you can use Tinycam with it, works great.
Yes
The bigger the scope the better. Once you get the optimal focal ratio (f/11 for this camera) your image of Jupiter will be, in pixels, about the size of your scope, in mm. An 8" scope (200mm) will give you a Jupiter around 200 pixels wide. Watch my YouTube video Planetary Imaging - Which Barlow? to see how I came up with that. A spotting scope has a small lens. Also, you need to have a motorized mount that will take out the Earth's rotation. See my video Planetary Imaging - Equipment Needed to learn more.
Yes, it does. Very good binoculars for the money.
I'm sorry - don't know. I can just confirm that they charge quickly and perform perfectly in my Canon G 15 camera.
no it does not....
Yes, it comes with the adapter for 12vac
Yes, it should work with any flash that fits and work on Canon DSLRs, the camera gives the signal to the transmitter and the transmitter send the signal to the receiver and the receiver triggers the flash
No
I don't know for sure but I think this is same size GPS and the only difference in the 7735 is upgraded software.
There is a chance it would fit. The case has one internal separator that may cause some interference but it could always be cut out if desired in which case it should do it.
Doubt it the case is pretty flat. A gps and power cord is really all that will fit.
Not the best bass sound. It's just a teeny tiny bit better than factory. Good if u are trying to replace the original. I have no complaints. They have done the job, and for the price, u can't go wrong.
They will fit just fine. :*]
My power cord is 5 feet. It is also detachable with DC 5V written on the outside of the Foscam device. I can't tell you that they are all detachable or 5 volts, but mine is.
Should work great as a nanny cam. Remember, the camera has a fixed lens, (no zoom) so placement for the image you want is important. You'll need an adequate WIFI signal as well as an electrical outlet within 5' of the camera, I don't recommend extension cords in baby's rooms. Pan and tilt from the phone is a bit touchy but it can be done. I called tech support and they gave me all the help I needed to get my 'Droid working.
Surprisingly good. On a scale of 1-10, I'd say its a 8.1
The manual specifies 32GB and that is what I have been using successfully.
Yes it will.
No, Does Not Have Bluetooth.
Yes!
I bought this for my daughter to record her lectures in college and for her 1hr 15min lecture the recorder file is around 104.2 MB and it is pretty much good quaility.
It takes about 2 or 3 seconds to power on. Press record and its ready.
Recordings can be retreived by viewing calender date or the recordings can be subdivided into five folders. Use one folder per class.
Yes
I believe so. Mine has two internal water bottle slots. It fits my hydroflasks nicely (wide and narrow mouth bottles). It also has one external water bottle pocket. I really like the bag.
No it does not but there are enough loops and other possibilities that I am sure you could affix your own
Tim, depends on how many books and what size are the books. The main compartment is approx 5-6 inches before stretching the bag and before it starts looking overpacked. This is for the medium size but according to Timbuk2's website, the large is about the same in width but is bigger which is wider. It works perfect for me as I only carry my comic books to read, paper and pens, my laptop, some work paperwork and enough room for some my food container for lunch.
No, there is no lock that comes with it, and the zippers don't have a locking mechanism. You may just have to wear it in front rather than on your back for security.
No it does not but there are enough loops and other possibilities that I am sure you could affix your own
Yes.. Of course it is. You can use.
No
as long as you have a double DIN opening (which is about 7") it will fit.
No it does not. You have to tune the radio yourself to the weather band by switching from your normal cd/aux/radio to the weather band input. It is however easy to do and the the weatherband channel provides constant updates
It's standard 1 din should fit but would still check measurements in your dash
No.
If these speakers are wired in parallel they should work together.
comes with built-in microphone, but you have the option of adding an external one also. With in-operation chose of which one you want to use
Yes, they sale a wired remote control for this head unit. It also comes with a wireless remote. And just to clarify one thing, this is one complicated radio with way to many features and a very clugy single button control. unless you need all of these features, look at the M302 model.
You will. Need to buy the antanna as well
You can use two with the y adapter. I sent the radio back however. Complete pain to operate.
Yes. I have an app on my iPhone, a different app on my Kindle HD, and I also watch on the web. They can all be viewed simultaneously.
It works with anything that works with normal headphones
5 watts output
Klipsch stuff is usually pretty efficient. I don't think it would have much of a problem driving them to moderately loud levels. As for using it as a pre. The headphone output is fine. I would caution, though, that having something plugged into the headphone output does not mute the speakers. This is handy if you want to add a small powered subwoofer that is still volume controlled by the unit. However, if you switch from speakers to headphones (or using as a pre) then you might need to mess with more cables than you want to.
I don't know the models of your cameras but yes, the insert is removable/ adjustable.
With the back of the remote toward you and the battery compartment up, there is a small gap on the top right of the battery compartment. Slide the tab just to the right of that gap into the gap and hold it in place. The battery tray will slide out easily.
Yes
CR2025
yes, suitable for home hi-fi. amazing accurate sound reproduction across the frequency spectrum. the sound reproduction is 'flat' in that no component of the range is accentuated. this may disappoint some who have become accustomed to 'boomy' bass frequencies. my fav 'cans' for serious listening. I favor this type of on-ear phones as opposed to over ear units like the Momentum
Hi! Same day if possible.
Unfortunately, the 2013 glass size is about a 1/4" smaller than the this one. So, it will not work. Sorry.
Yes
Hi, it will fit if your 2013 Jeep Wrangler factory radio is a double din and of course, you will need an aftermarket dash kit made for your vehicle. Replacing your factory radio with the Pioneer AVH-P1400dvd head unit will differently improve your factory speakers, it basically bring your stock speaker back to life as it did on my 2005 Honda Odyssey. Hope this help.
No
Hi Clay, Based on the usage I give to this amp, I don't think will be a problem. I have connected two 8 ohms speakers and often to highest volume, using the power supply provided, and not meaningful warming up. However, I don't think is good idea to close completely ANY electrical device. Leave a minimal air entry and I don't think you will have problems, using it inside specs.
On the back there are several spring clips that are marked left/right/bass.
No.
Hello Pedro, Thank you for your inquiry. When an order is fulfilled by Accessory Genie, it will ship via USPS when ordered with standard shipping (unless the weight or size prevents this) and FedEx when ordered with expedited shipping. Sincerely, Accessory Genie Customer Service
Flip down
No, they don't have it.
Yes they can but there is not a mic on the aux cord, but you can buy and aux cord with mic so you can talk and listens with the heshs for phone usage.
It is good but I did not compare it to other brands
These are sturdier than the buds I have bought from Walmart or Target however, they are just light small speakers for ears. They are very dependable. They keep their sound quality use after use. My children are late teens and early twenties and these have held up with them. I have wondered if they are made for the youth just because of the name and logo. I hope that answers your question, somewhat. Good luck
Round.
No....it is strictly a listening device but it is of good quality. Our 17 year old twins requested them as their choice.
Sometimes but it's super easy to get it out
We're sorry but we do not have them in teal.
Straight
This did not work for me at all. I had to return it.
What do you mean by "image of my computer"? Do you mean your screen saver or desktop? You may need to press the F7 key (perhaps ctrl F7) to get the output to go to the external device. Also there is a tiny switch on the device that you may need to change. Make sure that all the cords are plugged into your computer; i.e. the USB plug, earphone device, and video output.
You need to add a wireless card to it for wireless connection. This in inexpensive in itself.. Best buy would have and put in. You can connect via ethernet from a cable from your router however. Why not? I have At and T and it is a router with cables and also wireless... If you are a novice. The cable connects to the back of the computer with something that looks almost like a phone connection (but it isnt). Same connections (holes) should be on your router. Cables are cheap...
I can't help you but I am very happy with this machine.
this will work on a plane if the jack is a standard 3.5mm jack if not you'll need an adapter.
Yes
Joint.
The card calls for 550watt power supply minimum on the box. I run a Corsair TX650 to power it and my hardware with a i5-3570k CPU. I think a 750watt would work well if you want at least that. :)
Not very well, plus it runs very hot under load. I would go with a gtx 660 for that budget range
Yes, but you need a good case and P.S.U.
Can you be more specific? Are you asking me if I have the setup you're asking for or should you do the setup?
Yes. With the mobo you can actually use upto two pci-e cards like this in crossfire.
yes.
You would have to check the requirements, specially in regard to the GPU/3D video requirements, but in my experience it runs well even very heavy business and development software, like Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate, but you'll have to check if the video requirements are up to standards for games.
I use it with my 4s. However, I don't have it set up to sync via Bluetooth mainly because its my husbands and I do not use it that often.
Yes, I use my ipad to turn the volume up and down
Yes, it says "AUX-IN" it is right next to where the power adapter goes. I haven't used it yet, but it's a great option.
Yes it will fit a Manfrotto tripod. I have one and it works with no problems. I use the Desmond DPC-140 lens plate which is 5.5 inches, attached to the Tamron 150-600mm lens.
Yes
yes you can but keep in mind the cable is short (shorter than original 3ds charger) so you can't move away from your PC
no
The demand exceeded our ability to produce this radio. Sorry about that, Ed
This watch works equally well for walking or running.
No, it does not have. But it has stop watch function. You can also set the length of a lap, at 0.4, 1, 2 miles etc., it will warn you through a beep and show you the time took you to finish the last lap. It is probably more useful in training than countdown timers.
Does no display any route
As for the time, toggle mode button to the "set" position, then "+" through to "time" (press ok), "time1" (press ok), "manual" (press ok) then set the hour right (using + or -). One way to reset chrono is to stop and save the workout (then delete it or whatever you want). Hope that helps.
Honestly I don't know how you would, short of glue. No mount points at all on the back of it.
The VGA cable that came with the monitor has 3 rows of 5 pins.
Yes, great screen contrast indoors and outdoors.
No max resolution is 1280 X 800
Yes this works with a Samsung smart TV - this is what I use it for.
negative
Yes it will fit
Daniel, are you asking if you could power a device through the USB to the play music through the AUX input?
read the description... 3.5mm input jack
Its infrared
Sorry, cannot help. I returned this item as unacceptable very soon after receiving it.
lay it on the table face up so the "DVD" is correct to you, not upside down then just lift the cover. the latch looking thing is actually the hinge. as for the CD compartment just push the latch down .
I checked the specs, don't believe it does.
I have it mounted on my desk next to my computer monitor , i also move it to an entable next to my recliner it is used for security and surveillace purposes . It is small and works well .
Cant really say,but convert all your videos to MPEG format it's big but it will play.
Hi it didn't have an antenna.
The left and right output gives out different power (volume is different for both sides). It tried several units. It has a design flaw.
Yes it comes with a connector with an inline fuse to wire up to 12V.
1.5 But it poor quality and isnt durable
No. It is strictly an amplifier unit that requires another source, like an MP3 player.
I hooked the ground wire to the frame of the bike and the positive wire I ran to the fuse box, hooked that way it was powered when I turned on the ignition
You can, but the fan is pretty loud. It is better when you can have it in one room and use cables for the speakers to be in another.
great , just buy it , its a great
If it is stock yes but if its big subwoofers you are gonna need an amp plus this radio i wouldnt recommend for alot of sound just for music is what i bought it for
No
It comes with AC power supply, no headphones. I had to do no upgrades because it has the extra memory and other features for schools & offices. I like mine very much.
Yes, you can use any cd/dvd external player that has usb.
yes it is.
Yes it should. You will need to relocate your HVAC controls if you do not currently have Navigation though.
Yes. It does.
No
It doesn't include the cord but you don't need a cord since you plug the charge at the wall. The charger at the back has the 2 foldable metal thing the goes in the plug.
sure can just that your speakers might crap out...
No, it doesn't have any balance control
The battery that comes with it lasts "about" an hour, maybe a tad less. I bought my daughter an additional battery when I purchased it. As for 'plugged in', I do believe it works, although we've never really tried it. Most camcorders we've owned have worked without the battery attached.
Yes. It comes with a built-in USB cable. If you're using Win operating system it will show as an external hard drive.
It is not the size of the speakers as much as the efficiency of the speakers. In simple terms, speaker efficiency is measured in ohms, generally 4, 8 and 16 ohms. This amp will probably be able to drive 4 ohm 12" speakers but don"t expect to get too much volume with out distortion.
No. But U can play music from a memory card. No shuffling or playlist access features. It's a nice little amp for a fair price and the remote works well.
I have not done so, but with the proper wiring it could be accomplished quite easily.
The unit has a battery which will provide power when electric power is interrupted. This may be most important for continuation of phone service.
Check out these specs of the TM722G and TM822G. They both are DOCSIS 3.0, have the same number of upload channels (4) and upload speed (up to 122 Mbps). Main differences are TM822G has 8 download channels and up to 343 Mbps download, while the TM722G has 4 download channels and up to 160 Mbps download. Also it appears that the TM822G has two RF channels to assist in download, whereas I think the TM722G just has one. arrisi.com/product.../TM722G_07JAN10.pdf arrisi.com/products/_docs/TM822G_TS_24JUN11.pdf arrisi.com/products/product.asp?id=80
SB6180: 300-343Mbps download / 131Mbps Upload.
This is not a WiFi router. This is a modem. You need this for high speed internet from the cable company. This basically receives the signal from the cable company and sends it to your WiFi router.
This isn't WiFi.
If you're asking whether this works with Cox, yes it does. I simply logged into my account using my old modem, added the new modem to my account, plugged it in and everything worked fine. You can also call customer service and they can set up your new modem over the phone.
Yes, there is a USB port for that, but I am not 100% sure if it's used for that purpose
Very low sound coming through camera from someone trying to talk through browser. When listening via browser, sound isn't crisp and clear but full of static. When I talk to someone through the camera via browser, I don't get close to the camera but my sound level has to be much higher than normal.
There is no SD slot. You need to purchase Blue Iris ($50) for Windows or Evocam ($30) for Mac to record to your computer. Both are very good with numerous triggering options: motion, sound, time and date, remote request, or manually. You can specify the folder to which the video clips will be written. If you have DropBox, you can dump the videos in your DropBox folder so that they are sent to the cloud and become available to all your portable devices.
I would think the firmware is already installed now. The main fix was that it tells you to change the default User: "admin" and the password: "leave blank". If the cameras are not updated, it is easy to do yourself.
Yes Sir. Go to the owc website. They have a lot of videos. http://eshop.macsales.com/installvideos/. Regards
yes they do! I installed the owc into mine and I just bought my laptop
I have it in an Early 2011 15" model. I believe that they are physically the same.
Yes
Fits my S3510 otherwise ...?
Yes it does my daughter say it hold a charge for a long time
I couldn't say for sure, our laptop is NPR530A. Remove your battery and google for the number on it.
It takes beautiful pics' and 1080P video!...great purchase!!! Specs say "effective is 4megp and total is 5 megapic's. The under water capability is really has great quality!
I haven`t verified this yet, but as long i have checked this problem there will be an update
Sorry, I have no idea. We love the camera though!
absolutely, it does. I have windows 8 and it works very well. even though the initial setup may be little challenging but once it is linked it wirelessly sends pics to the auto update folder on the PC
Short answer...NO. The packaging tells you the size you need; I picked one up at Staples.
Hello, thank you for your question. This item is sold by various sellers. Some sellers choose to ship internationally and some do not. The easiest way to check if the item can be shipped to your location would be to add it to your cart and then click the "proceed to checkout" button. An error message will appear if it is not able to be delivered to your destination. If you are able to proceed through the order process you will be shown shipping methods/speed/prices to chose from. I hope this helps!
I just use my old cheap generic average size digital camera case. It fits perfectly.
Yes
It comes with a Samsung rechargeable li-ion battery. How long it lasts before you have to recharge depends on how you use it, flash, size of photos, internet connection sending photos in emails all use the battery but at least several hundred at a minimum. I have never run the battery completely down as I like to recharge each evening for the next days shooting.
The exact dimensions for the each cameras is: Dimension: 6 x 5.2 x 1.8 inches ; 6.4 ounces) and the shipping weight is ( 1 pounds) or 1lb(s). i hope it helps
Foscam maybe, I am not sure. There is an app on IOS called Live cameras that will give you multiple screens and control over all your cameras.
Yes, the two outer bends lock together, and the center bend can only fold one direction. On a caved surface like a lap, it stays flat. On a hill type surface, it folds open at the halfway fold at the center, but is still usable because both halves are flat.
Hello Jay, This keyboard is the same size as as my 15 inch laptop and it is perfect in every way. There is just one fault, they should have used a USB or better still a Micro USB connector, not a camera connector, where the cable choice is severely limited. I am hoping that I can buy 300 mm cables from USB Brando, which are now on order. The keyboard is vastly better than the tempremental Bluetooth ones that I have used.
I own this camera, and yes it does have macro mode. Incidentally, I have owned 5 point-and-shoot cameras over the past 10 years and this one has the best image quality by far, even though it's the least expensive camera I've ever bought.
My camera came with a 4GB memory card which allows me to take over 700 pictures. I haven't yet taken any videos with it so I'm not sure how much a video would cut down the number of photographs I can take.
The camera came with the power cord and the USB cable to connect it with the computer.
In IA mode, the ZS-15 takes 12MB pics (4:3 aspect), 10.5M (3:2), 9M (16:9). etc. So, if you are referring to 16:9 aspect (not 19 x 9, perhaps a typo?), the answer is 9M in Intelligent Auto Mode.
This camera doesn't come with a case or bag. It does have a battery and charger with it.
There is included a power cord that plugs into the camera and charges the battery in the camer. If you want to charge the battery outside of the camera you have to buy and external charger which several of the reviews have listed and which I purchased. This gives you a couple of extra batteries as well as an external charger at a very reasonable price.
I have Windows 7, and all of the movies and videos I've downloaded to the computer are MP4 format. They play just fine. Hope this helps.
Hello. These cameras are sold by a seller not Amazon.com which means that the prices are set by the seller themselves. Sellers on our website are allowed to sell items at any price they feel is fair. However, we do have rules sellers must follow:
Yes it does. It has a 2 and 10 second self timer that is super easy to use. I use it all the time for group shots.
Yes. It's easy to use, really cheap and comes with the charger.
Yes. Successfully used the charger in both 110v and 220v outlets.
The colors look fine to me. Did not due a technical evaluation of the colors.
You have to buy the memory card separately (inexpensive from Amazon) or use the internal memory to download. My computer is a MacBook operating OS10.4. The camera automatically download photos & videos to iPhoto. Works great! As far as a microsoft operating system, I don't know.
It comes with a short USB cable that connects between the camera and your computer and allows you to transfer pictures while the camera is charging. The cable also connects between the camera and a wall wart that lets you charge directly from 110 V. This camera has worked out great for me. I do everything with it now rather than use a larger camera. One important feature of the camera is that most all the operating prompts appear on the LCD screen, which helps you learn how to use the camera.
Plug in the wall socket battery charger included.
Charging cable,av cable,manual no sd card
Sorry...I bought as a gift for someone but I am sure if you Google Panasonic they will give you an 800 # to call and ask and I am sure they will have all the info for you
1080p HD
It has it's own qrp system that doesn't match any others that I know of. Even different models of tripod head within this brand seem to have different sized QRPs .The plate attaches directly to the camera and come with the tripod so you could attach your own to that if you really wanted...
It does have a USB in port.
About 500$.
from my brief use of this camera i have not noticed the heating of the side of the camera. now, i'm assuming that you're talking about the hand held side, right? if it's the screen side, well, i haven't notice anything unusal on that side too. hope this helps-gy.
don't buy this camera. Choose something else. The picture is very grainy. I wish I had returned it. My cell phone take better video than this.
If you continually use it, 2.5 hours to 3 at best
received defective one
Mine was brand new. Yes it does accept that memory card, that's what I had from my old cybershot.
There is a wall cord plug that comes with the camera but no charger. FYI, the cord has an USB adapter so it can be plugged into computers, laptops. I hope this helps...
it does both. you can even take a picture while you are video taping.
Yes it does all, but the function buttons on the wheel can't hook up to the control of the music and the phone jack.
That won't work. You need to have "sat or channel in order to make work properly.
Yes it will
as long as your GMC is a single DIN unit. Most likely if so you'll still need in dash radio adapter.
No
I never checked it. Sorry for that and now one of the monitors fell from the head rest and snapped the connection, make sure that they sit well in the head rest, otherwise it is a good product. Thx
The package contents are HIR9BGTA Car DVD player, Remote Control, 3 Interchangeable pillow covers (Black, Gray and Tan)
Yes they will....
yes I use it all the time !
No it does not. That needs to be purchased separately. Pretty standard for decks not to come with the wiring harness and steering wheel control adapter. I have yet to see one that does
I think that the softwere they use only work on radio and cd's because mine had the same problem you are having...i would recommend you to return it and get a better brand thats what i did im 100% satisfy with the pioneer i bought
No
I'm sure it will. I had no problem mounting in my Nissan frontier which has depth issues. Because it has no CD player its half the depth of a CD unit. I just completed an 11 hour trip and had zero issues. This is a quality unit.
I have no idea
I have the same issue but one thing I discovered quite by accident is that if you put in an address first and then play music the navigation voice will continue to provide instructions (music will mute while navigation voice speaks). Either way this is a definite "con" for the system that has disappointed me as well
If your current set up is a single din, then yes. You'll need to purchas the in dash adapter and the wiring harness adapter, both available from Metra. By the way, it's a great setup. I've had mine for over a year now and it's still working perfectly. The best part is the bluetooth streaming and phone. The DVD player is nice too, when my kid is in the car.
Yes
I don't c why not. But i only have 2 kids, i haven't try with a 3rd one.
Yes but its a piece of junk it disconnects from bluetooth when it wants to and when you first start your truck it makes a loud noise.and if you try to return or exchange you can't because it was installed.go with a real name brand like jvc pioneer kenwood clarion spend the money.I took the boss to the mountains and but some 12gage slugs in it.hope this helps
the screen will come out when the radio is turned on and you have the option to close the screen with the control button
Yes there is a warranty. Please look here for the warranty info "http://www.bossaudio.com/technical-support/warranty-information/"
Just a hole. Most people can hear me fine, but it doesn't do a great job of killing background noise
This will fit in 99 Durango, but I would not recommend you to buy it. Unit is low quality with bad control and questionable sound.
You have to purchase the Power Acoustik Dtv1 Add-on Digital Tv Tuner to be able to watch tv..
Yes it fits.
Yes it comes with a remote and a microphone
I am not sure. I put it in Mercedes ML series truck.
Aside of having a valid and working Microsoft Excel installation on your Windows machine, there is no additional requirements for installing and running NumXL.
Yes, this is a one time purchase, but for $500 (not $150) for a single NumXL 1.6X perpetual license. A perpetual license provides you with an ongoing access to the NumXL software without the need for future renewals). In addition, every purchase of NumXL is packaged FREE with 12 months of premier support and software update; after that, we give you the option to renew the premier support service.
Yes you will they come with dual tweeters i think thats what makes them so loud
They are 2 ohm.
If the camera accepts a standard 1/4" stud mount thread as found on most camera tripods and similar it should work fine.
Once the jack can fit.
It is also a weather prof lens. The macro is not a true 1:1 though, but the image quality is excellent.
I would suggest Zuiko 12-50mm zoom or fixed focal length Rokinon 10mm
The product is strictly a standard black / white umbrella with a unitary construction. There is no black cover to remove.
it works. Don't worry
I used it for iPhones and IPad. Not sure if that helps any. Both ports are not made for all apple products though. I can use both for an iPhone 5 but only one would charge an iPad 2 and old iPhone 3G.
Most audio amps for speakers have a headphone jack taken from a preamp area within for a headphone jack. Why they didn't, who knows. I would buy one even at a higher price if included it.
This won't have enough power for all those and be very loud. I have one hooked to 4 speakers and a woofer but it didn't have enough kick, so I I took the woofer off and used a powered sub. Lepai does make one that has a subwoofer output which would probably be a better choice
Whichever speakers you hook up, will be on when the AMP is.
They fit the smaller on ear headset.
no
Yes, it's pocketable!
No
unless your ipad has a usb port, I don't know how it could. my 1pad doesn't.
Probably not. This is a very basic camera.
I have not experienced that did Nikon not respond appropriately?
Yes, that's the battery that came with it.
NO
As far as I've been able to tell - NO (spent ~1 minute trying to figure it out). They let you manually adjust absolutely nothing.
I may not be the best person to ask about that as I haven't attempted any flash photography until just now (months after purchase). There is a flash symbol on the d-pad and the same symbol on the side of the camera where a pop-up flash comes out, but I was unable to get the flash to work at all using either of these buttons...
yes it does. they don't advertise it like canon does tho.
Just 1 at a time
If you can find the setting for shutter speed decrease the time. So instead of 1/2 a sec increase to 1/1000
I don't think so !!!
Exhausted about what?
I really don't know but know that we are so happy with the s6300 as it has twice the settings as the older Nikon we had & even the zoom works better as it does not get all blurry. It also takes outstanding videos & the sound is very good. I would always buy one from Amazon Prime as when we bought one from someone else they did not back it up as well as Amazon does & would not even pay the postage back and the camera did not even work from the moment we got it.
I'm not quite sure what you mean? All cameras are different, but this one takes great close ups, has a good flash and is easy to use
Yes, it comes with its own battery pack that will never need removal. If you choose to purchase an extra battery you can. The camera plugs into a charger to charge
Yes it does........................Video Gear Direct
Yes it will, but there may be better choices. Suggest you give us a call and we can discuss your needs with you. Video Gear Direct 888-784-7399
No it does not. It is hard to find one that has both in this size. I WISH it did.
The charger is a USB charger, 2" X 2" X 7/8". The battery is removable, but you charge it in the camera.
The cord is 52" long, so plenty of length for me and I hope for you. It is the same as the cord that originally came with the quiet Bose comfort headphones and comes from Bose too.
I believe it does. I didn't need it. My wheel is standard. Call them directly, they are on site. My stereo is still working great but I had issues. Had to turn it off otherwise it drained the battery.
No. Mine came with about 20% charge remaining
I have two laptops it fits but neither is that model-- I think.
You can still use it for surround sound.
These binoculars are NOT waterproof and I doubt that ANY binoculars are fog-proof.
Yes, this is the Aculon T11
Hi Andrew, It is still in the box. I can look in the manual if some-one else can not answer your question.
NO.
I looked up the images for the Captiva antenna... it looks like this antenna will fit that base.
I am on vacation and do not have a measuring tape but I will estimate that it is 6 inches at its widest. And is approx 7 inches high and 2 in he's deep. Hope that helps
It fits
Honestly couldn't tell you. I would "assume" Fords have the same antennae mast, but can't say for sure
It has y-r-w inputs, no s video... according to my brother :)
I'm sorry - I don't know.
Yes, it has all of those.
You have to pop it open for the flash to work. Actually have not used the flash much.
It takes 4 AA batteries - no battery pack. I take about 100 pics a day (home inspector) and the 4 batteries last about 8 days.
use 4 "AA" regular batteries and it does not come with a battery charger. This is so much easier without the odd size batteries that have to be charged. I just keep extra batteries in my camera case.
I paid the extra 5 bucks for the one with th microphone and it's helpful if you're lounging around the house on your phone with these headphones in, You don't have to hold the phone up to your ear. Other than that if you don't need a mic then just get the regular headphones
Nope. No remote or volume control for the ear buds, but they are great nonetheless.
According to the backside of the packaging it says that there is a 1 year warranty. How you go about fulfilling this warranty, i have no idea.
Hi Hilary, We only ship within the United States. Please let us know if you have any other questions.
This Receiver will work Only With M/N. Y-RBN90 (Keyboard), M-RCR147R (Mouse) The part number on the bottom of the keyboard must match this number 820-001633
As long as it looks like that! I bought a replacement because mine broke off into the port. I just looked up the piece nd ordered it. Worked out fine.
There is no jack on the back or sides of an iPad that will take the screw on this handle. If an attachable backing were to be made by a handyman, however, it would be great.
The picture pops out from the top' so no worries on your fingers getting on the way. When it stops ejecting u just lightly pull it away from the camera. And don't shake the picture while developing that's just a myth that it helps it ok &#128522;&#128522;&#128247;
No. There is not a headphone jack.
You will have to manually select the dock for input. It also has selections for "aux-in" and "radio" for the built-in tuner. You have to read the dimly-lit LED window in order to know which input is selected. The LED lights on mine quit working after several weeks making it impossible to see what input I was selecting. Mine is now sitting in the garage and no longer in use. I have purchased a Bose Mini-Link Bluetooth speaker as a replacement and it is wonderful.
I haven't actually weighed it, but it is pretty heavy. So, probably accurate.
No, but you can buy this adapter: http://www.leobodnar.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=188. Otherwise you'll need to buy the Logitech G27 wheel. If you buy that adapter, you can use it with any wheel because it converts the cord into a USB connection.
No batteries, it doesn't need any, it plugs in to the steering wheel.
Yes it comes with both the wall outlet plug and the computer plug.
To be honest I bought a second complete holster for spare parts and spare holster. I couldn't find any extra parts anywhere so couldn't go wrong with extra all.
Absolutely. I'm a 44d and it worked just fine for two weeks in Hawaii,, a day at the zoo and oodles of other venues. It has plenty of leeway in the straps for adjustments.
I buy the bubble free ones that are super easy to put on, the only sticky part is around the edges, or look for the ones that say reusable.
Apple charger. The old style
As long as you have the latest version of IOS downloaded, Siri is available. You have to click "yes" when it asks if you want Siri installed.
You're looking at offerings from "third party" sellers, so Amazon is not setting the price, they're just handling the shipping of the item. I don't see any listings where Amazon is the actual seller, only the shipper, so don't blame them for the pricing, that's determined by the third party seller.
It does not have a USB port. I bought an accessory that connects a video card for downloading pictures but found out I did not need that. All I had to do was email them to myself. I bought a wireless printer and downloaded an app for the printer but it did not work.
Its a Verizon iPad. So if your international card is Verizon, then yes. If its not just do what I do. Use WiFi. Then you don't have to worry yourself wif it
I'm sorry sir, I do not quite understand your question. I apologize.
The charger does come with the iPad. It does not have a standalone keyboard. When you need a keyboard it is on the screen
I think you're asking if this refurbished iPad is as good as a brand new one you will get in the store, the answer is yes. Mine had no scratches, cracks or markings of any kind. It had a plastic sheet on the screen for protection and it came in an Apple box with a brand new cable. Just like new!
You can go to amazon and go to warranty for iPad and order I think it cost 78.00 for 3 year plan
Yes, you can.
Yes it does.
Yes you can there is 8.3 update
Personally I don't see enough difference between my 1st generation and the last to warrant a change. If photo quality is your concern then maybe it's a difference. I have photos and they are more than good enough for me. Like I said, what are you using it for and what apps are most important to you (personal preferences). I haven't found anything that I wold consider to be a show stopper between the first and last. I prefer the first, second and third generations size and sturdiness to any after that.
We test the iPads to function on AT&T service however we understand they should function with most GSM networks. We offer a 30 day warranty on all iPads.
Yes, it does
The one I received was the current version with the current OS.
Yes Barbara, The Logitech devices work well on all computers. I like there devices.
Yes
When you purchase the iPad you go through a set up and have the option of setting it up to use a password or not.
The one I got did not come with the cover or charging accessories. However, read the fine prints to make sure.
Came with mountain lion and first thing it did was tell me I could update to mavericks. With itbeing solid state iI've never even felt it get warm
No SD card or ANY card slots, No flash player technology either.
I have not had the problem at all and I have used my new MBA extensively (several hours every day) on wifi for about 6 weeks. I believe it was fixed by a software update from Apple.
Yes you can! I bought mine from a NYC vendor, had problems, took it to an Apple store in London, UK and it was fixed on the spot at no charge. They were not interested where I bought it!
Regarding Excel, I have an older pre-unibody MBP and use Excel a lot with no problems at all. I've not used Autocad, but I know the (especially newer) MBP can handle very graphics-intensive drawing and movie editing programs, so I would be very surprised if it had a problem with Autocad.
A PC may not be able to open a "Pages" document. You can, however, send the file as an Office document or PDF file which is very easy to do if you're using Apple's Pages word processor. When you click share, just choose to share it as a Word or PDF document and you're good to go!
Its never paid upfront :( the only option is to find one that is both wifi+at&t (Or another carrier) and then pay the monthly fee.
Yes u can. I live in the caribbean also and thats where i am using it.
No you are not wasting your money. Until 2012 I was always a PC man until purchased an I-phone. Then my daughter gave me an I-pad for Christmas. I was impressed so much by the quality and functionality of them both, so much, I purchased an I-mac pro desk top and then a MacBook Pro laptop. I will never go back to a PC again.
as a matter of fact, you cannot think of any other laptops that are more durable and rugged than MacBooks/MacBook Pros are. This is an aluminium case covered tough machine, good for many harsh packing types. Backpack full of books can do ZERO damage to a MacBook Pro, even if there is an entire harry potter series in back pack.. (:
Hi, The tax is included in the price, bringing the total plus tax to $2,179.00. Cheers!
Transmitting at high power, this radio will draw less than 14 amps at 13.8 V DC. Something like the Samlex SEC-1223 power supply would be ideal.
No. It is soldered in.
Around 47
It is a standard Mac so I dont see why not. Rare to find devices that don't work these days. But for a real answer check Canons website for compatibility. It will really be up to them, not apple.
Language can be set on the mac to any language upon installation, including Spanish. With regards the keyboard, I am assuming that if you purchase your macbook in the US it will come with the standard English keyboard. However, if you do decide to buy your mac in the US you have 2 options-- you can either get your new mac serviced and have the keyboard changed to Spanish, which will cost around $150 to do or you can buy a Spanish keyboard cover that goes over the regular keyboard. They cost around $19 on Newegg.
No it is the 1st edition. The new ones start with ME instead of MD.
It doesn't have the finger scanner so its not a three. It looks like a first generation ipad to me.
No it has not happened so far all is good.
2 years
I suggest the app KeyNote but it's not free (it's $9.99)
Epson TX620FWD
Yes, you can connect this via hdmi to your TV or Computer Monitor. Or even to a stereo receiver. In addition, the hdmi will carry sound as well as picture.
Because a newer version was announced yesterday.
It includes one
I have mine connected to a 40 inch LG 1080p and it's fantastic. Apples retina displays look better but cost much more. I'm completely satisfied with 1080p and I am perticular about my viewing experience. Hope this helps
Maverick...
yes
I got mine brand new.sealed box and everything. You can always return it if your not satisfied. Cheaper in amazon than apple direct.
They are available in limited quantities so that is why I purchased it from Amazon. It is quite amazing too.
I was lucky and got the samsung display. I bought one from best buy and got the LG display and returned it, than ordered this one from Amazon with the samsung. I returned the other one because after a month I started seeing ghosting, I recommend getting AppleCare with it if you're considering making a purchase, they will replace the display if there is any issues down the road. I've had mine for 6 months with no issues at all.
Have you tried pressing the small, round button that's just above the - key on the numpad?
There is a typo in the question. I assume he means model awrcc2. Yes, this remote works with the awcrcc2. Dave, Olympia, WA
No.
James...I haven't actually tried it, but I did order a micro to usb adapter for my Note3. It s/b here in about 2 days. My Note3 and the Fire HD have the same micro usb ports so i plan on trying it out. I will let you know what happends. I know that doesnt help you right now but thats all i know. You could also google it and see if there is anything saying wether or not the HD is compatable with a micro to usb adapter...im guessing it should work but not 100% sure.
The connections are standard male spade connectors, 4mm by 6mm. Any hardware or automotive parts store will have them. Even Amazon. Here's a picture, http://www.lambrettaspares.com/images/products/mbe/mbe0053.jpg . If you're going to carry this on a mountain bike, I hope you realize it is a lead-acid battery and quite heavy.
sorry I dont know
I use one in my car.....but sudden stops can send the unit flying. If you could secure it with Velcro on the bottom, that should do the trick. The sound is adequate for a car....but may not be loud enough for some. You might consider buying two, as they will automatically recognize each other and split the Bluetooth signal into Left and Right channels for true stereo.
Yes it comes with a 1 year warranty from Samsung and when you register it on their website they extend that an additional 3 months. So 15 months.
I don't recall seeing either a mini or regular size jack, which would be unusual for most tvs of size. It has audio RCA jacks, component, optical and hdmi ports.
1 yr, but they will offer extended warranty.
Yes, just connect your ROKU to one of the inputs. On a ROKU 3 this would be hdmi.
yes it will fit and work. its plug and play
Not that I've noticed
Yes, it has a built in internet explorer... and you might wanna buy compatible mouse and keyboard for surfing, because its really tiring with remote...
I've got Roku, Apple TV, Dish Network, and a Panasonic Blu-Ray all running through a Pioneer vsx-60 receiver to the TV and they all look great. I can't tell any difference between a 720p and 1080p TV . I have both.
I asked this question also and I get this from Samsung tech, "If you purchase the unit within the North American Territories, it will only have support for NTSC/ATSC/QAM broadcasting systems and only 100v-127v 60Hz power. Since the NA TVs will not accept a PAL signal (or higher voltages), you will not only need a converter for the broadcast, but also for the power if you would like to use the TV in a PAL country."
Best regards! Here in Venezuela with Directv works great, so far I have had no problems!
I went into tools and set it on amplify.That made the volume a little better. It seems the volume on all the HD tv's could use some improvement. So just play with the sound settings until you find one that is suitable. Otherwise you will probably need to invest in a soundbar. Hope this helps.
Sure does...it's amazing! I load my amazon all the time....and have watched youtube. You cannot link Itunes to it as Samsung and Apple are, I guess, competitors, but if you want that option....you'll have to purchase a box at Bestbuy or other similar store...it's called an Apple box ($100) that you can plug it and then you can upload Itunes. Other than that, Yes to your question...again...I love it!
Yes. I mounted my digital antenna on the roof of my house. Connected it the coaxial that was used for cable TV access to the house. All my TV's work with either a converter box or their own digital tuner. Reception is very good for all 24 channels. I'm about 15 miles east of St Louis. I do not use any amplifiers at all.
No, it's a single unit. But I'm picking up channels from due south, se and almost w transmitters with my unit pointed south. If your transmitters are opposed (n and s) you might need a more complicated setup (dual antennas, some kind of switch or combiner, etc.) Good luck!
China
Yes
I have Comcast. You can call time Warner and ask them
I do not see a cable port. You might check the specs on Olympus and see if it wireless.
This is a smaller body. I did not try to use my old Olympus lenses. I am happy with the E-M5. It has all the bells and whistles and half the weight and is weather proof, a real plus for me.
The body and kit lenses can come in both colors. Mine personally is a silver body with the black 12-50mm kit lens.
Hi, it just means that the camera has a warranty if it has any manufactures defects.
Yes! It comes with 2 glasses.
It plays video from the USB stick. I think mine where MP4.
It's a nice kit lens and it is IIr which I got it with EP3, with OMD EM5 I got 12-50mm!,it is very sharp and has a macro too!
I was able to find information online, depending on what kind of set up you wanted for your tv (movies or tv). I dont remember the setting I programmed but everything was online about what the display should be. I also recommend turning off the motionflow, which is good during sports, but during all tv shows you can definitely notice it.
It will definitely fit, I personally have an h100 and it fit just fine. I used rubber "screws" to keep vibration down and noise. The case can transfer some major vibrations if you don't take measures against it. But other than that this case is wonderful! I have never been happier with how many options this case gives.
My tv was going off & on from background noises. Turned the voice activation off to resolve that issue.
yes, if it was not this way they would not sell the Ghz edition
I don't own a Panasonic. I returned my Vieira like 7 months ago.
I dont know
The standard remote has an INTERNET button which takes you to the "Viera Server" which essentially brings you to TV apps. This is assuming your TV has an internet connection. The easiest way to have a connection is directly through ethernet since the TV is only WiFi READY (it requires an additional device to use WiFi..... oh marketing)
I would think you will need a recorder with hdmi connection.
The Panasonic is at a second home, but I so I have not been there in awhile but the sound is not great. i am definitely going to hook up to surround sound when I get back.
Correct. Amazon only supports Roku and Sony fully.
This appears to be account protection from Google/YouTube because the login appears to be coming from an IP address in India. Check your email for a confirmation message from Google that will allow you to confirm the login up to ten minutes before trying the app again.
Sounds like that's the cable box. My bf's box goes out all the time. The cable company should swap it out free of charge.
The On Screen Menu does not have a Bluetooth option anywhere. Don't know if the wireless adapter would respond to that.
Sorry, I haven't tried it yet.
Not know, i havent tried it
That is the responsibility of the service provider i.e. Comcast, Time Warner etc. TV is just a display unit that is used by your service provider.
If I were you I just wouldn't get it because it broke after 2 years and the manufacturer offered no remedy whatsoever. My friend has a vizio he had for 5 years so clearly there is more parity in the TV industry and the Panasonic brand isn't what it used to be.
I'm afraid I don't understand the question.
No this player has no built in Wi-FI. Worse a USB off the shelf Wi-Fi radio Internet dongle will not work. The USB Wi-Fi adapter for this unit was never produced by Panasonic. This unit plays discs and that's it. Forget any Internet connection with this unit. I returned mine for one with built in Wi-Fi. This is a DO NOT purchase unit for sure.
Mine plays both .sorry .no problems here.
The HDMI cable is all that you need. I have never used calibration videos or devices. Once the TV is broken in, it's a subjective matter as to what kind of image you prefer.
yes
I have AT&T DSL modem & Linksys wireless router have no problems connecting to internet.
I do not know for certain, but I seriously doubt it. Maybe there's a way you could contact Panasonic to find out - try searching "Panasonic sales" online.
The problem is not just the speakers. There isn't sufficient amplification to product acceptable sound levels. best to get a sound bar or an inexpensive receiver and speakers. YMMV
Yes its wireless and Wired, Your choice.
I have Dish and have never seen anything like that. Are you sure you have your settings right?
Plenty of USB ports, we have our DVR hooked up through the HDMI ports.
No reason why you can't use it for HTPC, though image retention is pretty likely. The anti-image retention options on the TV itself aren't that strong, though the scrolling black and white bars does work. Your HTPC should be able to dim/blank the screen when idel though...
Try google. It is most likely one of two boards failed. It seems SS board the more frequent culprit. There is a YouTube video instructing how to replace the board but finding a new board may be difficult. I assume TV is out of warranty. You could pay an authorized Panasonic repair shop but it will cost around $400-$500. It is also possible to remove board and send it out for repair. Cost &lt; $100. Again, Google is your friend :)
Yes
Yes
Sorry, we do not have 3- or 4-station of this kind. Thanks,
I don't know - I am using it with KX-TGA470 main base and charging base
This drive does not come with the blu-ray software. You'll have to purchase the software to be able to watch them I recommend the PowerDVD 13 .
working on windows 8
Hi Chris I do have a Netflix account, but I have not used my Acer to stream Netflix movies. I am assuming that you want to steam movies over the Internet, since this netbook lacks a DVD player. But you can still buy an external USB one, which I have and this way it works OK.
No if u have more then one thing running it will kick up on u.
Yes, you need to use 2 usb ports for the extra power. The supplied usb Y cable has about 5 inches of slack between the plugs. If your laptop only has 1 usb on each side you will have to get an extension.
Its really stupid but there is no bluray playing software,its a rip off,the best I can recommend is buy cyberlink powerdvd 14 ultra,or torrent it if you do that sort of thing.Sounds illegal but guess what,you
Yes it has a 3D blu ray player. The drawer extends out of the front, about center of the unit. If you have not purchased yet you might want to look at the comments about video over the Internet (or cable system).
Not sure about the 6V. I burned out my Proform recumbent bike controls by using a 12V adapter.
No. High humidity wrecked this. Had to bring it inside for a few days to dry it out so it would work.
The power supplies are approved, the injector block has no active components. So no approval is required.
No there are no Guards. Wired hot.
Hi Robin! Yes! They will work for your device/Kindle Paperwhite. You can use our stylus pens with any device or screen that you can use your finger with as well (commonly referred to as capacative touch). Let me know if I can be of more help here at:
These are not recommended. They are wrong AH, wrong connection type. Go with TR18-12
Yes, you need an SD card. It is very important. I highly reccommend 8G or bigger. The camera does NOT come with it. It's sold seperately.
Yes it does. Audio plays back nice and clear when you play it back on your computer. Just don't block the mic.
No, To take pictures It has 640x480, 1600x1200, 3264x2448, 4608x3456 and 4608x2592. To take videos: 1280x720 and 640x480
Mine came with a wall charger. The battery pops out with a little button switch and you put it in the cahrger.
yes
I know that it does, but I have never used it.
I do not know, but Canon is very good with customer service. I'm sure they would answer your question.
Yes,but the camera is not all it's claimed to be.I wish I would have taken the time to send it back.They make it sound like a good old look,click,and shoot.....not,can be complicated
Yes, there is lag. This has a CCD sensor, I have many cameras. I suggest if you want no shutter lag at all, a CMOS sensor camera. Panasonic SZ7 is a good one. It will take a photo almost instantly.
not very long, but it is OK. What I do is to buy some additional battery for it; I have 4 battery, I think it is too many. 2 battery will be good enough.
yes, it is a great camera
I have this camera since Xmas and would say the quality of photos is excellent for a camera of this size. I have a Rebel t1i but it is too big to carry around sometimes. This is a great pocket-sized camera for the money.
Probably not the camera you want for that. My daughter plays high school volleyball and I have tried in various gyms under all manner of light conditions and camera settings to get both action and stable shots with very mixed results, with most action shots being fails. That said, that type of photography is not this camera's forte and you really need a dslr with a good lens to do that job right.
Sorry, my camera is black.
Did you hit the display button and turn it off ? (the bottom of the selector ring) Use same button to turn it back on.
Yes it does. It's a fun little camera and has taken great pics for us.
The flash only works if there is not enough light - automatic. However, there is a menu in the camera, and I see Lamp Setting which is on when you get the camera, but you can turn it off.
yes it can take digital movies, they're not the world's best quality but better than my camera on my phone...it will eat up more battery and space depending on how long you are filming, but have not run into any problems filming kid skits or choir pieces for school or fun in the park kind of things...just get a decent size memory card, I currently have a 16G
click on menu. top left on screen it shows a camera or a wrench and hammer. scroll over to the wrench and hammer. Scroll down to format click on the middle button function set. If you click ok to format it will erase all pictures.
The Canon SELPHY CP900 is perfect for 4''x6'' dye-sub prints
Yes skype works but the camera needs to have adequate lighting for you to show up properly to your distant end.
Two
I'm quite sure it will, providing you have a wireless provider/carrier, via WI-FI!
I wouldn't buy any Hitachi Hard drives. As a computer technician, I use either Seagate, Western Digital, or Toshiba Hard Drives. If you want a hard drive that lasts longer then 11 months, then do not buy this.
No. I don't even use it anymore. It had too many problems, so I bought an IPad.
If I'm reading your question correctly you need a wifi router or a hot spot piece. You can not cord connect it to the internet. Hope this helps.
I don't recommend the coby I returned mine it was to slow with high speed net
I don't think so. I only enjoyed mine for about two weeks and had to send it back because of a defective power jack. Still waiting to see if they will replace it. But it's a nice tablet.
You can't get Netflix on this device. I don't know about Kindle.
Not gonna happen; they won't (prior experience). Be wise and wait for the lightning deal (not guaranteed). You'll just end up paying extra for return shipping for the product, plus a 10% or more restocking fee.
You can purcase a separate cd/dvd drive and connect to usb port.
I am very happy with the battery life;once full charged, I could use all day long at the beach and snorkelling with no worries...
The cord should generally the same across all dell laptops.
Yes but kind of loose and I have wrap them with rubberban.
Yes
Yes it works fine and excellent purchase
about 3 feet
no it does not fit, you need smaller plug size
Mine actually just stopped working.... Like one day it just wouldn't work anymore... Wouldn't recommend buying
5.5" x 5.5"
Yes indeed, it worked for me. That's all you need. No more rental fee..... But I would highly recommend for you to get in contact with your local cable company before purchasing this modem.... Just to be on the safe side. Mine has been working for over 2 yrs and the installation took only a few mins over the phone with the cable co. Good Luck.
It more than likely will work but to be safe you should contact your ISP.
it keeps turning.
I would say it's a medium size
I would say it's a medium size
Nope. Definitely not the medium and it would probably not fit in the large either. My boyfriends 15 inch MacBook Pro barely fits.
Yes it does I currently carry them in mine.
It should. It worked for me shooting stage acts a few times when used on a G3.
As long as you get the m43 version not the end mount version you should be good. It will be a long normal or short portrait on a m43 body like your g6 rather than a wide normal on sony bodies which may limit it's use depending on what you are looking to shoot. An alternative is the 17mm f2.8 pancake which in my experience is almost As sharp and around the same price but is a great walk around focal length of 34mm
It essentially becomes your mouse so it interfaces just as a mouse would. You can use the pen to the pad or your fingers to the pad. I would suggest the medium as I think it allows for more economies of scale and making the tasks easier rather than requiring a large range of motion that a large pad requires. Yet, a medium can also be placed on your lap if you want.
It has a USB port, yes . So I guess you could show photos on there .
No ,it does not tilt.
You setup for left hand
Also a recent firmware update has added RVU client capability to the TV. This means the TV can connect to a DirecTV HR34 Home Media Center in another room without the need for another DirecTV receiver.
Do you mean the refresh rate? Ours was 120. 240 is better.
No. Amazon is not one of the User Interface Apps built in to the TV. However, you can purchase many blu ray players for about a hundred bucks that have Amazon Instant Video, such as my Panasonic. It's still cumbersome though
Works fine with Win 8, brand of computer shouldn't matter. However, it's NOT illuminated.
Why type of input source do you have? You'll only get 1080p/i if your uncoming signal is in HD. Whether that be from satellite, cable or a DVD player.
I never tried so I don't know.
its pretty good. it does have some issues with skype though but I've used them for gaming and it works fine. (skype might be the issue though it works very poorly on windows 8)
Yes there is an antenna connection
Mine doesn't
No, it doesn't.
I like the audio on this TV. I get a lot of things going at once with the TV going and I can still can hear it over that. You could buy a sound bar but I don't think its necessary.
The company is in NY. The Binoculars are made in China. I don't know of ANY made in USA. Leupold has some assembled in USA - parts are imported. The Carson ED glass on their 3D series is a quality product. I've been using them for 4 months. The finger groove on the body brings them right into place. The focus wheel is quick. They work well in low light. The case is great. They have a lifetime warranty.
I only have IPAD3 so I don't know, sorry.
24.99 about
Yes
I had the same problem. Fixed it using this solution here: http://www.avsforum.com/forum/109-home-theater-box/1481206-help-samsung-ht-e5500-keeps-changing-source-2.html#post23923247
Yeah it does....Good sound I have it for a year still blast like hell
Yes
Honestly not long enough, I cant hang the wires around the celing border as I wanted to on my medium small/size room, I had to just let them on the floor and under my bed to place the rear speakers on my night tables :/ Even worse wires are permanently attached to the speakers making it harder to extend.
Yes. Connect The antenna n go to fuction
Depends on your mounting depth, and if it currently have a 6.5 speaker now. You can always cut a bigger hole but the door has to be deep enough as well.
Yes they look just like the ones u see when u click on it
I am sure there is. I have the original factory. I know other people that use mobile and longer.
It can, Yes.
Yes
From what I am reading it says your speaker size is 4" so I'd look for these in the size you need
I wish I could answer the first question. Mine is connected to a Samsung TV with an optical cable, though it has HDMI and RCA plug connectors available. My TV remote will control it, but I prefer to keep the controls separate, as there are many more options on the soundbar remote. It is occasionally necessary to work with the sync for reasons I don't understand for one, and the wide quality variations in audio input make other control features handy for good sound reproduction.
Yep, should fit just fine.
Yes d800 is little bit bigger than the d700
It should. Nikon has it included in their list of power accessories on the D810 webpage.
I think there is a vertical grip for the D3200 but the MB D12 works only for D800
You should not need anything besides the grip for it to function properly. You will probably want to purchase another battery. It also takes 8 AA batteries if you want to go that route. But it should work like intended right out of the box.
Plate looks stainless, body hard plastic and some of edges rubberized to prevent slippage. Well engineered. Picks up stations well including weather. Good battery life with solar help but also can be 110 volt charged. Have only cranked when on boat where no power available. Would buy again but not probable as still working great after two years.
We selected the La Crosse Technology 810-10 because it met our needs (NOAA, solar, crank up, light, ...). Radio has worked flawlessly for more than a year now. I do not recall all the other alternatives we looked at but can say we are pleased with our selection. I would recommend the La Crosse Technology 810-10.
yes, it has composite video(rca cable), super video in/output and component video output. it lacks the hdmi input. your hd tv had all this inputs that you can connect to the dvd recorder. If you connect your HD TV to the Component Video Out of the Recorder you'll get HD 720P (3 WIRE RED,GREEN,& BLUE RCA PLUG) it's the second best Video signal to HDMI 1080P HD.
Sorry, but no. The connector at the end there is shaped to fit onto the Xbox 360 controller only, and the shape wouldn't fit into any PC microphone port that I know of. Maybe the new-style inline volume control headset, but not this one here.
Yes i have it working with Lync , GotoMeeting and WebEx (with Chrome) on Windows 8. Infact Logitech does not offer any help here but Jabra did.. Infact BSP 420 is re-branded Jabra speakerphone.. Check out http://www.jabra.com/products/pc_headsets/jabra_speak__410_series/jabra_speak_410 I installed the Jabra call manager and firmware updater the tools "correctly" recognized it as a Jabra device and updated the firmware and drivers.
Yes!!!
The sound is quite good for the price I paid, comfortable to wear.
Whata the reason for needing a new one?
You do not have to worry about the time of the charge. The charger has automatic battery sensing circuitry and will shut off the charge when completed. I have had no problems the batteries and charger.
Infolithium is specific and probably licensed to Sony. They are just a lithium ion with a microchip that can comunicate with the device given charge and capacity info. I have used these for quite a bit with no problems. My camcorder shows capacity correctly and I just use the included charger. Perhaps they have included a microchip in the battery, I don't know, but, so far, I'm happy with their performance. Hope this helps.
Sadly no. But it's still a great holder!
I guess I would have to own that particular bluetooth transmitter. I don't so I can't help you.
I suggest you read the terms and conditions of Samsung's warranty on their website. Additionally, you should get the model and serial no. of the drive from the seller. Samsung may have an app for checking if/when the drie was registered by the original purchaser. Finally, ask the seller for a copy of the original purchase receipt. If you can't prove when you (or the seller) bought the drive, then Samsung is not obligated to provide warranty service to you.
The big black thing that holds the batteries for charging also has flip out prongs that go to a wall outlet to charge the batteries from AC power.
Yes it will.
Not sure, I bought the remote to replace my old one which is an exact match for my flat screen. Sorry not much help.
1 year parts and labor warranty from Toshiba
No it is not.
I have a 40 inch and 50 inch. The 40 inch is too small while the 50 inch is great. I don't know how much difference there is between the 46 inch and the 50 inch but there is a huge difference between the 40 and 50 inch. If there is not too much difference in the price I would suggest the 50 inch. I am very happy with that.
No but you can simply use one of the three HDMI inputs and use it with your PC.
A mouse would probably help out quite a bit although you can hit TAB on the keyboard to change what youre selecting on the screen if need be.
unsure but issue sounds like a problem with your cable provider if its only affecting certain channels.
Yes
On the side
Here in the U.S.? it's standard 120V input.It seems you are asking something different though as this seems like a "Duh" question.
other than making sure that the mute or 1/2 mute is off, I dont know
Yes...I do and they work fine
Hi, No it will not fit! You'd need a bigger mat or have a smaller opening
Hi, No we don't but we can certainly cut it. Please email us, we can get you a quote! Thanks, Leslie
They were both 1200 mAh batteries and work as good as the OEM Canon battery!!
No, this comes with the live subscription only. But while you are activating it you have an option of activating the trials for all other security features for 30 days. If you like you will then have to purchase the license from watchguard.
Yeah I took this to couple of business trips, no problem...
I haven't had any problems at all. No over heating issues at all.
Easy. Take something that is soft and plastic and pry gently along the pieces that clasp to it. It won't make any marks if you do it right.
Have you tried to change the optical cable or the type of connection you are using. I am not sure if that would help, but you might try that. Maybe the optics are not working correctly. The delay button on the remote may also be the solution, but if it does not work maybe the cable is the problem.
I have an LG and am using the fiber optic input and it works great. I also have a bluray player hooked up to the second fiber input.
No, but you can add a third party BT device from someone like RocketFish.
Yes it should fit its almost universal
It stays open it flips up so you can insert the cds.
Yes.
No it doesn't.
I don't know why it's called a mono block. I wish it were because I needed this for a center channel speaker. I can tell you the manual says it is not bridgable so it has to be used stereo.
Anything will work as long as it has a phono/rca/red white plug. But to answer your question, yes this will work with an LA table.
One. You can buy the pair.I just needed one.
Yes it's both and mine came with 2 sets of wireless headphones
I'm not certain whether or not it will fit your Lexus, but do your research before buying this particular model. My dash was not deep enough to encompass the entire unit (it's quite long). Additionally, it didn't fit into the standard DDIN dash-kit that I had to buy. When I took it to the car audio shop near by house, the installer told me to avoid foreign models like Boss, because they don't always meet the specifications. He recommended Pioneer, Jensen, etc.
Yeah it should it fits in a aftermarket stereo
I have a fairly thin belkin soft plastic case and it does connect. I suspect thicker cases might not work
It will not work on I Phone 6 unless you purchase a $30.00 adapter from Apple. It will only work on early Apple products that have the large old style connector.
No, plus it is a piece of junk, I returned it because it didn't work.
Yes it will.
No it's not Bluetooth
I have monitor 20 feet down the hallway from one camera and two stories above another camera and it works fine
Big, more than adequate
I get two 18-hole games per charge. Hope this helps.
Yes. It is incredibly light almost felt like air when I first picked it up.
I would say maximum between 4 to 5 hours.
More or less, but lately I've been disappointed. It started out well, but one thing is it doesn't fit well into the laptop I guess and will fall out. I had to scotch tape it in. Not too cool! It seems to not hold a charge very well. Guess I'd say it doesn't work...... I am considering getting the one from the laptop manufacturer, though that's pricey. I took a chance due to price.....
Its built in wireless
Yes it does rather well
We have the regular Kindle Fire so I can't answer that portion of your question. However, we bought 2 of these cases (one blue, one green) for our 3 and 4 year old boys in March and they are WONDERFUL! They drop them on our wood floor all the time and we have never had any issues. My boys are pretty rough-and-tumble and these cases have been great at protecting the Kindles from their energy. They fit snug and look great as well!
No, it is custom made for Kindle Fire.
Yes and Now.... It would fit the tablet but it will cover half of the speakers on the side.Hope this helps.
Hi, the wattage output is 12 volts.
Elaine, The U.S. warranty for new models is 1 year parts and labor. However, for U.S. customers, if you register your set either online or through Samsung's customer service center, you can qualify for an additional 3 months of coverage for free. That will put you through September of 2014. Try calling the customer service center and registering if you haven't already, and then take advantage of the additional warranty to have your set repaired. Let us know if we can help further. --Mr. S
Yes, there is a place on the remote to turn it on and off.
I used these mounts http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002WN1GOW/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and mounted them on the ceiling.
Yes connect your earphones to the zone 2 output jacks.
No, the system uses wires, but it is easy to install since all of the cables are color coded.
I don't understand your question . What do you mean by zone?
Yes, we can. We will use DHL express
No, but it is easier as it shows on the big screen. Otherwise it shows on the screen of the receiver.
no its just the screen , not the whole outter frame as shown
Over
If you are on a plane and listening to music and the ambient noise around you, it does not bleed. If you are in a room and the drop of a pin can be heard, then yes it does.
"Designed and engineered in Japan, but made in China" is what my headphone box states!
Thank you for your inquiry. This product is compatible with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. Thank you.
not sure. covered thru amazon and paypal. its been a year and no problems
Just like the original. Have had it off the charger for days and holds a full charge.
I have not idea if this battery will work with an ATT phone. Mine was a different brand.
Yes but not to their full potential
30 pin.
The unit works better with an older iPods with the wide multi-pin connectors than with the new narrow connectors. With the new iPods you have to get a converter (~$25) and some features will not work properly.
We set ours up from the beginning in the vertical and they have been a big improvement over not having a sound bar. Never having tried them horizontally, we can't give you accurate information on the comparison. Sorry.
Yes!! This system is VERY NICE for the money and the sound in my opinion is up there with the top contenders. I have this system set up to a 50 inch wall mount Samsung smart TV AND a 105 inch electric screen ceiling mounted projection system. The sound is incredible!!
I'm not sure.. I haven't had to do it yet.
It's a soft bag so dimensions depend on how you pack it. Including the side pockets it's about 18" wide, 8-9" tall and and 8-9" deep. I have carried letter sized file folders in it with no problem. I use it as my camera bag and my man purse.
Indeed.
I have a canon rebel xsi and it fits very well even with a 200mm lens attached
length of camera with lens should be 7 1/2 inches or less to fit.
Nope. only play/pause.
It's kind of soft rubber.. Quite comfortable too
Is it designed to? No. Could it fit one? Yes. But it was made for DSLR cameras. So why would you want to? Just wouldn't make sense to me as it won't properly support it securing it from moving around.
Sorry, but I do not understand what you are asking.
I would say SOL. You may have broken the gasket on the rear door which may have caused a leak. I had an earlier version which went in about the same way you described with screen failure. I did not take mine underwater however. I would look into sturdier models which may have extended warranty periods. You should seek out other opinions. I did purchase this model again but will not subject it to water.
Keyboard is integrated in the TV, like the smartphones. Any wireless keyboard & mouse will do as well, I had a spare at home.
I bought this TV at Amazon.com and called the CC with same question. You can register the TV (even if bought at BB) with Amazon.com and view Amazon videos. However, you still need to pay the rental cost for the videos. You are not saving anything in terms of money. You can either register the TV or have an Amazon video account. They are the same thing. To me, this offer is useless as there is not 'real' benefit.
I bought this for my husbands desk but it seems to me it was a good size. It wasn
Hi, always, as a general rule, to view the 3D effect it is required a 3D capable TV, if you use a 3D Blu Ray movie with a non-3D TV you will only see a normal 2D Blu-Ray. So to answer your two questions, yes and yes. As a final comment, I don't recommend this player, look for Sony.
With the phone , yes ; however I am not sure that it does the same with the GPS as I did not pair mine yet with the gps, nonetheless I am sure it is suppose to
I am sure this can be paired with other Interphone F5 units. Unless the description specifically says it will pair with Scala, I would not think it is compatible. As a side note, give consideration to the SENA SMH10. It is excellent!
You will need the DSP adapter (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00GV4V8Y6) and the satellite cable which is available at the BMW dealer. Dice used to have the part, but it has been discontinued for a while (ACC-BMW-SAT). It's possible you may find someone that still has some. It is identical to the factory part.
this unit utilizes the external bmw cd changer connection in order to connect the iPod. I believe in the 2005 the cd changer is in the dash of the unit, therefore I do not think it will work. If you have an external CD changer from BMW this unit will work.
Yes it does.
Yes, you might need to get a dash kit which will cover up any gaps left when installing any aftermarket stereo. Search for one on Amazon, if they don't sell them than you probably don't need one. Get a vehicle specific wire harness to make wire hookup a breeze too.
Dell Venue 8 and 11 Pro both uses Synaptic digitizer, and this pen is Wacom. So even though they are both active, they are not compatible.
No this pen does not require a battery. This uses Wacom technology. N-trig technology requires a battery.
This system uses GSM network, Sprint use CDMA network, it will not support Sprint cell service
Nope. And they blame Amazon.
The screen comes with VESA standard mount, so you can mount it on any VESA standard stands.
Yes
yes 110v-220v
i've used it with a comcast (arris) router and a buffalo router.
Yes to south american Brazil works very well and very good antenna
Line of site. Needs to be in place in order for this to work
Hi Devin, The grid and the radio are included. Regards.
You do need to have a usb port on your tv. If you don't, I'm not sure if there is a work around. Paula
gave unit as a gift to friend/ but I would say yes, they just call for 1 1/2 volt battery
No. Unless you use the unit as a video monitor and can get video out from your Phone.
There is a USB cable that you can plug into that comes from the back of the unit. You can route the cable into your glovebox if you want it hidden or have it come out of some part of the dash.
Yes it is.
The camera can be connected via a cat5 LAN network, meaning if you have internet service at your garage you could connect the camera to the internet via a router. Some service provider internet modem are also an integrated router you would have to check. Otherwise the camera could be connected to a computer LAN/Network and connect directly to a computer, without at least that the camera would be useless.
beats me
Did you tried manyal mode? Though it has multiple connection as it works like supporting TTL, it does not support TTL.
Yes, the keys don't push we'll.
I think the keyboard is junk. Most of my keys do not work.
This one is Pink. We also have black one on selling, please search DealBarn.
I've never connected the case to wifi I've only done blue tooth to my tablet from the case.
If you read the description it says iPad 2 so I would think not.

Yes it does. In fact, it's a great fit
I would look for something better. Perhaps a Kenwood. Map support has been nonexistent. Plus this system is over 2 years old. Though it is OK, I would think there are improved heads. Good luck
It doesn't
Not detachable this year, but the motorized models (KW-NT700 and KW-NT800HDT) have reverse tilt. FLAC and WAV files can be played from either USB or SD card. There is no file limit, but officially only 32GB cards work. Although reality is 64GB cards will most likely work.
Not really, but like any headphone if you are close and it gets too loud the other person ca N hear. Comfort wise they are great
I don't think this can be answered properly here. This same unit could be sold as new, refubished or used by different Marketplace sellers, but these questions will be shared with all sellers of the same unit. If you look at "From These Sellers" the new, used and refurbished tabs are there to help you sort it out (if the refurbished tab doesn't appear, then none are being reported as refurbished by the sellers).
You cannot watch movies from a USB, you have to use an SD memory card.
With the proper dash kit yes and if your interested in it I'll sell you mine I got rid of my car and no longer need it great condition only had for about two months
Mine was a Samsung, BD-C6500. The adapter didn't say it would work with it, but it does. I just decided to buy it and try and it worked. You've got to decide if you're willing to try it and see. I can't tell you if it'll work, only that it worked with my Samsung. Good Luck.
It should. Its a srandard single din opening. You can always refrence crutchfield.com
yes, in the eq there is a setting for sub on/off
I had not tried to do so. The current bluetooth isn't the best and will cause you problems down the road.
In what sense? It is designed to work with any car with a double DIN interface
No
Negative. Battery power only.
You won't need one if using Bluetooth. I'm not sure about a cord/ adapter. It does have a ac input "hole". Same size as a power plug is.
This will work with an iPhone 5 but only via Bluetooth.
Mine did because they were used I'm not sure about new
You may want to order the factory speaker wire adaptors or be prepared to do a little wiring hook-up changing. No big deal if you are a little able in this area. If you buy the speakers from Amazon, the site will probably offer them as an additional item. I think mine cost me around $8.00. Good luck and I think you'll like them.
yes it is......
pair
yes
Unfortunately no. I still need to carry my bag. I can say that the convenience of this vest is outstanding. One can hike, stoop, bend over, etc w/o the swaying and potential camera damage if using a conventional strap. I love it !! Frank
I have not had my telephoto lens attached while wearing it. But have to say that I barely notice my camera while hiking.
I would think it could--all the straps are adjustable.
this is theproblem with this bad. u need to place it flat, and gain access to gear.
AA and AAA rechargables... If your looking at the same charger I purchased 4 AA rechargeable are included...
It really doesn't take that long. Pop them in and walk away and it seems like in an hour or so you walk by and the green light is on and they are good to go. It works great. It is also nice to have 2 in the camera and 2 in the charger.
Any AA NIMH 2800 mAh Rechargeable Battery
The battery is internal somewhere. I have charged the keypad as often as I've needed to charge the IPad so I haven't needed to locate the battery. There is an on/off switch so I tend to turn the keypad off when I'm not using it so as to conserve battery life. I've had the IPad die more frequently than the keyboard. I love this keyboard!
I haven't had any wifi issues with the case.
The part of the case that snaps on to the IPad is a bit sturdy, one needs strong fingers or a spatula to help wedge and ease the iPad in, I did it with my fingers, needs a bit of strength to pull and snap in the last corner after the other 3 are in place, once it's in it holds pretty good.
No stylus holder but a great case, very pleased"
Not noisy at all. The projector runs rather quietly, even when used all day in classes.
there is two usb input for wireless n storage input, the build in bios will only run video n some files. it will not recong a camera !
refurbished , yes- new , no
Yes, it works
A pair
Jorge, I don't know your sub, but the 10.1s will work well with the Marantz amp, both in terms of power and sonics. I recommend them highly.
Yes
I believe so.
Yes it is
No. Only 3.0
Yes, the output is the same.
It doesn't use the cable. I had lost mine so I was able to take the battery out of the camera, place it in the charger and plug into wall.
I've not used in the car outlet. I have only used to plug into the wall.....battery pops in the device, plugs into wall.
According to the directions and wiring provided you can. I only have two speakers so I cannot answer from experience.
No HDMI port, but you should be able to find an adapter that will allow you to go from either VGA or USB to HDMI
yes - WINDOWS XP with Office 2007 on it and still running strong
i sent the battery back because it didn't fit.
i don't think so because there is no video cable of any sort
The camera picks up everything from the rear bumper out to 75 feet. The monitor can be viewed up to about 3 feet effectively.
Mine works great behind my 28 foot Terry Trailer.
I see what your problem is. With the license plate attached to the hatch you would have to run the wire up the door and then back down to the light. Unless there is a way to attach the camera to the center of your rear bumper. There should be enough wire to reach the light if you run it up and down. I put mine on a pick up truck. It works fine but the camera has to be cleaned off whenever the weather gets bad. No big deal.
With my bag the strap keeps it in place, but there is a lot of area around it, and I have a 19 inch screen.
Probably not. Most if not all computers require separate jacks for the headphones and mic, these earbuds have a single jack.
Barely. My D5100 with a tripod mount and 18-200 was a tight fit and I couldn't close the velcro.
Yes, it will. The EOS 40D fits and there is room for a lot longer lens. See caselogic.com for more information on size of this case.
Yes...it uses sd card...
No, it has a very old fashion parallel port connecting to the printer from the computer
8 guage wire to run power from your battery to where you install it, inline fuse, some smaller guage wire to run the remote (12 volt accessory) turn on wire from the back of your stereo, also either RCA cable or speaker wire depending on whether your running low or high level inputs .... you can buy it separately or just get a 8 gauge sub/amp wiring kit and it will have everything you need
Yes
not sure, however it fit's under my seat 2010 extended cab Silverado.
No just buy some heavy gauge wire for the power,and a little heavy gauge wire for the ground ,also get in-line fuse put it close to the pos.side to the battery.You'll need some speaker wires too but not much. ok thats about it.
battery
Built in crossovers you can check http://www.rockfordfosgate.com/rftech/woofer_wizard.asp for what to wire them to for your amp.
No
50 watts RMS, 100 watts max
That has nothing to do with the monitor lol If your computer supports double browsers (like Windows 7), then yes.
No
The device is 3.5 inches by 1.75 inches. Works as described with my tablet.
I no longer have the unit and don't recall what type of cabling came with ti. Sorry I can't be of help.
Yes. It comes with a remote, which I never use. I never use the Motion sensor either. I have mine set to come on @ 6 am and turn off @ 10 pm.
Yes, the power pack says 100~240V input.
no they do not have inline volume control
Yes, but I would not buy from them. They sent me mine and it would not work, nor did I get a refund.
just a year. but mines stop working after that and i had to purchase another dvr
Yes, it will fit on the board. I have one installed on a LGA775 board. It is fairly tall, though. Mine sticks out about as far as my power supply.
Didnt have the chance to use it, it was damaged when I received it. So i returned for money back.Sorry!
Yes. The earphone jack is located in the rear of the unit, right above the speaker jack.
I work from home thru a VPN and have no issues what so ever :)
I can't say for certain that it will last forever but so long as no other functions are selected I've never seen it come out of pause unintentionally. Your best bet would be to make a note of cd time position at the point where you pause in case something were to happen. Even a minor power flucuation cam cause any electronic device to reset and unless you keep batteries installed that could be an issue here as well. In fact I am unsure about whether it would interupt changing over from plug to battery power. Best of luck.
I don't believe the box has any internal power save feature, but it does pass any OS sent power saving commands through to the drive. So if your OS has a spin down timer configured in its power options, then the external drive will share that spin down function and turn off and on with the OS requests.
Yes - I keep it plugged in all the time so it's ready when I want it.
It plugs into the TV. So, your TV remote will control the volume.
No. It did not work with my tv or cable box. The connection cable will not work with the tv and cable, it was not suitable for my tv Samsung flat screen tv , nowhere to plug the speakers. You might need to buy an adjustment ??!!!. Tablets, phones and stereos and maybe computers. I bought it for the tv and I couldn't use it. I did read the comments from other customers so I thought it will go with my tv but it didn't so I am not sure how they made it work
8 to 10 hours
No
As far as I can determine, the DHS 100 does not work with the DECT 1580-3. The Uniden website says that the unit works with the D1700, D1780BT, D2300, D3500 and D3900 series phones. If additional information is needed, I would suggest contacting Uniden via the Web or by telephone since they may have other options to add.
It works on a 120 volt. I Love mine. Best purchase I ever made.
Press "Menu" on the base, arrow to "Ringers," and press the down arrow on the "Volume" button, you can turn the ringer off. It will stay off if you press "Menu/Select" to save your preference. PS--If you have the Caller ID feature, the phone will not announce the number when the volume is in the "Off" position.
It's drag & drop. Super simple.
5 years on SD cards.http://www.sandisk.com/about-sandisk/warranty-and-user-guides/warranty-table/
It should definitely improve your graphics experience, but double check that your power supply can handle the new card. Also, is your current graphics handler integrated into the cpu or mobo?
As I understand it, Sandisk gives these products a limited lifetime warranty (10 years in regions that do not recognize lifetime warranty). It is best to check for yourself at http://www.sandisk.com/products/memory-cards/sd/ultra-uhs-1-class10-30mbs/?capacity=32GB
It does NOT come with an optical cord, I purchased one on Amazon and it does come with a remote- Hope that helps!
Will it improve the sound of TV? Absolutely. The array of speakers on the bar alone provide better sound and the subwoofer, though comparatively modest as subwoofers go, truly fills out the bottom end. We don't have the system on all the time, just when we watch shows with music or movies. and the difference is dramatic. There are much better soundbars out there but they all cost a lot more. For our bedroom TV, a 32" Sony, it works very well indeed.
Basically, you hook speaker to TV, I used optical cable, then put TV on "mute" and turn on speakers with their own remote...then adjust volume, treble, bass surround etc with the speaker remote. Speaker remote also has a mute setting. I also ran a cable from speaker to computer headphone outlet so I could use speaker for my itunes while running computer. Can use same cable to run to my iPad etc if I wanted. These are great speakers and economical.
It has a 3.5mm headphone jack on the side with the HDMI ports. I use it often and I've never had a problem.
This particular model is 8 GB. They make a 16 GB for about the same price
This one is 8 GB.
yes
Earphones yes. Armband no - at least I don't remember seeing one.
Sorry it took me so long. Just tried and yes you can fast reverse. Hope this helps you.
Do not know, still not reached my blue ray to my house
I'm unsure of the problem since I currently have digital cable connected to this tv. You should try calling your digital cable provider.
It takes about 30s to connect
You have to press the ear piece wire button to talk.
Don, I haven't had any issues with short transmit times yet. My transmit times are fine so far, but I haven't put that many miles on my radios yet. If the alcohol doesn't help you might try a contact cleaner called Deoxit or Deoxit Gold which you would have to spray on a Q-tip and then apply to the contacts.. Or, you may have to replace your batteries. Try talking to the Midland Tech support also.
I have used these for us to a week while hunting. They lasted 2 to 3 days with constant us, bUT is also comes with a vehicle charger plug for 9th the road
It will play then sequentially. I have so many tracks that I still haven't reached the last one. But, if I remember correctly you have the option to loop, shuffle, or stop at the end.
Mine just stops getting louder. I have found headphone quality can make loudness vary with this player. I was surprised to hear how much louder mine got with different headphones.
Just the mp3 player and directions
They are not good quality, however they work good! If you can get a best ones! Do not hesitate to do it! :)
It depends on how big the radio opening in the dash is. Is it more square or rectangle?
It all depends on what you willcuse it for. If it is for gaming I would use the Asus GeForce. The XFX AMD Radeon tends to over heat.
You can use regular ear buds to listen, but not speak. There is a separate smaller port for the mic that requires a compatible headset.
Whole network, if the VPN router is the default gateway and you have the routes configured correctly.
are you using wall plug or a strip? always use wall plug for charging. i had same problem. and so i put the charger plug in wall and it will charge. now it takes about i think 10 hours to recharge the walkie. try that if that doesnt work be sure that the plug is in the charger part of walkie and it all the way inserted.
Tom - Yes it is!
I bought 4 pairs of these to augment the range of the Motorola radios I already owned for use at outdoor events. They all talk to each other, based on the big and small channel numbers, and in fact I learned about the Midlands when someone used their Midland to talk to my Motorolas but I didn't have the signal strength for them to hear my replies. Now I use the Midlands for posts further away and the Motorolas for nearby posts as well as for backups/extras around the event organizer's base.
Now, I'm very new to Mac so a lot of you Apple lovers probably know this already, but for Mac newbies (myself included), you need to go to SYSTEM PREFERENCES and choose DISPLAY, APPEARANCE and click on MIRROR DISPLAY to get the video on your TV. And to get the sound from your Mac to your TV go to SYSTEM PREFERENCES and choose SOUND, OUTPUT and click on BUILT-IN HDMI OUTPUT and that should do the trick. Hope that helps folks out there.
No, but there is a spot to hook on a lanyard on the back. Hope this helps.
Yes it works for any adroid or tablet
Yes.
I don't think it has a specific USA warranty, but I have heard that Yongnou is pretty good about standing behind their gear. I have 4 of these and the 622C-TX and all work well.
I have never tried it so can't give you an answer.
Yeah Glenda, it has fast forward and rewind features.
No
Yes, the speaker is pretty good actually for a recorder of this size. In that sense it is better than my Zoom H1.
I used my Motorola rokr e8 ac charger, it being a micro USB. Therefore it can be deduced that since the general USB delivers 5v a normal 5v socket charger (mini usb) would suffice. (120V 60hz power). Note: I have never left my unit charging from such a source for more than half an hour!!!!
I have a14 inch lenovo idepad. I fit the arms by moving them to about one half inch from the back of the laptop. This provided the best balance and most stability when working. I imagine every machine will have a sweet spot for the stand but I would start as far back as possible and move forward. Hope this helps.
Yes, unless you are picking up public wifi.
Blue
I purchased for a Latitude E6410. I don't know the Precision line or the C565C designation.
Mine came with a remote.
yup, works great with camera. has yellow rca input for backup.
I'm not sure if it does but it fit into my son's 2002 Ford F150
I'm not sure.
if your phone has a USB connecter on the recharge cable. By the way the sound on this cd player is awful.
Yes, it does have a headphone jack.
This camcorder is not feature rich. I thought it was a waste of money
Hi Phil, It does not appear that you can. There is only an input/output port where you can plug in an AV wire to view your videos on a television, and also a USB pops out that you can plug into your computer so you can download and view your videos that way, but it only has battery capability from what I can tell. Hope this helps. ~Ann
I am afraid not
I think 8 gb is the maximum. but you could try 64
0000
the item is 32" l x 2"x 2" I hope this helps you.Happy New Year.
Have to say I haven't had that problem. It generally works perfect for my iPad. Maybe it's the device you are using?
yes, on labor i almost pooped when i seen that
pretty sure it has an HDTV like most digital TVs.
Yea
No it does not.
Not sure, may need to contact the company. Sorry.
Yes it is a good cd player
It comes with the usb cord, but no charger because it runs on batteries.
The best answer I have is to make sure the audio files are in the proper format for your storage card. If they arr make sure they actually play on th computer, if thry do not play on the computer obviously they wont play on the device. Otherwise most likely the storage card isnt a match.
Yes
All I can really tell you is that it works fine in my Canon SX170.
I am not sure , but if the N3 connector fits on the receiver pin and the other side fits at the 6D camera it will work .
Yes, this will work with your Samsung Galaxy Tab 3. This has worked for my multiple Samsung devices, as well as Motorola phone, hp desktop and laptop. Generally the Sandisk works with most devices that have either micro sd or usb
The ultra records video faster. Some HD equipped camera's are to fast to write to a regular 32gb chip!! Check your camera's requirements.
Yes, I would think so.
Its 5.1 so, You got your 4 directionals, your center, and your subwoofer.
I honestly don't know. I would google the one for that camera. Or look it up on amazon for your specific camera. This one works on many of them but unsure about the D300!
no, I just had a small issue getting the box from my old key into the new shell. There was a small piece of plastic in the new shell that I had to cut away. Then all you have to do is have the new blank cut. All programming is in the box that you remove from the old key.
No
Same here... I thought it was gonna be better than it is... disappointed overall
There are two advantages to this card - even when using the older cameras you've listed: (1) very fast write speed, useful if you shoot sports or wildlife in the continuous high mode, and (2) fast upload speed to your computer IF you are using USB 3.0. If you do not shoot continuous mode (and never will), and if you do not have a USB 3.0 reader (and never will), you don't need the speed this card provides. Hope that helps.
No. You need a SD (Secure Digital) memory card. Lexar does make an SDXC 128 gig card that would work. see - http://www.amazon.com/Lexar-Professional-128GB-Memory-LSD128CTBNA400/dp/B007BZRXK2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394215418&sr=8-1&keywords=Lexar+SDXC+128+gig
Yes, well sort of. But it is a waste of money. Buy a slower card. The D70 cannot use the extra speed you are paying for in this card. Check the back of the manual for compatible cards is the only way to be sure.
The neck strap connects to the camera, not the case.
Loud is relative. I don't know if these are what one would consider industrial. If you wear cans constantly they can become uncomfortable. They're clean at peak levels and the bottom line is can't find better for the price. Good luck.
These headphones have an 1/8" plug, so they plug into an mp3 player. You would need an adapter (1/8" stereo jack to 1/4" stereo plug - Radio Shack part #274-876 or 274-371) to connect the headphones to a stereo.
Great....no but ok. These are not meant to be for audiophiles but the mid is good and clear. For the price the are a good buy. Previous buds were Klipsch s4, Sennheiser and Denon...they all died in less than a year and I am not hard on them.
pretty long. not sure. these are awesome. i have. 2 pairs.
Can't imagine why not. It's just a regular headphone jack. If those have regular headphone jack, then yes. My son uses it with his ipad mini.
Not bad without sound on. But once you got music or something playing, they are pretty good.
JUST over the ear. Not as big as Beats, but good enough.
I asked my sister in law who I gave this unit to as a gift and she said 'no'
The two necessary AAA batteries are included.
It the traditional woven cloth material its pretty durable we use them for our guys in the field and they are rough on the bags
It does NOT come with one. I purchased separately (on Amazon)
It may be the same. Just (Google) searching for VS14415 returned this. http://parts-lcd.com/viewsonic-parts-c-21/genuine-viewsonic-va2703led-vs14415-lcd-power-board-487a91201m-l02561m-p-4241.html
Power is provided by the same USB power running the cooling fan. No additional power cable is needed.
yes, the Canon T31/600 has a mic input, so the Rode VideoMic Pro will work fine with it. Just need to use the Manual setting in the camera for audio levels to get better sound quality.

hi there ,i do not have a sony system , but your best choice is to write sony as some firmware up dates or models may not accept large CF or speed . you're better off to write Sony because i tried to use this card on some other cameras it did not work but it works on Canon 5Dmark 3 . i hope i answered your question .
Yes. Keyboard is included. It doesn't have batteries, if you're talking alkaline. It's just rechargeable via a USB cable. It lasts about a month, depending on how long you use it or leave it turned on. Mine gets a lot of use, as I use it to type papers and discussions for some online courses, but I keep the keyboard turned off otherwise, and it can go a month or more.
No. iPad Airs are a totally different design and aren't compatible with any previous generation of iPads.
Yes, mine came with the watch bracelet. I use mine almost every day while exercising!
As far as I know,no.
3 years
it works in almost every different Sony TV. I assume this one will work without problem
Yes.
yes works perfectly :)
If they're the standard door speakers then yes. And they sound great! Good luck
Yes. Socket 1150 has the same standard mounting scheme as socket 1155.
Yes, 1150 shares same mounting holes with 1155.
I use it to charge an iphone and a Google Nexus tablet without any problems.
Mine plays any type DVD I've put in it. I didn't have to change any thing. Perhaps you screwed something up by changing to PAL. Did it come with instructions? I'd advise reading them. I had no problem, I took it out of the box, plugged it in and it's been working ever since. I've played region 2, 3 and others without having to change any settings or do anything.
Yes, it can work with a Neewer flash if and only if the power pack attachment connects. I saw some models of Neewer, but I can not see under the rubber cover in the pictures.
It can be used both ways. It is IP-based, so you can access it stand-alone using a web browser, or you can connect it to a computer-based DVR software, such as BlueIris, which knows how to "talk to" IP cameras.
To the best of my knowledge, there is not an hour rating. The original OEM bulb is supposed to last 3000-4000 hours as I recall. The first one that came with my projector lasted a little over 3000 hours and the OEM replacement only lasted around 1200 hours. I have this bulb now and the picture quality is just as good. It has about 500 hours on it so far. For the price, I'll be satisfied if I get over 1500 hours.
The one I am selling has a ATI FirePro M7740. It has also been updated with 8 GB of RAM and a 250 GB solid state drive.
The best way to find out what is compatible with your provider is to call their tech support or go to their website.
I do not know if it is Cox Compatible, it is Comcast Compatible
Used it to connect my security system Internet module (system visibility, notifications and control). Had REALLY bad disconnect issues / warnings / calls from monitor company. After MONTHS of this crap (sometimes multiple per day) and buying a new router and balancing the load from all my toys (still had bad dc issues), I just happened to try "short" for the preamble setting and haven't had an issue in I think at least a couple of weeks. FINALLY!! But we will see if it holds...
Yes
Yes, there is an elevation indicator on the screen "on demand" along with time, direction, and distance to destination and time to go.
Sound channels are wrong? Is it because you are unable to match up the proper channels to those on the card? I ran into this issue for a bit but eventually found the right channels. Part of the issue is that I don't think the coloring is universal and 2 of the channels required using conversion cables. Otherwise I have 7.1 playing pretty well through these headphones.
I think you should be fine,the alarm duty cycle is usually short and this horn is fairly inexpensive. I'd try it. Good luck.

You can patch the HDMI video out of your DVR or the component out of your DVR to the corresponding input of the Intensity Extreme and then record the playback using the capture feature of the Media Express application that comes with it. The Intensity Extreme defaults to recording uncompressed HD which even if your system meets the requirements for that you might want to change the settings to Apple ProRes (if installed) or Apple Intermediate Codec. Once captured you can edit and/or convert the files to whatever video format that you need for playback elsewhere.
Thunderbolt devices can only be used on Apple computers with Thunderbolt, or in some case a PC with Thunderbolt - if the vendor provides PC driver support. There is no "USB 3.0 to Thunderbolt" adapter or any workaround like that unfortunately. Black Magic does make an Intensity Shuttle USB 3.0 model, however it only works with a specific USB 3.0 chipset in the computer, so it does NOT work for many users.
Although you will still need some kind of program or utility to actually stream, you can use this as a capture device to run a signal from your camera into your computer. Assuming of course that your camera is able to output on a compatible standard.
Yes, with the included dongle which has analog inputs including s-video.
Probably, it isn't as important what the software is as long as whatever you are trying to use this unit with does not output to rgb. I got It to use with my ps4 and pc from my macbook so I could stream off my Mac using obs. What I found was that both the ps4 and my graphics card outputs were rgb so it would not work with the unit. Hope this helps!
yes
you can but i recommend you look else where
Im not sure Natalie. My son has Detox and this cord that I ordered from here is a FAKE. it does not work for my son's headphones! Im very disappointed with these.
Hi Cindy, I bought this for my Subway location, and we run XP on our POS system. Downloading drivers was a piece of cake & it's been running great for a few months now. Hope this helped. God bless. Balkar
You turn it on and off by holding the Traction control button. You can make all the adjustments via the cruise control stalk if you don't have the evic and steering wheel buttons.
I have the same laptop, and it fit.
I'm not sure what you mean by a non-visible IR illuminator? This is a motion detector run by batteries and it does not turn on if there is light which is really good. It has been working fine for me and I am going to get another one. It stays on for 30 seconds after there is no motion detected. I hope this helps?
the color temperature of LEDs is 5500-6500K
no don't think so . no multi-pin input . but it will take a large usb drive of music .
Yes
Hello yes this NAS is network secured with group security. it's easy to configure & stable. They only last 3-5 yrs though so do your backups!
My connection is a local network in my house running at 1G bit, Ethernet connection. You access it through an address provided by your router using auto DNS. If you are familiar with a network that has 2 or more computer (or printers), this device looks just the same. I enable sharing on my PC so that the backup manager on the Iomega can backup up my files. Hope this helps.
It's the full meal deal at least for the Professional cards.
I think there is no other way around it,the warranty it seems is only for US purchases therefore if any issues,i need to ship the item back.With that said,the item is well built and its 3M.A quality brand name,i believe their QC will not let the item fail anytime soon.
I don't know about Mac , but it's fabulous with my laptop toshiba ^_*
The power supply that comes with the MP410 indicates: input: 100-240v-1.7a 50-60Hz I have only had an opportunity to use it in the USA.
Yes, this option should be available. You can select the type of audio output from the SPIDF (Dolby Digital, PCM, or Off) in the Audio Menu&gt;SPIDF Type.
I tried an mp4 this morning to test it for you and it said unrecognized. The menu options seem to indicate pictures and music only.
Exactly what you're looking for. I pull it out and turn it to watch it from my recliner when I'm not laying in bed and it's straight. Moves up,down, left or right. Cannot see you having a problem with this.
Yes
Yes
No it doesn't lock but it stays in place it doesn't move that easy.
Dont know mine was a replacement remote control ,it was the same as the original remote
Yes, that is what we have.
That's a good question. I can only assume that it would work with any Roku system. The Roku I have did not come with a remote (purchased from a friend), and I ordered this one because it was the cheapest I could find and it worked just fine with my Roku XS
The cabinet includes no cords, just a power supply. Should take whatever you throw at it. I have a bunch of Samsung products in mine.
I bought about 20 at once and one was not functioning. The company replaced it immediately and then we had no trouble with plug and play.
Yes! Smart cover is built in!
Yes. This mount will work with any camera that accepts a threaded mount (S100 included).
This mount will work with cameras that have a 1/4" threaded female insert. I use it with my Midland HD1080.
Yes you can it is one of things you want in your camera bag very useful
The company's stock system is screwed up and they sent me a flashlight.... They all speak Chinese, can't get my money back.... Don't buy it!
I believe it will fit just fine from a size perspective. The 3 version employed a larger opening for the charger plug, But there may be an issue with it turning off the 4 when the lid is in the closed position. It works for the 3. My version 4 iPad is not with me at the moment to check the sleep capability.
Not 100% sure, so far all of the pictures seem to turn out great but I haven't taken that many at night time yet.
mine didn't work either - sorry
If you are talking about wifi range its about the same as most wifi routers. Give or take 150' to 300'. Also depends on other factors but best case scenario is the range that I just mentioned. One other great thing about this router is with my air stick I tend to get better 4g communications with it. I have used this router with my Verizon stick and have gotten better range than if the 4g modem was used in my laptop only. I am very happy with this router. I use it quite a bit for work.
Version 5.1.2 date 05/13/14. You can look at the product support page http://cradlepoint.com/firmware/MBR1200B. The items has been discontinued and will not receive anymore updates.
The 3D-Bee Home works with 1080p or 720p 3D TVs or projectors which accept side-by-side 3D video format.
I have a TC-L55ET5 Passive 3D TV. I believe your tv is active 3-D. You need active 3D glasses.( not passive).Check this link out. http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2404369,00.asp
Yes. Hdmi are not brand specific, like apple
If you are able to still use your touch screen, yes. The page will transfer to your TV but your phone acts as the keyboard...I hope this helps.
Absolutely DO NOT buy this - it will arrive bent and creased and unusable.
no. it is modified sine wave
Use the Intel Raid Controller that is on your motherboard if you are going RAID 0, that's what I would do. I am using the card for an SSD which was perfect for my computer, big jump in performance. Not sure how it would work under RAID 0, seeing how I have never used it for that. Hope this helps.
Yes. It has the holes to screw in the brackets. I replaced my old tv which was mounted With this one.
I had to use the remote search feature. Using a comcast remote, you have to aim the remote right at the sensor on the left side of the tv
I would first check the cables, whether they are plugged in correctly. Though it may seem silly, check on volume and muting. Go to settings in the TV and make sure the audio is set up correctly. If all other options have failed, You may have a problem with the TV itself. Should be under warranty!
The button will answer and end calls. It will also pause music with one click or with two clicks it will go back to the beginning of the track, then if you click it twice again it will go to the previous track.
I would doubt it. The manufacturer makes them sized to specific cameras. Go to their web site and send them an email and ask them which one would be best for your camera model and give them the size of the screen. The website is http://www.microsolutionusa.com. These can not be cut so the manufacturer says or the edges will not stick properly. Good luck.
That really depends on the voip system. If it will allow you to set multiple destinations for a single inbound number, i dont see why not.
No. You need the E-mount style of this lens. Two versions of the E-mount lens can be found. The first version has a ribbed rubber focus ring and can sometimes be found at a cheaper price. The later version has s smooth focus ring. This lens is a winner and can be found at...
Wow, people voting on answers should be ashamed of themselves! The answer to your question traviswclark is ABSOLUTELY NOT LEGALLLY! These are not FCC certified, and cannot be legally used even with a GMRS license. They would have to be completely reprogrammed even to be on GMRS channels. Unless you have a HAM Radio Operator's license from the FCC, do not waste your money on these, and risk $10,000 fines. Buy a legal FRS radio, and stay on the FRS channels unless you get a GMRS license.
Low Power- 1 Watt High Power 2.5-3 Watts I test them myself.
sorry. it can't be operated on the MURS Frequencies.
Yes
I have a 525 and it worked fine....do not know for your number....does the ad not tell what it fits?
Unfortunately no Russian menu. It has 11 menu language and it's very easy to change the language. You tape on MENU and then on SETTINGS. The first line is OSD LANGUAGE and you can makeyour choice
Yes - dv7 - 6000's one of the more popular sizes and common with two row cell cases
It does not...but it is easy to pull them out with your fingers
like all other keyboards, it has male plug
Not unless you use the RCA hook-up (red, yellow, white). Use of the HDMI cable somehow prevents the closed captioning from showing on screen, even if your television has this capability. CNET has some questions/answers about this.
yes it does, recordables too.
About 4 hours. Long enough for 2 movies or 4 episodes of a TV show.
Yes you can play any kind of CD's
No
I got this back from Icarus: The excel supports 802.11 b/g/n.
It is not locked and you can use it outside of Germany. I returned it and replaced it with an ipad though. Good luck!
Sorry, I don't know. I only use it for audio, not linked to a TV or monitor. Sound is very good.
you only need to power 2 small speakers. you don't need a lot of power. Any receiver will work.
Yes. The great thing about Wacom is that the nibs are generic to all Wacom pen tablets.
Yes. It is a professional grade level product.
It does have 2 docks that will charge the new ipad3. There are lsp two USB charging jacks that will charge the iphone5.
I purchased this for another motorola radio (which died so I purchased the MT352R) and it worked just fine with the MT352R. The MT352R only uses the single plug (it is NOT a dual plug radio).
No, CBs operate around 27Mhz (11m band) while GMRS/FRS radios such as these operate at about 462MHz (70cm band). The numbers on the display are more just a mnemonic or convenient 'symbol' for the actual frequency. On a ham radio walkie talkie (HT), the user can assign displayed numbers (memory presets) to whatever frequencies they like. Hope this helps someone!
Yes. I have a Samsung with multiple ways to connect to other devices and the dvr has multiple ways. The dvr also includes some of the wires to do so.
Okay, I wasn't going to, but here ya go. I can't even get my camera to work with the complimentary Trendnet software. No wonder you're looking for another way. I plan to call Trendnet again and hopefully they can help me. I love the camera, wireless, picture, etc. Why wouldn't they be able to help with this question?!
I dont know, I sent mine back it was to complicated.
Yes, IF you have a Web Browser, Network and a Router (For the TRENDnet Camera to connect to) However, I've been disappointed with mine. Allow me to suggest http://foscam.us
If you have a 110 VAC outlet and a router, you are good to go! Yes the camera will meet all your needs as mentioned and more!
If there is enough light to avoid the night vision ,than yes it will work. If not the ir lights will reflect off the window glass and either blind the camera or reduce the range. What i did to get around this is to conceal the camera in an old birdhouse my wife had on a table on the porch.
You can. I have not used that function but it is available.
Of the free apps, I use both TRENDnetVIEW and SecurView Pro. The former looks better and fills the whole screen on an iPhone 5 while the latter allows you to automatically pan the camera. I haven't tried any of the paid apps yet.
It is not weatherproof like camera's intended for external use are. Power connection is not waterproof, and no hood to protect the lens from sun glare. I would not recommend.
This is the heavy duty grip. I have it on both my 5D Mark III and the one made for the 7D. I love it!!! I had bought the Zeikos one before I bought the Canon and the Zeikos was a plastic piece of junk. So, I dropped some money and have been hysterically happy with this grip. I wouldn't give it another thought...buy it, you will thank me later.
Saw those and knew immediately they were scams. Tried to add it to cart anyway just to see what happens. You get a message saying that the item cannot be shipped to your address, enter another address. Well, I entered several addresses all in the good 'ol USA and none qualified. Don't waste you time and DO NOT write them unless you want to get involved with scammers. I've done it a couple times just to waste their time by giving them fake info. Heh heh.
It is Canon's LP-E6 battery and is rechargeable. For shooting photos, it'll last something along the lines of 300-500 shots depending on how you shoot. I don't shoot video, so I couldn't tell you how long they will hold out for video.
Yes, its a L lens, the 24-105. It would be about $800 by itself. I a incredibly useful lens, F4 is fine for almost any situations except very, very low light. This lens covers photo and video very well.
I recall it is a 90-day warranty; and it is a US warranty if purchased from a US dealer
With the optional GPS Receiver GP-E2 attached to the hot shoe or the digital terminal, the EOS Rebel SL1 can record location, including latitude, longitude and altitude, and has the ability to track the trajectory of movement with its logging function. An electric compass records the camera's orientation during each shot, and world time information is recorded through GPS syncing.
No, I don't think so.
i don't know. it fits my PowerShot SD1200 IS.
I don't believe so. It has a USB port and an aux in, but that's about it.
No, once the unit is turned off all functions e.g. (CD/MP3) will begin from the first track/folder.
As a general rule of thumb, any USB device that can connect to a USB power supply will charge. There isn't such a concept as "wall charger only" anymore, since electricity passes through USB devices. So, I would say yes.
No gps, no waze
You will need a 3G wireless service from one of the wireless service provider such as AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon
If you buy the 11" model, yes. I have the 13" and it fits the keyboard area well; it just makes typing a bit more cumbersome.
Manufacturer suggests, for hygiene, it be thrown out after six months. If a customer wants to clean it, dish washing hand liquid soap and water -- very gently -- would do the trick. The film is very thin and subject to tears so be careful
Yes your sub handles 1000watt rms, i have the same amp running PPI pro sub wired to 2 ohms to produce an Ohm load on your amp to produce 1000watt rms, good quality amp, you will need an upgraded alternator and a capacitor so your lights won't dim at night.
It piggybacks on the existing power adapter for your phone. You plug the phone power adapter into this device instead, and then plug the power cord running out of it into your phone. So only if you don't already have a power adapter for your phone will you need to get one.
I bought this as a gift for my sister, and she seems very happy with it.
Yes it has an electrical cord.
Don't buy one! Return the unit right now. It will no longer function in a few days, weeks at the most. It stopped working well on day 2 for us, stopped working entirely in day 3.
This device not even works with CD. It was a failure. I cannot recomend anyone to buy it.
Sorry not sure.
Only if the dimensions are the exact same as the earlier IPad...otherwise it will sit too loosely.
No it does not.
Yes, The battery recharger is like the one Canon provides with the camera. It has a wall socket and also comes with one that converts it for European outlets as well.
Yes
I am using it with OS X Mavericks without any problems.
I'm not familiar with that modem...but if it has a standard external antenna port on it, it should work. I've been able to use these with my Buffalo and Amped Wireless devices with no problems (which have external antenna connectors.) EDIT: To expand on my answer, these antennas fit standard 5mm male threaded connectors.

TDGBR250 is the traditional model, cheaper one produced by SONY. I have both models, the main advantage of TDGBR750 is its weight -&gt; it is very light. But TDGBR250 is great and it has a bigger vision field than TDGBR750. Please see http://www.amazon.com/Sony-TDG-BR250-Rechargeable-Adult-Glasses/dp/B004U5QE4W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1373033946&sr=8-1&keywords=TDGBR250 in Amazon to browse the other model. I have just checked the current price of this model and I would not buy it costs more than USD 100 as I checked.
No
Yes thats what we use
No, mine setup only uses dish. I believe you can buy a model just for direct TV.
Hello dear buyer Thank you to be interesting in ours products I'm sorry that especial it's not available but we can offer next day delivery by fedex for the same regular shipping costs thank you Feel free to contact us
Yes
what you see is not complete, there is a connector that is included that has three connecting cables, the positive color is red, the negative is black and a third cable connection that can be blue or yellow that is remote, it will auto stereo, is responsible for turn on and turn off the monitor automatically.
The green cable hooks to your reverse light and will darken your screen if you are not in reverse ( safety feature ) . The monitor will work without the green ( or blue in my case ) hooked up.
Yes
Only 2 look up the reviews on YouTube
Yea
We used a choir mic hanging from the suspended ceiling above the subject.
You would need some video capture software. This is NOT a USB or IP camera.
Yes all the equipment were there
This thing is terrific for larger camera lenses, but . . . My experience is, it doesn't work well for small pocket cameras. Both of mine have this tiny opening created by an (I think) metal iris. The tip of the LensPen will barely go through the opening and you can't move it around, which is required to clean the lens. I had to resort to lens cleaning paper (Tiffen Lens Cleaning Paper Tissue) and solution (My favorite is "Formula MC Lens Cleaner"). But, you must be careful not to get free liquid on the lens.
It goes in the headphone
Yup. No issues with the glasses on.
It has speakers, of course, but they are not in front. They sound as well as any others out there. We have owned this TV for a year and love it!
It should be fine with a wall mount. The mounting holes in the TV or 400mm horizontally and 300mm vertically in the back. Most wall mounts are now set up to take many sizes, but get one for 400mm X 300mm, and you should be fine, with an 80 to 100 Lb rating to be safe.
Yes Maria, they do... they have about 1 1/2 inch adjustment on each side.
yes, I also wind the wire around it to keep it untangled.
For a TV with an HDMI interface this cable will work: http://pdf.crse.com/manuals/4416759111/eng/contents/07/01/01/01.html
My 13yo son got his in September, he uses them a lot and they still look like new.
Just did the testing and the results are very good for you Tucker! These headphones will definitely do the job.
We offer this item in just this one size I do apologize.
Not sure, if it is waterproof exactly, but it sticks well to the back of the aquarium and looks great!
Looks like it would.
I'm not sure how far the screws go in. The TV does not sag. This wall mount has worked well for several years.
Nope, unfortunately not.
They should be compatible with any computer that has a USB port. Brand doesn't matter in this case.
Yes
yes you can plug into any usb and it will work
I'm no expert but I do know LED stands for "light emitting diode" and LCD means " liquid crystal display" It is two different technologies to produce the picture of the TV.
It might, but you need to download and run https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/
It should work.
It has an RCA in jack, but the only outputs it has are the amplified speaker wire ports.
No, it came with it inside.
I have my switch plugged into a plug strip and there is room below the single port switch. I would put it on the top outlet then the bottom outlet should be fine.
No it does not I had a hard time charging the device
hi,our offer is us$32 in total,and we will post with ePacket express shipping,usually arrives within 10~15 working days
4 lbs. I don't agree with all the raving good reviews on this bag. If iI could return mine I would. I just bought a Victorinox bag to replace this one. So if you really want this Targus bag, I'll make you a great deal!
I don't know but I'm a 60+ year old lady and I didn't have any trouble pulling it around or handling it on the plane. I find it's very lightweight when it's empty.
Yes I have the white model and the carying case is white.
Yes
I cannot confirm the Y510, but I have the Y50 (Newer generation Model of your laptop), and it fits just fine.
It is just a base to use any device. I think it is great. It has a good ledge and can place my Ipad at any angle. Go for it!
Don't know why it would not be ... it is an open concept. My mother used her Kindle on it prior to switching to an iPad.
Yes it will operate with that box.
No
Yes, include the Power cord, the batery is excelent, very good laptop.
It fits the Nook first generation. From my perspective, it doesn't look like it can fit any other device bigger than the first generation Nook.
I just use a damp cloth and wipe it down.
Not sure bought as a gift for my sister in law and she has a nook
My Nook measures 8x5 & it fits perfectly
No, it fits the original Nook color 7in.
I would check directly with the Anker website. They're good about answering questions. If it fits your computer, it's a great battery.
Don't know, go to the web site, but it does fit my G62 perfectly so I suspect it will fit your G 72.
yes!
The Adaptor diameter is 1.5" (1.475") and the lenght is 1 5/8". A standard incadescent bulb screws into the adaptor.
I had no problem getting mine registered - even had a brief email conversation with them. The only thing that I can suggest is to make sure that you have pop-up blocker set up in your browser.
The badge appears to be permanent. It cannot "be pulled off" easily.
yes man anything fit ipad2 that can fit new ipad ipad retina. it only NOT fit ipad1 and ipad air
Doesn't look like it.
Yes, the system has a TV Arc setting which allow audio from television to play through system. TV arc doesn't work with all HDMI cables. If TV Arc doesn't work with one cable try another one.
you can find the manual online at shop.panasonic.com page 26 for the information you need
If you check panasonics website and search your tv model # then it will tell you if it's a go or nogo. I have the tcp55st60 and it works amazingly for me
I run mine about the same distance. I too had issues until I figured out my receiver was 1080p and my TV was 720p. Turned on 720p only and bingo. Works great! Maybe check your wireing.
Yes, unlimited nodes (local). SSL VPN nodes are limited to (2), and global VPN clients are also limited to (2). VPN policies are limited to (20).
Yes! I think this will be "easy to use" while still giving any teen-ager interested enough in photography to take a course in it to have numerous options "at the next level." Affordable and I find especially fun to use to get close ups of various shots outside. Good luck.
I don't know either, but if they expect to sell these the information should be there.
I have no idea, but it fit in my Asus G73JW just fine.
I don't know precisely for your Msi, but this is a standard drive, compatible with most laptops. Personally, I just installed it on my computer, a HP, and it was recognized right away.
7D+70-200 L will be fine..
As far as I can tell it's glass. 2 layers that like your polarizer turns and gets darker as the 2 layer interact. Haven't really tried it yet so I can't comment on how well it works. But it goes from a light gray to so dark you can't see though it.
Don't waste your money on this . I has terrible banding when stopped down at all
No, this is pretty much a no-frills keyboard except for the illumination feature.
Good for this use.
I have a Samsung smart tv and a Netgear router, which is in another room. I had a problem with Netflix dropping off line, so I bought this extender and placed it near the tv. It works perfectly. You do have to occasionally reboot the extender -- just unplug and replug it in.
No install disk, but you don't need to touch the modem. There are instructions included, so as long as you can get on the wifi you're trying to extend, you'll be able to set it up.
Go here. http://foscam.us/bracket-f18904w-34.html
I am not sure but my 37" worked just fine.
I believe it will. It is very universal.
I think you'll be OK - I can't measure it accurately because my TV back is covered when the mount is folded. It's close to 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 inches. It's a good mount, and really sturdy. I have a 31 inch mounted to it. Give it a try and return it if it doesn't work.
Yes, we mounted a 32" Sony in a fifth wheel cabinet. The base will swivel and slide out. It will also lock in an out or closed position.
yes it does 100-240V, 50-60hz, 1.20 A
Yes...as it is adjustable. I haven't tried to use it on my iPad mini yet.
Yes. Just be sure not to cover the camera with the arms (I did that the first time I hooked it up)!
No it falls down even with a laptop in it
My thick, nearly 16" thinkpad fit easily. There was still plenty of room for the power source, mouse, headset, a sweater and my snack. I can't verify the maximum size it will fit, but amazon has an easy return policy.
Lok8u has a different product sized for children. This is far too large for a 5 year old
Yes, came with a silver reward, you can choose up to 2 games.
This thing can only fly for 5 to 10 minutes before the battery issues a warning at 20% and it automatically comes down to the ground. Therefore any video would stop after a few minutes, as well. If you only took video and never flew it, it would go for much longer!
I suppose it would run just fine, but at 1333 MHz rather than 1600 MHz.
This ram is 100% compatible with your system. PC3 12800 will run as PC3 10600, so the clock will be slightly slower, but it shouldn't be noticable.
No they pretty good at lasting long. I have dropped them a lot and they still work like they are brand new. To note these are really loud even if you don't have it on the volume all the way up too
Yes it was.
3 x 4
No! It is only used for wide cameras!
Hi: No it does not.
Yes
Yes it can. Would work pretty well for that application. The instructions are not very clear for the item so don't get discouraged if it takes a minute to figure it out. Should work fine.
It uses a conventional DC power source used by most 12V security cams. Example - http://www.amazon.com/HQ-Cam-Accessory-Power-Adaptor-Listed-Regulated/dp/B00L2H8Q7O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419955940&sr=8-1&keywords=security+cam+12v+500ma+power+adaptor
4 to 5 hours depending on use
I don't think so, just ipods
It does have actual USB ports. It also has a SD card reader. They plugs into the header on your system board.
This product will keep out most rain. The seal around the screen protector is positive and does not allow water in. However, I have never allowed it to sit in the rain. I have just had it rained on as I went from one location to another and it did very well in protecting the iPad.
not sure never put it in water
Are you leaving the keyboard on/off switch on all the time? This will cause your battery to drain faster than if you turned the switch off when not using the keyboard. You are not really giving me enough information to give you a better answer. I haven't had this problem, but I always turn the on/off switch to the off position when I'm not using the keyboard.
The ones I received were white. They sound great and play loudly without strain, btw.
If the connector is a micro B then yes it will.
I would assume. Works great on my HTC One. Heavy cable. Good connector.
The one your referring to is not a GoFlex drive which means you can't swap out the connector for a USB 3.0 drive in the event you need to connect that drive to a none thunderbolt drive.
I have one and so far the answer is no. The size wont line up between models for me. Possibly you could use cables to bridge the connection but then the problem becomes the power supply from only thunderbolt not being enough to power the 3.5 inch hd. If i figure out a workaround ill let you know
Yes it does :)
Hi, im not sure about the Bowen mounts becuase I dont have anything Bowen. But it does come with the 7" refelector as shown. It is a great strobe, very strong.
Display adapter sticking out of the second TB port (when TB Base is hooked to computer through TB cable) works fine through DVI, VGA, HDMI Display Adapters to their matching monitor. In other words yes you can daisy chain to normal non TB monitors with Display adapters. You can even chain the bases several times before adapter and monitor.
It should do just great.
I have a super nova and it works gteat regular size
I doubt it, look for a "truck box" they are slim enclosures designed to go into single can trucks. This unit im 99% sure wont fit most single cab trucks
I believe it comes with Powerdvd version 9. It will play some blu-rays, but not all!!! There is a newer version out that will definitely play them all from Cyberlink (Powerdvd 13).
Power cord and computer cable
No it doesn't.
The Netgear XAVB5101 powerline adapter has no wi-fi capability. But if you have a router with wi-fi a laptop could connect to that while you were using a desktop connected to the Netgear.
No they don't, but you mileage may vary depending on how old your wiring is. They do state that performance is better if they're on the same side of the circuit panel.
Sorry, I don't know--I no longer own the monitor.
Yes, VESA Mounting Interface 75 mm x 75 mm
it's good quality. I have been happy with the sound quality. I am not watching movies or tv with it - mostly using it as a computer monitor.
I think it will. My Vizio, not the same model as yours, is closer to 3 years old and the remote works perfectly, even providing more options & things that can be done with the remote. It's worth a try; after all, if it doesn't you can return it. I hope that, if you do get it, you'll like it as much as I like mine - it's so much better than the one that came with the set!
yes
Earphones only unless you have speakers that will work thru earphone connection
Yes, i purchased and it worked well.
Yes perfect
Yes it works. Because of the tight fit, though, you just need to make sure the cover is fully closed. FYI, I've had the case on my 4th Gen iPad for a couple of months now and have found that opening and closing the cover is not a big deal as it has loosened up just enough to make it painless.
Yes, I have an iPad 4 and it fits perfectly. If you check current prices on Amazon, some of the other styles are lower in price as well -- the more expensive styles appear to be exactly the same (from the pictures). Not sure what gives, but if you're not thrilled with the all black color, you may just want to wait a bit and see what happens with the prices.
Yes it does. I often have my Stereo Clip plugged into a USB charger while driving and playing music from my smart phone or tablet via Bluetooth to the car stereo.
No, it is not a stand alone player like a mp3 player or ipod. It's just a dongle that connects or bridge the connection between your phone or tablet to your head unit via aux connection.
Hi T.E. I am sorry that camera takes the VBT190 and VBT380. Unfortunately our factory is still working on those batteries and we do not know when they will be available. Kind regards, Blue Nook
I'm using these batteries with camera model V201. Original battery model is VW-VBK360 and you have to cut one of the 6 plastics. Depending on use, it lasts almost 4 hours.
no there is no room for a separate keyboard in this cover.
No there isnt but this case is the best i have gotten for my ipad 3rd gen. Others dont hold the ipad up right it just falls but this one does thats what we needed
Yes, I believe the information is provided with the light.
Any light stand should be able to support the ring light. Good luck!
Its about 9 inches wide and 13-14 inches long at the base. And like 3 inches short of 4 ft tall
Yes - it fits all except Air -- fabulous product -- never any bubbles
I do not have a ASUS Transformer Book. It would be best to contact the seller or select a case that is advertised to fit the ASUS Transformer Book.
Sorry, I don't have that model. I have the TF-700 tablet and keyboard.
100wh
No, pretty durable and loud, not good for exercising. Everything else, good.
The remote for this TV is for the TV only. You need to get a separate universal remote control if you want to control more than one component.
No
I'm not well versed with Macs, but I have a fairly new MacBook pro and just updated to the newest operating system. Printer works fine, no issues.
new computer or just use your computer and it will just work a little slower.clickfree is very easy and simple to use.just plug it in.great phone support.
Yes it works well with both..... I use it all the time and love it!
I think you will need to buy an adaptor like I did. Apple store has them for $30
Yes
Hi Yanti, here are the compatible Apple devices for the Sony Portable Dock Speakers: iPod touch (4th generation) iPod touch (3rd generation) iPod touch (2nd generation) iPod nano (6th generation)* iPod nano (5th generation) iPod nano (4th generation) iPod nano (3rd generation) iPod classic 160GB (2009) iPhone 4S iPhone 4 iPhone 3GS iPhone 3G iPad 2 iPad Thanks -Vincent
My IPodII charges and plays when plugged in
Fits OK.
The manufacturer of the TonidoPlug is implying that to run the TonidoPlug continuously for one year will cost approximately $5. However, you also have to keep in mind that you'll be installing a storage device. If you use a conventional 2.5" 7200 RPM hard disk, you'll bump that power consumption up by a factor of 2 to 5 times. Of course, if you use an SSD, your power consumption will drop significantly (and so will the generated noise).
Yes, It can support FTP.
It does not work as smooth as the real Canon tripod mount but it works great and costs a lot less. I use it all the time on my 100-400mm lens. The lens does not rotate as freely with the DSLRKIT mount as with the real Canon mount. The DSLRKIT mount is well made and fits the lens properly.
Mine was actually listed as used even though it had never been out of the original packaging. Vendor said they sold it as used so they could price it lower than Yamaha allows their dealers to sell new product.
Party mode works fine. No delays. No other problems. Just like it is supposed to work.
YES !, Big time lag.
Not worth it. Can't be used while charging. Get a taotronics. It's much better
You will need to use a preamp with this receiver, there is no phono input. You can buy a phono preamp starting at about $20. If you don't use a phono preamp, the sound will be very quiet and you'll have to crank the sound all the way up to hear it at all. Some turntables have a phono preamp built in, in which case you won't need one.
Nope. No pre-amp needed. I use an old sony powered sub. Works great.
I ordered a zoom lens. It was not expensive and I could see good use with the lens. I already had a mic from a long time ago so I can 't recommend a mic.
No
Yes,it fit my IPad 1st generation :)
I no longer have the packaging and don't recall the country of origin, sorry.
It's designed only for ipads 1. 2 .3 and 4 generations
The answer is no. This remote is a DISH remote and the SAT mode cannot be edited of even add more programmed buttons. Hope this helps.
Yes. I am using it with my MacMini as I type this response.
you plug the drives into trays so you don't need cables or connectors
Generally the SHR (Synology Hybrid RAID) is the best choice, it gives you certain freedoms that make future changes easier. If you want to be more traditional, a RAID5 option is good, both will allow one HDD failure without data-loss. If you are storing very important data, you might want to look at SHR2 or RAID6 which allows two drives to fail without data-loss. Synology have a handy RAID Calculator to view your various options http://www.synology.com/support/RAID_calculator.php?lang=us
No
I could not get the case on. I'm sorry I could not help you. I do not think it is a good product.
I personally have not experienced this. So far. However I have noticed that sometimes the sound just stops working. It seems to be random and infrequent, but it's definitely an annoyance. Turning off the system and then turning it back on solves the problem, so far, but as you know this setup is not a speed demon and it's a PITA. Does all Samsung tech have a mind of its own? A slightly demented mind?
Yes, I have both a directv unit and a dvd hooked up to it and then the tv. I just don't turn on the receiver if I just want the tv speakers.
call onkyo...there is a fix for this.. they will do it free of charge.
Hard to say from not seeing your connections but your problem seems to be an override of HDMI setup on your computer. If your cabling is correct, and you want to see you PC on your TV through your Onkyo, then you have to switch source everytime you want to use PC or TV. Probably change on your remote for you TV source or the Onkyo. Play with your sources on PC, TV, Onyko, or software. All assumes you have things correctly connected and configured on TV, PC, and Onyko. Good luck.
@ Art.M, TX-NR 818 HDMI handshaking issue happens sometimes if you are using a cheapest HDMI cables or not properly connected between T.V and the receiver, before i bought my Onkyo tx-nr818 i have also a YAMAHA 7.1 receiver that have a fix firmware (theres no way to update) that also had HDMI handshaking issue with my two television but when i used a brand name HDMI cable(not really expensive) the problem gone, that i also did on my Onkyo 818, and look for the latest firmware update, hope this may help you..
It uses 110VAC to 120VAC , 60 Hertz
Metal :)
the door pins
I returned my replacement battery because my Dell 1749 did not recognize the battery. It only recognized a Dell battery.
Yes it is quick connect and disconnect. There is also a screw to keep it in place if u want it for a more permanent placement.
It's got settings for volume and frequency but no remote... It's meant to be used with a sound bar or surround sound and can be controlled by either.
yes we had to replace ours, I got on line and found the video on how to do it. It is easy to replace.
I am not familar with the 201 b1ke. Check 3 things 1.the DC voltage,2 the amps outand the output plug. If DC voltage is the same, the amps are not less than listed for 201( more is fine ) and output plug is same , it will work.
I was using this to send a signal from an Xbox to a tv and a video capture card so that I wouldn't need to power the card to see the games on screen. I had to have the signal go through to the TV before I plugged in the second output for it to work.
If you mean by turning the lights on and off. You will have to unplug it from the wall.
Yes its compatible. I have a Hero 3 and i use 4 of these mounts
If you use a blowdryer on a hot setting, you can slowly melt the adhesive and take it off without any damage to the board. However, you might not want to put it on a rental because the mount will be rendered useless one you take it off. It would be too expensive. An alternative is just using the regular flat adhesive, and use the lanyard and lanyard mount that comes with the floaty backdoor. (use the floaty ALWAYS when in water, regardless of what mount you use.)
If you have a voltmeter or multimeter, you can just plug it in and determine the polarity of the leads that way.
no it does not. And the manufacturer told me that they do not plan to make clamps for the iPad Air. That made it useless to me and I gave it to a friend who has an ipad 3. The product description should state that it does not work with the iPad Air
No, it has attachment for computer only. It plugs into a hub on your computer which in turn gives you 5 hubs instead of one.
Not that we're aware of. The glasses connect to the Samsung television using active shutter technology. You may want to check with the projection manufacturer to see if they have that option available. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Hi Justin, Yes this QNAP does have eSATA connections.
87x110=137" Diagonal it's come, but you can use up to 130" diagonal for the projector screen of 4:3......
Dual slot.
As long as you have wireless internet you will be fine. You do not use cable at all just plug in and register with your wireless password.. Super easy
About 30 min for mine it depends.
Press on and off button down to it turn on.
It has a Mega bass on-off button only. No balance or treble controls for output. Great sound for a small portable unit !!!!
The unit is 6.75" H x 5.75" W x 2" D.
No, this is a new computer to old monitor gadget. There are vga to hdmi boxes on Amazon to do the old computer/new TV trick, i have the etekcity version and it works well.
It definitely should since it's for an m43 mount
Yes, I use it with all my Canon EF lenses on my BlackMagic Pocket Cam and it works well.
Any lens you use will have to be manually focused. If its a canon fd lens it will not work without another converter.
Im not that.tech savy but t does it passes it to the two portable screens that i have in the car
Yes
Frankly, I don't know as I've only used on PCs. Sorry I cannot be of better help here! Kind regards
Contrary to the other answers, when you purchase the Hopper it is an owned device. There is still a monthly fee for the device but you are free to sell it at any time when you deactivate it. As far as the warranty, Dish will replace the receiver at any point if it fails. Just call their main toll-free number or go to a website called SatelliteGuys and Dish has representatives there. -3HaloODST
My bill is $12 for each (rented) Hopper and $7 for each (rented) Joey. It doesn't seem like owning the devices affects that service fee. I would suggest renting 2 Hoppers and 2 Joeys, pairing 1 Joey to each Hopper. It's not much of a price difference ($38 vs. $33) but you don't have everything going through 1 box so you avoid the complaints about freezing and lagging. With our system (1 Hopper with Sling, 1 Hopper, 2 Joeys) we have never had an issue.
I've had no problems with the new battery. I read somewhere that the new battery is a bit stronger and therefore better.
It is the real one but make sure you get the size you want. There is Jambone and Big Jambone.
About 15 feet
yes as long as it has a head phone jack it can connect
No
Yes, absolutely. These headphones have a great bass driver but do not over do it like some of the beats or monster phones. The highs are clear and crisp, mids sound warm, and bass is deep and rich. These are by far some of the best headphones for the price and built to last. The aluminum construction makes sure they do not snap like the plastic ones built by other companies. Check them out in your local audio store and compare them for yourself.
Sound quality is superior to the UE 6000's but both serve different functions. This is a dj headphone meant for djing and beat matching. The UE 6000's is built for comfort and does not swivel. If you are looking for something on a budget and do not need swivel. I'd go for the 6000's. If you're looking for a dj headphone with superior sound and build construction, I would go with the HDJ 2000.
Yes it has all features
contact the seller for a cable or the manufacture 1888 853 3818
I bought it for the Kindle Fire, so it has not been tried on an HD.
I blew my speakers - my fault - got in touch with Wharfedale - and they sent me a new pair. Amazing customer service.
don't no
Yes it will. Just research other neighbors WiFi channels for best performance.
It will work for any Operating System. A router's function is independent of the operating system of the devices on the network. However, I did not attempt to use the CD provided software with Windows 8. I just connected my laptop to it via an ethernet cable, allowed the router to assign (DHCP) my laptop an IP address, then used Firefox and the router's web interface to configure it.
Two USB ports for connecting external hard drives and/or non-wireless printers for network usage. I have 2 - 2TB externals attached to mine. Each of my computers/tablets can connect and open files with no issues.
That is right when you get the hopper your old 222k will not work
It had a remote, but you have to buy the wifi plug. Or you can use the ethernet cable
No
Yes.
It's quite loud~ much louder than my previous laptop. I'm not sure about the quality... It's good for me~
One monitor per plugable only.
Yes it has been set back to factory settings we are quite satisfied with our purchase and would not hesitate to make another purchase.
Hi, thanks mail. About 4 days to shipping is required. Thanks in advance.
Sorry, we don't see provision for bluetooth at this time.
Yes, you can plug an external antenna to the antenna jack on the upper right side of the TV set ( # 17 ) on the instruction manual diagram.
Thanks for your interest It could be replaced, but only by Supersonic
It has strap type mounting kit. I used Velcro its under my drivers seat. I don't know if it would fit under your seat or not you would have to see what space you have and look at the dimensions/specs of the sub.
The transformer controls the flow of electricity, although in more developed countries this isn't really necessary. I Went to Croatia and my friend was fine with just the converter plug, no transformer.
We took this to India Its work Good there.
It only works with the 1Dx or the EOS 1D-C
According to the manual, page 52, the photos show that only the DVI and DisplayPort inputs allow for an Optimal Mode 2650 x 1440 resolution. The HDMI photo shows an Optimal Mode of 1920 x 1080. That seems to jibe with what I've read elsewhere. You can download the manual from Samsung's site (under Support). I'm using the DVI input at the full 2560 x 1440. Hope this helps!
No. Just a wall charger.
http://altegobrand.com/warranty/ You might find your answer, at the url, I provided. However, I do not know if you're covered, if you bought it off Amazon. Amazon unintentionally voids warranties, with some companies. Amazon will void by making you the third party and some companies, like Otter Box, will not honor the warranty. Hopefully this has been helpful. Doesn't hurt to talk to the company. Godbless.
This little player has been great. But the battery takes a few hours (around 1 or 2) without being on to charge fully. If you have exhausted the battery you must plug it in and stop using it. Wierd in my opinion. Still a great unit for the price though.
There is a scenic route that you can select instead of fastest or shortest route. By selecting scenic you take back roads and avoid highways as long as there is another way to get there. We used it to go to Dutch Wonderland, usually takes us about an hour and a half, with the scenic route no highways but it almost took twice as long to get there.
Yes, its an excellent choice. I use my table for notes, Microsoft documents-Polaris Office (word, ppt), YouTube, email, playing games, watching movies and viewing youtube videos. It works great!
I believe so, but you have to buy maps for that area.
Yes you can use it as a optical drive
Yes had no trouble installing or incompatibility issues.
yes it will work with windows 8. i have one on two comps ..no problems
Will not if it has a cover on it I would think.
It came with an a-b usb usb 2 cable. I mounted it high on one wall so needed an extension. I did buy a usb extension cable from BlueRigger (also through amazon.com). I hope this helps.
The question your asking is very vague, if its your asking if you can turn your laptop into a router or wireless hotspot with this then your answer is yes as long as you have more than one device, one for connection to the internet, the other for transmission of wireless service like the signal king, any wifi adapter will work and yes I have done this before several times, here is a link to something like what I assume you're asking http://lifehacker.com/5369381/turn-your-windows-7-pc-into-a-wireless-hotspot
I am not a knowledgeable computer person. I was able to successfully install the antenna using a "driver" downloaded from the internet, after repeated request/complaints to the company. They finally sent the driver identity to me, which resulted in the successful download. I suggest you pester them about it.
it's small and light. We mounted it on my nephews 80" wing span RC plane. Lot of vibration, work great, what a video. I have it mounted on the side of my helmet for trips that I make on my Harley. I don't even notice it on my helmet. It's very easy to attach and remove. It may brake tomorrow, however, I'm well please today.
No, it fits older phones (it fits 4's for sure) and older ipods. The connection is long and flat, not the new kind that is on my mini-ipad.
I would think so. My Wireless unit is on the third floor of my house and I get a good signal in the basement.
This reverse camera does work with non-Kenwood units. The manual does explain that if you hold I think the main button and the Plus button for a few seconds, it will display on your screen a mode where you can adjust the camera and the guidelines. It's in the manual.
We ordered ours in November so we haven't had any problems yet.
I believe it is the same bulb when you take the cover off the back it will have the model of the bulb on the housing
Bulb World 915B403001 for Mitsubishi WD-60735, WD ...
I don't know...I was trying to figure out how to send mines back for the warranty but I don't have the information.
Yes! :)
for all Sylvania 7" 9" and 10" portable DVD player.
I am not sure, it fit the LCD. I did not notice any overlaps, but also I did not look at it too anally. I just wanted a permanent protection.
2' 5/8 x 2'
My camera is a Coolpix 810, and this screen protector is a bit smaller than the LCD. However, when positioned correctly, it works fine and is very durable.
Go online and look at Details for your computer model number and it will tell you the AC PLUG size i.e. 3.5mm or the correct size.
That is a good question. I have had it for 5 months and it's still running on the same battery.
Yes it can. That's what I used
Yes it will. I'm using Chrome OS.
don't buy it it was horrible mine did not work at all and I never got a refund for it as for using it for a galaxy s5 I wouldn't even risk because that'll be 20-30 dollars at your pocket
Yes, There was a Crossfire adapter in the box.
Hi Tom. Im not sure if it will, but here's a link you can read on to understand the card better. Click on the Features tab somewhere below. Scroll down to the bottom and read point 1. http://products.xfxforce.com/en-us/Graphics_Cards/AMD_Radeon%E2%84%A2_HD_7870/FX-787A-CNFC. Cheers!
Well I can say for sure that it does NOT work on a K53E MB...I was disappointed. If your original keyboard wasn't backlit, chances are that it wont work for you either.
I had the same problem myself, turns out I ordered the wrong model, even though the two keyboards looked identical and had the same connecting wires, the laptop didn't recognize it and caused input errors.
Not sure about the mac issue, I use a PC. It will work with a printer if the printer is bluetooth enabled. I personally haven't seen any that are, there are a lot of wifi enabled printers, not sure about the bluetooth....
You will need a separate card for wireless internet capabilities.
7.5 long X 6.8 high X 4.5 wide the length and height are depended upon how it is angled when mounted to get your desired view.
No, this is only a bearing to enable your crane to rotate freely (and very smoothly).
Yes--I've confirmed this case also fits the Canon S90 camera.
I'm not sure, I have a 40" and it just fits
No crossover just inline capacitor for tweeters
Unless you buy an item specfically marked "used" or "refurbshed", you should expect a new in box product which includes all parts an accessories. This goes for all products on Amazon, not just this one. Answer here...
You'll get half the output, not recommended but won't hurt anything.
I doubt from the seller, but the HD is easily accessible. It would be as possible as for any other laptop.
Yes
this mount came with all the screws i needed. I have switched tvs since i have bought this mount too. I started with a 42 LCD and now have a 46 LED.
it fit my 42 inch old plasma which was very very heavy so you should be fine
After initiallizing your wifi repeater, you can hide your SSID from broadcasting. I personally found out in my unit when I did this, it would emit a weaker signal. I also recommend changing your router channel to 1 or 6 or 11 for a more stable setup.
This is a knock-off of a very popular, and much more expensive, Manfrotto camera mount. I have several of these and have mounted them on all of my tripods, monopod, jib/crane, etc. Because of the differences in camera mounts from various tripod/monopod manufacturers, this makes all of my devices universal. I have the mounting plate part of this device on the bottom of all my cameras and I never have to stop to change fittings. I am not familiar with the Dynatran ATH-918 specifically, but this device has been able to mount on every 'pod I have.
Sounds like your cord has gone bad. Happened to me recently as well. I changed my review to reflect this.
Sorry, I have never used a mini port but the HDMI on my LCD is great
While I am certainly not an expert by any stretch, my laptop is an HPG62-347 NR and I purchased this battery several months ago. My understanding is that this 9-cell battery is stronger and will last longer than the original 6 cell that the computer came with. The number listed on my original battery was for a 6-cell. The 9-cell took some manuevering to get it to stay in place but now that it's in, it works quite well. It holds a charge much longer than the original 6 cell.
Hi this battery is in effective. At full charge...the battery dumps the charge and computer shuts down immediately. I am not happy at all with this battery.
No. I've seen non Oem batteries do exactly this. No true interactions with the equipment, I.e. no real battery levels indication, freezing, etc
Didn't measure box but it fit perfect under the back seat of a 2006 F150 crew cab.The box fits JL Audio 10w3 is perfect
Yes, you can use it with the iPad mini. It is adjustable.
You can choose shortest, fastest, and a compromise between the two. Most importantly, you can tell it to avoid interstates and/or toll roads altogether.
Yes
I'm not sure what you mean by 1/2 height, but it does come with full-height and low-profile PCIe brackets. I have my card installed in a low-profile PCIe slot.
I did a quick search on Amazon for 'nextbook 10se car power and found at least one available - I didn't scroll through all the results but the one I found first was from a company called Upbright. Hope this helps - John
No manual comes with the tablet, but I think it is available online.
Yes.
I haven't tried with that. I've worked with Ipod, Ipad, Iphone, Samsung Galaxy, Blackberry and I had no problems
No , you can't use keyboard
Not PayPal but square will work.
It has a regular camera mount. You'd have to get an iPhone adapter for a tripod to get it to work.
Mine came in a nice MSI box, not perfect condition but it was in the original packaging
Yes this MSI AMD Radeon HD 7950 is crossfire ready. Sli is for Geforce cards only but this does have one bridge connector.
i never received my own still waiting lucky you got yours
I have the un55es7100 and it works fine. plug and play.
I think it definitely would work since we have a Samsung 46" smart tv. Works great and Skype is very clear. also portable enough that you could move it around the room to other people if needed. We have our on a wall stand that moves but it only sits on the tv.
Yes. However, only use this model if you wear eyeglasses. If you don't wear glasses buy one of the smaller models so it won't block as much of the viewing screen.
no you need square eye cup
Yes it supports 3d and essentially all audio options are supported
I do not know. But, Samsung is very responsive to email inquires about technical issues with their products.
The issue I had with this receiver is it clips very early, it will work for what you want. However, just a suggestion I would not go with a hi phonics amp on Rockford subs. Spend a little extra and get a good quality amp. I personally would go with a Rockford amp since Rockford subs.
3M called today admitting they have no cables to connect the MP220 projector to a computer for screen output. I had ordered the cable from their website as an accessory for the MP220, but they sent the cable for the MP410 (they say they will make a refund). Amazon sells various cables that fit various 3M projectors, but compatibility is ambiguously described. According to the 3M Europe website, the correct VGA cable is: 3M ID 78697200307
No, there's a standard SVGA computer monitor input. I believe the descriptor is DB15. I bought a converter to take the BNC from our cameras to SVGA for the REVO monitor.
Yes.
Yes, if you check out Ideal Security's website for SK642 and click on "Product works with" under Technical Support it lists SK616 along with other accessories. http://idealalert.ca/ideal/securityprotection.php?category=securityProtection&type=wireless_products&product=SK642
I have not. On the front of the radio, it does not say that it will, either.
Nothing that I can see, both seem to be 120 watt. Beware, with this bulb the picture was very dim compared to previous bulbs I've used.
Mine was dim from the get-go, so I didn't bother trying to get another one. Get a name brand bulb from someone reputable.
The radio is a double din radio so if the is double din it should fit perfectly. I did a quick chick on another website and it appears as if the 2003 g35 is a does have a double din system.
I really dont know, I have a Toyota. Thi thing is that I dont recomend Pioneer. theyre Service politics are so bad!!!!
I use the case it came with and stick it in my notebook bag wherever I go. So, i've never looked for a hard case for it. You might be able to find a camera or tablet case that it will fit in. Have you looked at those options?
The Pioneer AVHP8400BH does not have an HDMI port. It does have the standard RCA inputs and out for rear seat monitors.
I am not sure what you mean. It's a double DIN size. Meaning it meets the standard for any double DIN application. I hope that helps in some way.
It can be wall mounted or set on a counter space. It comes with wall mount brackets, and a rubber 'foot' if you want to set it on a surface. The speaker sounds really good.
Yes, it comes with two ac adapters, one is a single plug, the other has a "Y" cable to charge two units at once.
Only one person can talk at a time but both the other units will hear. The way they work, when the button is depressed it is in transmit mode and when released it goes into receive mode. So if two people are pressing the buttons at the same time they will not be able to hear what the others are saying.
Sounds like a flaw in the remote's circuit board. The leftmost power button (red) should always turn the receiver on or off, even if you are using the universal remote function to control other components. I would contact Pioneer to get the remote exchanged. Hope this is helpful.
Sorry, it comes with only one fixed length, however, you can add wires to the end of the kit to increase the total length, if it is needed.
If it see any trouble it will kill all power. Love mine! I'm sure it has saved me money from bad power.
Wires down. However, I'm on my second pair (first pair stopped working), and the second pair also stopped working. That said, the company was great in replacing defective initial broken pair. I love the functionality and the price so much, I plan on taking my chance with a third.
They go about 30 feet.
About 5-6 ounces
For protecting purpose it is doing well! but Indo not think is is light and beautiful. Whatever, it is competent as a cover, especially for the price. Hope this can help you.
Your question doesn't make any sense.
No, you need a Toshiba 19V 6.3A
I really don't know, sorry.
You need to check your current power supply and make sure this power supply is the appropriate replacement. Click on the link for the new power supply and it will list the old power supply it replaces.
As far as I can tell these are gx12 connectors, panel mount and female: http://www.amazon.com/GX12-4-Screw-Mounting-Connector-Aviation/dp/B00H8RECHA/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1410315441&sr=8-4&keywords=aviation+connector+gx12, male: http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Metal-Thread-Aviation-Connector/dp/B00K7ZY0VS/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&qid=1410314794&sr=8-15&keywords=aviation+connector+gx12
Not sure this will help but I didn't worry about wiring it to automatically come on in reverse but rather to a toggle switch so I can turn it on when ever I need it and it will stay on if you don't line it up exactly right and have to pull forward and back again. Simple install power from the battery to a toggle, then power from toggle to the unit. Easy as pie.
I don't stream anything, but I don't see why the TV Ears wouldn't work because whatever audio is coming from the TV is sent to the TV Ears. It doesn't make any difference what you're watching.
It comes with a North American plug style with rca cables.
Yes. I have a 2nd generation IPAD 2 and it fits perfectly.
HONESTLY I HAVE NEVER TRIED THIS ON MY PHONE
Yes, it is for ASP (cropped) format cameras like 60D. It is not designed for full frame cameras like 5D II. It's f/2.8 would be very helpful.
Yes the lens works with the D7100. Awesome combination as this what camera my wife uses the lens.
Yes, the ipod 5th generation will fit there and Definetly No! It will not fit in a bagpack.
Peggy - unfortunately only for iPhone 4/4s
It dodnt work for my lg 2 so im not sure
This is a bad product, don't work
Wall charger included. Battery is charged while in the camera, so it's a little inconvenient if you have a spare battery.
No, they are not bluetooth.
It doesn't come with a mic.
No but you can get a free version from appstore
Yes. I have watched many hours of shows through Netflix with this tablet. I connected it to my phone's hotspot and watched movies while on guard duty. I think the picture quality is very good, but you will want to use headphones for sound.
It should work on anything because there's no software and the earpiece is also a mic. It just records whatever you're hearing on a call. I've used it with my iPhone, iPad, my daughters Android phone and with land line phones and it's worked with all of those.
Yes it will.
yes, and an LED when on.
yes, and an LED when on.
Yes, you can plug it into the headphone jack
Hi. No this will not fit the Dell XPS 13. I bought this based on reviews stating it does fit, but the one I received was too large and I had to return it.
You have you press the button and slide the cover to the side ( not pull) slide
I am going to wait. Had the TF201, but sent back because of the GPS issue. The two factors making me wait are the lack of Gorilla Glass and the brightness of the display (not the resolution). I plan on using it heavily outside, and both of these can make a significant difference when out of doors.
Yes has total of 5 if you would like to add a sub.
no. the router is faulty as is the system. Read the reviews.
No.
I have 3 case fans and a CPU fan, you should be fine.
Yes
Have not tried. Call Manufacturer.
Most likely it will work. Here is a site with the specs to your power supply http://www.outletpc.com/bx7516.html. Yours is a 300 Watt power supply and this one is 400 Watts. The only limiting factors are physical size (measure yours and compare) and output connectors (wires). The connectors and wire on the 400 ATX are long and should be sufficient to reach all your peripheral devices.
Lens hood comes off.
Hello. The lens adapter (not pictured) is a small black barrel looking piece. This adapter attaches over the existing Sony camera lens. It attaches via a tightening mechanism that is done with a small L shaped tool that's included. Then, after you tighten this adapter, it will provide threading on the end. Here you will attach the lens. Thank you
Yes hold down the play button
No battery, it fully charges with a usb cord and I cant tell you how long it will run off of a charge because it has never run out of juice before my kids were done. It is really good, I actually want to buy 2 more. Hope this helps
Hey,no not really,just has a bigger sound then the built-in speaker my iPod has,but is good for the shower n when we cooking,ok sound for the price
Yes it shuts on and off when the cover is closed.
Yes, it fits very well as advertised
Hi AK, if your Sony Alpha SLT-A57M uses the 18-135 mm lens, this one has a filter diameter of 62 mm. It is also mention on your filter about the size ( B+W 62mm Clear UV Haze with Multi-Resistant Coating 010M). This Front Lens Cap ALCF55S is 55mm which means that it will not fit in. -Ely
Yes
Yes. i didn't hace problem
This is a great bag for man but I don't think a Mac will fit of 15
Hi Charles as a computer technician I can tell you that SATA is backwards compatible. So SATA II and SATA III will work in a SATA I the only difference is the max throughput that you will see for read/write performance. I do believe that E-Machine does have SATA ports on it. Secondly to see best performance you would need to install a SATA II or III controller for maximum performance. I installed a SSD drive in my mothers notebook and it's only SATA I it is only about half the performance in my desktop which is SATA III.
This is a great reliable drive to use in a ps3. I can't imagine it wouldn't work in a PS4 since it's a standard 2.5" drive. I use it to store all of my movies and watch them on the ps3. As far as loading times with games, I don't think it's any faster than the drive that came in my ps3. I highly recommend the drive. Just don't expect any speed increases with it.
Yes, if you are using an OS that will work with that large size. I had to upgrade WinXP with a MS add-in. Win7 was just fine.
I am running two UHS-1 cards -SanDisk Ultra 64 GB MicroSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory I have not formally benchmarked them but transfer using a USB 3.0 port is much faster than a 2.0 port.
It works with my MacBookPro perfectly. The connection is plugged into my extra USB port and instantly worked with the mouse!!! Worth a try!!!! I love it!!!.
The older model Logitech 305 (which I currently have) works great with Windows 8 which is installed on my Laptop. Thinking this is a 325 is a newer model, it should work with Windows 8.
Irish Eyes, The USB dongle is tucked away in the battery compartment. Just open the battery compartment on the bottom of the keyboard and you'll see it.
Yes. I used this with a Windows 8 tablet.
Did you download the "latest" driver off of the AMD webite? Try setting your resolution to the highest and check you refresh rate as well
found this forum post. according to it: "...a minimum of a 500 Watt or greater power supply." www.tomshardware.com/forum/348776-33-radeon-7850
Most likely it would be a very tight squeeze, this card is very long, although it isn't as wide as some of the Asus versions of this card it is still a good size. There are several you tube videos out there that would give you a much better idea of the size.
It doesn't come with a converter that I remember but those are very inexpensive. It has a dvi, a hdmi and 2 micro hdmi ports. I don't know about which is better for gaming, but I know that any benefit you would gain from a dvi will be lost if you convert it to vga. I suspect that hdmi might be faster then vga, but honestly unless you are a razor-edge, 99th percent pro gamer that the difference is entirely negligable. I certainly don't notice a difference between dvi-to-vga and hdmi. Hope this was helpful.
On the package it says it is Windows 8 ready. But, I would double-check at the Gigabyte website.
this does work, I bought it a few years ago and it's still working fine
Yes it does ,ive built 6 of these now with that exact memory!
Probably not -- it's server memory.
I don't know, but it does a pretty good job recording audio through it's own microphone. It picks up what is said in the front seats very clearly.
dont see why not it has read and worked with any mPCI i have tried so far.
yes, you can,I used mine that way for a while but I would suggest that you wrap the drive in some like a static bag if using a metal case.
Yes - the slot is the same, but the back clip that holds it down is too far back to hold it. Nothing a little tape can't fix.
Sorry, I just use it on my 6D as a regular flash.
Yes you can. It needs some very little configuration. You should be able to do it following the set-up instruction. I use it for similar concept.
I really don't know. I plugged in at the office to hear the books I purchased, and will use batteries if necessary when there is a power outage to keep abreast of things.
They fit my Contour +2, not sure about the camera you are asking about. I tend to run my batteries completely flat and then charge them so having three on rotation works well for me and they seem to have lasted all summer, several charges. That being said, we all know how quality control works these days...
My best guess is that your module is burning up battery because it is polling (looking) for your wireless server.
no, but these speakers crackle like crazy. i sen them back & purchased Logitech Speaker System Z623 & they are way better...a little more expensive but sound & quality are far superior. The only way that the Cybers sounded good was when they were cranked so far up that the sound washed out the feedback. But if you are going for any volume less than dance party...they don't sound good...good luck!
No
I do not think you can unscrew the stand I don't see anywhere to do that... my desk and its upper shelves have somewhat of a curve to them and I velcroed the side of the speakers to the end of the curve on each side at ear level ( sitting down) and the sound is incredible, so much better than having them in front of you .. With Velcro the will stay in the side if u are lying them down
Unless they have updated it mine has old ipod /iPhone dock. It does cone with remote. Also unlike other beats products that don't sound that great this thing has great sound. I think you can buy iPhone adapters though for the new style.
Yes.
No it doesn't work
Yes. It is compatible with all i-phones and i-pods. It has a movable hookup so that you can even dock your i-phone with a case on it; the only exception is an Otter case. Btw, this machine has fantastic sound quality!
Dont know for sure, but they are very similar , i used to own a 7200 till i killed it droping it into a pool, i would bet they would work together
Usually around 6-8 hours. I've never had the battery die on a full days use.
Yes, Philips does allow you to pair two of the SHOQBOXs in a stereo pair.
No it is nice for around the pool or on a boat that has a trolling motor but not a very noisy area
I've never used it with a phone. However, it charges the iPod, so I assume it charges the phone too.
The official answer from Olympus: Compatible: E-PL6 / E-PL5 / E-PL3 E-PM2 / E-PM1 /OM-D E-M5/ OM-D E-M1
The Samsung 2 10.1 does NOT fit in this case. This case is made for 7.0 or smaller. It is very nice and durable.
Yes, standard eye glasses fit just fine.
Dear Customer, Thank you for your question regarding our BTD-400 Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter. Yes, the software installed with the BTD400 drivers includes all of the standard Bluetooth profiles, like A2DP and HFP. Please contact us at support@kinivo.com if you have any additional questions.

Yes
I don't have a filter adapter/filter but I can tell you that there is about 1/4" to 3/8" more room under the lens bubble than is needed for the stock arrangement. So long as your accessory doesn't add more than that amount to the lens length you should be Ok.
Yes
No other cables. HDMI .
No, it only works with the 4 model. I wouldn't recommend this product anyways, lasted for about 2 weeks then broke.
No it just plugs right into the outlet and that's it.
The seat-back holder just "holds" the ipad. If your ipad works with the bluetooth connection now, it will continue to work when it is in the holder.
Each one uses 0.45W had them a while and they still work great
This will only work on the car radio if there is an iPod dock pre-installed in the car.
no, it will not work with 1st generation you might need the Scosche dock passport adapter, but even with that sometimes doesn't work, if your Bose Sounddock charges your iphone it will work for you whitout the need for adapters
Very poor quality don't ever buy again . Pls don't wastage your money for this product .
it does charge but in order to play music you have to use the 3.5mm jack. it is not at all like an ipod where one cable does it all. you have a mini usb to charge and a 3.5mm to play the music..
This particular model fits 2010-2011 Prius. Thre might be a different model that will fit to Tundra.
i like to know to.I bought the as51 which is 200.00 more then the as71.maybe i will send this back and get my money back and buy the as71.Did you get an answer on your question.Thanks.
It will but the only problem to be honest is the waiting time to download stuff the WiFi antennae is not strong so you need to be very close to the connection and also it can lag alittle sometimes but i've dealt with it and it's perfect other then that :]
As long as your trying to hook-up this adapter to a female end u also have a converter for your phone as It will provide power and covert the Video/Audio over
I do not know why the listing states that the item is currently unavailable. I was able to go to the listing & click the 'new' button, and then you should be able to purchase it from there, as we do have guaranteed stock available on this item. Thank you. RageCams
Would like to know too
Yes, there are mounting brackets included that allow for vertical or horizontal placement (and adjustment of speaker direction).
This is a complex structure. It comes fully assembled and is one piece. I assume you want to know how big of a camera will fit inside it's inside dimensions. Inside it measures 18mm w x 12mm h x 5mm deep.
I use a 7D and you can access the battery with it, so I assume a t4i would be the same.
You can use the shoulder mount with the cage using the 1/4 20 screw from the shoulder brace to tighten onto the cage.
Make sure all your connections are connected correctly and be sure that your antenna is in the right location and seated in the unit. If that doesn't work check to see that your GPS card is seated correctly in the slot on the lower right hand side, in front, of the unit. If you still have problems you may have to return the unit for a replacement.
Yes... it will work, but you will regret it. Besides you are going backwards, I just bought the JBL NAV system for my Venza 2012 XLE. This system is not as described, the steering wheel controls does not completely work with all steering functions, keep it real buy genuine Toyota parts. To completely have the system working perfectly and not losing resale value keep the JBL system, do not make this mistake. It is not worth your time. I hope this help.
This card does have SATAIII as well as USB 3.0. The case I got was http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B009GXZ8MM/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1, which has 2 USB 3.0 front panel ports.
I am using two eight gig sticks, but I do know that it is indeed compatible with eight gig sticks as well. It's a great motherboard, by the way. Couldn't be happier.
Well I didn't do that, but you can downloadowners manual from msi web page. However this isexcellent mainboard.
You can use either operating system with this motherboard.
I actually have it hooked up to an LG TV and it came with everything I needed. To me it does sound MUCH better than the TV speaker.
YES
1/1/4 thick, 3 high, 2/18 deep, with the ac plug closed.
Do not buy it, broke the same day I received it. Whatever they tell you, they are lying.
I want to say it was plastic but not positive.
Old version of it. They won't be updating it. Nor will users be able to buy from adobe. Just rent the CC (Creative Cloud but I call it cash cow).
I have rev 1.1 and am running with WIN8. I just had 2 SATA ports go bad but Gigabyte was excellent doing fix with very quick turnaround.
As windows vista came after XP, and windows 7 uses vista tech, then I see no reason why it should not. But why go back to that old version of windows when 7 works just fine.
I dont have the board anymore, but note that the board SOFTWARE support for X-Fi via the THX TrueStudio Application and Creative Alchemy. I dont use it though as I am using a Asus Xonar DX in my PC.
Well, as long as you have a sufficient power supply, I don't see why not...although I have just one evga 660 installed at the moment.
Yes, that is essentially how I am set up with this board.
No
Yes!
I have an iPad 3 and it fits.
Voltage is 12V
I'm not sure of my model but I Googled and this looks just like mine except mine is black. It works in mine so it should.
I don't see why it wouldn't but watch out it verrrrrrrrrrrrry fast
yes. I have it working on a pentium core duo. It did speed it up a bit but the great leap in speed came when I upgraded to Windows 8. I have 3 hard drives, the 120, a 1 Tb and a .5 Tb
Yes indeed! A very nicely built collar it is too.
.....not sure, I'm using it with a prime Canon 200mm 2.8 L lens... with a Manfrotto QR plate, well built, great fit
Dawn, It works with my Ipad so I dont' see why it wouldn't work with your Kindle Touch e-reader. Anything that has a bluetooth capability will work with this JAM.
Does your MacBook Air have a jack for head phones? You can use a double sided aux cord.
It works with anything that has blue tooth connection...
They screw onto headphones that have a 1/8 inch male see if theres a threading where the cord connects to the end
No
I don't think so. It's been a couple years since we unboxed it, but I'm pretty sure it didn't come with a remote. I assume it has a timer? But we've never used it.
Doesn't have the wifi option, but has not stopped me from loving this camera...takes few extra minutes to download to my mac. Just look at my pictures by looking up the DMC-GF5KK camera. Same camera, but with the manual zoom. I took the northern lights picture, as well as a few others there. This camera is easy to use..the touch screen is not as sensitive as your smartphone, but I think that is a good thing, because you wouldn't want to accidentally touch it slightly and change a setting.
I haven't had that problem. The only real problem has been actually seeing whether you are on video or single shots while underwater
Intova Sport HD has no built-in flash.
That part of the model number tells you about the lens. The lens with the GF5X is an upgraded model.
The RCA output jack is for the subwoofer only. L, R, center, and surround L&R are simple bare wire hook up. Yes, you will need to wire in a RCA jack for the sub. Shielded cables are always better with any audio application.
Go online to denon and ask the same question, corp is very good for a quick response.
No, this lens will not cover a full frame.
I did have some issues linking a console (PS3) and the Denon... audio lag audio and other stuff... i managed to left everything right connecting Audio via optic cable and video through HDMI. Hope This helps!
Like a cherry wood.
You need to buy a wireless adapter. This is what I used. Gigabyte GC-WB300D 1Mbps/2Mbps/3Mbps Data Rate Exclusive Bluetooth 4.0/Wi-Fi Expansion Card Motherboard. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0081Y0Y4E/ref=oh_details_o08_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I use it with windows 8 and it works fine
Yes, absolutely. It works with all multimedia applications.
Hi, there is a sticky pad inside the cover. You can easily paste your tablet on it. It works very fine actually by sucking your tablet firmly, and it is also easy to remove the tablet from the case.
Yes. See: http://www.sandisk.com/products/usb/drives/cruzer-switch/
The bulb should have no effect on HD, but I'm not a technician. I have replaced five bulbs on my tv, no problems. This is normal. I will say the last bulb I got from a supplier that guaranteed a year for it and it has lasted more than a year, so I will use them again. Actually should go ahead and order another. Have you checked to see if your higher channel numbers are HD? My low numbers are analog, higher HD. Call your cable company.
Yes it would, you would need the a park brake bypass and the double din bezel
I don't have these on radiators so I'm not sure. Sorry.
Yes, they would work just fine. I use two of them for the same purpose and have not had any issues.
The only way you hear them is getting thw fan close to your ear
The speakers' range are as great as your router. As long as your phone or tablet can see the network in that area, the speakers will see it too. The speakers have 7.5 watts powering each driver, so 15 watts total.
AC
Like an original. Very happy with mine. Bought it some months ago. No problems.
I use it on two computers. I haven't looked at their legal notice in years, but it used to authorize usage on two computers, which has always worked out well for me, since I usually use our desktop for planning and transfer the map to our laptop for travel and on the road updates.
I loaded it on my regular computer and on my LapTop.
One license, can be on desktop and laptop but only for one user.
Not as it comes. You should visit the Microsoft site, I understand they no longer support MapPoint. I found the zip codes available were woefully out of date.
Yes
Yes it is and it's working pretty well with my current build so far no issues and I haven't even overclocked as of yet so when I do it will be interesting to see how it performs hope that was helpful
The monitor has a connection for an HDMI cable which means that it can connect to a standard cable box with almost no hassle. http://www.timewarnercable.com/en/residential-home/support/faqs/faqs-equipment-and-instruction-manuals/hookup-diagrams/hdmi-diagram.html
24" diagonally, 11" vertically, 21" horizontally. Be advised: this does not have a built-in camera nor are the internal speakers very good. We purchased a cheap stand-alone camera and added speakers. The best thing about this item is it's HD color.
It is full viewing from top to bottom, side to side. Very clear picture.
According to the specs on the ASUS website, a full 24" (61.0cm.). Haven't broken out the measuring tape... Hope that helps
Yes it will handle it. Be sure you use guy wires though. Excellent product.
This battery is the same exact battery that works in both the ZS19 and ZS20. Both cameras are exactly the same except for the ZS20 having the GPS function that lets you know where the picture was taken.
according to the mfg,"max gain uhf 10.4 dBi, vhf 3.1 dBi." You can also contact Antennas Direct: their customer service is quite good.
It does.
Dimensions 100 x 69.85 x 7mm http://www.adatausa.com/index.php?action=product_specification&cid=3&piid=171
It should come with a 3 year warranty, mine did. I have had my drive for a year now and have had great service from it with no problems at all.
Sata Cable No, mounting bracket yes, I would buy Intel or Samsung tho, this drive failed on me
uATX Form Factor (Micro ATX) 9.6 inch x 9.6 inch ( 24.4 cm x 24.4 cm ) http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/P8Z77M/#specifications
It should be compatible with dell 660. Its a micro comptatible board and has hdmi and a built in sound card. As far as windows, its vista and windows 7 compatible for sure I never put windows 8 on it yet. I personally have a fourth gen i7 quad core and it runs beautifully. As long as the chipset is an lga1155 it should be fine. If you need any suggestions on what to use or put in your machine just feel free to contact me.
Yes, as well as any other LGA 1155 based board. All you have to do is match the LGA socket requirements (1155 in this case) between any CPU and motherboard then you're good to go.
It's an Intel board, so no. Find a board with a chipset that takes AM3.
Yes
It is but you won't be able to use the 6gb sata port because it will cover it up. This will only be a problem if you want to use an ssd for your system drive because ssd's should only be used on a 6gb port.
Armband? I just put this in my swimcap.
Yes, I have it on now.
No, it is only for the 14mm pancake or the 14-42mm PZ lens.
Round, they are not flat at all.
It's designed to fit all nuvi models, so yes. And you'll have plenty of room to fit the power cord, suction mount, and even more.
the projector does not have a zoom feature. you have to move the projector to make the image larger or smaller. I use mine hooked up to my ipad, and then I can zoom in or out as much as I need. if you hook it up to your computer you could also zoom it.
It works with HP G6 laptop but won't fit correctly. When you are mobile with your laptop just be ready to catch your battery from falling out. You can use it still just not a perfect one.
I have a pavillion DV5, worked famously.
Hard to tell but would guess that keyboard would break before any damage to iPad would happen. This is just from looking at design and how it fits the iPad. Great little keyboard so to be safe...just don't drop it.
I don't remember having a felt arrow attached to my battery roll. If it looks like it can be removed, I'd remove it. I know that in other electronic devices I've purchased I had to remove a plastic insert to activate the battery. If in doubt, call the company. I believe there is a number in the instruction booklet that came with the keyboard. Sorry I can not be more help.
Hmm...I have never used it for that, so I don't know. I know there is a USB port on the back and it comes with a charging cord for an Android micro USB device. It also comes with an audio jack so you can listen to your stored music or internet radio through the clock's speakers.
All items were included in the package as advertised
1. No, You have call the company for that answer. 2. yes . you can view recording. 3. yes you can view live video remotely if you want it that way I keep mind on video recordings, if two or three days it delete inself started over for other dated and times .
Instruction book explains. Very simple procedure.
Regular size card.
Yes
The part number for the HDS-7 gen2 bundle is 000-10869-001. That is the one that is covered under the $300.00 rebate from Lowrance. Thank you,
There are 2 transducers with this unit, the sonar transducer which looks like the standard from Lowrance. The other transducer is for the HD structure and side scan, it is about 11 inches long, half round, and designed to mount flush with the bottom of your hull.
I don't know about the 2009 Mac pro, but I have the 2009 mini Mac and it DOES NOT support Audio via HDMI cable. you can browsing Apple web site http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3476. At first I thought the cable was bad, but when I read the manual my Mini mac does not support sound via HDMI.
Is this the model you own? https://support.apple.com/kb/sp618?locale=en_US If so, your laptop supports Mini Displayport. Thanks!
yes it does. i have no problems with it. i love it
It's really made for using the enclosed sleeves. (Plenty of room for the booklets etc.). You could technically fit CDs in jewel cases in there but it wouldn't be pretty. I'm not sure how many you could fit in to the case, but again it's not really designed for that. (With CD's with booklet/cover in sleeves it fits between 700 - 800 CDs)
Yes, it does. Many new boards will as well.
I have a Dell Inspiron 1545 and this power supply works great. My original cord had gotten caught under a rocking recliner and needed to be replaced. The thing about this one is that it's 19.5V - like the one Dell sent out with the 1545 originally. Watch out for "weaker" rechargers. This one has been great for me. I'm using it right now.
If it's a Dell laptop it should work just fine unless that model has a different plug for some reason.
Its sort of slim. I got exactly what the product picture looks like.
speed should not matter, though I can't vouch for Nexus 7 compatibility
you would have to be on a plane with eithernets, jacks alav for people flying , which I ve never seen, whether you have air plane mode on ,or off does not matter kal.
It's for 2 din DVD player
No, you lose factory sat radio and most of the steering wheel functions.
Hello, I received FujiFilm Finepix S4500 model with all the accessories of the image, the make my purchase in late February 2013
It will work without problem, just buy the Nikon mount and it will work the same way as what you already have with your Nikon lenses.
Yes 0 gauge is what I'm using 2
I would say yes it can! Mine is at 1 ohm on 2-15 kicker cvr amp is only about 1/4 of the way up and they are about to fly out the box!!
ONE, unless you use adapters for multiple inlets to another single outlet to the unit
It should work with anything that has a USB port. It just allows you to plug more devices into it.
Yes, but you would need an adapter... such as the following. http://www.amazon.com/3-5mm-Stereo-Female-Y-Cable-6-Inch/dp/B000I23TTE/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1420000279&sr=8-2&keywords=RCA+to+3.5mm+female
It is a black plastic, but high level. Looks nice, not cheap. Wood base.
The Craig HDMI Portable DVD Player 1080P Model CVD401a that I purchased has a separate power adapter that converts 110-240 VAC to 5 vDC 1.2 Amp. Power consumption is rated at 7.5 W. The video output is RCA video and audio as well as three RCA component video and RCA audio and also HDMI video and audio.
I don't think so. With the very low cost of this excellent device it doesn't really cost too much extra to to buy an entire unit. I have purchased replacement remotes before, and they cost nearly as much as this entire player. However, you could get a universal remote they do contain codes for the Craig player. After a lot of use, I still recommend this versatile player.
No, unfortunately, this particular Sylvania CD Player does not come with an MP3 capability.
This is the adapter you need: http://www.amazon.com/Fotasy-NAC-E-Mount-Camera-Adapter/dp/B003XQIRPS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1424150245&sr=8-3&keywords=adapter+cine+lens+to+sony+e+mount You might also find any other adapter, just look for "adapter cine movie lens to sony E-mount". However, be aware that this lens does not cover the whole sensor of your camera, since it is smaller than the sensor, so that it creates a Vignetting that covers about 1/3 of the APS/C image which is your camera's sensor. Take a look at some pictures in the reviews to understand it.
Yes, perfectly
It's able to pick up people standing about 4-6 feet away, or at about a 6-8 person conference table. I haven't tried much beyond that, but it works perfectly at least at that distance.
Plug and play.
Hi Cyndy, the battery you reference is a replacement generic battery, and its not the Original Toshiba brand - hence the price difference. Both will work for your laptop just fine
yes but I bought a a small partible boom box speaker that echarges with computer port. Great sound like stereo set
Theoretically one can use an adapter, there is a plug. However my new unit will not play with one. Very disappointing.
I'm not sure what you're asking? If it's to 'burn' an MP3 song onto a CD, I believe you would have to have the proper equipment (ie, from MP3's on your computer to an applicable disc drive. As of itself, this would not happen using this player alone. And, then you would have to have 'bought' the songs on your MP3. Does this answer your question?
Item will ship from Austin,TX Thank you!
Russ, The Display operates on 12VDC and draws approx 700 MA of current. I power my Display from a small DC supply that was built to power a Radio Transceiver. I suppose it is possible to power the display from a "Wall wort" power transformer by fitting the Display's power leads with the proper connector. You want to be sure that the transformer is capable of supplying at last 1 Amp.
I had the same problem. Easiest solution is to get a styrofoam cup, cut it down into strips and put them between the monitor and mount. This will provide a nice cushion as well a firm mount for the monitor. Hope this helps.
I'm not sure. But, I think so. The hdmi chip is in the adapter itself.
Be sure to restart your computer. When rebooted, go into display properties and make sure to specify how you want the video output to be treated on the extended desktop.
2009 or newer.
The speaker's built in battery will move into sleep mode when there is no sound output for more than 1 minute.
the four ohm speaker will work just fine in this application, but it will not be as loud as a two ohm speaker. the ohm in this sense is a unit of resistance, and the higher the number the more resistance you have. that being said, finding a two ohm speaker may be a bit of a chore. good luck!!
Yes, but the latch is a magnet with a knob to holld it closed. And yes the keyboard and tablet are closed up together. The keyboard is held in place by four magnets. I've had no problems with this setup. Enjoy!
I believe so, It's a long time since I did the pairing. I think your tablet presents a pairing code that then has to be entered by the keyboard.
It doesn't have mouse or a finger pad. Very easy to enter multiple letters if you're not quick to release your finger. The curser movement keys are handy.
I see there are 12 on the keyboard; but I don't use them, so I suspect they all are usable but can't confirm that.
It doesn't block out all sound, but it does block out most of it. I think it's because of the padding, not any kind of advanced technology.
That product sucks...the minute I saw it I returned it..I was not fond at all, of the fact that it could not be plugged into the wall...
there should be no problem to use the wireless keyboard for both ipad, you only need to pair the keyboard with the new ipad.
No. It is for the I-Pad mini.
It functions like a regular keyboard. I have an Ipad Mini and it's not the easiest keyboard to type on for obvious reasons. It doesn't light up like a MAC keyboard, but it's efficient enough for basic needs.

You can buy an optical viewfinder (it's not built-in), and yes, the battery is very easy to get. They have Kodak and Fuji variants even that are exactly the same, as well as third party ones too.
Yes, it came with all its accesorios and has a wonderful sound
No I didn't have any warrenty, and the blue tooth phone a big sound problem
I'm not sure where you can get a replacement.Contact Jvc or amazon.
Yes, you can set a day-time and night-time brightness level. The display is easily visible in sunlight...
Yes
Yes
no this unit does not have a tuner so it is always tuned to channel 3
the solid color lens will tint the entire photo.
Hi David, you need to check the specs for the Kodak z990 to determine if the filters will work. The item you are asking is a 52 mm lens (wide) filter so if your camera lenses are 52 mm then it will work, if not you need to buy one with the correct specs for your camera. Ask Kodak when in doubt. Hope this helps!
The item I received did not work. It was originally disclosed that this would carry audio out and power the device at the same time, but the audio did not work. I tried this on 3 different mobile devices and 2 stereo systems. It may work for a computer connection, but did not work as described. (In theory though, itll be the same as a basic analog audio unless you can get the audio digitally from a "dock mode" setting on your phone" tablet. That's IF you can get it to work)
Don't know. It worked with my Windows mobile Htc device. I don't it anymore.
I'd need to know the exact model number of the chip to be certain (ie i5-####), but I think it should be the same chipset (LGA1155). Also btw, an i5 has to have at least 2 physical cores running HyperThreading (2x2=4 threads), or 4 cores with no H. T.(4x1=4 threads). In other words, there is no such thing as a single core i5 processor.
It does have wifi and if you buy a cord that goes into it, you can have wired internet too
In the box is the Tablet, usb cord, usb charging adapter, and the Instructional Manual.
It's a some-what fixed display. It tilts up and down slightly for better viewing but stays open the whole time. I have this in a classic 55 Chevy truck and use it for the GPS, but still looks good. I like this unit, and for the price you can't really complain.
The issue of still images or video depends on the software you use. I use an application called IRIS which gives me video clips. I have not tested any software package3d with the camera.
This will work with any blue tooth phone or tablet.
Yes they can be turned off. The lights have 3 modes, rotating between colours, stationary colour or off
3.5mm audio line input for connecting MP3 players (players sold separately)
I do not think so unless Zurich uses the same kind of electrical system as used in the United States. My advice to you is to buy a 220 converter. Best of luck
Kinda late, but I'm sure it's same as the return policy for TVs that are larger than 27"
Probably not, but I don't know your cover's dimensions and thickness. The mount is curved at all 4 corners and has a lip/ridge that clips and holds the iPad in place with friction. Unless your case is incredibly thin, my guess is no. The mount is very sturdy and has never lost grip and dropped any of our iPads. We just take the silicone sleeves/covers off when we place it in the mount.
Hi! I ordered this case for my 2013 MacBook Air last week (Sept. 16th) and the second microphone is not covered. There is now a hole to make sure both are useable.
it should. yes.
Yes.
I'm not sure of the size of my MacBook, but if it's the same size as the old one I don't see why not
No, it doesnt .
It worked perfectly for my Mac Book Air.
Yes
It's a matte finish!:)
I'm afraid I cant answer that question. I purchased the grey cover. I will soon be buying more. I'm looking at the clear as well as the teal blue.
Nick I dont think this lamp is certified, but it has lasted the same hours as the one from the fabric, im still happy with my purchase
This camera is 4" x 4" x 4"
Absolutely nope and and very nice feel .
My remote like this uses 2 AAA batteries !
Yes it does
The manual show it works on Dell TV
I have one Aircam hooked up at 90+ meters from the poe, using Cat6 cable, it has been working since September 2012, no problems whatsoever
no, the camera is wired ip and power.
No, they are designed to be stuck in a hole cut out for them. You could mount them vertically, but still on a hole in the wall.
I have a Toshiba that believe it or not, is a VCR/DVD player and recorder that works really good. I also have a Technics that is good quality also
Yes. Just no wake up timer.
My measuring tape shows 15 1/4 inches high with the stand.
The wire is exactly 4ft and 5 inches :D
well I'm running it in my 4th generations sandy bridge alien ware x51...its made by dell...it should work
Yes to 5d
while your playing the radio or whatever the light is green, after 7 min. off , the light turns to red and is in the standby mode.
Can't remember if its manufactured by Toshiba, but its a fraction of the cost and its warranted for 1 year which is excellent. The customer service is also awesome!!
not sure, it only gave me the option for a refund when i said that it did not work.
Sorry, I cannot answer this question.
The most important thing to know is this card only fits in a PCI/X1 slot on your motherboard. This means you need to have a newer motherboard. Make sure you understand that before you buy it. If you don't have your manual from the motherboard, download a free tool called CPU-Z and run it. It will tell you what your motherboard model is. Then Google that motherboard and see if it has a PCI/X1 slot. If you do, this card should work for you.
yes , works fine I buy camera even diferente brand camera for better quality and just change the camera take old out plug new in simple that hope this help
I think it's about a foot, sticks out but I tilted upside down and there is no issue, much stronger signal
No it does not.
Well, Boston is like Atlanta (maybe not this bad) so it is impossible to keep up with the traffic updates...it seams to be better than the old method but a lot of the time the traffic clears and you are better off not taking the alternate route cuz everyone else did that and the alternate route becomes the bad way...but I think it helps some of the time.
Yes it does Ding before the turn...
Yes, the cord that plugs into your audio jack on your computer doubles over for an iPod plug in. The speakers also can take the audio plugins from consoles and plug into the control box.
I've found sometimes just reboot the whole system since it checks for an active input, I know what you mean though bro! Turn everything off and then power everything on but the speakers play audio and turn it on
2 AA only. That's why I'm using rechargeable AA batteries.
Closed
I don't remember that part. Better ask seller about warranty. But I would be surprised if it does.
Depends on what u use it for@ 4 watts a channel with 4 ohm speakers it will do nicely,some claim its 100 watts a channel no way....I recommend reading the reviews on it,i bought 1 but gave it to my dad,i use the lepai 2020A plus,its a little more but sounds great,i use them for my pc with AR satilite speakers and a 70 watt powered infinity amp that was added to a 10 inch speaker and it thumps like a log. z-2300 setup....
Actually, I've found them quite good out of the Apple system and can probably compete with the Beats i have at home, they sound amazing in my computer and home system as well.. good luck with them.
Yes, works perfectly with multiple devices, I have personally used with Skype on home pc, as well as on phones (Iphone, Galaxy S III, non-smart phone, GREAT sound too
Pioneer should have a one year warranty for parts/replacement, so I would get in touch with Pioneer's customer service dept.
Absolutely. The device can only display the data that is sent along with the ring impulses & it's only sent if you subscribe to caller ID.
Yes it does - you do have to change batteries often.
Hello Kat, We apologize for the confusion. Please note the products are categorized under "Color" option. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. iTech Accessory
No. Actually that item is a piece of crapp all together. Not worth a dime.
Yes
Standard 1 year parts and labor. Accidental damage purchased separately
110, all computers are 110 voltage in America.
It is a laptop with keyboard. Keypad?
Deborah, this mount will work great
I plugged the cables into the back of the TV before I attached to the wall
ironically? yes, I mean, it's snug lol, but it will actually fully fit in there and zip without issue, but like it JUST fits. I bought this for a different 10-inch 2in1 like tablet (ASUS transformerbook T100) but it broke and I replaced it with a SurfacePro3, tried fitting it in there and (YAY) it fit, one caveat though, it might not fit at first unless the other two pockets are empty, but after you slid it in and zip it stuff away and I haven't found an issue with loading it that way so far
Barely
Yes is adjustable.
No, sorry you cannot print coupons.
Yes.. it is currently on a gtx780
No, it already comes with paste
No, they are always exposed.
4 pin pwm connections which work on 3 pin as well. You can use it on a mobo with 1 fan connection with a powered pwm splitter that draws from the psu directly. That's my recommendation if you use a splitter that's not powered you might get some noise from the fans on start up. But that depends on the amps your mobo can provide. Hope that helps. Oh and by the way I replaced mine with a AIO water cooler and the temps are way better allowing for an additional oc of 0.4ghz
The camera stays on and when motion is detected the hard drive records the incident and or triggers an email.
Yes, as long as they have the same male and female plugs.
You sure can. I have it hooked up to a 55'' and a 42''.
It has an audio feature, but this model doesn't record audio.
Interesting question, Harper. The list comes up when one tries to use the "save as" feature inside WP, but I don't see a way to copy that list for you. Among the "60 file types," there are many versions of Word, some old versions of WP, WordStar, Quattro Pro, and many many more. If you have a particular program in mind that you want to use with WP, I'd be glad to check the list for you. Otherwise, maybe someone else will know how to give you the whole list. Sorry...
Sorry, can't answer this. I am using Windows 7 professional. I found I had to install files other than WordPerfect to make it fully functional with Dragon. (Needed to install the "extras" -- a file containing clip art and other things I did not think I would use, in order to make WP and Dragon work together.) Perhaps this would also be required on Windows 8 as well. I purchased a machine with Windows 8 on it and promptly set it in a corner, probably never to be used again unless I can "reverse it" to Windows 7.
It appears to be a full version, but I would ask the seller. If you don't have a previous version and this is an upgrade it won't work and I believe you must have either the X14 or X15 versions to upgrade. Like I say, ask the seller. As far as how many computers? I have used my full version on two computers and done a half dozen reloads.
It has 3
I have the Samsung Galaxy TAblet 2 - 10.1 and it fits and is great. THe model # I have is SCH-1915. I hope this helps-:)
Yes
The short answer is "no". The aviation band is for AM and this radio is FM. Even if you could trick the radio into using those frequencies, you could not communicate with other pilots and ground stations. A more complete answer is that this is a "software defined radio" and if Baofeng really wanted to add that to the software, they probably could.
The s3m has device control buttons
Yes. You need to read instructions to be able to use all of the functions.
Yeah, it's a pressure sensitive switch at the top. The volume control, aux in, and power are all at the top. It's a little like an iPhone screen.
Yep
according to the description it does. I matched the key layout plus the description, fits my toshiba perfectly.
Yes, the tv has a amazon instant video app.
Yes. There is an LED indicator on the base with a counter telling you how many missed calls you have. You retrieve calls with the handset.
No, desktop only. No way at all to mount it to a wall.
No
Yes, it is tricky to use but it does. It does charge the phone.
I use a nook Simple Touch with glow light. Some models have different dimensions,so may not fit. Be specific when ordering.
Approximately 5 1/4" wide by 6 1/2" long.
It will not work I tried several ways.i should have known better,I've been installing satellites for 10 years. Your best option is a new hd tv .period
Yes it is
Part 97.401(a) of the Federal Code of Regulations: Primarily, it authorizes any use of radio technology for the "immediate safety of human life and immediate protection of property," regardless of all other FCC regulations, when no alternative is available. Otherwise, yes a license is required.
I'm not sure if its color i hook it up to my notebook computer and show live images down a drain you can't tell if its color or black and white it does work goodI've used it several times down drains and you can always tell what the problem is
yes it will but the cable is like coax but not as stiff so you might need to attach it to a snake or something.
It does record in color, but beware that the LED light source is limited in reach and ability to contrast colors.
No you cannot remove the spread
Yes. They are compatible with any 75mm head.
No, it's not solid state.
yes it can but it did not hold up it was a christmas present for my grandson and the first one had to be returned the second one just burnt out im sure he played it forever better luck here this coming christmas
I don't understand the question?
Dear, it has steering wheel control function, but you need to get a canbus for it.
Yes you can through a PC. It works the same way as a USB. Very easy to use. Feel free to ask any other questions you may have.
2 Gb
Hi, No, it won't. You can use only 1.2-1.5V AA rechargeable or non-rechargeable batteries. Let us know if you have any other questions. Thanks!
No. the description says it has a "3.5mm Stereo Headphone Jack", which is why I ordered it. Well, it doesn't. What it DOES have is an input jack for an external MP3 device. It appears to be almost impossible to find a portable CD player like this with a headphone jack; you're probably better off getting a personal player if you want to use headphones.
YES
Yes, it has slot it in where you can pull a string (like ones used in a digital camera) through it or get a small ring through it. I pulled a string through mine and now I can hook it on my key chain. Also, the little slot for it is on the usb side, not on the cap. So if the cap fell off you would still have the usb.
Sorry I have no idea...
I have had no trouble with it collapsing at all, and I use it daily.
Yes and no. If you want to photograph a field of wildflowers then it would work fine because you could get fairly close, 0.82 ft. is minimum focus distance. But for macro photography of a single blossom it would not be the best lens to work with. You would need a true macro lens.
yes it dose come with a rechargeable batteries.
the monitor is also your receiver. i assume it is replaceble, i have had mine over 2 years and it still works so have not had to replace anything. you cannot hook it up to another system unless is has the exact same frequency as the monitor/receiver as the one u wish to replace. the pic is not good but love the sound. got restraining orders on some nasty neighbors which was a blessing.
Hi. This product is unopened new, which is delivered directly from the manufacturer. Thus, the accessory is only the front and rear cap. Thank You.
It's a micro 4/3 mount. An not sure but don't think there is an adaptor that would get it onto a Mk3?
No, it has a 30 pin (i phone 4)
I was really upset with these Monster headphones because they didn't even last me a month and they were already being defective. I don't plan to ever buy anything like this or anything similar to it.
As long as the DS or Wii has a 3.5mm headphone jack, then yes.
I bought for iPad
Yes they do.
Yes. Every iPad model can use a bluetooth keyboard like this Logitech.
Yes it does. I remember having a heck of a time turning it off. I forget where but you have to go setup. I am not with the camera but it was really not hard.
Much better. I love mine.
Is it possible the battery is not charged? The instructions suggest it is necessary to discharge fully then recharge. It may be it came discharged, and must be on charge to be recognized, I bought an inexpensive battery and it lasted about three days, then began indicating it should be replaced. The only other possibility would be an incorrect battery? Best regards, Sammy
I really dont know, It never happen to me. Probably you should returned the one you order and ask for new one, mine works just fine. I am sorry for not being of much help.
Yes, the power brick is 110-220VAC 50-60Hz. Be careful of the wifi frequencies. This is a North America model following the 2.4GHz band for this region. The Europe model allows customization for different countries wifi plans. We found out by being shipped the European model by mistake.
Yup, it comes in a carrying box, that has all of the things in it.
It should work but i tryed it on android and iphones and worked. so it should work also very durable earphones.
The LG must have Dual Play technology.
I'm not 100% sure, but if it will accept a video input with a BNC connector, then yes it should work. I have also bought a BNC-to-RCA adapter and ran this camera directly into a DVD recorder to videotape a meeting. It worked just fine for that.
They come already assembled, ready to put on.
No, this is for desktops, not laptops.
Sorry, no it doesn't. It is an amazing set of features, and I am happy to own it. I use my phone as an alarm.
I am not sure I have an Audi 2010 Q7 and it works perfectly in mines with no problems.
image shows DVD player though not listed in technical details...
Good point- in cart waiting for a reply here
It is the Starter version of Word and Excel. They don't expire and have enough features for most normal use.
Is that the one i have? It has, Intel B950 processor. Don't see anything about dual core but it seems pretty fast. :-)
It has an HDMI slot. Don't know if it's digital cable ready though. Maybe do a websearch for "NB GATEWAY NE56R12U specs" to find out more technical information.
No, but Netflix is an easy download. It works well.
Yes
There should be enough slack in the present antenna cables to reach the connectors. They don't shift far. If your cables turn out to be too short, you can always buy new antennas here, but installation will be somewhat more involved. http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004ZHT2JE/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_ST1_dp_1
No brother you have to translate the file to your computer and then posted but is real easy to do.
It is truly a 3rd generation i5 Intel processor (i5-3450) 3.1GHz
Yes! (At least mine do.)
I don't know. It is designed for the ipad so I would not think so.
Though not a designed feature, a stylus can be tucked into the back of the case between the case and the iPad. It stays quite well with an adult user. I suspect that a young child would lose it out quickly.
I really don't know the exact material it's made of. To me the material is like a nerf ball a foamy rubber. Hope that helps.
No this tablet doesn't the Polaroid PMID750 kid's tab does though. The specs are the same as this tablet but the application are geared towards kids as well as the screen is recessed and there is more plastic on the perimeter.
Yes
It does not have a DVD. What it is saying that the tv will iSync with the DVD player
I noticed this issue also, I even hit the button to inform Amazon about this,a month ago, no replies I wish SOME ONE could answer about this,,,,

Their website says 5 year warranty.
I would think so, keep it mind it's a tad longer than stock psu
Check the dimensions against a 3200 if its bigger even a little bit it won't fit. My D3200 barely fits
4gig but it segments your recordings down to 20 minutes each... But works for my needs just fine.. Easy to download
I think so.... im not actually sure what generation our ipod is. Bought it new ealier this year. Its an ipod touch 16gb... sorry im not much help on that. But it does fit ours great.
Yes it does!
No, no tuner. We utilize our cable box (Directv, non-HD) for the tuner. This is a second TV, so we just have the basics on this unit
John can definitely make the actual leather book cover to attach to your real book... he made one for me!
I really can't answer your question but an experience I had was I ordered a battery for an HP laptop by model number of the laptop and it came in wrong.. I had to reorder using the part number from the old battery.. I suggest you order by part number to be sure you get the right one..
It will only fix your laptop if you are getting the message that your battery needs replaced
I have the dell inspiron n4110. i know that this guy fit my screen perfect to such an extent i have forgot it was even on there...hope this helps you out
Yes, it works!
That's pretty much your only option. Unless you happen to have your iPhone connected you can tap the iPod icon which will cut the radio off and then press the "home" button on the deck to get back to the main screen which is what I typically do.
No it is not. Do yourself a favor and avoid AppRadios, they have lots of problems and pioneer customer service is terrible.
I just measured it and the maximum opening is just over 2 7/8". I have an HTC One X with a case and it works fine. I hope that helps.
Hi Marc, Yes we ship to Canada.
I'm sorry. I really don't know. It has been years since I used this and that was before I had Windows8.
Mine never worked at all, just a dead box
Not quite but close. It worked to keep crumbs out
1, How to select color =&gt; click "Bingobuy" =&gt;; on the right buttom, click "contact the seller" 2, Please make sure your model is identical as we listed before you purchase it to avoid buying wrongly!!! 3, package includes: 1 pcs of silicone cover (Do contact us for the color you need after you purchase it in 10 munites. If not, we will ship a random color.)
it loops around the housing bar where the back door clips on.
Don't have mine in front of me, but I'd say the lanyards are ~6in and the discs are ~2.5in across, maybe 3in. 4in seems a bit wide for the discs, but again, not in front of me.
Yes with an adapter
i really don't remember, but mine is going strong after 1 year!
It's the full cord. Has everything you need to charge laptop.
The Power Adapter Box is 2 1/4" Wide x 5" Long x 1" High. Is that the information you need?
yes, its 3.5mm on both ends fyi.
I don't know
What provider you using?
I don't know who is producer, but I advise you not buy it. It's a worsest camera as I see))
One charger comes with the computer, but we bought a second one. You have to make sure the wattage is correct. This is the one we bought: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064PNJ30/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I have a Qx410 notebook and it was the same
I purchased my power supply a couple months age to replace the orignal power supply. The original only lasted 6 or 7 months, for some reason it stopped charging my system and after reading several reviews I decided to give this one a try and the two months that I have had the replacement power supply it works great. It charges the battery on my system just like the original one. I will update my review if things change.
old remote should work
I have used it with several WiFi channels, both public and private. Not sure what GHz they were, but con't see why it would not work.
Yes - no problem - you can probably do more. I have a set in my office and one on my balcony. All from one transmitter.
yes, it works like any other mouse. I had to plug it back in every time I turned on the computer or my IMac would not recognize it. I am no longer using this device.
No, is made in Thayland.
rechargeable and charger. in photo mode, lasts for hundreds of shots on a charge. not sure how long in video mode.
Yes, it has video & yes, the battery is included!
Everything in my package was brand new.
Yes, one charger and one battery. I've bougth one more double charger, other battery and a grip
Yes
My package arrived with both lenses with built in motor. They both work great. it is a great package for beginners but I will recommend you to purchase lenses with a wide angle from Nikon for a more versatile picture
Hey Harrison, I don't exactly have an Android, but the keyboard works great on my Kindle Fire HD7, which has an Android-based operating system. I don't see why it wouldn't work on any device with Bluetooth. Keep in mind that the keys are marked with Apple-type symbols, but it shouldn't make any difference in terms of key functions, whether PC or Mac. I hope this helps.
Cameta Camera is an authorized Nikon USA dealer and we do not sell grey market units. The camera comes with a one year USA warranty.
The focal length of this zoom is 18-55mm so it would mainly be good for portrait pictures and subjects that aren't too far away. If you'd like more zoom then we recommend purchasing a kit that also includes a 55-200mm lens.
I have one that works just fine with 8.1. Not the best quality, so wouldn't be surprised if some are glitchy.
Hi Alex, I used with a hard disk from an old laptop and just have 160 Gb, but there does not exist any limitation about the hard disk storage size but you must check if your hard drive is "laptop size" (2.5") not "pc size".
aprox 1 kg
Yes I have an Einstein although I use them mainly with just a reflector. It certainly is sturdy enough if you put a sandbag on one of the legs
I haven't had that problem but I spent a few minutes trying to find you an answer. It looks like you need to access the Menu and then by trial and error try to select the appropriate entry that switches the language back to English. Here are the basic instructions I found: Turn on radio hitting button once, then push the mp3 button this will take you to menu. To select you use scroll know on top right ...it will highlight your selection. To select an option press menu button directly below the scroll knob. Hope that helps.
The manual just says mic and radio recording. I've only used it for radio recording.
Film opening fits perfectly over camera on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. Like it being non-glare, does not show fingerprints like the glossy protectors do.
I am not sure...I'm unaware of any incompatibilities.
I've not had to ask about that... it worked. If bought recent check with maker (vendor) but no issues to date
I would say its just to the computer. when I turn if off the computer will not see my hard drive hooked up to it tell I turn it back on. hope that helps
No, it should be on if it is connected to a power supply. At least that is what mine does. Every so often, if the brick overheats, it won't work until it cools off. That may be what happened to yours.
The mystery switch is your power led dimmer switch. It is only apparent when the power is on, but once you do that it becomes apparent.
Yes, but they add minimal height. They are more for leveling. Were you to remove them, you would entirely block the lower intake vents and your machine would probably overheat.
Keeps going
I have the Tf300t and it fit pretty much perfectly. As long as you line the camera cut outs properly and smooth it out, it will cover 99% of the screen. However, I did learn you need to be extremely careful when applying it. I believe either mine got stretched in a spot (my fault) and got stuck together as it dried (making a spot on the screen where the screen would detect a "touch" and act all goofy) or something got underneath it as I applied. Its pretty much trial and error.
Yes; dual monitors are supported. Video outputs: VGA, HDMI, DVI ports
Not sure about 2014 model, mine's 10.1 2012, but if dimensions are the same then you cant go wrong.
Dunno if they offer one for the tab 3, this one is for a tab 2. Sorry.
You'll need some sort of attachment point on the pack where the pack's strap meets the pack, but it doesn't have to be bullet proof. I've even threaded the cotton carrier strap through a keyring and attacked the keyring to my pack
Yes. It worked fine. Wore it on the left shoulder strap for about a week of hiking. I only took it off when we were doing some technical climbing.
Hi, yes it does! This pack has everything you need!
It's a little glossy, but a Sharpie might do the trick. Depending on your reason for labeling it, you may want to use a sticker label for neatness: there's not a lot of room to write. It's on the smaller end as far as USB's go.
Yes
You didn't say what kind of computer you have. For modern versions of Windows (7, 8, 8.1) you don't need an app. The OS will recognize the device and it just works. I don't know about MacOS or Linux. Probably it will work, but I only use Windows with these headphones.
No
I haven't dropped mine more than once or twice, but so far, no problem.
Nope, the camera has a built-in wifi!
It does via a smart phone / tablet app.
If you had software that supported drive cloning yes, but the device by itself does not do "push button" clones.
It has significant shutter lag, and after shooting a sequence it will pause to process the pictures.
Nancy, the NX1000 only comes with the 20-55 lens. My wife love this camera and has sent me some amazing photos while I have been deployed. You will not be disappointed if you purchase it!
yes you can
1:3.5-5.6 20-50 ED lens
Yes, and they are available on Amazon, here is one,Samsung 50-200mm Telephoto zoom lens for NX Series Cameras.
Yes the case should work. It does mine just fine.
I haven't had any problems with this, as there are holes cut-out for these buttons. When I recharge my Asus 300t, I just turn the computer in the case, since there is no hole for the adapter.
Yes it does I have one.
I've had this problem many times with my Toshiba, when the battery runs all the way down or changing the battery you have to restart and go into the bios, when in there, load default settings, then restart and it should be charging again
Yes it is. Since the iPad 2 is lightly thinner than the iPad 3, the spots are a result from that thin space between your screen and the screen protector. I fixed it by placing a thin piece of cloth centered between the back (apple logo) of the ipad and the case. This will elevate your ipad enough to make your screen completely flushed with the screen protector.
I don't believe so. Most devices only allow one bluetooth audio device to be connected to it at one time.
Neither, actually. The scales are metal.
I'm slow in responding. While we do not have an apex tablet, I can tell you that we had a lot of trouble with the keyboard and our kindle fire. The usb port was not compatible. We were told we needed to purchase the adapter, which we did, how the we could never get the keyboard to work. Basically, we spent money but got no use out of the product.
It doesn't work with Samsung Galaxy 7...it was a waste of time!
From what I can tell it should work with it. I am using it with the full size usb, so I don't know how it works with mini usb.
No because the person operating the device has to listen using a headset plugged into the device and speak through a microphone plugged into the device as shown in the picture. The person on the other end most likely will not know you are recording them (which may be illegal depending on the state) but the person who is using the phone the device is paired to will.
Yes, it works well and recording can be set to begin at the beginning of a phone conversation at the first detection of speech or sound.
Not very well. It's not sturdy enough. For 20 x 80s you should invest in the Paragon-Plus XHD. Or buy the 20 x 80 / XHD combo package Orion offers. The micro-motion feature is appealing but if it's on an inferior mount you wouldn't be happy. The 20 x 80s are only five pounds, but the tripod you're asking about won't even support that, let alone the 10 lbs it claims. I think you can trust me. I wrote Celestron's ads and publications for five years.
At first blush, it appears your Celestron has an eye piece of .98 inches in diameter. The Barlow you are looking at is designed to fit an eye piece of 1.25 inches. If you can find an adapter possible. But may not be the purchase for you.
Well with the light pollution in LA. I live in the valley. I'm pretty happy with what I get. Jupiter's clouds, Saturn's rings and even use it to see the Orion Nebula.
No it's manual. But sounds lovely.
That would be fine. In fact it would be a little under powered with two subs which is fine. They will take about 700 to 1000 a piece with no issues.
Nah. I have mine on a pdx mono 1k and pound the hell out of it. You should be fine
No they do not. These units require that they be plugged into a 120v outlet.
I have Android phone, but I believe you need Foscam Surveillance Pro. Not sure if there is a free version, but for only $4.99. Well worth the money. And there is a way to set the cameras so you can view them all at once. Since I'm not familiar with the iPhone apps, I would suggest to call Foscam customer service at 800-930-0949. However, you could be on hold for a long time. But once they get on the phone, they are quite helpful. I hope this helps.
The power cord is approximately 6 ft. / 183 cm.
This lens works well with the zoom on your camera. It gives you a wider field of view no matter your distance from the objective, but you have to consider your distance away from the object before picking a lens to attach this wide angle to. I have been very happy with this lens, especially for the price.
The size is 58 mm, so I suspect it would not fit 50mm lenses.
Yes. It should fit it. I got it and it did last only for 2 weeks.very bad quality. I got Anker brand later on and I am very happy with it.
Sorry, I do not have this model....I have a L655 S5096....replacement works great for this model...suggest you check with the vendor.
It comes with an adapter so yes it will work. It won't without one because it's too small.
As long as you get a dash kit for an aftermarket radio or if the car already has an aftermarket radio in it. Great radio nice upgrade from factor.
We don't think it would work for the second generation because they are not the same size. We have 2nd, 3rd, 4th & 5th generation iPods in our house. This case for a 4th gen has an opening on the back for the camera, the power button is in a different spot and the size is different. Hope that helps. We do love OtterBox cases though! Three of us use them. Good luck - Janet
We bought the purple one so I can't help you. Sorry!
No, it's not waterproof.
Yes, 1 year warranty
It will work/charge but the plug is too long to fit all the way in which make it likely that it will brake. That happened to me - only lasted ~ 1 month
Mine cuts on any time the power switch is turned on. I use it with a battery setup that I turn off when not in use so I leave the unit on all the time and turn on and off the battery.
Your Samsung camera looks like a large camera. I don't think it will fit in a TBC-404 (it's not very big!). I would definitely go with the dcb-304.
No, it definitely will not fit. This camera case is actually rather small.
Yes it does.
Yes it fits.
Hello Chris...it is 8550mah as indicated by the placard on the battery...regards,JT
I have an HP 7333cl laptop that is a little over a year old. It had an MO06 battery and the only extended battery that would work for it was a MO09 battery. So the answer to your question is yes it should work.
8550 mAh I have 2 of them, both the same.
The Microsoft website says that Windows 7 Professional Edition (on this Dell computer) supports XP Mode. (But Windows XP Home Edition does NOT support it.) XP Mode is a free download from the Microsoft website.
The app is in the Chrome web store. I am not a game player but if they offer the app it must work, don't you think.
No.
The W1 wireless system is currently unavalible. The system consists of a transmitter and a recirver that turn you headphones in to a wireless systen. The system uses the earbuds section of the SA.
For me there was one already installed to control a fan. The existing one went bad and locked into full power so I replaced it. There was three wires from my fireplace. One is power that is looped with a thermostat and the other is a neutral. Should be simple swap out, resolder the wires and it's ready to go.
You should be able to use that email but I don't think you can use amazon e-book.
25x9x17 including the wheels and collapsing handle (it's like a rolling piece of luggage)
not unless you cut the railings out
Sorry, we do not have.
I believe it will. I don't have my Nook tablet with me right now but this cover was the only cover (after a couple of other attempts) that fit mine. If you have a vent about a 1/2 inch or so from the bottom of the back side it should fit.
It treats it as two logical 2.0 ports going into the box: one of the 2.0 ports covers the six memory card slots and the other covers a 4 port USB 2.0 Hub. The hub is powered by a MOLEX cable so the practical difference is nil. You can boot off the 2.0 ports on the hub just fine.
Not a clue why but both of mine did the same thing. The unit works well once installed.
Yes, that sounds correct. That's how I wired mine, and it worked fine (for the whole 6 hours that it worked before dying....). Highly recommend spending a little more and getting one that actually works.
I don't think so. It will block the drone of an airplane but you do hear conversations (ie flight attendant asking if you want coffee etc.)
Yes, any USB hard drive can work with a Mac or PC. This hard drive is USB3, so if you have an older USB2 computer, it will just run at USB2 speed. If you have a newer iMac with USB3, it will run full speed. FYI, don't forget to format it to Mac's HFS+ format before you use it. Use the free Disk Utility that comes with every Mac.
800-1000rms. This thing is high quality and will sound really good. I had a pioneer champion amp powering just this and it was beast.
I used the E/F type in Vienna last year with no problems. Used with the regular charges for the Iphone, Android phone, Kindle and laptop. If you are using older appliances, be sure to check the voltage range on your appliance. I bought a new travel size curling iron before the trip to replace my 15 year old one.
No
I know that it worked for me in Scotland, Europe and Ireland. Hope that helps!
The adapters accept one (1) plug each. The plugs can be 2-prongs or grounded, 3-prongs.
If your "chargers" are dual voltage then yes. My cameras (Nikon, Panasonic, Canon) chargers were all dual voltage and the iPhones are also dual voltage. You can check by looking on the charger to see "110-220". Hope this helps. Note: you will need the proper adapter for India (type D).
Yes
Type 1 adaptor will work in China and Australia as stated with the product information.
Yes, it will accept a UK plug and Argentina also.
They are just speakers. There's no receiver. No remote.
14 gauge wire is what I used to wire entire system.
Yes it does....was kind of surprised. Some inputs do better though...started to have some issues with PC in general pushing through
It is the same
Yes, however you need a receiver device to deliver to display in HDMI...
Yes it does
I don't think so, unless it is the same size as an iPad. This case works by being tight around the tablet as there are no strap to hold it in place. I think Otterbox makes Samsung cases that would work for kids.
Sorry I do not own the tab 2....
Are you asking if I'd recommend one for the Encore? Based on my experiences with Poetic I'd say yes...
all you get is the power cord. all other cables are your responsibility.
I have the L755D and the battery works just fine.
Sandisk provides a lifetime warranty. . . unless you live in Germany or Canada, which don't recognize "lifetime" warranties, in which case it's 30 years.
I am not using Mint but Fedora. This drive is very fast among USB2 drives, but it shows its maximum throughput only with usb3.
You can format it however you want.
Yes it is. Also the maximus hero and the black edition motherboard.
I tried going with 2400Mhz for that very same setup and it turns out that the RAM voltage on the sticks was too high for the CPU. I went with 1600 afterwards and everything is stable again.
Yes
Yes
The card does not have a VGA connector, and does not come with a DVI-to-VGA adapter. However, the DVI connector on the card is a dual-link DVI-I connector, so it should support VGA using a DVI-to-VGA adapter. I've not tried it though.
Yep, the drivers have to be updated online though. Before that the display is a little odd, but no big problems
A reviewer said it is 2.5 feet, i.e. 30 inches.
works with a portable battery and computer usb but my cable started retracting on its own after a few months. I didn't use it very much either. I'm going to replace it with a different brand.
Green zone
This product only has a USB cable that hooks up to the notebook computer for audio/sound.
It has an attached USB cord. No extra power cord. And BTW, especially for something so small and inexpensive, it sounds AMAZING!
Package Height 3.35 Package Length 9.37 Package Width 1.50
I am 5'3 so I understand your question! The handle has incremental locking stations so it works fine for me.
Not really - it is designed for notebook PC and accessories. You might be able to fit a separately-purchased camera holder in the big compartment - but it would probably be better to buy a case designed specifically for that.
No.and I do not recommend this computer.
I've tried Netflix and Amazon video, and both stutter a little too much to be tolerable. Web-based things like youtube work just fine.
That's, odd, my screen has been nothing but great. Try adjusting you're profile function+v, and you can sort through the different types of filters and whatnot
Yes as long as you aren't a giraffe without friends. It's funny because I went to check and realized I had removed it. I need to go ask my neighbor where it is. My neighbor is, in fact, a giraffe.
Yes it can handle World of Warcraft but it still depends on the system requirement of the game that you will run into this laptop.
No
Well Penelope as for sirius it's not internally in this system. However you can connect a sirius satellite to it. Hope this response helps!!! Happy Saturday!!!
I don't use Final Cut 5, I use 7. It works with 7. Not sure about 5. Not sure what you mean by an RCA monitor... It can digitize analog video. There are inputs for component and composite, both NTSC and HD, plus the HDMI port for digital. The only thing it's missing is a serial port, but Black Magic has that on a different version if needed.
No, sorry.
I don't have mine anymore, it broke. But the measurements (as I remember them) were close to 12-13 inches in diameter and roughly 3-4 inches wide. It's fairly heavy because of the heavy gauge wire inside.
The Box says "Neon Power ON Indicator Light. Rocky Kamrock Lights LLC
I didn't even bother with trying to "fix" it. Mine was same right out of box. Out of box hassle like that is not needed in my opinion, just return it and get a better model!
Charge was only lasting about 45 minutes so purchased new battery that runs for 5 or more hours of constant use.
About 6 1/2 in high. 8 inches deep. Around 14 in. at its widest point in front and 10 in. at its narrowest in back.
Yeah, you would just want to be careful as to not hit the button on the front. It is EXTREMELY loud. It would be hard to accidentally push that button though.
I am not familiar with that model and I would call Bose directly...
Yes it should. The plug end is a mini use.
Yes it works very well. I play my pandora all the time on it
Thanks for your inquiry. Headphones, like many mechanical products, may have a break-in period. As the headphones begin to break in they are supposed to sound better and more relaxed. It is entirely possible that your headphones have a different tonal balance than when they were received because of the hours of use. People cite break-in periods of vastly varying lengths, but we typically recommend 40 hours of use before critical listening. We hope you find this information helpful! Please let us know if you have any other questions.
Yes it's included.
I used rubber handled pliers. One came right off and the other required a little extra effort.
Not sure. Mine is the KX-TG9344T.
I just tried the cable on my iPod Touch and on my iPad Mini 2 Retina. The controls for the volume and pause/resume do NOT work with the extension in place. I assume the results with an iPhone would be the same.
Sorry, don't know. I use it to connect to my PC on one end to elongate my earbuds at work. Great sound.
Yes, it does. If I recall correctly, it gives you full IP tables access.
The router covered most of my 2100 sqft house no problem but I added a 12db antena for better back hall range. Configuration other than just as a router or AP is not easy for a normal home user unless your a seasoned network pro. IE. setting static IP's and port forwarding. There isnt a simple walk through GUI like netger & others have. I do IT work for a living and it threw me for a while untill I read through the Ubiquiti website WIKI.
1kHz = 0.001MHz
I'm from Venezuela. Southamerica. Those works perfect. It doesn't matter where you are indeed... :/
I would say yes, but the quality of your streaming would depend more so on your internet connection and its strength.
Have not used it with a 3 monitor setup. I have used it for Iracing, and it does fine. You can max out graphics if you like and still have 80+ fps, at least mine did. Graphics cards are great running in crossfire.
I think it is an Asian generic - but it works well, I am impressed with it for the price.
On the back, upper right corner thee is a small hole. Using a small bent paper clip, press on hard reset/reboot button for several seconds. If tablet has adequate charge, unit should come on and boot up. You will have to reload some software.
Not having problems with sound, but I don't like how fragile it is. Have two and both screens are broke. Also don't like that adope flash won't work on this model.
Yes. It has both a photo camera and video camera.
It depends on your setup... this has a 5 volt out put with an array of plugs to charge different things so if the item has a charging port an the cr123s are rechargeable it will charge it just might be a trickle charge
Nope it won't. I ordered it and had to send it back.You just have to use a regular CD changer it you want to play CD's
Only if you get the newer one. The older one, which I bought first, wouldn't work with it.
No, because you have to have the Wave CD player already to make this work and it has speakers.
No, clearly it is s 6 1/2 inch speaker spacer. It is a 1 inch thick piece of plastic that gives your speaker more clearance in the door frame so it doesn't hit your window when rolled down
Not sure about the Nikon D7100 I have a D70s and it works if I use the adapter, but it's manual focus
As previously stated, the seller of the lens does not clarify in its ad that in order for the lens to work on a Nikon you will need an adopter. When an order is place, the seller simply grabs the first thing off the shelve and sends it. The offer to purchase does not contain a space to indicate the type of Nikon camera you may own which tells the seller to include the adopter. failure to include that info will result in returning the lens because the lend will not work. Hope that helps.
Minimum System Power Requirement = 650 W. http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-690/specifications
exactly 11"
the light turns green, you have to use the charger that came with the battery
Absolutely! Every review I've seen says that 2560x1440 runs perfectly on it. As for crossfire, I assume you mean SLI? If so, then yes! Card is awesommeeeeee
You'd probably be OK. APC makes some pretty robust cases...Just use common sense
I use the Kindle App.
think back to dial up internet and then think slower.
Sorry Gordon, I do not know what Vesa is.
Yes. Nice tv too. No problem for about 1 year.
Yes
It would be nice if the cord was longer and heavier and would detach from the head phones. Okay for the price. Good tone and good volume.
THEY DO NOT COME WITH MERORY CARD
I would expect so, since it works with my D7000. You may be able to find a compatibility chart for it.
The stand was sufficient for me. Obviously, if you push it, it will fall over, but otherwise it's stable.
no,because the item was sold on US amazon.thanks
Yes sir
Several model variations are available. Some have 750 GB at 5400 RPM while some have 1 TB at 5400 RPM.
Yes but it requires you to buy a hdmi to vga/3.5mm jack (for audio) OR using the composite cable (red, white, and yellow) but u wont get hd w/o a converter... i have one that its awesome but i cant figure out the 3d aspect of it
yes you get a remote
The 1155 and 1150 sockets are physically the same mounting. The pin out is just different on the socket/chip itself. So anything that works with 1155 will work on 1150.
The mobo will matter most... it's a VERY large cpu cooling system, but the fans can be removed, flipped to other sides, and can be lifted/lowered depending on your needs on the heat sinks. I personally had to lift the front fan upwards (towards the side of the case) to fit my gskill ripjaw, but only by 1-2 heatsink notches... if your mobo has the ram farther away from the CPU then it might not matter! yes you will want a fatty case.. with a level 10 case it will probably fit
No, you can't, you should visit this website to know if your parts its compatible https://pcpartpicker.com/parts/cpu-cooler/#qq=1
as far as I remember, it didn't come with one, but I feel sure it can be purchased.
It bolts to the factory air box.
yes, right at the base of the snorkel it says Cherokee
It comes with nothing. It's also probably not heavy enough for a friction arm. Even with just a ballhead it's barely stable for tabletop work.
No, this has RJ45 connections for internet connection with Cat 6 cable from modem or router to computer. To protect your phone you need a surge protector with a RJ11 connections. RJ11 is smaller and less wires. If you have an APC for your computer, it usually has RJ11 connectors for phone on the side. If not order a surge protector with RJ11 connections for telephone.
The charger is not includes since OTS comes original with the camera
I believe that there is 1 GB of internal memory for the operating system and 512 MB of random access memory to store music, data, etc
1 GB ddr3
Yes with a BNC to RCA adapter or if your tv has a VGA input.
Yes I believe so. Ck web site to be shure.
Only if you want him to just read and play music on it, nothing ran on this. You can download stuff but isn't powerful enough to run any games or anything. Not even skype works so the cam is worthless. I gave mine to a friend and all they do is watch youtube on it.
yes you can. it is only an extension cord to the magsafe power pack.
Hit the top right button on the screen and it will show the hole numbers. Pick the number that corresponds to the hole you are playing. This works in shotgun start tournaments as well.
I have an 8000 series and they connected to my tv.
Synthetic and black
The answer is yes. There are several models of the T100TA comprised of different features. This unit happens to be an older model in 32GB SSD. I have owned both the older version and the new version with 64 GB drive. The EVEcase fit on both.
The headset isn't made to be an external audio device for the ps3. It can only be used as a microphone. It can be used to hear the audio from your computer though!
Yes it is compatible.
Definitely not. The adapter converts MHL signalling to HDMI and so connects to the TV via a normal HDMI cable.
It does not work at all
It should
Two. The unit gets really warm fast, so I hang it on a hook next to my computer so it won't overheat.
Touch pads and touch screens are sensitive to over-voltage. Check the voltage with a volt meter. ~10% over or more has been known to cause jumpy, unresponsive or 'mind of it's own' - type problems. My PA-10 is rated at 19.5v but puts out 20.0. No issues so far.
I don't have a tape measure handy bt 6 feet or so. Sorry I couldn't be exact. Hope it helps.
Yes is working good
Nope. Definetly not. It runs android. Not windows. Android is a mobile phone operating system, its not a full pc.
8inches by1 1/2 inches by 3/4inch. Who cares, it doesn't work. That's three of them and I need to buy a fourth if I am going to use this laptop without house power.
Yes it will support any motherboard that takes ddr3
Yes
No. It's same charger as 4s
No dongle is necessary. The unit comes with a standard analog cable which is all you need to connect the Transparent One to the analog output of any laptop (the analog output is the same output you would use to connect headphones). If you want to use the USB out of the laptop you will need to purchase a separate USB cable.
Yes
Nope.
Update. The case changes thickness. At the bottom hinged edge of the case it's 2 1/4" as opposed to 2". So 9 x 9 x 2 1/4.
Not sure but all i know is it works awsome gave my laptop life
Lousy...spent 2 hrs with panasonic...max WiFi connectivity is 15 ft
It has hdmi, as far as RCA I'm not 100% sure id have to look.. Hope that helps
YES
Yes, you need an adapter for the plug to go in the wall socket.
Yes it uses optical technology
The battery is not removable in any apparent fashion, and the machine has a little port for a paper clip which is labeled "Battery reset pinhole" in the manual (apparently it simulates removing the battery for a hard reset).
yes it fits mine
Yes, my device has a WiFi connection. The 3G usb modem I purchased is in Spainish and is locked, I have not gotten any use from it. For me it is a waste of money only the micro card reader works.
Yes, ports 2 and 13 are not used by the shield. Also, ports 9 and 10 are connected to the servo outputs on the shield but can be used for an ultrasonic sensor.
I use Model G05-BT with TC-P55UT50; They're compatible.
Yes, it can be turned on or off in the lower right side area.
Heather; I'm pretty sure it doesn't shoot in RAW but is a sweet little pocket camera that takes a wide variety of great shots. What a deal as a refurb! For my purposes I've been able to minupulate files as much as I need to through photoshop elements without RAW format. Gary
No
I don't know for sure. I would highly recommend using the SPDIF (coax) rather than the optical, though for better sound.
Si, utiliza una sim card para operar.
Buen da pero cuando lo compre deca que era unlocked y se supone que era liberado para cualquier operadora
It should, I used it for my MacBook Pro and it was great!!!
Don't know about the G60-549dx. It's a full size power cord. Used it on HP laptop
Fits like a glove
The cable portion is about 6 inches long. Overall about 8 inches.
Yes, as long as the device is running Android 4.0 or higher. This OTG adapter worked with all of my Android devices except for ones running over versions of Android i.e. Gingerbread and froyo
Which Wagan are you referring to? If the fridge, I would think not. Limit of the Bestek is 3 amps; the fridge I think draws 5.
no the disc are BD-R not BD-RW.
I don't know about the s4 but I have it in my s5. I believe it will but I'm not entirely sure
Mine came with two ends to work with either my T3i body or my 5D Mk ii body... I've had good luck shooting lightning this summer with it.
Yes it will.
Yes they will, as long as you have the Apple full keyboard. It looks amazing and it really sticks to the keyboard. My friends were jealous that I had a black keyboard. Just remember to wash in cold water and mild soap.
I think so... I'm using Windows7 Ultimate and it works perfect!!!
I cant give specfics but I have a ps3 that is at the edge the shelves. the shelves are undersized in my oppinoion
I wouldn't, the shelves are not that stable for base bottoms. The glass shelves are more designed to hold box size electronics equipment which will not tilt and fall. You could try it if there are no big dogs or small children in the household to bump it and depending on the weight/base of the TV and if you secure it to the bracket, it might work. I have a XBOX console, a medium size receiver and my one of my laptops for streaming movies. My TV has a built in DVD so I didn't need a fourth shelve.
Yes you can adjust any of the three shelves any where you want up and down
No, I bought it for my son for Christmas. For that very reason, to hold his xbox, and it doesn't even come close to fitting. We ended up using it for a very small dvr, and it barely holds that in.
I wouldn't try this at all. It might snap off the shelf in all likelihood, and at the least it would be very unstable.
I connected my red wire to the reverse light 12 volt + and the black wire to ground... so my camera will only come on when the vehicle is in reverse. If you want to access the camera at other times, you may need to connect the red wire to a 12 volt + supply that comes on when the ignition key is turned to ACC and install a switch on the circuit. That way you can switch it on whenever you want to.
Yes, but remember that this is not a DSL modem. It has the necessary setup needed to connect to anything, really.
my house about 2500 square feet without the range extender work good i use range extender model wn3000rp works perfect with my bluray player
Maybe the processing speed is a bit slower. But as long as the routing system is in the same room as the room you're gaming in you shouldn't have a problem. Personally, I never got knocked off of the connection while gaming.
My apartment is 38' long it works well within those dimensions. Also it works well by a mirror, with a door closed, and even when we're surfing the web and playing online video games. My friends router doesn't work with a mirror in the way or a door closed. That's why I said that. Lastly, a friend of mine who is a computer science major said it was fast.
From the view of the image of the card, the power conectors are on the upper right. When you socket the card, the connectors will face you. I hope that helps :)
When you use the view finder, the lcd is off automatically
I wouldn't worry too much about the peak watts, it's all about the RMS power which is 500 watts and thats pretty decent
Truth be told I only use it as a normal mouse - however you can try using a free software called X-Mouse Button Control and it should help ya
Unknown. It does work with Puppy Precise Linux and Ubuntu.
Yes.
If you use the tape out yes bcause is variable volume.. Do not use sub out
It doesn't. You have a subwoofer amp, and a preamp output for an external amp. The subwoofer doesn't put out any watts to the receiver unless the subwoofer has a built-in amp and you hook it up REALLY wrong.
According to Marantz website, it comes with 3 year warranty. Buyer should verify this with the seller and/or Marantz.
there are no additional zone inputs, you can select the 6 and 7th channel as a 2nd zone amp 2 channel but this is not a multi room receiver, you don't "input" you output additional zones, you need a receiver or multi zone amplifier that will power a pair of speakers in the 3 rooms in your home other marantz models can do this. and there are many multi zone systems out there as well
Yes.
2 feet.
I have the same problem.
Too;s, but it is very simple. It is a gret stand.
Yep. If you're not using a Asus laptop, it's okay to use it
This is used to establish a Wired Connection to the ethernet via the USB port when wifi is not compatible or present...that's all it does. There's no Ethernet port on the tablet only USB
I'm using it on my Asus ultrabook laptop. Works great!
It depends. The transfer rate relies on the speed of the network it is connected to more so than this device. You also have to consider what other internet connections you have ongoing such as Netflix videos or Xbox live. More people and programs using the same internet connection slow it down. This device will work as fast as it can given the network its connected to.
I wouldn't suggest it. They aren't sweat- resistant and I think too heavy to stay secure. I would suggest using one of the BT buds from Jaybord or Jabra. Sweat-resistant, can use the phone, listen to music etc.
No
this is JUST a router (and cloud server) the output of your dsl model goes into this
I use these on my Nikon D3200
It is powered by AC only (no battery to charge via USB). It does allow the ability to plug in a USB thumb drive and share that on the network though
No ... It connects directly through a program called Easy MP.
Ours did not work at all. We had to return it.
Yes, and it even allows the tv to swivel!
Hey no sync cord comes with it you have put the camera in Manuel mode or programming mode
sorry that we only have regular shipping method which takes 3-7days to deiver
I am sorry, we dont ship international.
It's not small... I'm estimating about 3.5feet x 2x2
I have actually used these for snoring-blocking when I was sharing a cabin a while back. It will block out light snoring but not heavy (you know, the surgery-required kind) but they definitely take the edge off! They also block out noisy neighbours, music playing nearby, etc.. Highly recommend them.
I wear glasses and I find the QC15s to be very comfortable. I can't stand having something push on my ears (it actually gets painful after a while) so the "over ear" option was the only way for me to go. Part of it may depend on how well your glasses fit (close to your head) as well.
if your tv has a headph.'out' jack then yes you can,although an extension would be handy as the cable is only 1m.
To the thunderbolt port which is next to the USB port. I would buy the product from apple instead of this. It stopped working after 1 month.
I play skyrim on high settings minus the anti aliasing or the other option (can't remember it right now), I also give it a gig of video memory if you can spare it. It runs at more than 30 fps at those settings, so overall it's not "good" for those games but if you don't mind a little lower quality than yea its a fine substitute for an enormous card. Also I drop the resolution to 1366x720. I haven't actually looked at what the exact fps is but it's not choppy at all.
Three USB 3.0 ports
No. It does not.
Windows 7.
No, it's not!
You will get a warranty but good luck getting them to actually resolve your problem. We have been fighting with them for months to fix the well known issues with the cursor randomly selecting things or moving. see my review.
Yes it does.
Yes. I'm not sure if the battery is replaceable by us (the consumer) because there's no obvious means to remove it. I assume Samsung could replace it if it ever became necessary to do so. The included charger is thin and light - very portable.
Yes. Above the keypad, on the laptop, there are three buttons. The first one is the settings button and if you click on it a window will pop up with a bunch of different settings and turning the touchpad of is one of those options.
I honestly don't know the answer to your question, but if you have not already purchased this I would highly advise against it. I just returned mine because it was very slow and frustrating. I got an asus that was cheaper and much better performing on every level compared to this machine.
...dunno if you can or not...it's a Dell, it's not well-built...so, probably not...
Yes....I do have prob with the wifi very badly...it is really not working in mine...when I got it checked in India I heard they saying it is due to partition problem...that they might have not done the partition properly.
no this product is designed only for the standard sized phone with original factory battery... that said, it may be possible to cut out the back of the rubber and hard plastic backing of the case to accommodate the larger extended battery... but wouldnt that defeat some of the purpose of the case?
It gives Long-Lat position worldwide on land and sea but there is no hardware or software for maps. GPS location only.
Yes. I am actually using a Manfrotto 324rc2 pistol grip head on mine. This tripod is light duty though. I might consider the next size up.
I don't think so...ipad air is a bit smaller. This is the best stand ever!!! I hope they make one for the IPad Air soon.
This will NOT work with a case on. But I love this stand for indoor use.
Yes! This is a great product. Reminder This item will not work on the I pad air.
I don't know what a cc swiper is, but I use a Fuzzy Fingers microfiber cleaning pad while it's in the stand. The stand is very secure; my ipad will not come out without using great effort to remove it.
I have a Pioneer CD-i200 (cdi200) iPod Adapter Cable and this DOES NOT work with it. Maybe someone else have better luck with other ipod adapter.
Yes but they are not exactly what they look like and I wouldnt buy them again.
I am not sure....you might want to check around on google or other forums.
It can work for ipod nano, any ipod or MP3 player that can be connected via headphones jack, it can also be used with a memory card and a USB. Now can you listen to it through a bluetooth, no.
Yes, it was packaged nicely. It however, didn't work. It was too short and didn't fit into my computer.
Sorry. Dear ! Only go USA ! Sorry for that!
No.
I don't think you can - this is a VGA/HDMI connector/converter - even at that it did not work for my VGA Desktop Computer Monitor port to Smart TV HDMI.
Mary, You are correct. The pads do measure 40 wide 28 high and 12 thick. and yes, the water does flow through the pads from top to bottom. flowing down through the 28 inches tall. If you have any further questions let us know. Thanks
Plug in and start tethered capture BEFORE turning camera on.
It worked on our 24" Westinghouse.
This is a universal remote. I'm not sure If will work for you,but it's inexpensive enough for you to give it a try.
No
To be honest it should work for any aslong ur radio has a aux tab
Cd player only it should work
No. The Microsoft Surface RT 2 has a proprietary HD Digital Video output port which is NOT the same as a micro HDMI output port. I suggest you search Ebay for "Miccrsoft HB Digital Video Adapter" to get correct cable. Should cost around $10 or so.
This product (STBU500100) has a removable USB 3 adapter that plugs into a SATA II port. The firewire adapter is not sold on this product.
Yes
If it is connected to your wireless router yes but if connected by cable you will need to connect to each pc to run backup on it
2.5"
One is pre-formatted for HFS+ (Mac) while the 900 is, I believe, NTFS (Windows) but has the Mac drivers so you can write to the NTFS disk. It doesn't really matter which one you get, you can just format them to the file system that you like.
I had to look those critters up.. and this is what I was looking for, 'RMS power of 200 watts and 8 Ohm impedance.' Yes, you can use the 2113C with these. I highly recommend you follow this guide from Dolby Labs. http://www.dolby.com/us/en/consumer/setup/connection-guide/home-theater-speaker-guide/index.html to complete your set up. Also, run the Audessey calibration routine.
Yes
Yes, it does
Yes. It is an external hard drive. It will behave as another drive on your computer.
I am not sure about the used version but the new version has one. I would think that even a used one would. Seagate uses a special end on their drive and so you will need the USB that goes with the unit; unless you purchase a Free Agent Go-Flex system and so change cable ends. I use a firewire connection on my computer as it transfers data faster.
These devices connect an HDMI output to VGA. The MacBook air has a Mini DisplayPort output on its Thunderbolt connector. This isn't the correct device to adapt that to VGA.
It should fit just fine brother. -Dj Hi Def
Should be the same for Serato DJ
The CD that comes with the package is a utility disc. Windows 7 OS does not come with restore CD but you can create your own through the utility software. Thank you
yes but the microphone for the speaker phone does not work well
On mine it is 4 and a 1/2 inches wide, 13 and a 1/2 inches tall, and 3/4 inches thick. The one I have is a little different then the one in this picture as it is an older model.
yes
Provided you have the correct tray yes. I have a ML350 G6 and the only tray I could use is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DWFH2BU/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
The Perc 5/i cannot use drives greater than 2TB. You would need to upgrade your RAID controller to a H700 before using this drive.
Supply and demand. People are greedy.
It seems Leica would be able to give you that answer.
If i was you don't get it cause it dont work, it as alot of problem and no it wount fit on. 2024. Take my word product its sad. Do. Not buy,,,,,,,,,.........,,big problem hope they fix my problem. Well they you have it. Do not buy it &#128686; &#128683;&#128683;&#128683;&#128683;&#128683;
Have you tried updating the Swivl app on your ipod/iphone? This might help http://www.swivl.com/support/new-swivl-firmware-update/
Hi S., if you have the cordless phone model, then no this headset is not compatible. Check out the Plantronics CS55h or a Plantronics CT14 and those would work with a cordless phone. Or you can always get a 2.5mm wired headset to plug into a cordless phone.
Hi Chaz, yes this headset will work.
Yes it can! The earpiece has 3 pivot points allowing it to go on either side with the boom still positioning naturally as well as the earpiece fitting properly in either ear.
Yes, it will work. No problem Thank you Sarina
Hi Andy, it depends which seller you are buying the headset through. We give a 1 year warranty on our refurbished headsets, but we are currently out of stock on this model.
the kit with 18-135 is WR, and much better deal. (most of k-30 with 18-55 are not WR, however, K-5 kits with 18-55 were all WR)
Yes, but this particular package includes the lens
Found online, hope it helps... ED = extra-low dispersion glass elements, reducing chromatic abberation. Not reducing the price of the lens, unfortunately. AL = aspherical elements, used in wide angle lenses to get a flatter focus field and better corner/edge sharpness. Like ED, it costs more. IF = internal focusing. Only glass elements inside the lens moves when you focus, the rear and front elements keep in place. The lens keeps the same size at all focusing distances. A bit more complicated for the engineers, thus adds to the price of the lens.
I had a run of over 700 hundred feet hooked up to one security camera and it worked well for my application.
According to Lenovo's website the battery is a "4 Cell Li-Polymer" so I guess the answer is "yes."
Yes it does. But super tough doesn't mean it is unbreakable. You always need protection. There is at least a couple screen protectors at Amazon. Also make sure to get a case cover. There is only one as far as I know specific for the A2109. Make sure it is Not the one for the S2109 model. The one I got is this: PadFolio Smart Cover Stand Alone Case, Best Seller Durable Premium Design For Lenovo IdeaTab A2109 9-Inch 16 GB, 8 GB Tablet

I can't answer this because I've not tried to open the memory door. However, I've called Samsung a couple of times and they've been helpful...and you can also email them. Go to Samsung.com, then computers, and then to support.
I have had no such problem. Sorry to hear about yours.
Yes it is. The font on the keys do not light up like the newer versions do, but....
Hello, Yes, we do ship to Brazil. Best regards, Amuras
I tried with mine and the memory card was still not compatible.
Yes
I hv a mac....it is compatable. Now..the gps is good , all directions have given me a wierd out of the way rd. But its gets me there. I still like my phone navi the best.....
Yes, it does. It has about four ways to choose, one of them is "fastest" which uses main highways.
This will work with a G3 from AT&T but you need to buy a circle case FROM AT&T. The AT&T is the only G3 variant to use powermat, all others use Qi chargers. They are not interchangeable. (There are guides online on how you can take the sticker off the back of the case to put on the stock back to use with other cases.)
I have a Lumia 1520 and it works for that but I needed to get a charging case for the phone first.
According to a Google search the S6 will work with qi and pma (powermat) chargers. Sometimes phones features change based upon the wireless company they are built for. Be sure to check the specs on the wireless companies website.
Have to purchase the Duracell power at case for iPhone 6...if one exists yet.
yes and the new generations of iPads
Oriented with the long sides of the iPad horizontal it cannot be made to stand the iPad vertically - it is always leaning away from you as in the product photos. Standing on the short side it can be made completely vertical however.
No
Viewsonics website has a distance calculator that will helo you match the projector to the screen size you have. .
Yes, on the switch-on button
I have the same problem
It works with anything that has a quarter-inch out. Can't speak to the quality specifically with your Roland, but it's worked with my keyboards.
Yes they will. It was posted on another brand how to do this. I have mine connected to my parking lights. So during the day, your tail lights are on also.
yes it will ,,, that's the idea !!! ,,also helps to to make more space on your PC hard drive ,,but the main intention is to protect information in case something happens to the hard drive ...
Absolutely, this is why I purchased this unit,worked flawlessly.
Its not something that is usually provided by the HD manufacturers and i have not seem them.
My 2TB and 3TB are both 7200.
Yes. I got one of this for my Xbox One and it's perfect.
Yes, I've used it with mine and it works.
It's hard to say. I've had varied experience with Seagate drives. Some have lasted 7 or 8 years; and one lasted only 2 years. I've only had this one for a few months. I don't take chances. I back up my computers daily to this drive; and I back it up monthly to another large drive that I keep away from the house. I hope this helps.
I ended up purchasing the slightly larger case, the Ape Case Pro 650, which fit my Nikon D3100 and attached Tamron 70-300 zoom lens. There was room in the outside pocket for the Nikon charger and in the inside top pocket for an extra memory card. Don't know how much larger the D5200 is but the zoom lens will fit easily.
You associate the sub with one speaker. Anytime that speaker is in a played group the sub plays. You can disassociate and re-associate with a different speaker fairly easily, but have to do it in the setup menu.
Not from the unit but from your Sonos controller whether that be your PC, iPhone etc
It should, as long as it is a regular widescreen laptop. No guarantee.
I just read about new dimensions of 2013 model and they are exactly the same as my 2012 model, so yes it will fit it like a glove.
It's not power zoom. It will certainly work with Sony a6000. It will not resolve anything close to the full 25 megapixels of the a6000 sensor, especially at the tele end, but it's fine for uses like web imagery. Double-check me on this, but I think current versions of this lens may support a6000 "fast hybrid autofocus". Older versions of the lens need a Sony factory modification to use this feature. The 18-200 LE will autofocus well enough on the a6000 regardless, but the fast hybrid feature improves the speed and accuracy of autofocus, especially in dim light.
It is relatively easy, but it does help to know the functions of the buttons. There is a question mark button on the camera that will tell you almost all the information you need to know about photography and how to work the camera. Hope this answers your question.
Yes of course, it also have in-body stabilization, so no problem with a m43 zoom (I have it and it's fantastic). Nevertheless, have a look at this first review, comparing real result with OMD-5. Looking the results, maybe you can rethink what to buy, specially now that OMD is for sale. http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/image-comparison/fullscreen?attr18=daylight&attr13_0=panasonic_dmcgx7&attr13_1=oly_em5&attr15_0=jpeg&attr15_1=jpeg&attr16_0=200&attr16_1=200&normalization=full&widget=7&x=0.1804539138490041&y=0.1535367545076283
It will fit but...........my experience with the battery is that it does not give you the charge of the OEM battery. I get about 1 hour of use which is disappointing considering the one I replaced was giving me 40 minutes.
I don't think so, Even though it states it was for mine it wasn't.
Height is important for greater coverage but the extra coax line loss with a longer cable will attenuate most of the gain unless you employ low loss cable.
Yes it has caller id. The cool thing is you can add other remote hand sets. I have 3 on mine
I have used it with an iPad. It pretty well drains the ReVive but I would expect as much as the battery in a tablet is large.
It is not. Most mechanical keyboards are very quick to advertise the fact.
nop. so far so good.
I would be surprised if it did not work with a Mac. I don't have a mac, and the keyboard does not use any hardware specific drivers, Windows reads it as a standard keyboard.
Should be no problem with that, it even comes with an IDE port on board.
Yes, I was satisfied with the quality.
I think so. I plugged my Samsung Galaxy S3 and works really fine. And a Nexus One from HTC. I hope it serves this info.
Don't know about your particular hard drive but if your drive has a SATA interface it should. In fact it should also work with any 3.5 inch SATA drive. Plug into a USB 2 or 3 and away you go!
Do you have component put to your TV? If you have something connected to the receiver using component cables you have to have component cables ran to the TV from the receiver also otherwise you won't have picture just sound
I have an i7 and it was a noticable upgrade on my pc . if that helps. windows 7 ultimate.
It says 300W but I run it on a 250W PSU right now without problem.
There is only an Ethernet connection. Pioneer sells a WiFi adapter for the unit. I prefer the reliability of Ethernet, so the WiFi was not an issue with my purchase
I've had my Pioneer now about 6 months; played all commercially available DVDs and Blu Rays. I've never seen a cinavia message but I really cannot comment on whether it is cinavia free or not. My understanding of that technology is that the codes are imbeded in the discs of material not usually available to or for commercial play but as to your specific question, I cannot comment as I have only played commercial discs. Sorry I cannot be more specific.
this is some generic (aftermarket) replacement for the model. The image you're coming up with is probably the actual Sony issued model.
yes it absolutely will. I have used it several times to play videos, streaming movies and videos from my ASUS tablet to a TV or projector.
You can use a USB to mini USB to downlaod pictures from a phone to a laptop. The only problem is that this product is a micro HDMI to HDMI cable, which is used and only can be used to display your tablets screen onto other screens with a HDMI port.
Yes it is compatible.
I don't believe there is one. I have had the same issue. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
The unit does not feature wheels. It is not any more heavy than a standard cooler when empty.
I carry Canon 7D with 18-200mm on it plus an extra lens, filters, etc. in the lower chamber (split-padding has velcro and is adjustable). I keep all kind of laptop junk, Bose QC2 head phones, books etc. in the upper chamber. In addition 15" Macbook in the vertical slot accessible from the upper chamber.
Yes! And a small place up top near handle to place ID.
Whatever is connected to this switch will be turned off or on all at once so, I guess the answer is yes you can connect a power strip to it, make it safe and double check it is fully connected to void a electric sparkle that can and end up on a possible fire, consider that all connections plugged to the power strip will be shutdown at once maybe is what you are looking for.
i havent tried that, but I can tell you that this is a quality item and it works great
It is in fact the E751 that I received in my order
i use it with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042AG9V8/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 this HDD
It's not a GPS. If you mean for an AM/FM/WB location, just as soon as the signal is clean enough. For the WB, if you mean how far away of a signal can you get, I'm not sure.
no
I don`t know. Ask Amazon !
Canopy will only ship to a US address.
one time fee
No it doesn't lock, but I haven't had a problem using it in my lap, etc. I chose this one instead of a rubber roll-up style one for that reason.
on the remote (near the top) there is a source button, scroll down to the HDMI plug that has your DVD player.
I do not get any noticeable glare on my TV. That being said TV is in a cabnets and there are no windows behind were we sit to view.
The bag is big enough to hold a 13" laptop so it should be able to fit in there fine.
I would think so; the bag is a little over 14 inches. I use it for my 13 inch Zenbook and there is room to spare.
I have a 3 and 6 year ole that both use the tablet with this case. It works just great and they don't need supervision.
It is worth the buy.
Only one
Yes, it have screen rotation lock. One mechanical, about buttons to adjust the sound, the other in the pop-up toolbar.
If you dial the brightness down a notch or two, pretty close to five hours.
Yes
It has one 1 VGA port and 1 DVI port on the back.
MS is offering a $15 upgrade option from the beginning of August(?) and runs to the end of Jan(?) 2013 to all purchasers of pre-loaded Win7 hardware.
Yes, it does.
I brought a SanDisk 32GB mini disk.
I did not have any problems with my FM Radio while using the in car video recorder as illustrated. The in car camera and recorder pictured with this question was not called "Tachograph R300".
Not hard. Mine broke in a week. DO NOT use a generic power supply, even if it matches specs. Dont do it. Suggesting another comparable product.
The nature of the Blu Ray HDCP beast is that key packs are ever changing to combat piracy. Long story short there is currently no free playback codec that works well enough to be a full time solution. I use Win DVD 11, it comes with a 30 day free trial and was about 33.99$ USD as an upgrade from the demo. It works perfectly fine and they just released a new keypack update.
No, but it does keep the strap in place. It is recommended that you use it.
Only offered one way
No. It is the display backlight which broke.
no it is not and while I like it, I have purchased a lenovo ideapad 13 which is awesome - a notebook, a tablet, a touchscreen, etc all in one. check out the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Su9O-2fRwcI
There are two 2.0 USB ports and two 3.0 USB ports. A total of four.

hi, yes, but you still need the genie. mini genies do not work without the main genie unit. thansk
Hi Ben, ours is a H25-700 and it works really good
It will run 3 monitors at once. It has DVI, DisplayPort, and HDMI outputs. I have 2 running on mine, as I don't use the DisplayPort output. It runs an HDTV at 1824x1024 through the HDMI, and a 23" LED monitor at 1920x1080 through the DVI.
Not as it is, but I sewed a strap on to attach to a caribeener hook. It was very easy, and the pouch is sturdy enough to handle it.
Each square pocket (inside dimensions) is approx. 80mm x 80mm ..or (3 1/4" square) I use it to store my 55mm filters ...it does so perfectly and securely as well!! I could easily store my 76mm with the same confidence, I highly recommend this pouch for its design, ease of use and efficiency in storage space!! it's compact and well made!!
4 1/4 x 4 1/4. Fits perfectly in vest pocket.
yes, I reempleace with these and it has worked very well
Hello M. Kirk, honestly I haven't really paid attention to the life of this charged battery but I do know that I'm getting at least 3 hrs. and probably closer to 4 hrs. out of a charge. --A.W.
Yes
Yes, it works with the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Model GT-N8013, that's why I bought it.
Yes, it will. Thanks!
Yes it dose .
Yes it will fit and charge the tab 2 7.0
lauren, this antenna is a generic universal antenna and fits my sony boombox and many other radios as well, the diameter is 0.2 inches which is approximately 5 millimeters and is not threaded by rather mounted with a screw, i don't know the antenna specifications of a g.e. superadio but its my guess that this antenna will work on your radio.
Don't know offhand. What I would do is look up the specs of the individual NVIDIA gpu's. Also, the amount of onboard video RAM and its clock speed is crucial. Failing all that I would look for reviews on those cards, But for that to be meaninful the reviews would all have to have been done under the same conditions. I would reccomend a minimum of 1GB of onboard RAM. Also, if NVIVIA or Zotac specify the MFS (megaflops per second) of the GPU's, that would be a good indicator.
Absolutely! I run this on SLI and its smooth like butter!
I have not yet tested that feature unfortunately. The camera was a gift to my mom and I am still at the level of teaching her how to use the basic features before moving to the next level
The StoFen for the Nikon SB 600 is the OM-600. Search for Amazon model B000HDFXU2.
Well there is actually 2 cords needed to complete this set up, the 1st cord is an HDMI cord that goes from the Elgato to into the TV, then the other cord is the USB cord that goes from your Elgato into your computer/laptop. There is really nothing special about either cord, I would say it's probably 3-4 foot but like I said either can be replaced by buying a longer cord. Hope I helped
Yeah it will capture PC I've used it to record my laptop before.
This YN-565 flash has a built-in bounce card which pulls out for use. Push it back in when you don't want bounce. It pulls out inline with the flash head. The bounce card itself is not re-positionable to a different angle. It basically re-directs spill light from the flash back toward the subject.
Yes
Yes it will it is the one I'm using right now
I'm not sure technically if it's compressed but we run several high def monitors off of the splitter for our church services and the picture quality is great. Watch your cat 5/6 length, though. We did have some drop out and had to shorten our cables.
My FJ cruiser didn't have factory B.U.C so can't answer that but the unit works great in every other aspect. Very happy with it and the GPS (reason for buying it) its fantastic !
No. You lose the factory Bluetooth hands-free controls. The Bluetooth functionality of the unit is below the OEM standard; disappointing. The only steering wheel controls that work with this unit are the channel change, volume control and Mode change.
I don't remember. My screen went bad on it after 13 months (just after the warranty expired)
You can configure the drive however you like (raid 1 or 0) and it works stand-alone or daisy chained. It's a very flexible and reliable drive.
Yes you can. If you are going to replace the drives try to go with the same name drives or at least 7200 RPM.
It can sleep and wake automatically, but I always hard power down cause I feel like it will increase the life of it
I would not buy this item. The drive is one of the slowest thunderbolts out there. The drives are not user serviceable. If a drive fails u need to send it in. I experienced cooling issues with this unit as well.
yes it will fit,but check on Google to be sure.thats what i did for your computer and it say GeForce nvidia in option for your computer dell
No. The card is for desktop PC
No, only 2 of the 3 at a time.
yes
No , you need at least a PSU of 300w to handle a graphic card.
It's ready to go right out of the box. It uses passive 3d glasses so you can use the pairs from movie theaters, but the two that comes with the monitor work better. I heard you get better results with hdmi. The box comes with everything you need.
Yes. HDMI is a newer standard. Among other things, it allows one cable to transmit both audio and video, where the DVI will just do video. Because the HDMI can do both, it is far more common to find it in the home entertainment area. The HDMI connector is also significantly smaller.
I never did this
yes they are legal
The battery is internal and not designed for replacement. Short answer, no.
There's an RJ45 port on these so you don't need any card. It just plugs into your CAT5 cable like a desktop. But I would consider another: I was thinking about getting this one and the reviews made me think otherwise.
I have an iphone 4 and what I do is put it alittle then pull up and then slide it in ??
You can play all of the above
it is 1 year, per customer service
It has an HDMI 1.4 Port and it is an awesome computer.
I purchased mine in Oct, 2012 and I'm not sure but I think it came with an offer to try Office 2010 for a limited time free. I didn't use this offer since I had previously purchased Office 2007 for my laptop and installed it on this Dell All in One.
Hey Joseph, You can definitely add any video card you wish, including the 7570. Although I have to say the nVIDIA GeForce GT 640 video card it comes with is pretty capable of handling a lot. Probably not any extreme gaming but good enough to handle all programs in Adobe Suite, including Premier Pro. Hope that helps. :)
The "in" outlet receives your "phone" line from a wall outlet; the "out" outlet takes your line to your computer (DSL) modem, i.e., phone line to the "in" outlet, phone line from the "out" outlet to the modem.
It uses wall current and can use batteries. Wall current should be your primary source as batteries don't last very long in this device.
no
Yes that is exactly what we use it for. Be sure to turn off the sleep mode while watching.
Not familiar with Vivo but would expect if both ends fit, it should work. Did you change your Input or Source on your TV remote to the correct signal setting?
really? you got the camera Nikon Coolpix L810?i had it too and the filters fitted good when i bought this set of filters and adapters
The X400 has the traditional threaded connector as most cameras use.
No, you need to purchase one.
Yes
One year warranty- see www.twelvesouth.com for details. I've had one of my Book Books for about 3 years and it is still in great shape (the others I have are newer and still like new).
Which iPad do you have?
There are 5 "squares" on the spine. On the top one is black and reads "Book Book." The bottom one is red and reads "Vol. XII." Nice case. I get compliments on it whenever I take it somewhere.
BCM4706 CPU = MIPS32 74K Core (600 MHz), Integrated 512 KB Fast Net RAM
It is your access point, it handles all your wireless, etc..
Works with my Drobo 5D. Don't know anything about the FS.
Yes, but you should check with www.hgst.com to see what is left with the warranty stated based on the SN of the drive. Originally these drives carry a 3-year manufacturers warranty but many resellers use old drives (they are new) OEMS but that we're not sold and only carry a 1 year warranty. What I did was I purchased a Canope extended 2-yr. warranty for 19.99 each to compensate for the loss on the original warranty.
You can order the drive and verify the serial with HGST when you receive it. Just order it from amazon and you know you're safe (ships from sold from)
Sorry, but I don't know. I did try to add a USB drive and the router forgot about it's internal drive. I just had nothing but bad luck with this router. I still say I give WD 5 stars on their drives, but I don't think they should be in the router business.
Yes, we do have them in stock: http://www.amazon.com/Ceptics-Europe-Asia-Adapter-Quality/dp/B0084OIY0M/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1429557377&sr=1-5&keywords=european+adapter+12+pack
Yes.
Nah man, it doesn't.
No
Not long enough. And don't buy this cord. It's junk, although its supposed to be OEM. It won't stay connected to my iPhone 4s.
6 inches long
Should work just fine with a 13.3in laptop. It's meant for a 15.4in laptop. Anything larger or smaller is a bit cumbersome. The fan is quite noisy. I don't use the fan anymore.
My fan vent is also in the back. The chill mat is about 14" wide, so I think the Toshiba would fit. There are little raised pads that let air circulate under the bottom of the laptop.
Yes, it does come with the cable. One end is standard USB for you computer, The other end is mini-USB for the unit. It even has 2 velcro tabs to organize the wires going across the back.
No. All Schlage Nexia Cameras have proprietary firmware that makes them secure and unable to be used with other manufacturers Zwave or other IP systems without flashing with different firmware. Best to call Schlage Technical Support for any questions. There is a lot of good intentions and a lot of misinformation posted here. Also they continue to offer improvements and enhancements.
Yes, it works, I bought it for my wife's Toshiba Thrive. She has no problem with the card.
Yes,,, The 4700 has 1=PCIex16 slot, so yes you can!!!!
If it has a pci-x 16 slot on the motherboard then yes
The power supply must be 350W or greater (with a minimum 12V current rating of 20A). One card which consumes less power is the Evga GeForce GT 430 requiring 300 Watt or greater with a minimum of 22 amps on the +12 volt rail. The lower memory capacity has less heat but less gaming satisfaction, and it's compatible with Windows 7.
Yes, just connect cables to the two RCA input jacks located on the back of the unit. Use a cable with a Y from a stereo jack to the audio output of your TV, as for a headphone output. On the unit, press the Source button repeatedly to enter Aux/Line Mode, indicated by a white light. Or use the remote to choose the Aux/Line input.
60"X80"
No
No you can find that at tranducer shield .com it's called a traduce saver call them and they can help you every thing you need
We put ours on the belt and if the school protests, I will sue them. They have no right to deny my child safety. I have a girl, so belt is not always an option with dresses. We'd put it in the backpack, which is not ideal.
The device cones with an AT&T sim pre-installed that is specifically configured to work with the device. I believe the company has a pre-paid option if that helps.
That's what I use: "White". I really like it, because it eliminate the harsh effect of the undiffused flash, when taking snapshots in dim lit places. Restaurants, hallways etc. I've found no use for the other colors!
I don't have a Sony, but I have used this diffuser mount on 3 different types of cameras - each had an existing mount that could be used for an external flash (which, to my knowledge, is pretty generic). My knee jerk response would be 'Yes' based on the photos I've seen of your camera.
You can stop the screen at anytime
Mine was brand new and sealed from the factory.
It charges in a couple hours - I usually just plug it in at bedtime and its ready to go in the morning. You can easily get 3 FULL Phone Charges before you have to recharge it.
This should work for any phone, mp3 player or any electronic device that charges off a USB port.
I love the sleeve, however I do not use the plastic case on my mac ...so I am unsure. Wish I could be more help!
Should. Be only one. And dont know the amperage output.
Not sure if its water proof but it has been tough and done well in the rain.
no......I used the monitor I had from previous computer... HPx20LED......hope I helped
It works with any phone provider that provides caller ID info, so if you have a phone and get the caller ID information when a all comes in it will work. I use the "white" list which allows me to put in the numbers I want to pass thru, those not on the white list get hung up on immediately all they hear is a click and best of all I hear nothing. I love it!
Since you have to input each phone number separately, I don't believe you can just block a certain area code.
yes, VGA and HDMI
we use this in our camper--and if we want it louder, we hook up our Sony sound bar--it generally works in there, but it is a very small space...
The back of my set says only 100-120v; 50-60Mh! I think you will need a converter!
The speakers are about worthless but the picture is great! So add a set of external speakers and you're set.
No - should it? Coax to cable box only.
No I don't think so. The DVD player is self loading so it is built to handle regular sized disks.I think if it pulled one to small inside it would become stuck.
It did the first time. I havent tried it again since the last time when it didnt work. I just hooked up my old dvd player to it. The tv itself is still working great...
My Picture setting is STANDARD... Screen Size is 100%...Aspect is set to NORMAL. Try these setting and let me know the results please...
Not difficult at all. Carrying case can be held in one hand.
Hi Kate, I just purchased one and I would say yes. It is like a sleeve or sock that slide over the frame and fastens under the bottom tube of the frame. The back part is black stretchy nylon and would block most if not all light from the back. Of course you most likely would be using it in too bright of light.
Try the headphone output. This is working fine for me.
The screen is completely stationary. Unless you're horrible at screwing it to the base, in which case it swivels a bit.
Most depends on who you order from mine came with 3 ports but trust me get another brand of tvs.
You must have it on wide screen, reduce the image. I noticed when I first got it the picture was terriable, but when I reduce the size of the screen the picture has been perfect ever since. For the price we paid it's really not bad.
The speakers are on the sides-back of the TV.
I Had the same problem. I took it back. it was 1 day after my 30day warranty. they wanted to give me another one of the same, I said why would I go through this again. up graded to LCG. will never buy RCA again there where good in the day but not anymore
yes, 120 minutes
My Picture setting is STANDARD... Screen Size is 100%...Aspect is set to NORMAL. Try these setting and let me know the results please...
Yes, it does right next to the USB port
Yes it does. There are 2 speakers, one on either side of the stand. They point down, which could contribute to the poor found quality. I would like to update my original response too. I have since gotten into the sound settings. The tv offers preset options labeled dynamic, user, soft, etc. You can go deeper into those settings, however and adjust the bass, treble, and balance. Once I boosted the bass to 15 and brought the treble down low, it is so much better. I actually am enjoying it now.
Yea it will.
Does not record at all.
Yes- the light effect is very similar. I love them both.
Yes it is enter. By pressing it after you choose a pattern of lighting displays.
Comes with everything including rods and front support.
Yes. Easily strong enough
Yes standard sub output outlet
es ok!
Yes, they can listen music without power.
Made in China..
I only have one other case to compare it to. It is an older Tucano Second Skin. Compared to the Second Skin, this is noticeable thinner. If you are in need of a thick sleeve, I would look elsewhere. If you want a good basic thin sleeve, this will be perfect.
It would work for that too since its a 13 inch laptop and since it is fit to ultrabook standard
the company is veryyy easy to be contacted you could either go to their profile or call them and they answer any questions you have, I would hate to give you the wrong answer to your question. Hope this helps:)
It is 21 1/4" high.
The filters are for 49 mm, the close ups are for 52 mm and can fit 49 mm lens via adaptor which is included. I think for 40.5 should be additional adaptor which is not part of this bundle.
i did not look at return policy i plugged it into my comp. and have had no problems.
Yes. The S4 also fits in it. However, if they are in phone cases, neither will fit.
I haven't tried it myself, but I've seen many reviews that say it doesn't work well; some games work, some don't.
I own 3 of these, and I HIGHLY recommend it. Yes, this is compatible, but you need to buy an HDMI to VGA(or HDMI to DVI) http://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Active-Female-Adapter/dp/B00879DM56/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1388371894&sr=8-2&keywords=hdmi+to+vga+adapter
Mine has a bright orange display against a dark backround
In normal use it is a good device. If you are driving in a convertible top down at 70 mph it probably won't meet your expectations.
It did come with a charger. I'm pretty sure it has a manual too. If not there's one online.
It is still unlimited data. They charge $39.99 for the slower speed & $54.99 for faster speed, but with either, you get unlimited data. I should add that I only did the activation online, not in a store, so stores might have different pricing.
I am not so sure that the glasses are compatible with anything. Mine were defective when I received them and would not turn off. They are a piece of trash! Good luck getting them to work.
I do not know if it can be paired to two devices.
The Syllable G08 does an excellent job of noise suppression. Overall it is a good value. The only negative is the excessive bass.But that is tolerable.
If iPod nano has Bluetooth, Yes
Yes you need to plug it into a USB port to recharge it.
I dont know in your proyector, but in my proyector, I have to enter in the proyector's settings and then choose 3D mode, and pick a mode left-right or up-down, it depends, on what kind of 3D your movie is
It would depend on the size of keyboard and how you rotate the tablet if a keyboard could fit. There's no actual slot for keyboards. I have never seen the Logitech Ultrathin Keyboard Cover so I really can't say whether or not it will fit.
nope! that is the problem on this model. but phillips has a better one with night vision.
Yes
Yes, that is the one I use. This will mount to the back of the X-Grip. You will need an extension and base to mount to the other surface and may require another one of these depending upon which base you select.
This card will only drive two monitors. Worked well for me with the dual configuration.
From the website: Minimum of a 350 Watt power supply. (Minimum recommended power supply with +12 Volt current rating of 18 Amps.) Total Power Draw : 49 Watts http://www.evga.com/Products/Product.aspx?pn=01G-P3-2621-KR
yea definitely :) bought it as well!
Hi, This has a Lenovo specific port in the center which fits specific Lenovo models. I had to modify the docking station to fit my Lenovo model. Because this docking port is Lenovo specific, I highly doubt that it would work with any other models - IBM/Lenovo always had company specific solutions and were never generically interchangeable.
yes you can but make sure you download the amazon app store its a third party app store not google play
you can use a mini usb the flat one used for phones
No. An adaptor is not needed. you plug your laptop power cord into the port replicator
yes
No, it's not compatible.
If you are wondering whether you'll need to upgrade your power supply, most likely you won't. My computer took the card flawlessly without upgrading anything else.
Yes, it does full bridge mode. In the configuration, under Device Mode, choose Modem Only. No, it is not ipv6 compatible.
No
I'm sorry but I don't have an answer for that, as I have a different model and don't want to give you a wrong answer. Perhaps you can consult the Lenovo website?
There is a 3.5mm Aux line in connector of this docking. So as long as your device has a 3.5mm Aux line in and cable of 3.5mm male to male line, you should be able to connect two devices, play music thru your touchscreen. Thanks
Yes, it charges iPod
Yes I have the same model laptop and it works fine gives a backup of 100-120 mins
It keeps light out. It can be reversed for storage. Makes the camera more compact while keeping the lens with the camera.
Mine screws on to the filter threads.
I am using this: ASRock Z87 Extreme6 LGA 1150 Intel Z87 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard
No ios is too low
Not that I have discovered how to implement if it is available within the four corners thereof.
It is a dv7t-7000.
yes, download a program/player called VLC
Good question
3 usb 2.0 ports. I have used an external usb dvd drive but not tried playing media. External hard drive works too, but have not tried media play on that either.
Yes it plays cds. And has a cf burner in it.
If you look at the comparison graph a little below the product description, you'll find that it does have a built in webcam. The product picture also shows it though it may not be the easiest thing to see. It also has Altec Lansing speakers, which are good speakers and reading a couple of the comments, it's obvious they sound good by themselves.
Blu-ray?? Naaa, is too cheaper to come with blu-ray!! Can play blu-ray ripped videos like MKV extentions or Mpeg with Xvid or DivX compression, but not blu-ray disc phisically!! Sorry!!
It definitely will if u have a smaller selection. I have over 800 songs. I would still suggest backing ur music up. I think it's light weight will be a + as well. I say smaller collection because this laptop is definitely well rounded for personal use. If it's strictly music (non video & pictures), it will be solid. I'd also suggest staying with the Windows 7 this laptop comes with. It's way more solid & reliable than Windows 8 or 8.1. I hope I was able to help you out.
No. The HP Envy 4-1030us does not comes with an international warranty. You maybe able tom purchase one from HP. Do know that if you decide to upgrade your hardware or software (Windows 8 etc.), your warranty will not cover any problems or issues that occur with your laptop.
Yes it does fit nook HD+
I highly doubt they sell replacement parts for this. It would be easier and probably faster to get another power cord from RadioShack
Hey Katrina: I wish that I could answer that for you but I can't, because I use a 16g sd card and I'm constantly reviewing and deleting recorded footage so I really don't know. I'm sorry :-(
No
I have the iPad 2. Is there a size difference between iPad2 & air?
It does plug in but does not charge your phone.
Yes it comes with a 3.5mm audio cable.
I'm not quite sure. If your HTC has a place to connect ear plugs then I would think it would work. It comes with the connections. All I did was put it in the hole where I would normally plug in my ear plugs and the music will play.
I was offered an inexpensive warranty option at purchase. TV is a good deal. Shipping was fast.
Yes
Yes
Unfortunately yes. some in ThaiLan
I purchased one of these and after 2 weeks of striving with it , I sent it back. I was at Costco and saw a wi-fi signal booster that you just plug into the wall which would help with this issue;Called "amped signal booster"Item #629754 This brand 9Amped) is also available at Amazon and is the way I am going to go.I would avoid the YWA-10! Best regards.
Please check all the connections and replace with a new power supply. If the problem remains please send it back. Thanks!
The front plate is approximately 31" wide. This mount is compatible with the bolt hole width of 26".
Hi. Jesus. Those headphones seem to have a narrow band as seen on the web. The replacement cushion fits on my headphones snuggly which was good. For the price I would go for it! If needed then some foam could be put under the cushion. The snaps should face away from your head.
those are real photos of my device
I bought a separate keyboard
Acceptable. It's no Apple touchpad but it's on par with other Windows Ultrabooks and seems reasonable for the pricepoint.
yes, it does.
Unfortunately, I can't answer that specific question but I can tell you that this model is one of the most unreliable computers out there. I've had to send mine back for repairs 6 times in 15 months: 3 times for keyboard malfunction and 3 times for battery-failure/heat issues.
No, it only has an unkeyed trial version. It badly needed a new touchpad driver, but otherwise it's a great laptop.
No, it's not.
I honestly don't know
Yes,it will work.
The "14-42m II" is the Movie-Still-Compatible (MSC) version. If there is not a "II", it is the earlier non-MSC version.
Yes you can. It has an AM/FM Radio. I haven't listened to the radio, but if it works as well as the player, it should be fine for casual listening
From the first line of the Technical Details: "With pre-order, your credit card will be charged for the protection plan at the time of purchase, but your coverage will not start until your Kindle is shipped" Seems pretty clear to me.
4 watts x 2 and 8 watts woofer output
That's exactly what I did, so I would assume so!
Key to the answer is whether or not Amazon does business in El Salvador. If it does, suggest you buy the protection plan with your El Salvador address. I believe in buying these plans. You should be able to change your account address to your planned El Salvador location at the time of purchase.
Hi, Carlos! The Kindle is an Amazon product. Local stores sell FOR Amazon. I also bought mine locally at Best Buy and registered with Amazon. I buy my Kindle content from Amazon. I did buy my 2-Year Protection Plan plus Accident Coverage from Amazon. I think it is a wise choice to protect your Kindle!
The coverage is for two years protection additional to the one year manufacturer's warranty to repair your broken item. The additional coverage protects your item to be fixed if you break it in an accident, i.e. drop it, spill water on it.
Looks like it will work just fine based on the measurements I took of mine. To get a 45 degree angle one end will be 3 feet off the wall. Just something to keep in mind when planning your space.
yes I would definitely recommend it, after I received this product I realized it was better than I expected it was easy to install and I've had nothing but compliments.
yes! it'll work perfectly i have mine on a 40 inch lg plasma tv.
Yes it will
No. The cable is not compatible with the MP220. I returned it when it didn't work and I'm still trying ot find a cable that works with the MP220.
Not all sellers re offering shipment to Italy. Please contact us directly we do ship to Italy. TR Authorized Seller
I did not experience the problem of the battery not charging. Make sure the battery is seated properly in the computer and make sure you have power to the computer. If it absolutely does not work, contact Amazon and return it.
Yes
It would depend on what version of Serato you are running. Please refer to the link to see the version that this system can run. Bear in mind that this system is not upgradable to OSX LION or higher. It is as upgraded as it can be OS wise. I enjoy using it, but it can be difficult to find software as this system is a bit dated. The production date for this model is 2007-2008. Very good system for the money, though. I hope this helps! http://serato.com/downloads/scratchlive
I bought this for my grandson and he doesn't live with me. I would suggest you Google the Laptop and see if they have details about HDMI. Have been really happy with this laptop (he says) and especially liked being able to purchase with Windows 7.
No splitters are necessary, all you need is an ethernet hub/switch.
yes and no. If the attached PoE device is 10/100 - no problem. If the attached device is a gigabit device- link will not be established - if the switch managed - then force the ports to 10/100 - then it willl work.
Yes, Any iDevice that uses the 30-pin connector this is compatable with. Which means any device that isn't iPod or iPhone 5 will have the 30-pin connector. So, yes this product is compatible with the iPhone 4S. Hope I was of help!
Not at all! I purchased three and basically threw them away rather than waste the time and money sending them back very disappointed
yes
It comes with a wired external mic. Mic placement is key. I've found the best place is on the instrument cluster as it's away from road noise and the recessed cluster catches your voice. You'll have to adjust mic gain for the best sound quality.
My Sony works with my blue tooth phone and also a few other items I have connected to it. As long as it is blue tooth it will pair with anything.
It will automatically launch and play the last station it was on.
Hi Gabe, Here are the compatible apple devices to this device: iPod Classic, iPod nano 1st through 5th gen., iPod Touch 1st 2nd gen., iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S. Passenger control not available for iPod nano 1st gen. or iPod with video. -Anthony
Yes, that's what I use it on.
I have the Sony NEX 3N and this adapter worked great!
If the nikon lens is md mount it will work
we want speakers close to are seating
Do not purchase this Bluetooth adapter. It never worked and it was replaced and that one didn't work either. Worst purchase I have ever made on this site.
one only. tried this and it did not work. ended up giving the extra speaker to my daughter.
yes, it is recommended. however, if they are all on the same circuit but on different breakers, it will still work. it will NOT work if they are on entirely separate circuits
Yes it should. I have used a bunch of sim cards from all over the world with it. You may have to do some profile configurations to get it working on some carriers, but I have only had to do that twice.
Yes it is very self explanatory. Just put sim in slot under battery and hook up to computer/laptop it'll pop up go to set up new device.. That's it!!
There is a slit in the back that would work for the pole from a ceiling mount.
I really do believe it will.. there is room left over on my TV.. works great too.
Currently this brand is only available in 32" and 42".
Are AA, and it can recharge. Its good
I'm using that same soundbar on a Vizio tv with 400 x 400 wall mount layout. If the samsung has that same pattern it will definitely work
We use WiFi with ours
WolVol-1.2ghz, singlecore. Nabi-1.3ghz, Quadcore Nvidia Tegra. Wolvol-800x400 resolution, Nabi-1024x600. WolVol-1gb ddr2 ram, Nabi 1gb ddr3 ram. WolVol-4gb Nand flash, expandable to 16gb, Nabi-16gb emmc flash expandable to 32gb. WolVol-2200 mAh battery, Nabi-3850 mAh Lithium-ion battery. WolVol-Wifi, Nabi-Wifi+Bluetooth 3.0. Is that enough reasons to cost twice as much?
Go into the Google Play Store. All the apps you need are in there. Same as an Android cellphone. If you use up all your memory you have to get a 16 gigabyte micro SD card and insert it in the slot in the back of the tablet.
yes
It comes with the mic in the picture. I think there were options for a tie clip mic (purchase separately). I wish I could be more helpful. I found the headset to be lightweight, comfortable, and not too conspicuous when presenting. Try googling your question with your mic info and the name of this brand, for compatibility. That helps me. Good luck.
should be on the bottom of the mouse.
The non-hd kindle fire (both original and 2nd generation) do not have the micro-hdmi port that the Kindle Fire HD does. So unfortunately, this will not work for you.

You can play the various video formats you mentioned on the Samsung Galaxy tablet by using any video converter by dragging and dropping your videos into the application, which automatically converts them into a size and resolution that's perfect for the Samsung tablet. You can use the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet video converter. I think it can play in 16:9 aspect ratio if in landscape.
Yes-search Grace Digital and call their CS department-I've found them to be very receptive.
yes
on stand it is 12 inches tall, without stand (for mounting purposes) it is 10 and a 1/4 inches tall, the width is 13 and 5/8, the screen is 6 1/2 X 11 1/2. I use it as a karaoke screen, its perfect
It is on the left side of the TV.
yes it does but the sound quality of this unit sucks
open up the little door on the bottom of the unit. That is where the controls for the cassette player are. There is an eject button there
I installed this hard drive in a CECH-4301A. At first I had a bit of an issue assuring it was properly inserted but as I soon as I did, the hard drive works fine. Funny thing though - I was never prompted to install a system update from my USB drive like I read about.
It should work on all PS3's. And is fairly easy to do so.
Yes
Watson Sony Battery charger for P F V series batteries. Available at quite a few on line retailers including Amazon. Link is to the Amazon listing. http://www.amazon.com/Watson-Compact-AC-Charger-Batteries/dp/B00EHST958/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1397447451&sr=1-1&keywords=Watson+Compact+AC%2FDC+Charger+for+P%2C+H+%26+V+Series+Batteries
Just an FYI for anyone who has a similar problem, all that needs to be done is download the latest graphics drivers from the AMD website (we are not allowed to link external links here, else I would direct link it.) The default Windows ones don't seem to have everything up to snuff. All units produced after 12/15 will not have this issue.
They have a standard 1/8in headphone jack, so yes. Using headphones to go to sleep is dangerous because the cord can wrap around your neck. You may consider another option for bed.
Yes these cameras will work with DVR B00L2YNCM6
Zone 2 allows you to play from a different source than Zone 1. You can have Zone 1 playing a movie on 7.2 Surround while Zone 2 can be listening to the Radio or playing from other sources (some limitations apply, so you need to read the User Manual for details). Party Mode is used to listen to the same source on both Zone 1 and 2 at the same time. Typical use would be listening to Radio or internet on all speakers when you have a party at home (hence the name "Party Mode").
I am not sure abut the music enhancer, I just know it sounds great, I do know the VIDA chipset definitely has improved the video display, in general very happy with this receiver and would repurchase. Mike C
SENA does sell a dual pack with two sets in a box. Part number is: SPH10H-FMD-01
DAFUK is that?
The SM10 is a universal Bluetooth hub. I used it for my two helmets on my wing. You do have to plug it into your audio device though. It worked well for what i had planned to use it for. I am ot familiar with the Spyder, in regard to the bluetooth functions.
If the fairing has a 3.5 mm audio out jack then this will connect to it and transmit the audio on bluetooth. This is a transmitter only and will not receive audio through bluetooth.
Yes, you must press the button to initiate the intercom function. Once activated you can talk back and forth. Do do not use it like a ouch to talk button. Hope that helps.
I bought it and no it won't work.
Sorry i have not tried the pen as yet.....
It really works in any country,just insert a Simcard(pre-paid),and follow instructions.
Yes
Most weather apps use location data and/or a GPS signal to ascertain where you are,thus providing the current weather.This tablet is not equipped with a GPS or cellular antenna so it is not able to run weather specific apps.
As long as your TV has a standard VGA input, this cable will work very nicely for you.
Yes
I don't believe to have notice any lag.
Yes. Very well. My head phone cable is about the same size.
Yes, it is simple and fast as a mp3 player
I had poor results with this brand. I also bought the Term Leapfrog remote extenders and they work much better. I would not recommend the Monoprice.
Just plug into Satellite or cable box and also into electric outlet. The second one goes to remote TV and is plugged into an electric outlet as well. Very simple setup. My Direct TV remote works with it. I just point it toward the remote and it changes channels, etc.
I'm sure its the reular number of pins, but I am not sure it used the extras for power to charge the Nook quickly. Without the light on the plug to tell you it's charging or green whencharged, I really couldn't tell. B&N lowered the price on the cable to $9.95, so I bought 2.
I could not figure that one out. The power button does not work on my unit. Based on the horribly written instructions and reference to possible problems with the power button I inferred that the manufacturer knew there were problems before they sent them out. When plugging the unit in to charge there were lights indicating that a charge was taking place. Other solar charging devices that I have use a led light to indicate that the unit is charging.
It's junk. Don't buy it.
It charges the battery.
With mine, they did. Nothing should prevent it from working.
Yes
I do not know but the day time color is off.I left a review about them.
Nope. The only apps you can use are Netflix, YouTube, Vudu, and Pandora, and there's no USB port or Bluetooth.
mark, The only battery that will display is the ones made by canon. Although other batteries can be used they will not show up on the display.
I never remove the case. It doesn't cover up any of the openings/slots in my MacBook Pro 13. As a result, I assume that it gets all of the ventilation it needs.
What magnetic strip? There is no magnetic strip that I use with my case.
Only if you buy the right wiring harness
It most likely will. It's been a while since I had to deal with this problem, but if you want to get your turntable working, the cost is reasonable and worth giving it a try. If you have a problem installing this, type your question on Google and a video should come up with very clear instructions.
Not sure! Technics is made by Panasonic, so I thought this one would work and it did. Might want to look up Pioneer's website and get the belt #. Good luck!
Kim, Joshua has the best advice and have your son or you follow his instructions. If all fails contact Amazon and let them know the problem and you can get an replacement right away!
Push down or Flickr the. Radio button until Youvhear the tv
No. This is a gaming headset.. It's engineered only for games. The sound quality and its chat quality in playstation and Xbox is unbeatable but don't expect it to give you the same results via any other media source
The memory was never a problem. It was how the whole thing functioned. It was horrible even for an adult.
Yes, the tablet was still under warranty.
"Purchase" the app on the amazon app store. It is a FREE app. :-)
Mine is made in Japan
Yes it is without going thru a computer. I bought the Apple SD card adapter for the iPad, hooked it up to the iPad, took the SD card out of he camera, put it into the adapter and after a wait, depending on the photos in your SD card - the photos loaded into my iPad. It was great as I was able to view the photos that I took everyday that eveneing while I was on holiday.
Soon English will be last on the list LOL ;(
Looking at the front of the unit, the hdmi port is under a cover on the right side. It is right next to the power input.
It works perfectly well with the D3200 and the D5100 so I would say, definitely.
No the gt2 is wider than the gt3
Yes, mine does.
As of writing this, Walmart.com has a ship date on or around 6/25/12, Vizio.com has an arrival date of 7/9/12, Microsoftstore.com has an arrival date of 7/15/12. I would be willing to bet you can find it in stores at Walmart (and maybe Sam's Club and Costco) before the end of June. And online orders will be shipping around the same time (arriving shortly after).
This computer was bad from the start. Fan stopped working after about 8 months. Ruined the motherboard. Had to get rid of the whole thing.
http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_trksid=p5197.m570.l1313&_nkw=vizio+adapter&_sacat=0&_from=R40
Yes, Vizio will give you one if you request it on their website.
Batteries only.
No -- you have to flip the cassette over. For the price, I guess it's all right, but really this is a pretty terrible piece of equipment. (Very cheaply made.)
Well, if you mean the in-dash radio that also functions as a GPS, then yes. If you mean a standalone gps, then no. In order to ensure compatibility, check to make sure that your factory or aftermarket radio has an RCA video input jack. More likely than not any aftermarket radio with display will have one, but often times factory radios are a bit more tricky.
This remote works with both devices. Needs to be "linked" in the "Remote" section of the "Settings" section in each device. You"ll need to either do it on the device controls on the unit or another remote to get to the "settings" area...
It fit mine and works well.
Not really, it wont fit in the slot. I have to take mine off or just lay it on top.
In the product description it states, "Expiration date always 1 - 2 years ahead of the current date"
I do not do "gaming" and have little experience of it. Have a feeling though that if I did and wanted to be serious about it, I'd get something with more "horsepower". Good Luck! Hope it helps.
Yep, works great with BF4, bought it for a buddy.
Yes, this is compatible with Windows 7. I would recommend the Radeon HD 7980, if you're purchasing soon. It can be found for about $30 more and is a fair bit faster. Based on the APB: Reloaded recommended system configuration, the HD7770 video card can easily handle running the game. You will want a quad-core or core2quad CPU and at least 4GB RAM as well.
Standard PCI Express with a single-width x16 graphics slot. Mine just plugged into my PCI Express slot without issue and the card works great.
it should work normally I install this card to windows 8 computer and its working good I use the HDMI
Most def! I've used this model on Time Warner and Suddenlink. Love it :)
Comcast told me it would not work with their system.
Yes, it comes with an AC adapter, ethernet cable and a USB type cable.
I'm not sure what you mean by the term "AC adapter". It does come with a power unit allowing it to be powered by plugging it in to a 110 power source like a wall plug. Without the power unit connected, the uBee unit does nothing. In fact, when I want to reboot the uBee modem, I unplug the AC connection for about one minute and then re-plug the connection.
I don't see why not, as specs say it supports displays up to 40lbs. With larger screen TV, you will probably lose some degrees of turning freedom, as side of TV will touch the wall.
Yes, I have no problem running QuickBooks. As a matter of fact, I run more than one version of QB for different clients. But beause I spend hours at a time making entries, I prefer to use a full size keyboard and mouse with the laptop.
The version lava-computers sells is windows 7. Non touchscreen. Please check my exact specs under item condition. Cheers!
Ok, I just checked and yes. This will charge a kindle. But please note that the kindle I tested it on was the original kindle, the old one. This will also charge an android phone, Samsung galaxy pad, an iPod, iPhone and iPad. Seems like it will charge everything. It even works my battery charger.
when I got mine I had to make minor adjustments. the little cooler fan had a protective cover on top, so I had to take that off on another one not this one I hacked sawed a little bit of metal so it could fit right try it its a great product works fine for the price. I am glad mine worked I hate returning things.
Yes does work with any iPod does not work with life proof iPhone case
Probably would, especially since newer TVs are lighter. Nicely built.
Ever since D-link updated the firmware, this cam moves easily with an Android phone. This D-Link Cloud cam is also wireless and there is no charge to use the mydlink.com website to view it unlike Drop Cam. We rely on D-link Cloud cams for our home security and they all perform very well.
All of these other answers are wrong! As long as you have the H/W Version B.1 you can talk to people on the viewing end of this camera. You have to do it while using mydlink.com. There is a microphone button that you click on and you have to activate it in settings. The audio quality is questionable but it is a two-way audio camera. I use it quite frequently to annoy my wife.
I'm 99% sure it will it's very universal. I had some doubts about my Favi and it worked fine.
I'm having the same problem, let me know if you found a solution!
no, you have to use rechargable batteries or normal batteries.
yes when you log in to router with 192.168.1.1 (default) username: admin (default) pass: password. there is a option called wireless settings in that you can give your wireless a name and assign passphrase so it can be secured and nobody else can use it.
Best answer is here: ftp://downloads.netgear.com/files/WNR1000_SM_WW_23Jan09.pdf The short answer to your question is this. It doesn't matter what kind of computer you are using to set it up, nor does it matter which operating system you are using. You will use a web browser to do the setup, as described in the setup manual above. The only thing I would caution out about is that you use a standard browser. Explorer or Firefox or Chrome are all good.
I live in a dorm with all concrete walls. I have no problem with the connection, even with thick wooden doors closed and on the other side of the room.
Yes, any Canon EF lens will fit the Canon EOS 350D, so this lens will mount onto your 350D.
yes
I contacted Amazon yesterday and he said they will get some in 7-10 business days, but I dont know if it will go back "In Stock." I ordered mine on the 6/21.
They are both image stabilizing but the ISTM also has a pretty silent motor so that you don't hear it focusing during movie modes.
Yes it has a 3.5mm mic input.
No a antenna was not included or not needed.
I don't know. I use it only to be able to use my laptop in another room. This way I don't annoy my wife. I am not that computer literate.
If you have time to set up the shot first, you could practice changing focus, keeping track of where your fingers are at either end of the shot. If not, you might have to zoom in very quickly, get focus, then zoom out quickly to the framing you want. If you have an assistant, they could handle focus for you (small piece of white tape to mark both distances on the focus ring). Auto focus tends to be more of an issue in low light.
No external mic. Built in yes.
Not AP130a, it's the AG AC130a. It does have the upgraded autofocus and does a decent job. The camera is awsome.
yes
yes, mine did!
This isn't a 'Smart Tv box' or similar. It takes an HD video signal from whatever source and outputs it to your 2D TV or projector enabling you to watch in 3D. Both Side-by-side or Anaglyph red/cyan type.
Just go in to the program menu, find sirens, and there you can set how long you want the siren to sound when activated. You can set it anywhere from 1 - 999 seconds
I don't believe AT&T has sim cards. I already had T-mobile service, so that is why I selected that vendor. You can choose any vendor that issues sim cards. as for basic line services, should be like 10$/month. The unit will accept line lines if you already have one, but if lan line is cut by intruder or service is down, the unit will not call out.
If correct
Yes. It will take an HDMI signal input and split it so you can play it on 2 different TV/Monitors.
it will mirror the image to all 4 outputs
Hi wayne no it would not work with 118/119 ,there is a special circular lnb for 118/119 you can get it right here on amazon the strong lnb's are for leaner sat.
There was no Silver available when I bought mine, but based upon the specs, I would say there is no difference other than appearance.
I have fully charged ten completely dead smartphones with my Satechi 10000, before it needs to be recharged itself
No. The X2 needs the 45 watt 19v 3 pin 4.5 mm connector. It does not charge from USB.
55
Yes
Yes
It should have no effect on your phone provider's service. The device works from your home. It blocks the signal as it enters your home. Make sure that you read the instructions carefully and thoroughly.
Yes
i have it in a lenovo yp410 and it working fine
Hi Jessica, I'm Jewel with Kingston Technical Support, here to answer your questions. Our part KVR16N11/8 meets the general specifications for your system and generally should work. We recommend part number KTD-XPS730C/8G which is a branded memory module made specifically for Dell systems and guaranteed to work. For any further assistance, please call us at 1-800-435-0640 (USA and Canada only) M - F 6am - 6pm PT and I or another available Technician will assist you. Thank you for selecting Kingston.
No bluetooth
Yes, CS5 runs fine on this laptop so CS6 should be no issue.
Per the packaged box, 350 is the minimum wattage.
All regions are automatic for DVD. They must be switched manually for blu. Mine did not come with instructions or the code to switch it. I found it after some searching on line. I also posted the new code in the reviews. Hope this helps.
My Orei Player does not play region B discs. Only plays Region A.
When this happens to me, I just hit ok or cancel and then try again. This usually works. What I would suggest is an email to the Belkin tech/support team. Unlike a previous comment, I've found them responsive and their suggestions usually work.
Yes. The app is about $10. On 3g looks ok, 4g would be better but the most important thing is to have a good signal.
the pen is 4 inches long. Yes over 3 inches.
As long as you have a PCI-Express slot, yes. I forget now, but this card either uses PCI-E 2, or 3. If it is 3, then running it in a 2.0 will bottleneck your card (Not too badly, though). Otherwise, not a problem. I can't find your motherboard model anywhere, otherwise it'd be very short.
http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=2456#ov http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4217#ov I don't know, but the links to Gigabyte may help.
What I see on the box says it is compatible with 3.0 motherboard, which means it's backward compatible. Should be just fine pci-e 2.0.
Yes. It is a type A Male USB connector
The adapter is designed to be connected to a computer, not a PS3. I do not have a PS3 so I couldn't try it to see if it would even be recognized. My guess is no.
It fits the standard fire perfectly so I'm thinking it will not fit the HD. I think they are different sizes.
Yes, I love my case. It makes my kindle feel heavier, that's the only drawback.
The short answer is yes. You only own it, DirecTV will charge monthly for the privilege of activation and only do so with a two year contract. If you are going to do it, do it now before AT&T owns it as rate hikes are slated if the gov't allows buyout.
I have a genie going to four rooms with Tivo to two more. You will need to add a switch at the point of wiring to get the Tivo unit to work also ( so that it has a separate feed to the dish). If you just plug it in where a c41-700 network box is it will not work. If you are replacing the Genie, then it will work. Network availability, just like the Genie is also required for proper functioning. Hope it helps.
Yes, they do
Utll all depend on your level of wifi speed. The tablet works fine with good broadband
Yes, it come with a charger and plastic cover
one for power and the other one is for a usb to ac adapter. if you dont want to siphon off power from your laptop.
Atiq, I don't remember if it has/had a one year warranty. I will say that for the price this is an awesome cooling pad, well worth the risk mine has been through a lot of wear & tear not to mention a move with me from one side of the country to the other. It is a great value warranty or not.
yes, you'll need the hdmi cable, this is merely an interface / "plug" to the hdmi cable
For me it did not. I returned it after wasting about three days of knowledgeable investigations and tests.
Yes it does.
I've tried the Blu-ray and it didn't work, so no it doesn't play blu-ray discs. It does play regular DVD's and I LOVE the quality of the playback; the screen quality is really good I think.
Hi K. Wedderburn! Maureen here from The Friendly Swede:-) You should have no troubles with prints on the screen, never heard of it happening actually! Also these skins/keyboard covers are made specifically for Macbook 13" Unibody / Macbook Pro 13" 15" 17" / Macbook Pro 15 With Retina Display** / (please note the Macbook Pro 15 with Retina Display IS the LATE 2013 release version), so you should have a match! If there's anything else, just let me know. I can be contacted directly via this link:
yes
Yes you can but to do so you must purchase the model with the information window on top of the unit.
what is pal region
Yes...I have the same one....works great!
You can't select tracks from a thumb drive. The songs will play in the order they are listed. You can, however, skip over a song.
For the KB800PB-US-20, there is a 20 inch wire connecting the keyboard halves. I haven't measured it exactly, but you get about 19" of separation based on where the wires attach. (If using the hinge clip, the top corners are attached and can pivot, but not separate. It's easy to remove the hinge clip, though.)
Don't know
Shouldn't be a problem
According to the specs page on this site, it does up to 400 Mb/s (megabits/sec). NOT 400 MB (bytes), which would be 3.2 Gigabits/sec, as someone else answered. But 400Mb/s is more than enough for any cable internet provider in the U.S., unless you have Google Fiber.
this router is like all others. if you set up the wifi with WPA2, you will not have issues with anyone using your wifi. remember to change the admin password of your router also.
This monitor is wonderful. It sits in front of a large picture window in my office at home and I don't have any problem with glare.
I have Mac OS X 10.7.5 and it worked with it.
Actually, you don't even need the HDMI. It will work fine with a VGA cable and speaker cable. My wife's Windows 7 Inspiron runs it with no problems.
Yes.
It's so useful and good.
4 per system
My experience is whenever the laptops cover is closed, regardless of plugged into the Dock Station, it puts the laptop into sleep mode, would be a great feature, however, don't think it functions that way...
It should as long as it has a USB 3.0 port!
I would doubt MS Server 2012 would install as this PC would not meet minimum hardware specifications. The same reason it won't install to a laptop PC.
As I understand it never
Unless they added it in the last firmware update, no it can not. I gave mine to my mom last month, but as if the last update it could not talk to Amazon prime videos.
2.5 inch, no room for an 3.5 drive you should go with the SSD, its easier on the power supply. I am not sure the compatibility between sata 2 & sata 3, the box has USB 3, that is good. I was surprised to see the box run win server 2012 when we loaded it as a domain controller.
The base is about a foot wide and about 8 inches deep.
I can re verify when I get home & check, but there are 3 ~ one on the left (if facing the screen) and two on the right. I have my wireless mouse dongle on the left, which keeps the two on right open for other things.
The Intel Core i7-3770T only comes in tray so the cooling fan is not included.
look by pic on your car, radio built in special shape/integrated in dash. dont know until removal radio and see what inside, and what need to modify
It fits in my 2002 Ford Explorer....goto YouTube and type in the name of this JVC RADIO ON HOW TO INSTALL....Guys and Company's are all the time putting "How To" videos on YouTube. Or! Goto JVC.com. They should be able to tell you what it fits. GOOD LUCK!!! It's an awesome radio for the price!!!!
Its just the case (monitor) and the power supply. You have to supply everything else.
hi Sercan, Wifi antenna is built in but module is not. you need to buy intel wifi module. In my case, i bought intel AC7260.
It doesn't come with anything. It is a barebones system. It is however, prewired for your display, side panel ports and webcam.
This it's just the shell. If the remote insides line up with the shell, it will work. This is not the remote itself.
It close with a magnet . The elastic strap is also close with extra security. It works both ways. I like to place the heavy side on top just to have a better closure. Either way will work just fine. Thats just me. Ihope this willhelp.
In order to use a Bluetooth adapter your television would have to have Bluetooth software pre-installed which isn't likely if your TV isn't already Bluetooth capable.
Hello, FYI, I returned this same item for a refund. It didn't work the way I was expecting it to. It may work better for you though.
Yes, you can make it work. But you should note that according to Prolific's website the chip in this device is counterfeit. I recommend sending it back for a refund, but if you're like me - it's way too late for that. To get it working on Windows 8 (or any other version of windows for that matter), follow the instructions on: leftbraintinkering.blogspot.com/2013/05/usb-to-serial-prolific-2303-device.html I tried a lot of different drivers, these are the only ones that worked for me.
Yes. Go to the Prolific web site or type "PL2303HX driver" in Google.
hello friend thank you for your inquiry yes,the item is ship to Germany have a nice day Emily
This product is trash.
Yes-I play CDs on it and it does a great job.
The package states that it is a "Replacement Battery for Canon NB-11L" and is "compatible with PowerShot A2300, A2400 IS, A3400 IS, A4000 IS, ELPH 110HS, ELPH 320HS and all similar models."
It appears to be the same. This isn't shipped directly from Amazon, though, so it's up to the third party seller to decide on their shipping costs. Don't forget to add sales tax. Apple seems to be the better deal right now.
Hi, I have a NUC model DC3217BY, with firewire and I have used the apple thunderbolt adapter with it. For it to work you will need latest Broadcom Ethernet NetXtreme Desktop/Mobile drivers. You can download them from station-drivers web site. This will give you gigabit networks speeds, way fasters transfer rates of the obtained with any USB 2.0 to Ethernet adapter.
Not in and of itself, but if your computer does not have a cd drive (like a MacBook Air, retina MacBook Pro, current Mac mini or IMac) this will allow itunes to read and rip your cd and then convert to mp3
No, this is simply a CD/DVD ROM which is connected to the Mac computers by UBS. In other words they saved lot of space from inside the computer by building USB Superdrive outside. A new idea, but the PC Computers are also using it. Buy an external hard, I always do one TB for every computer! I hope this helps!
No
It is as shown with the cable coming straight out of the side of the macbook. It is not the style that exits toward the back.
Yes it will read a flash drive
it is the radio
a battery comes with it by default, mine didn't come with a memory card.
Yes it does!
This would probably work although it's not very durable, so keep that in mind. There is a headphone jack connection and also a place for batteries so you don't need to use the USB connection.
Plastic
My case has the VIPeR head emblem on the lower right corner of the top cover. My receipt has this listed as a VPR premium. Hope this helps
you can see it on the second and sixth image of the product
Yes, considering its size it does a very good job but placement is very important as is true of all indoor antennas. Attach additional coax cable and move it around in the room. In one location in a room I found it even did a good job on VHF channels 7-13 where most indoor antennas fail. Considering the price and size it does a very good job bringing all local channels at a distance of 25 airline miles.
Have you charged it? The keyboard has to be charged first. Then once it's charged, on the side there is a small (you can barely feel it) switch. Make sure your ipad is set to bluetooth.
I don't see how this product relates to that goal.
Yes it comes with the corel painter essentials 4
Yes and it works very well.
Yes
It is a dual core i5 processor.
Yes, if it's marked as new, it comes with a 3-year Lenovo Worldwide Depot warranty. You can also add Lenovo onsite and/or accidental damage protection plan.
Nope.
As long as you have a phono input; you do not need a preamp.
The 24-85 is an excellent lens that I use on my D700. However for a DX camera the 18-55mm VR is an excellent optical performer,lighter and costs less. It will also provide you with a wider angle than the 24-85. Keep in mind that the 24-85 on a DX will have the focal equivalent of 36-127mm.
No. Works very well.
This lens is available with a Sony mount. It can only be used on a APS-C sensor camera (the A-77 has an APS-c sensor)
Yes this will work with the Pentax K-x. All the latest Pentax DSLR (except the 645D and Q series) use the same mount. So it will fit and function as it should (as well as Sigma programming allows). You may not have some of the exif info that you would have used a Pentax made lens but beyond that you shouldn't have any problems.
No, this comes with 60ft of wire.
I'm not sure. I ordered extra cable to be sure I had enough and didnt install it myself
Connect to any video in on Tv or monitor
It works good at a macro but because it is a zoom with AF, it can be difficult to use it as a 'true' macro lens. I prefer to use this for wildlife and landscapes but I have used it for macro. Use the MF if going to use for macro. I hope this makes sense.
I do own a 18-50mm on my Rebel.. and this one is for my Nikon... But I really can't distinguish any differences since I am pretty new to the hobby. But I find it very easy now to just have one lens on all the time .. with my canon I would always have to keep changing from my 15-50mm to my zoom lens a lot and it takes too much time plus you have to carry another lens with you. So far so good.. its a really awesome lens.. and all my friends think its cool!
Yes.
yes. it fits model A1475
No. The iPad 2 and iPad fourth generation are the same dimensions. The 1 is a different size.
Yes, great purchase...get rechargeable batteries. I love as I fly a lot and very comfortable.
No you need to look up a smart case or cover that specifically fits the iPad air on Amazon
Yes it fits ipad 2 perfectly.
Yes you can stand it on two different sides of the triangle. Works really good. Love this cover.
My case is not leather. It is some kind of synthetic material. I just use a damp cloth to wipe it clean.
No it is too big
Yes it works.am using it with a viewsat
Yes! 5.1 still works fine, I haven't tested 7.1 but I expect the original audio stream is passed straight through so anything that works over HDMI should work through the box.
The signal is sent to both outputs all the time. You can use either tv or both at once.
Yes, I would think so. Have you tried reversing the cables in the ports to see if the other unit gets sound? Also, try switching the cables on each unit. Could be a bad cable or port.
Fanless
Soft scrimped white overlay in front...no gels or color masking
There is no option to choose a recording speed. It copies exactly as recorded on the master disc.... and it takes only 2 to 4 minutes.
If 3D and HD are the same thing then yes, it pays all three formats. Netflix, YouTube and Internet ready. It can get wonky and have moments, but so far this replacement has worked out!
Just on and off
Yes on top there is a port where you can plug the reading light into an outlet. I tried my baby monitors charger and it worked on it. This is the charger model I have and you can find it right here on Amazon, hope this answered your question! http://www.amazon.com/UpBright%C2%AE-Adapter-GPE060A-060080-1-Monitor-Charger/dp/B00KA415KA
If you want to be able to set aperture on a G lens, you need this one I think: http://www.amazon.com/Fotodiox-Adapter-DX-Type-Fujifilm-Mirrorless/dp/B008BBI72I
Lens adapter is a metal ring that fits between a camera and a non-compatible lens. It enables any lens to be used with any camera.
My Nikon D200 did not recognize that there was a lens on the camera when I tried to use this adapter. I have seen other reviews that it worked for other people but it did not for me.
No, see that blue little thing, and 6 circle indications ? You turn that to choose one of 6 stops . No exactly aperture number will show on camera screen. Fully manual focus, manual aperture control with 6 stops
I haven't. Flares really shouldn't be a problem as you are only extending the distance from the rear element to the sensor. My setup doesn't exhibit that problem
I am sorry :-( I dont know photography gear very well I only know that it works fine fitting m'y 50mm Nikon on m'y Canon 5D mark ii. dorry again.
It would depend what the lenses are. there are 2 adaptors for Nikon lenses. I know because I accidentally ordered a different one from Fotodiox before this one.
Not sure, I use the adaptor on a manual Nikon lens for my T3i and 70D The AF feature of the lens might be disabled however, you would need to keep it in manual mode
I agree with Juan J's answer. The lenses I tried were Minolta, Maxxum, Sigma, Quantaray and Tamron and Sony Alpha, and they worked okay on a Canon 7d and Canon Rebel both digital and film, but not as well as when attached to Maxxum or Sony dslr cameras. To reiterate, the lenses need manual focus and aperture on Canon EOS cameras.
No, this was designed for the Canon EF 100mm f/2.8 L II IS. I do not have the lens you quote, but from the pictures online, I does not look compatible.
I just got it in the mail today. Unfortunately didn't weigh it before assembling it. But it comes packaged nicely in the duffle bag and I would guesstimate that it weighed 35 pounds. I'm an average height, strength guy and I could quite easily carry the loaded bag with one hand. It's more awkwardly sized than anything.
Yes it could be... be sure you research exactly what you want before you buy. You may need different items if you are going to be indoor only vs. wanting to take these outside. Overall, as a beginner you could probably make this work in almost any situation because it's decent performance, light weight and quite portable.
Yes
Yes, its a plug in. I havent had to replace mine yet.
I have not maxed it out yet however I have put 20 pounds on it and have no issues I don't think 50 would be pushing it either... it is certainly not made out of titanium and I don't imagine it was made for heavy duty use at this price, but for small money it holds more than expected, as long as your expectations are reasonable.
Pull the top pole all the way up till it comes out of the hole.
I have this stand and it's awesome but you need to buy the clamps seperately.
No, you will need to install the drivers. The link to the drivers can be found at: http://www.satechi.net/index.php/computer-accessories/network-adapters/satechi-bluetooth-4-0-usb. For further assistance, please email support@satechi.com. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
It does. It comes with instructions showing you how to install for Windows XP.
Hi, this item can't support the MAC, it can support with these systems: Microsoft Windows 2000/ XP/ Vista/ Win 7, hope this will help you.
Yes, you can.
I do not have any 3D source to test it but the Sony store website does say the following: 3D pass-through capability allows you to enjoy Blu-ray 3D movies, 3D video games and other 3D content with compatible players and HDTVs.
Yes. Of course
use a microphone with a stereo jack, like one used for a computer. my unit grounds out when using the mic jack.
In theory, you can, but I will take some work. You would need to switch it to running Linux, then recompile the Minecraft stuff to work on ARM instead of x86. That requires the source code, which I'm unsure is available.
Yes it does.
I believe I do still have my manual. I'd be glad to look for it and scan it for you. I would just need to know how to email it to you.
It is 4" high - This will most likely not fit into a space smaller than 4-5 inches high.
About 3 to 4 ft.
Yes, it sure does.
Not very good. Down but not straight down. And up but not straight up. I don't know the exact range though. Sorry
No it does not
I set my heart rate range and it beeps when I am not in that range, I don't remember how I did it though, the instructions were a bit confusing at first and now it's just set to go.
fans directed right at the chips (bottom) and heat sink (top)
I guess that depends on your case, I have a similar closed loop water cooler on my cpu also, so yes. But getting both radiators installed in my case took a little ingenuity.
It is compatible with a 4g GSM.
Yes
I'm not sure.... Depends on which model of otterbox you have. If the back has ridges it may still work. I use mine on a leather case from piel frama. Have also used them on silicone and plastic cases and they worked great.
Not sure. I use it on a D 5100 Nikon
Good and timely question. I just tested my iPhone 4S running iOS 7 and ported Netflix video and sound to my 24" monitor without issue. Did need to remove the iPhone from its Belkin silicone bumper shell to get a solid connection with the 30-pin plug. This adapter is definitely in my travel bag.
Amazon does sell a lightning digital AV adapter....I believe it came from Apple. I bought one several months ago for husband's 4th gen and it works great.
Yes, but to be honest the quality of sound isn't really any different than the mic on the camera. If you're going to buy a shotgun boom I would shell out a little more for something better.
Yes the shielding on it sucks I don't use the mic any more. You can try and use a better XLR for it it helps a little
No power switch. Just a plug and they are on. Because of the occasional feedback I unplug it when I'm not watching a movie.
GT 620 M on mine.
No. This adapter is for connecting a laptop that has an HDMI (output) port to a regular monitor that has a VGA (input) port.
approx. 3 feet.
No, It actually is garbage does'nt work in any configuration. i threw it out. don't waste your money
Never tried live tv, but video is fine in Netflix app downloaded from Google Play.
There is always the chance you can get a lemon--no matter the brand of TV. All I can say is that I've owned 2 Sceptres for a year and can report no problems.
I did not have time to use all of the features on this television before the picture tube went. I still have not heard from the company or received my property back. GREATLY DIS-SATISFIED with the product and the service.
The one I bought was a used one that was shipped broken and these guys took care of it right away. Other than, out of the bad, I don't recall any warranty. Sorry
dont know but i doubt it's very hard. ask google or youtube, they have just about everything.
yes
Yes it will. Make sure you install in an area you can plug in your laptop to do updatrs
No not compatible
I don't have this radio so I don't know.
Yes, same model I'm using it for
My hubby loves his. His had an issue and the company replaced them in a week. We haven't had an issue with them since.
Not the one I bought. If you can find the one for your exact model you should buy it! These are way better than snap on cases! Mine works great!
This is a 2012 Model Panasonic Plasma, and all 2012 3d Panasonic Plasmas use Bluetooth (NOT IR) for Active Shutter 3D sync so these glasses should be compatible with any 2012 Panasonic 3D Plasma.
I am uncertain about that.
I don't know. I am using this with Panasonic Viera 3D TV through RF connection.
Yes
I would go and look but the speakers are at my other place. Nevertheless, the controls for pairing, volume, and tone are all on the rear of the speakers and I access the controls frequently rather than go inside to whatever I have them paired with. You would be better off with a wall shelf. I can tell that these speakers have great sound!
Don't get these speakers are overrated and underpowered. Lots of distortion.
the wireless stick is not included. It has to be purchased separately. It pairs up with you home computer and allows you to stream the content from your computer via your home router.
Not that I'm aware of. The playback features are pretty basic. They haven't update firmware in quite a while, don't know if this feature will ever be available.
Not overly glossy at all, my main screen faces my ceiling fan directly and i have no glare issues from it on the screen itself, whereas i can see each bulb on the fan on the much more glossy bezel. I have no glare issues at all with it.
The best connection is with the DVI, this will give you the fastest response time and the best picture as it keeps it all digital. I only use these on my computer and they are great. Hope this helps.
VGA and dvi are both present. Amazon shipped mine with the wrong power cord.
Yes, but it won't look as clear as straight HDMI.
you don't actually need it for your cablework with either Roamio. I strongly suggrst that you call Tiiiivo and ma ke sure the Roamio works with your cable system and then talk to them about using the actiontec MOCA. some cable and satellite systems wont work with Roamio.
Yes
Hi IT D., Part number KVR16N11K2/16 can be either standard height (30mm) or very low profile (VLP) height (18mm). It is currently most commonly manufactured as VLP. Thank you for considering Kingston ValueRAM! -Jewel, Kingston US Technical Support
Yes
I had no problem. I ordered a replacement. When it arrived, I found a video on line that showed step by step what to do. You just have to be careful with the wires. It took less than an hour.
That's a good question. I can't find any information about warrantied. I assumed since I bought it directly from Amazon and not a 3rd party person it would be warrantied. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
for me it was working fine. notebook which i had to fix was too much broken, i had to remake some parts and so on but bios was working probably. i don't think monitor to be bios problem...
yes
Yeah it's working
I would contact Samsung Customer Service - they were very helpful when I had a minor problem with my laptop!
Yes
I have not had that problem. Works just great for me.maybe your Internet provider
It's kind of universal, so long as it fits over the flash head or reflector. My dynalite heads are like 5 inch, I think this was 6 or 6.5. Measure your strobe and double check the spec to be certain.
No its specifically designed for studio strobes, it a heavy speedring and would likely damage an on camera flash
Hi Willy, it is ASUS original. my one bought here just had some issues and I sent back for repair so they checked serial number and it is original Ciao, Andrea
The tablet I have is for WiFi only. But some do work with AT&T 4G and 3G.
No this just does direct scaling
NO. You cannot access Netflix or create a link that will work. I have spent some time on this and the only streaming sites I could reach were mostly the built-in chinese sites. Do not count on the manual either to help you, it is one of the least useful I have seen for such product, documenting the obvious, and silent on the rest.
Mine, already had the thumbnail view when I turned it on. If you add the artwork in JPG format to the same folder in which you have your video files then the thumbnail will display the artwork for the thumbnail. Keep in mind that the video file and JPG file have to have the same name. Hope this helps.
Mine is metallic silver with white keys.
I bought it for my trip to Europe in Sept thinking it would be great instead of lugging a laptop. It WAS for the first week but then after that it started falling apart and the plastic ON button broke off so I couldn't get it to work at all. By the time I got back from my trip it was too late to get my money back so I had to drop it in the recycle bin. I wouldn't recommend this - needs improvement!
Yes, you can. I actually have done it several times. As long as you have a Mic input in your PC there shouldn't be any problem.
It's basically made for that exact purpose. It's perfect for interviews.
this is navigate
Try the card in a few other computers, or different brands to figure out if the problem lies in the card itself. BTW, theoretical top speeds are never achieved in practice. See Wikipedia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_device_bit_rates#mediaviewer/File:Speeds_of_common_interfaces.svg
We use it with our desktop:). We love it, works great!
Not sure what "issues" exactly means. But the vendor does give a waranty on the chip. Just contact them.
Dont have exact weight of the crane but its not heavy, especially when in its individual components. The amount of weight you'll use to balance depends on what you're putting on the end. I use mine with a Canon 5D typically. 2 5-pound weights is plenty. Had a RED digital cinema camera on it for a day and that required 20 pounds.
No. USB adapters only transfer data (files like documents, pictures, etc.). This product will not project your computer screen, no matter the age of the TV. In fact, I have no idea why a product like this was ever made. Do not purchase it.
I used this wire in my house. It is stamped "CM/CL2" on the wire every few feet.
40" long, 6" high, 4" deep (all approx)
It worked great for a 1998 Toyota Camry but we had to call customer service and get help from them for programming...you need to make sure the dimensions are exactly the same as your key and if it is then it's worth taking it to a locksmith and paying $4.00 to have it cut. The Toyota dealer wanted $100 which is 90 percent more than I paid...if it doesn't work you're out about $10.
No they are not. If you can run wire in the wall there is a way to have them appear wireless with the brackets they provide. I also ordered a nicer bracket that I decided not to use because of visible wire
14 would be fine. Im running 14 with banana plugs with no issues.
Just to output the audio into the radio so it is louder. You cannot charge the iPhone with the radio.
I don't have a problem with this. I use it in a classroom to capture the lecture and class discussion.
I found no need for one.
My laptop is about 5 years old. I went on ebay and bought a VGA cable that had the audio jack (3.5mm plug) atached to it. I used this from the VGA jack on my laptop to the converter, and plugged the audio jack into the head phone jack and into the converter. My picture on the TV is pretty good, I would say around a 8 1/2 to 9 right now. I just bought the LCD TV and am still tweaking in the picture part of it. Hope this helps.
Hi Nate, I'm Jewel with Kingston Technical Support, here to address your question. Our part number KVR13S9S8/4 is compatible with your laptop based on it's general memory specifications.

Thank you for selecting Kingston as your upgrade partner.
You have to check what kind of memory does your computer need. This is DDR3 There are DDr2 and DDr1 after that you need to know the mhz this is 1333 check your old memory and read the spec that it shows on the sticker
I install larger sticks in slots 1&3 (ch 1), smaller in slots 2&4 (ch2) .
Hi John, While this 4GB module does match that PC3-10600 specification, it is not compatible with the Dell Inspiron 560 desktop. That system only supports up to 8GB using four 2GB memory modules. We no longer manufacture memory that is compatible with that desktop. Although, you might be able to find the discontinued compatible 2Gb module, KTD-XPS730BS/2G, from some online resellers. Thank you for considering Kingston ValueRAM! -Jewel, Kingston US Technical Support
Yes this should work perfectly
they are used.
I bought mine they said refurbished which I can believe but I don't think they are replicas or fake
That photo is a stock photo, posted by the original seller to create the listing. All other sellers simply list under this listing. We're unable to replace these photos with our own however I can tell you that the pros are in excellent condition.
These are not wireless
The head phones I purchased didn't come with anything and they were in horrible condition.
yup
It's hard plastic. However, the outside has that soft rubberized feel.
yes please we need some pictures ;)
They shouldn't be interchangeable. For TTL to work properly the flashes have to be engineered for each brand. I'd send it back and get the right one. It's a bargain of a flash for the money though. You'll be happy.
They go into one of the ear pieces. The Beats logo needs to be pushed and turned.
I am 6" normal ears and they barely fit, they get uncomfortable after 1 hour, sorry cant give measuraments
Hi Saadia , mine didn't come with a warranty probably because they were returned and resold to me at a reduced price ( $60.00 ) . There's a round section next to the earbud on one side came apart on mine & I had to glue it back together with super glue , however they still work fine though .
They are the original. Came in the Dr. Dre box and everything.
I'm sorry but I don't know the answer to your question.
Yes and greater stability to boot. I went through several routers and am VERY happy to have ended up with this one. Excellent web interface and wire-speed performance.
Unfortunately, this model is NOT full HD; if you look at the specifications, it says that the resolution is 1366 x 768. This is still a nice, premium ultrabook though. Hope that helps!
The keyboard was horrible right out of the box. The keys stick because of poor construction. The keys are on a plastic shaft that fits into a hole. The plastic on the key shaft would rub against the plastic in the hole. The friction caused the stickiness. These keys were not made to move up and down smoothly. I would guess that all of the keyboards of this model will have the same problem. It's a manufacturing defect.
Yes you can
Im not sure but under manufacturer details /description it lists the measurements so you may be able to tell from that. Sorry I didnt have a simple yes or no.
You can still use music streaming with the iRad.
No and it has the wrong cable with it the one i recieved!
Yes, I video skype with my daughter and wife often when I'm in the office. I don't know if I'd consider it HD, but it's definitely good quality video (I can easily see the painting/pictures/crafts my daughter made in school) and the audio is very clear. We downloaded the skype app from the android play store, logged into our skype profiles, then "called" each other. Haven't had any issues with skype either.
If you are experiencing a freeze up, just wait about 10 minutes and try to restart by holding the On/Off button on the top corner for a count of 10. That has done it for me. I try to "clear" records by touching the double screen on the bottom as I think the memory can get jammed.
Yes. I installed the video card in my Inspiron 539 with no trouble. There are several short helpful videos on YouTube that show the process. I've been using my desktop for about 2 weeks since the installation.
Yes it was included
No this is the windows version.
it only comes with 2. Amazon has an adapter that'll give you 2 more for 3 bucks as an add-on item. Search for molex to sata adapter
Yes, the keyboard does have a rubber dome.
The keyboard has a nice responsive click and the keys pop back up nicely. Mine isn't squishy at all.
When I purchased mine, it came with the power jack for the back of the amp and the other end had stripped wires.
Hi Gem, I have had the Honeywell L5100 in service at my house for about a year now with no problems of any kind. I have both cordless and mobile phones as well as internet and all work fine. Thanks, Donnie
It will. Mine is the newest one, 32 gb, (as of today).
I'm not positive which generation my husband's Nexus 7 is, but I bought it in December 2012 and this case fits. He loves it.
On ballistics site but it is $20.00 and a new case that comes with it on Amazon is about $25.00 buy a New case from Amazon
I don't know. I have a Samsung galaxy 3
No it doesn't.
Yes. I do the same.
I have no idea. I have an S3. If the item is the same as what I have and if the 5 is the same size, then of course. But if the 5 is any larger, I'd say definitely not.
It is made of silicone, but the silicone is only exposed on the corners. I slip it into my pants pockets and purse all the time and I do not have an issue with it sticking. It has been a great case for me. I am glad that I purchased it.
The different designs are from different merchants. You can also do your own image.
Yes, it fits very well. My wife and I both have one, and like the duribility and the low cost of them compared to the Otter Box. I would totally recomend it!
Clear protector is a waste of material but is removable.
You have to install an NVIDIA graphics card which is compatible with it. Check the Hp z220 quickspec for further details. I have installed the NVIDIA Quadro 2gb graphics which support 2 monitors. http://h18002.www1.hp.com:80/products/quickspecs/mobile/productbulletin.html#spectype=worldwide&type=html&docid=14286
It works very well with my Vera lite. There are detailed directions online outlining how to set it up with a Vera. Be sure to follow the directions exactly to ensure all features work.
Not yet, but I think they intend to support it in the future.
the tablet never worked or was dead when I received it.
yes, usb to computer.
yes as long as you have an HDMI cable
Sorry but no, this is a switcher, not a converter. Search on "HDMI to "Your TV's Connector (like coax, component)" converter"
Are you asking whether this switcher will work on all of your equipment or if it will work without AC power? If it's the former, then yes. Otherwise, the answer is that the switcher WILL work without AC power but you will have to switch it manually. As soon as you plug in the IR receiver, you require additional power.
Purchased this for my daughter to hold her T4i with 18-135 lens. It is a close fit, but it does fit.
You could but, it would probably be easier to install the crossovers that come with these
You don't have to enter a password every time it's used, if that's the concern, and is better than having neighbors nicking your signal.
Yes, you will need a modem if you plan to connect to a signal from a provider. The provider will supply the modem when they install their service. If all you want to do is connect two computers together or a computer to a wireless printer, then you do not need a modem.
Yes, the storage memory is 2 GB
Yes there is a camera. Yes you can email from it. You should buy extended warranty from squaretrade. Samsung and windows are close but those are better. Ipad is the same as Samsung and windows.
It is for the 2014 edition.
No airplay - just a USB input.
My experience with adapters so far is the autofocus has not worked. Your camera is totally manual
No. Not this model. It needs power from a USB connection also. So you need a Mac or PC computer, or perhaps a Microsoft tablet with a USB port. You need a model with a video output, preferably, with an HDMI connection.
Yes. I normally take pictures of lecture notes and send them to my students.
Looks like it's a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1": www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-GT-N8013-Slate-Tablet/dp/B009PIE2NE
Matte. Doesn't get a glare. Very Good Instructions.
It should. I have it running an IBM M13 on a Win 7 machine and it was plug and play, with the keyboard's trackpoint and everything working as intended. For giggles, I plugged the same setup into my Galaxy S3 with a USB to Micro USB adapter and it worked the same. If I had a ball mouse around here I'd try it out on my Win 8 laptop just to check, but I don't know of any reason that your ball mouse wouldn't work under Win 8 with this adapter. I hope this helps.
I measured my case and its 7.5"H X 6.75"W X 4.5"D
Yes it does. Make sure you tell seller it is for a Cannon. I very seldom take it off anymore ....Love it.
After I fully charge the unit, I play 36 holes every Saturday and have some charge left with no problem.
Go to the Izzo website and send them an email requesting the course you would like. Be specific with the name,address, and zip code. They will reply when it's available. You'll need to download the latest update from their site.
The yardage is direct from tee to green, straight line. Does not do dog legs.
I guess it is only thru amazon. I bought 3 of them and had a problem with one. It would not come on one day. I reset and reloaded to factory spec and it's ok now... very poor manuals but love the product...
HBO Go? Absolutely! It's available at both Google PLAY and the Amazon Appstore.
yes
Yes the one we own does.
Yes, this comes with a remote control. Although initially I gave this system a good review, I actually wouldn't recommend it. It stopped working for me after 1 week and I had to return it. It was stuck on standby and I couldn't even retrieve my CDs before sending it back!
Seller 5-Year Warranty.
I don't think it is compatible. The S5 uses a USB 3.0 connector. This dock is for the older Galaxy models that have the proprietary Samsung connector interface.
No not at all, it's only 4 inches wide, it can't span your lap, it will fall off.
I agree with Eric. I doubt the interface has changed. I suggest buying it from a reputable place where you can return it if not satisfied That way there is little risk to you.
No. This is a USB cable. A Kindle Fire HD can broadcast to your TV with an HDMI cable (regular to micro). A Kindle Fire HDX could use this USB cable with a Miracast-enabled accessory (e.g. NetGear Push2TV wireless box).
Yes
Yes, you can. However, expect a VERY SMALL performance drop compared to pci e 3. Only about 1-3 fps. I have the card and love it! I highly recommend!
i have never tried that but i linked it to the dlink app and that rocks
yes you plug into the wall but don't bother buying. it dies in 2 months and I've had constant reviews saying the same thing
Heads up these have a habit of failing. On pluging this into my 360 it is saying its not a Microsoft certified disk bla bla bla, but it seems to work.
Yes
Clearer sound, better quality and more balanced. Also they have a different material. The original tracks have the SOL emblem just decalled or painted on, but these are actually engraved in.
It has one PCIex16 and one PCIex4
no they will not. I purchased a set for my nephew for Christmas and within a month one of the earphones was not working properly. They would not honor the warranty.
On my Galaxy Note 10, the Play/Pause seems to be the only feature working. Minor sacrifice for the quality though.
Yes. And yes, but they are produced by Alpine, and whether they will continue to provide updated maps, and how often I do not know.
Yes you can wire it to your horn.
The dialer requires a land line to dial out of. Once the connection is made the host can then call any number that you program to the host. Including cell phones.
Yes, this is fully compatible with Windows 8.1.
i would say the moment you purchase it and arrives would be my guess
Yes it does!
I'm not sure what an otter box is - however the iPad alone fits pretty snugly into the holder.
Yes it comes with art range too!
yes it is "pressure sensitive" but for sure not like the intus, anyway i am not using it for illustrations to be honest, but i have both bamboo and intus and i like them both..
Only stupid questions are the ones not asked! Yes, it comes with a pen. But not a pen holder, which is odd.
yes it is .
it worked great with my galaxy s3 10.1
The only difference is software so I'd say yes.
Yes, I installed mine and worked like a charm.
My camera 750cam-us pro is connected to a Swann DVR.
Yes it can. There is a small amount of lag though.
Yes
Built in NIC card and Wifi...connects effortlessly to your home network
yes
Hi, thanks for contacting us. This card will work with any computer that has an AGP 8X card slot on it. If there is anything else I can do for you or if you have any other questions please let me know. Sincerely, Chris Nickels Red Planet Trading
YES IT WILL
Not sure if you mean warranty or how good product is. I think its a 1 year product defect warranty. As for the amp, its the best one ive owned. I have it hooked up to 2 alpine type r subs n they are crisp n clear at a high volume and really put out alot of power. The only down side is the amp gets a little hot after about an hour of use, but I live in arizona n have only had that problem when its over 110 degrees outside
Yes
The audio doesn't work on mine either
Not sure, I haven't tried it but it seems like it'll work
I used it with my Toshiba laptop
We offer free shipping to US continental street, thank you.
I am not sure because when I received the item the port was broken. It won't charge.
Are the batteries in the remote new? Are you running the latest firmware? Is your power cord in good condition? These things have all been problems for me in the past, which once corrected resolved all problems. Hope this helps, Peter
I have never tried to access the other menus. Or at least I don't remember as it's been a awhile. The camera defaults to camcorder once it's turned on. You might want to cycle through the menu a few times to see if you can locate the other commands that you're interested in.
You can use it as voice chat with the PS3. But it won't play game or movie sounds. Just voice chat. Only the official PS3 headsets play audio.
Yes it does work. With cable better quality stereo sound.
Yes they are - but they are available elsewhere on Amazon for $229 - just type in Monster beats headphones!
The claims aren't
The Dr. Dre Beatbox must be turned on before you can bluetooth the stereo. If you leave it on it will pick up if you link it to your phone or ipad through bluetooth. It also works as a docking device for your iphone.
yes it does it will also work in xbmc media center which is way better than the windows media center.
The only advice I can give you is to search for hp windows media center remote online. Mine worked right out of the box but there were no instructions. Hp has a users manual (1 page) but there are several possible sites with troubleshooting advice.

The screen has two RCA inputs, which can be connected to any compatible source. You would have to toggle between the cameras, though, because it only displays one input at a time.
That way out the back door or more professional ways would be to go out through the fire wall and under the car or if your make and model has them....run to the skirting on driver side..there should be a couple of access holes along the door frame for just those upgrades.
This item is made very well. It would take very rough treatment to get a "tear up" to happen. If you purchase this item, be sure to read ALL INSTRUCTIONS for getting a proper seal. There is a test to use BEFORE PUTTING THE PHONE INSIDE to make sure it is water proof.
Inside the back cover.
We did not experience any difference as long as its kept clean.
The lifeproof came with an attachment that you use to screw into the auxiliary cord part. Thus piece is made to work with all auxiliary cords.
Yes
Yes it does. It only works with the HDMI inputs though, according to the manual. I haven't tried it yet. Get back to you in a couple of days.
I think 'NAR' = North America release.
Yes it will fit with the double din install kit. I installed it in my 2002 Volvo S60, with some modifications.
It should work with any brand as long as your units have both input/output ports of this type of jack. It is a universal Audio video cable with a single pin jack. Hope it will work for you. Good luck.
Yes it does. Tiny adjustments need to be made sometimes, but all in all, it fits nicely
The device itself does not need drivers (at least for Win7). On mini CD they have software which is used to display video on screen or record it. If your notebook does not have CD drive then you can simply copy contents of CD to USB memory card. Case your notebook do not have USB then you can zip contents of CD, upload to file sharing hosting like rapidshare.com and then download it to notebook. Good luck
I don't think so. This device is meant to go from your cable box or DVD player to a PC or something with the USB port.
To the best of my knowledge a USB port always functions as exit and an entrance. My PC doesn't connect to the TV as well that's why I got this device (August VGB100). Simply connect the device to your PC through the USB end, install the software which arrives with the device, connect the TV/VCR/Camera with a RCA cable and digitalize your shows.
Works fine with my TV; straight out of the box. Great product.
I'm routinely using it for 3 to 4 hours and still has a charge. Guess I could probably go 4 1/2 to 5 hours. Definitely was a good purchase - at least for how I use my computer.
Charmaine, I cant's say for sure but my whole model number A505-S6005 was in the list of computers this battery fits I also see your A505-S6025 in that same list if that is any indication.
Hi Natalie, I actualy purchased 2 of these in the last year the first was from "TR Authorized Seller" and it came with extended piece and lasts about 3 or more hours, the second one was purchased from "BTExpert" and has extended piece, Same 8800 battery but can barely get 2 hours of use. I also Purchased a smaller one with out the extended piece from"Bay Valley" and It works over 2 hours. It seems that every time you purchase the same Item on Amazon you get a different supplier which makes it hard to compare quality. Kenric
US version.
The camera comes with one.
No I had trouble with mine and ended up buying a new key from the dealership
This one comes with 64 gig. There is also a 32 gig model. The seller updated mine to the newest version of software so I think I saw that it had 57 or 56 gig still available when I got it. So I would say there was 7 or 8 used.
Really? http://www.amazon.com/Apple-MC707LL-Wi-Fi-Black-NEWEST/dp/B00746UR2E/ref=sr_1_4?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1342734666&sr=1-4&keywords=ipad+3 You could also get the 32Gb version and get a 32gb micro SD for $30. ... or get 2. The extendable storage through micro SD was a big selling point for me.
No.
They will take you order, and when the product is available to ship they will charge your card or account.
yes, I had a slingbox solo and this uses a standard ethernet connection. You should be fine and speeds should be fine as well.
You have to sync it to your iPad after you charge it there is a code it will give you to type in and you have to turn your Bluetooth on and press the Bluetooth button on keyboard
Yes.
The remote releases are specific to the camera model. You will have to read which models each unit fits. I had to buy one for my T3i, and a different release for my 6D (which also matches my new 7D).
Yes, it works fine with my D5300.
On my d90 and d3300, it does take longer intervals. The idea is that this will hit the shutter release button for you at any time interval you set, so u can put it on any setting. But make sure to have the focus on manual or it'll refocus every shot before taking it.
In the instructions, on the back of the cover page under product specifications it states: Power adapter - Input AC 100-240V, 50/60Hz, Output DC 5V, 600mA.
You know, I actually sent it to my mother as a gift so I am not sure. Sorry.
I don't know exactly but it IS limited. I put 650-700 photos on the card the first time and it would only read just. It showed those particular photos over and over again (not anywhere close to all the photos on the card). I went back and put only a dozen or two on the card and it read them OK. I haven't had time to find out exactly how many it will read on the card yet. Sorry.
It depends on the size of the chip that you install. I have a 32 Mb chip and have over 500 JPEG photos on it. It is truly an all day photo album.
no, worst piece of crap i've ever bought
I have shot footage in 1920x1080-60p http://vimeo.com/album/2541490/video/75558936
One.
SAMSUNG Spinpoint F3 ST1000DM005/HD103SJ 1TB 7200 RPM 32MB Cache SATA 3.0Gb/s 3.5"
I do not have it. I returned it
OMG NO!!! I haven't even heard of such a thing! I know I have only had mine about two months but, I wouldn't have gotten it if I had heard of something like that. Sorry that happened to you
Thank you for the inquiry. Since it is a store in Japan, it becomes the dispatch from Japan. Sending by express is also possible. Thank you for your consideration.
Yes it will work as an access point..It does have an rj-45/Ethernet connector.....You must check either the Ubiquity website or YouTube for video tutorials on how to set it up as an access point though..
Nope. It is the right one. https://dl.ubnt.com/datasheets/bulletm/BulletM_Ti_DS.pdf
I have used the Sony F970 as it seemed to be the only battery that would boot up the screen. There may be adaptors that I'm not aware of.
Not sure. It is pretty loud itself. You may blow the speakers inside if you do.
In the night....
The Unifi Controller software only needs to be running in order to make configuration changes, or install updated firmware to the device. Unless you want to utilize the Guest Wireless setup, that requires the controller to be running for authentication. Yes you can do seamless hopping as long as you are using the same SSID/security setup and operating on a non overlapping channels with non Ubiquiti APs.
According to the specifications, the power required is 5 amps.
So much easier to use a phone for the initial setup (turning off the SIM PIN and a few other things)
Not in my experience. I have to use an audio cord as well :-)
Yes (SECAM is a very close friend to PAL) but the unit is a piece of junk. Buy something else.
Yes it can
Yes. That's what I have it on right now.
I do not know if it will work on the SX10
Yes James, as long as you decide what mm size you want to use! I prefered the 58mm adapter ring, this info is available in the Canon online operaters manual! Just make sure you specify the camera number (SX50 HS) when ordering any after market devices!! PS: You may already have 52mm (or other) lenses from another camera, get the correct adapter ring, and use lenses you may already have!!
The size is much smaller than the big jambox, the sound is not as loud because of the size but in a good size room at the loudest volume it is much louder than the smaller jambox and a cleaner sound.
Yes, both the iPod touch and iPad are Bluetooth compatible and will work with the Pill. Also there is a input for a wired connection for devices that are not Bluetooth capable.
Did you charge it first?
Yes it is Bluetooth compatible...
Depends upon which version. The latest version does.
I did not have any problem with shipping ... now about the dimensions you are talking about the dimension lens or box size ?
Thank you for contacting us about our bundle! In regards to your inquiry, the lens comes with a 5-Year Nikon USA Warranty. We do in fact have extended warranties if you are interested. For more information about our available extended warranties, please contact our sales department at 800-991-3350 EST.
made in Thailan
No, same as the R9 270.
No. Check the site and see http://www.asus.com/ROG_ROG/MAXIMUS_V_EXTREME/specifications/
Thats what i have in mine and it works great. Beware though i have had mine for 5 months ish and the seams are starting to come apart. But yes ut fits chromebook
Not if your model number is not listed in the ad. Look through all the Samsung batter ads and find one where your model number is listed.
No
Dimensions are: 95 x 65 mm, about 12 mm wider than Arduino Mega. 35mm thick when hooked up with Arduino and Shield.
It will fit, but the 5100 meters through the lens sensors, so you'll have to shoot it in full manual. Go for it. It's a digital camera, so learning won't cost you film, and you'll become a better photographer for your efforts.
Yes sir. They sound AMAZING.
Yes, if the radio is on only
Only if it doesnt have a case on it.
Sorry - I wish I could help, but I have no idea. If there is something specific you know I could look for, I can let you know if it is dockable.
Yes, it works fine on my ASUS TF700t. Sure better then the 3 foot one that you now get if you order a new power transformer/cord from ASUS. The original I received from ASUS was 6 feet, but when I sent the unit in for repair, they didn't return the 6 foot, just a new 3 foot.
Yes, it should come with a blue analog cable...
Yes, you will need a 1.7 meter Ku band satellite antenna to get some of the free to air (FTA) programs. You should google FTA providers to see if there are any Italian programs available in North America
No
No, it is not. However, the company will look at stock if you describe the item you are looking for if you provide details.
When the beam is broken between the two devices it merely closes or opens contacts to the connected device (a sliding gate in my case, it causes the closing gate to stop and then open). It is activated as long as the beam is broken.
The transmitter sends out a small light beam to the reflective round mirror, which sends it back to the transmitter, which also has a receiver in it. If the light beam is broken, it trips a relay in the receiver, which gives you a set of contacts to set off some type of alarm of your choice. It works perfectly!
Just the tower is included.
I disagree that the NVIDIA GeForce GT620 2GB video card is crappy.
Cool blue
Sure my grandson is only 7 years old and we buy used games all the time. You can play any type of D's game on this machine.
Hello there. The one we have for sale originally came with 4.5 however we may own different releases. Check this site to match your serial number and you may be able to find out which yours came with. http://wiki.gbatemp.net/wiki/3DS_hacking_faq#Can_you_check_the_System_version_before_buying_a_new_3DS.3F
You don't need to use the connect button when you set it up. (That doesn't usually work anyway). Just follow the simple instructions to add the a netgear. The little manual shows step by step directions. Just have your current router password handy.
Only if you are going to be somewhere that will give you their wifi password because it is an extension. For example: you connect at home and you have NetGear 528 - when you set up the range extender it will create NetGear 528-ext I don't think a motel or resort will give you their wifi network password for you to set it up. If its a private home probably would be just ine, unless thy re like ome of my I laws, they don't even know their pass codes ! LOL. Hope this helps
yes, as I have a kindle app on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet, and I download lots of free books to read on my kindle app. Also have a MP3 player from Amazon, and if you have a Droid phone, it's just as easy to use as the phone.
It should come with chargers, maybe they left them out of the details by accident.
Xfinity is a just a trademark name of Comcast services, so yes it is.
No but I use the wireless router to connect to the phone modem.
Yes, but you will have to have them activate it.
remote control runs DVR any universal remote should also work
16
No
Yes can play USB SD or AUX from cell phone or laptop or any audio,,this is build FM in ,,has remote control.. Power adapter 12V 1A or 2A,,or plug in car cigarete lighter use same car radio mp3.
It will work. I don't see a RMS wattage listed but you will get half the wattage for whatever it's rated at 8ohms. Im using this on 8ohms home stereo speakers and it is more than loud for a garage.
No that is the $149 docking station. Which I highly recommend! This case will not work without but frankly it doubles your battery life I couldn't live without mine!!!
I do not recommend this product. It took a month to come from the uk. When trying to return it they asked for you to pay for the shipping. Thankfully amazon returned in full.
you sir can find your answer in this link, i hope it helps: http://www.hkvstar.com/technology-news/whats-difference-between-d1-and-cif-for-dvr.html
Its over 2000 hours. Which is about 3 months.
Con disponibilidad a que se refiere?
It appears that the battery is internal and non-removable. When I received it, I gave it the full 6-8 hour charge and its last over two weeks.
you can activate it and check it everyday with your computer or you can activate it and pay a monthly service charge which connects you to real time and monitor anytime from your pc or phone and there are different features such as maps, this way you can leave it on the car and check it anytime only charging it once a week
Yes..it requires a 12 volt minimum of 1 amp power supply. These illuminators are very good, mine have been up since August and I love them...they cast a very bright, wide and long IR beam. You won't regret the purchase.
Send it back. Mine has been running for almoat 2 years and it doesn't do this.
It hooks up to the computer to download pictures, but doesn't accept a memory card. It holds enough pictures internally, though. One drawback is that the pictures are all erased if the battery is removed or dies before you import them to the computer.
yep! my 7 yrd old grand daughter figured it out.
This camera is part of a Uniden wireless system. It is an add on which works with several different Uniden systems. However, it does nothing on its own. It does NOT communicate to a standard Wifi network. The connection is proprietary to the Uniden system. That said, I have have four camera Uniden system and it works just fine.
Recording is done via a micro USB card. It comes with an 8 GB card but I added the 16 GB card. I have had problems with recording. It does not seem to want to really record over previously recorded files. Sometimes It will stop recording and I will have to turn off the monitor and then on again to get it to record.
2013- 8 GB RAM-256 SSD
Yes. That is the same ipad I have. I believe it's a 3rd generation ipad
It draws its power from the TV through the HDMI port you plug it into. Very convenient.
To clarify, less than 2 feet, not 2".
Great. I travel on airplanes all the time with them and dont have an issue. Should be fine.
It can record video and is supposed to be "HD" but I don't think they quality was very good at all.
10
A direct beam which widens. I believe if you go to the Rodann Website it is addressed.
The 60 watt bulbs will fit, I don'think the heat will be too great. I think your problem will come from the amount of light output and the temperature of the light. Make sure the light temp. is correct for your camera settings. 5600 K is day light temp.
yes
Your computer must find the software. It doesn't come with any. Your computer should automatically find the driver on the web. Hope this helps...
I couldn't get it to work on Windows 7 so I never went any further.
It won't fit, different sizes.
Should fit any samsung 10 inch tablet. Great cover for the price. Our model is gt-p5113. Work well as stand and protector.
Yes it does. I love this tv so much, I thought how can something so inexpensive be very good but it is, watching movies on it in HD is awesome, you can zoom in like when your watching a football game and it has cinema options and a couple other options to, great picture......
Not for me. In fact I returned mine. The sound kept going in and out for no reason, and since it was brand new - I was scared that one day I wouldn't have any sound at all. I returned it while there was still a 'return policy' available.
No
Yes it does with no problem. I even have an aftermarket L-bracket that works just fine Thank You
Yes
Yes, I have same remote and it works on Onyx EZ, no complaints or issues with mine either
Probably none. This one can be used anywhere with any carrier.
I don't know if this can happen, but the tablet does accept and reads/displays purchases & updates from Kindle Books on Amazon.com, so I suspect it will sync with Kindle Fire; hope someone else knows this.
Yes, You can add a portable keyboard va bluetooth, I have one.
It seems it does not use a white list so it should work.
It's is good durable sturdy keep everything in place. Gps is secured
My Amery is a SP-815UZ 14 mega pixel. I found the compatible items in my owners manual. I hope this helps
Yes, it will work.
i think it will. has all the wire adapters works great
Don't know
S seor, debera funcionar... Una vez puesta mi computadora corre como la seda...
I guess I don't understand the question, but I purchased this AC adapter to replace the non-functional factory unit. My application is the Roku 2XS. This AC adapter is a perfect replacement, and I have used it on my Roku for nearly one year with no issues.
I dont know
Based on the pictures it looks like the keyboard portion of the case actually disconnects and then you have just the portfolio for just the tablet. If you never intend to get a keyboard though you could just get a case like MiniSuit ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity Case TF700 / TF700T PU Leather MultiView stand folio case for ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity 10.1-Inch Tablet - Black and not have to worry about it.
I don't know
It's about 10 feet long. It's longer than most of the third party laptop codes in the market.
I am not 100% sure as Yosemite had some big issues that needed to be addressed. If you have done all of that and are running Photoshop or manga studio on your ios without a problem them out should work fine for you. I love my Cintiq and find out to be an indispensable tool for my artwork.
Microsoft Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP (SP2), Macintosh OS X 10.4.8+. Also requires available DVI or VGA connection on your video card, available USB port, and CD/DVD drive. That's the minimum. The programs that you use with it will define your video card, processor and ram requirements.
It works perfectly with windows 8
2 silent series r2 hydraulic bearing fans
This case is already huge. But yes... The fractal design define XL r2.
your mom's got wifi
I am 6'3 and wear it cross shoulder at waist height
So I have an iPhone 5, but I have to use the 30 pin connector to lightening adapter to make it work. The device itself has a 30 pin connector. I didn't have a problem with this, because I have the 3rd generation iPad which is still a 30 pin connector. Other than that it works pretty good.
My daughter says no, only with the case that comes with the set. The magnetic lens won't work with any of the cases she has tried.
I am not sure, it fits a Kodak One, the first digital I had now fits my Sanyo X1200, although it is a bit big for it, so I carry my extra SD cards and battery inside. I hope this helps
Yes.
The only difference is the color. Anodized black vs raw aluminum. Inside they are both the same stick.
I bought this flash unit for my Nikon D3200 and would assume it would work well with the D7100 as well. Great price for a very good flash!!!
Yes.
Meike MK900 TTL flash could be used on Nikon D3000 .Thanks
Mine is 12mm.
Yes it has a external battery hook up. I really like the door knob also.
The extra pack is for when the batteries in your lock need to be replaced and you either do not have a handy set to replace the dead batteries, or you do not have the time to wait for your (rechargeable) batteries to recharge. The details how to apply the extra pack are a part of the instructions.
It should work with your 2000 Jettta 2.0. However the quality is very poor on this unt.
If the BMW has the OBDII connector the cable will work, however the software on the computer is what you should double check that it can communicate with the BMW.
Yes i believe you are correct.
It would be a good item yes, but keep in mind 150Mbps is pretty fast, as well as the fact that you are only going to go as fast as the network you're connected to. The fastest Internet speed currently available in the United States can get as high as 120Mbps from what I've seen. My speed is currently an average of 45Mbps and that is plenty fast. So again, all depends on what router you have, the network you're connected to and so on. Hope that helps.
I believe it would. I've yet to see a Mac nearby, let alone try to plug in.
I highly doubt it. The elastic straps would fit over the case, but not the leather ones.
No, it does not. It is secured on the inside back cover.
it takes a SD memory card or mini SD card with adapter.
It will work about 30 feet away
Can't answer that one, never tried it.
It is backlit with a solid backing. Not sure if you can remove screen from backing for projector mod.
No this ifs just a Router
If paired with the wifi remote (sold separately) you can turn it on and off. I use it with the smartphone app and you can control all the functions and preview and view video and photos but won't turn on and off camera at this time.
This is for the first and 2nd year. After the two year warranty, it's over.
I would assume that it does cover it. You call them up, they send you a box to return the item.
If you purchase this warranty from Amazon it's only good for purchases made through Amazon. For items bought off E-Bay you'll either have to purchase the warranty straight through Square Trade's website or the E-Bay website.
Register it online using the instruction in the email. Read the website FAQs. There are also phone numbers to call with questions. Every warranty is specific.
Yes
I'm sure it does. I don't have a coverage but they cover all electronic devices, I am pretty sure.
First off....I'm 'New' item buyer....I shy away from 'Used' products...That's just me. Secondly, I would evaluate the cost of the insurance (protection plan)....add that to your price....that basically is the cost of your item. If you are comfortable with that...go for it. Insurance (Protection Plan) is something that is good to have.....better if you never need to use it, because of the inconvenince. Good Luck.
I really couldn't answer that Jeff , maybe you should ask the company by Email , sorry I couldn't be of any help
It depends on the plan. I have Square Trade warranties on dozens of products from major appliances to multiple smart phones. I am been a Square Trade Customer since for ten years. I have filed a few claims and have always been impressed by their high level of customer service as well as their dedication to resolving any claim quickly. I rate them as high as Amazon and that is not an easy mark to reach!
The program comes included, with the product, on a 3 inch disc.
I bought the insurance and they definitely paid for a new phone when the one we had died. No issues at all. I would call them about theft.
Whats the model of Panasonic 32" Cheryl? It most likely will work but if you can look that up I can tell you for sure.
My ceiling has 2x6 joist which wasn't wide enough to receive all 4 screws from the bracket. I thought about only installing two screws opposite each other but because it was outside, I went in the attic and screwed two pieces of 2x4 or 2x6 to the side of the existing ceiling joist and all four screws mount to solid wood. To answer your question, the mount is at my summer home so I can't measure but I estimate the screws are approximately 4" apart since the width of 3 2x6 is 1.5x3=4.5". Hope this helps
As shown in the picture there are two sets of 4 holes. The inner holes are 3 inches apart which I used to mount my 19 inch Samsung. There are also 4 holes to the outer which are 4 inches apart. This product works great.
You can power any aftermarket speaker off of your head unit. Amps only provide additional power for the speakers.
Yes a 3.5mm audio and microphone jack that you can use as is or plug both into the USB adaptor.
Don't know- I use it with a Benro travel tripod with a Swiss Arca style mount. It appears that the VCT-640 comes with a pan head, not the Swiss Arca plate. You may want to use the esupport at Sony to answer the question definitively.
no it does not fit my kindle falls right out of it
I doubt it, although I can't be sure. It holds my first generation IPad. It weighs a good bit.
Yes, it fits beautifully.
It does have a hand strap but it will not fit the new Kindle HDX 7 in. The case is too big and you cannot access any of the buttons. The HDX is not very secure in this case. The case does fit the Kindle Fire 7 inch pretty good.
Karen, I have four sets of two in my den. Two sets front and rear plus a bass woofer and a center bar. I love the sound and my wife loves the look of no huge speakers on the walls. Amazing sound from the Acoustimass.
It is actually one speaker that is composed of two separate cubes stacked on top of each other. You can either align them so they point in the same direction, or have them point slightly in different directions. However they cannot be separated and there is only one input to the pair.
Yes you can, in fact I have those conected direct to a Yamaha A/V receiver
hellllllllllo.....butchog..tkx for the look......funny you should ask that question.....i have them $12..20'+//$17..40'+......i have a listing 'BOSE SPEAKER CABLE 5PAC W/ PURCHASE OF 5ea speakers $49.95......you can buy one tell me the length..then i'll refund you the difference.....tkx...g.scott
Had the same problem until it finally burnt out. One of the large pins on the socket component's solder joint was completely black on the board. I successfully repaired my laptop using this component and following the instructions at insidemylaptop.com website http://www.insidemylaptop.com/disassemble-asus-n53s-laptop-fix-dc-power-jack/. I did not require any additional components as this one does include the socket that accepts the plug from the ac adapter.
Yes I had the nex 5 r. And works fine.
Yes!! But u will need a adapter from raido shack. The push button may not work due to a cell has no internal push to talk.. Hope this helps..
I haven't tried it when snowboarding, but i will let you know this weekend.
Yes, it is a plastic/rubber tube
Yes, a user manual is packed with the UV-5R. It does contain the information necessary to use the radio, but the instructions are brief and not always clearly written. However, it would be a good idea to go to the websites: http://www.uv3r.com/uv5r.html and http://www.miklor.com/uv5r/ to get additional information about the UV-5R. These sites contain links to more information written by UV-5R owners. Mike, N5YM
No it does. Not have dual tones
No the specs are the same
This is the factory specs
Don't works
Yes, I just mounted that TV on that wall mount. However, the bolts provided with the mount are too short to engage the recessed threads on the back of the TV. I bought four bolts at Cardinal Tru-Value that were still metric but were 5 mm longer. It works great! I don't understand why Samsung recesses the threads so deep in the hole. If the threads came out to the surface the supplied bolts would work fine. Be sure not to use a bolt that's too long - you could always use washers to make it work.
This mount has the standard VERSA mount pattern of 100mm or 200mm up to 60 lbs. if your TV is within those sepcts. it will work it says for TVs between 19" to 60 " up to 60 lbs.
The wall mount states that it fits tvs 30-60 inches so a 40 inch flat screen should not be a problem. The tv sits about 3-4 inches away from the wall depending on what point you are measuring from. Hope this helps!
Yes
Yes, would not turn on or move in any way. We did the set up as instructed.
I don't know, it didn't work on my next book like was listed, so I can't say
It should work. It has several connections available. You could do the 1/8 inch out from your TV to a RCA Y-connector, or RCA cables if you have that output on your TV. I don't think I recall there being a Toslink port on this (I sold mine).
Unfortunately, No Trim support.
I bought a nextbook branded car charger from Amazon which works perfectly
the Nextbook 7"car charger works great for trips to keep your nextbook operating for all the games you play and enjoy. So glad that I ordered mine from Amazon and received it fast in the mail.
I have a 8" nextbook tablet and it works great
Hi, This package doesn't include the mats. On our website your able to get the package with the mats. Then you would email us and let us know you wan black mats instead of white (white mats are the default color unless you choose a color) Thanks Leslie
Hi, Yes there are 2 different sets for 16x20 frames. One comes with mat and the other one doesn't come with mat. Please make sure it is the package that comes with mat. (It'll say it in the title and description as well). Also, the mats would be 16x20 for 11x14 and it the color is white Thank you, Leslie
No camera port.
yes it is.......i have this reciever for 2 months now...its 4k ready...its awsome.....powerfull....lots of extras...it pumps out a lot of power.....go to onkyousa.com a
Yes, the hard drive is pre installed.
It won't work if you have a 30 pin charger (the wide one). It will work with a lightning cable.
No, all atmos capable processors need a specific chip and this does not have it.
I don't think so. I can't remember for certain.
Those buttons don't work on my Mac. Instead, I use the scroll wheel which works well
We used this to charge two iPhones, two iPads, and a camera for a week with no problems.
The adapter works great with mobile phones, but you need a power converter for appliances. I plugged in a small portable white noise machine using the adapter and it was blown out immediately, never worked again even back at home in the US. All the hotels during my trip to Italy had hair dryers. I did without any other appliances. Hope this helps.
If your George Foreman Grill is from the US (110 Volt) unit it will not work without a power converter/transformer. China is 220V, 50 Hz. The adapter plug only changes the connection to the power outlet.
My wife and I both have some European (German, French) plugs that work with these, They are pretty much universal.
It is made for and fits exactly(tightly) the folding headphones: Sennheiser PX 200-II I think the packaging mentioned a few other Sennheiser models it would fit too. Best, Marcelo
I get 1-7/8" on my PXC250 measurement. Should be a fit. They are a bit difficult to install but work great.
They are not foldable. Sound however is always in the ears and brain of the beholder. For the money I think they sound great, no complaints and find them to be more than satisfactory for me.
yes. BUT I run it through my iPhone with MyTunes Pro music app. It's worked fine. At high volumes its held up.
You can use it almost anywhere you need to improve the sound for any device that either has bluetooth or has a headphone jack. You could simply use the bluetooth feature for the ipad and the speaker and you could hear the movie much better than just using the ipod's built in speakers. Hope this helps. I have the OontZ and the OontZ XL and both deliver excellent sound.
Yes. Done it many times.
Yes, it is essentially wireless. smart-phones, mp3 players...whatever the source .., if it can be used at home, then a car makes no difference.
Every time the blue light comes on, a sale starts at Kmart.
Yes you have a cable to join them second screen is a slave, can only play what is on main screen
Yes i beleive so!!! It is a super long cable. Just fyi
Hello C.M. I do not know if the lenses would fit a Nikon 55-300mm lens as I use them with my Canon camera. I do however use them on my 55-250mm lens that has a 58mm thread. So my assumption is YES, they would fit because they are not made by Canon. But I honestly am unsure. I hope this helps, I apologize if it doesn't.
Yes, these are used for NAS situations, although they can also be used as regular hard drives. The reason I purchased the "Red" drives, is that they have a 5 year warranty instead of a 2 or 3 year warranty
I'm using it in a server raid 1 for data backup. I would say yes on NAS configuration. Because of the slower speed I would not use it as a drive setup to run programs from. Just for data.
The 7 inch on the tablets are the screen measured diagonally. My tablet is a 7 inch screen but the actual length of the tablet is 7.5 inch and the width is 4.5 inch and it fits nicely in this case. However I bought one for my sister Samsung tab and it was a bit big it kept sliding out.
Dear valued buyer, Thank you for your inquiry. Yes, the item in your question is working with the tablet your mentioned. Our item come with micro USB adapter, which will connect the keyboard case with your tablet PC. Hope this answer your concerning.:) If you meet any question, please feel free to contact us at any time. Sincerely, HOHONG LTD
I use mine at night...to see the deer...they have worked for me.
I have the canon eos t1i. From what I read, all of my lenses are compatible between the t1i and the t5i. I have been considering an upgrade and lenses were the least of my worries.
It does not fit my HP 17" laptop. the dimension inside the waterproof case are 15 1/4" H x 10 1/2" W x 1 1/2" T. hope this help anyone who want to buy it.
Mine came with charging USB cord. Did not have the micro card for memory.
Yes. pretty much. If you know how to navigate thru setup menus using your remote control you can operate Jadoo 3 easily. For people not very comfortable in selecting options using remote control, one can always setup favorites so they can tune in to their favorite Jadoo 3 channels by selecting minimum options. (I am taking about people like my aunt and uncle)

My disk arrived blank. The seller told me there wasnt anywhere to download the same software that was supposed to come with it. I was able to find some other 3rd party software that worked with the cable, but it was specifically for a Subaru which works great for me.
I'm running FreeBSD with 2GB of ram, cold boot is about 45 seconds and warm boot is about 20 seconds.
It should be. I don;t thinkthe unit cares what kind of printer it is. If's its a WIFI router it should work
Never heard of it...not normal. Check sound settings.
It can record any audio (if you have RCA Connection).
It gives location/ grids anywhere in the world based off of where ever you are, it just depends on the grid system you'd like to use. Hope this was helpful
Hello, The GC1000 already works in windows 7 and 8 respectively. As far as updates for them specifically for x64 architecture, and/or OSX, I don't know of any plans for it. Ian A. Technical Support Diamond Multimedia Tech06@diamondmm.com
Yes you can. Not with the program. There is a different program which is called XSPLIT broadcaster. You open first the capture prpgram for diamond multimedia (DMcap) and then open up XSPLIT and then you can livestream.
Yes you can use av cables as in red white and yellow it works great with Xbox and 1080i
Yes it will. Use the hdmi cable for best results next would be the component cables.
It certainly does...
Sorry I don't think so
The lens hood will help help to prevent lens flair and help protect both the lens and UV filter from dings. The UV filter will protect the lens from dust and scratches, and in that way serve the purpose of a lens cap.
Works fine with the original blue ray player. Also powers on/off TV and works for channel surfing.
Yeah
Only good for model year 2012 or later
It has A/V OUT only. It does have an impressive built-in pick-up mic with VOX, but it does not have a mic input port. HMDI, Mini-USB, and the slot for the Mini-SD card only. Also, the A/v out is 1/16, not 1/8.
according to the specifications; Operate Temper 0 55C (14F122F) Operating Humidity 20%  85% non-condensing
The answer is yes. There are several models of the T100TA comprised of different features. This unit happens to be an older model in 32GB SSD. I have owned both the older version and the new version with 64 GB drive. The EVEcase fit on both.
As long as your operating system is a Windows or a Mac you are good. Latest firmwares are at: http://www.j5create.com/support.html#dockingstations
Not sure. they do have macbook product though. I used it with windows, and works great.
The 30-pin connector on these is, as far as I can tell, exactly as thin as the standard Apple iPhone cable, so if the Apple cable fits, these should fit too. I have a Magpul case on my iPhone and I've used these with various iPad cases as well: I've yet to find anything it won't fit into.
Power doesn't go through the replicator; the replicator handles device and network connections. You need to plug your laptop into the wall directly. Or, if you don't mean power but just that the replicator and laptop aren't communicating, be sure to install the latest drivers from HP for the replicator, and be sure to install the latest DisplayLink package from DisplayLink.com. Hope that helps.
The installation that you made should be connected to your backup lights for the power feed. If you have the power feed for the display coming from anywhere else - that would happen. You should have both the power feed for the camera and the display coming from the backup lights circuit.
It says it is rated for 100 miles.
Yes, you shouldn't have any problem.
Yes. I only use it for internet only
I had to buy a new one when my wheel got stuck but my player was over a year and a half old. I never managed to fix it.
The EQ settings are for Jazz, Classical, Funk, Hip Hop, etc., then you can use the "custom EQ" settings, which has some slider buttons but I don't know what they do.
Yes
What you can do is to request the model number and serial number from the seller and then check on HP's site for warranty information. I would guess it should be 1 year. I have this notebook and had an issue with the keyboard and HP was super efficient and professional about resolving the issue, so it worth checking out.
Use the Mac OS included "Disk Utility" application. Choose the MacOS Extended format if you're Mac-only. Otherwise use FAT32 if you must share with windows. Note, if you want to use it with Time Machine you will need at least one partition to be MacOS Extended formatted.
Sorry, I do not know. If camera has a standard USB port, I would assume it would.
there is WIFI WPA for wireless security.
Yes you can access the internet over WiFi. Not hard to do just follow the directions.
1 PCI express 3.0 x 16 and 1 @x4 PCI express 2.0 x16
Yes, you can. The EFI has both MSI's OC Genie II and the ability to configure manual frequency settings. You will still need a CPU that is OC friendly. Page 26 of the manual (which can be downloaded from the MSI website) clearly shows the EFI screen options for overclocking.
yes, I confirm.
I measure 10 7/8 inches wide and 6 1/8 inches tall. Hope this helps.
No you don't. Use it on the internet like a small computer. It is like most tablets. The battery last 8 to 9 hrs. depending what you are doing with it. It is a very good value compared to others. I love mine. I bought the wife one too. She has a Kindle fire also. It is a good tablet, but the galaxy has way more functions..You will like it.
There is a Zmodo app to view remotely on your iPhone on your home wifi LAN. Port forwarding on your router is required to view on the Internet.
The quality of video and sound is very low.
Yes, it has an integrated microphone, and supports bluetooth calling, but the audio quality is not that great for the receiver. Otherwise is a fantastic radio!
you can skip ahead to next song
The charge will hold for another complete round of golf.
Yes - there is a clip-on wall charger. If you need an automobile charger, it is extra. Charging is simple and if plugged in the night before lasts.
Im surprised the battery only lasted 2 years! That's rediculous! I would contact Garmin and see if they will fix the watch for you.
Yes
Yep
The cable is 3 feet long... The same size as the OEM...
Brooklyn, New york
Yes. It's just the cable though, not the part that plugs into the wall.
It needs to "see" the sky. It's Bluetooth and cordless, so just put it somewhere on the dash. It's rubber feet will keep it in place. It only ever gets plugged in to be recharged. It is quite stable - I have had it on my boat's dash many times. It won't move.
It is for iPhone. It does work with the 9500
Yes. We currently have Verizon and are using one of their HD set top boxes. We have it mounted in the kitchen under the cabinet.
No, my case has no hand strap. Only a small section for a stylus.
Yes, it fits the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 just fine. I did add a few Velcro strips to it and the tablet to make it more secure.
There should be no problem doing that. You should tin the wires, solder, to prevent them from unraveling.
Havent got the iPad Air yet. Sorry.
If it works on my iPad 3, it should work for your iPad 4. And it's fantastic! I use it to record my video podcast.
Thank you for your interest in our products. The K is only a typographical error.
I think what you need is a sata port, I plugged it into a Biostar P4M890 motherboard and a Pentium D and it works.
Yes it will update drivers and it works well
The box says Frequency band: 2.412Ghz-2.484Ghz ISM band I'm not a teckie--dont know if this helps you or not.
Yes, this fits the iPhone. Headphone jacks are a standard size, so this will fit any phone that has a headphone jack - including all the iPhones.
It is supposed to come with a USB cord for charging. It plugs into the bottom of the remote with their proprietary connector. Their cord has this connector on one end and USB on the other end.
Dear Luke, This is a correction for the last reply. The Graphic card of this item (HP Pavilion HPE H8-1360t Desktop) should be 1GB DDR3 AMD Radeon HD 7570. We apologize for any confusion it may cause. Best regards, Xeletctrons Customer Care
I believe the one I purchased had a higher dynamic contrast ratio than the w2072a.
Yes This Would Work Perfectly For That Has VGA And Dvi Connections
No, it comes with VGA cable and power cable
I am not too sure but it works great for my Sony Flip.
no this only good for htc tablet.
Sorry, I actually bought this for someone else. I know it was for a TV, but not sure if its the same one that matches your item.
More than likely its your router, I tried everything I could to avoid buying another one cause I was having the same problem with my Linksys Router and as soon as I changed routers the problem was solved.
I signed up with AlarmRelay after purchasing this product. Their typical monitoring cost is 8.99/mo, and they are billing me somewhere between 13.00-14.00/mo for Wifi monitoring.
Up/down by just ratcheting unit only, angle of view covers almost entire frontal field of view. Excellent quality video.
Stranded and like a 24g wire.
I seriously doubt it, they would normally list it if it was. But it is cheap and it does do the job. If you are using this in an important application that requires RoHS I think you may be looking in the wrong place. A EE teflon insulated wire would probably serve you better.
Hello, dear friend, we are sorry to tell you that the ' solderless,no welding' means there is no solder connector in the middle of each 20M. Sorry for the misleading. Any other questions, please kindly share with us. It is our great honor to serve you. Best regards, Lemonbest
No will not fit in phone, this is for camera or laptop devices.
Soldering is an option. But you can also use a water proof bonding agent.
No it is not
No. This is basically before the touch screen era.
No, they will not work, they are too fast, etc. (204-pin PC3-12800 (1600 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM) You want the 204-pin PC3-8500 (1066 MHz) DDR3 SO-DIMM, look for these here. You have 2 slots, figure out what you have from the system profiler and decide what to buy from there. You have a max capability of 8GB (4 per slot). Hope this helps..... I highly recommend Crucial (in pairs), they have performed perfectly in the last 12+ Macs I have had in 15 or more years.
Hi Simone, I suggest that you go onto the website of crucial and run their diagnostic program; it will tell you exactly which models are compatible with your computer.
Yes. I did and it really speeds up an iMac!
It actually is mac specific. The way to determine is via our model numbers and release period. I wouldn't test this on a PC. There are many other options out there that will be designed to work with your PC. It might work, but I wouldn't run the risk of trying.
I would recommend you go to the crucial web site and use their tool to match their memory with your computer.
yes, it is
My late 2012 Macbook Pro had 2 x 2GB stock RAM. I replaced one Apple 2GB module with this 8GB module, for total of 10GB, mixing Apple stock RAM with this product. No issues whatsoever.
I looked up a bit more information by Googling "memory upgrades for SVF15N17CXB. This Crucial web site was one which came up and should prove helpful. http://www.crucial.com/upgrade/Sony-memory/VAIO+SVF+Series/VAIO+SVF15N17CXB-upgrades.html
It works for my Inspiron 17 7000 which required DDR3L as well.
No
Yes, is easily mounted. It's been in our test lab for months with no issues.
Sorry, but I don't recall there being a dimmer switch on this clock. We have never needed that feature.
Cables not included.
I am looking for it too - appears the company is out of business, not sure why this is still beimg sold (amazon, toysRus, Target)
No, you cant fast forward or rewind. You can only skip.
defect
I have no idea if it will work with a mac mini. I don't see why it wouldn't work, I can't say for sure because I don't have a mac. I've used hdmi between my android tablet and tv with no problem, and also between windows and my tv to watch huly, netflix, and hbogo, so I don't see why it c/wouldn't work with mac.
Yes
Probably not, your going to need a amp otherwise they end up fairly underpowered
It could, depends on where you plan on putting them.
No
Yes, there is a volume control.
That is the cover. The top part you just pull it up to cover and pull it down to put the usb in your laptop/computer
I bought this one and it is ok for my light duty use http://www.amazon.com/Professional-Mini-Ball-Camera-Mount/dp/B000L47AHG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1417638946&sr=8-3&keywords=ball+head+camera+mount
No
DMW-BLC12
Mine almost got stuck. The release lever is a bit flimsy but with care, it works. Rather stiff though...
Japan.
Clarity of what you see through the viewfinder is adjustable to adopt to each person's different eyesight. There is a small ribbed wheel on the left side of the viewfinder to make that adjustment. Turn that wheel either up or down until what you see through the viewfinder is clear. It's that simple!
Mike, it will rip any and all DVD and Blu-Ray. I have my attached to a new iMac. The iMac is running Intel core i5 with 16G of memory. The device is easy to install and operate.
You need to purchase the SD card separately.
Yea it definitely does!
The Drobo Mini looks like a USB 2/3 hard drive, so if your router can mount a USB hard drive, then the answer is yes. The particular format of the partition will have to match what your router requires (FAT32 is a safe guess).
Actually no. In fact Drobo states as such on their Web site. It does make a substantial difference with traditional hard drives.
I've got a W530 (I'm not sure what you mean by "new" as all W530s are the same when it comes to the chassis) and it fits perfectly. Installed the OEM 1TB drive in it and I'm using a fast SSD as the primary.
NO, however keep in mind wireless cameras need a power source ie power outlet at each camera. So if up put a camera on the 4 corners of your home you will need power as well at each corner. good luck
No this is just the case.. if you mean does this fit a retina display ipad? then yes it fits a retina display ipad.
yes it does. the keys are very sensitive. the battery life is very good
It's a very tiny port on the side of the device beside the on switch.
Probably not. This camera is barebones, with all kinds of electrical potential being exposed to the environment. If you want to use this little thing outdoors, you would have to harden it to electrical interference. The cost to do it right would most likely exceed the price of a "game camera" which is designed for outdoor use.
No idea. never tested.
Yes but it's like dropping a wall between the seats! I had mine installed at best buy the kid mounted it right where the slide is for the sun roof goes it's tight and works awesome! If you have bucket seats your good bench seat may not go all the way down! It grows when it's installed!
Provided there is an open pci slot on the pc (which you can find out by opening it up) and the psu is putting out 400 - 500 watts you should be fine. Upgrading stock PC's can be tricky though, I wouldn't recommend it personally, hard to get it to the standard you want.
It fit myD3000. I just took a chance. If it doesn't work, just send it back
Yes, two pair of glasses are included.
Absolutely It's passive 3d. One button 3d on/off. Only problem is the stand (tilt only), these monitor need to be at eye level.
Yes, it does come with shutter release and works great with T4i
This one only uses the Nikon batteries, there Srebrenica other brands that offer the flexibility of both types of batteries I would not recommend this grip
Yes, this lens is compatible with your Canon 50D.
Phone..both..usb adapter facilitates this. However mine got corrupted in about 3 days..my fault or theirs..I don't know.
I don't know if it will fit that device.
I suggest you to buy zeetron screen
The headphone jack is under the liftable flap (in the middle, labeled "ear") next to the tuning dial.
Yes, great little radio.
No, it does not. FM, AM(MW), SW1,2,3,4 etc. No TV though.
I have a 2014 edition galaxy note 10.1, and it fits. Don't know about a tab though; maybe look for a protector that is specifically made for the tab 3
The differences is clear were you can see your screen good, and anitglare is to keep the glare off your screen.
The difference is the price. Anything made by Canon or Nikon is way more pricy. These units are extremly easy to use, you can fire one or two flashes at the same time. I have purchase about 6 of these units for my students and everyone warks right out of the box.
Hey. I think there was a warranty but as of all the reviews and to set more out of my factory radio it was to talk worth it. I really don't see it giving me a problem since it's just a bunch of wires
Sure!!!
Hello..it does work on the iPhone 4S. I used it on my computer to change the HD, and RAM. Also when the screen on my iPad broke I used it as well. Hope that helps answer your question.
I don't think these Floureon batteries will work with your UNIDEN TRU8860-2. Your phone model is not listed under it's description. Amazon does sell batteries that will work with your phone. Search: UNIDEN TRU8860-2 replacement battery. As far as the mAh number goes: the higher number, the longer the run-time. Example: Let's say the 800mAh batteries allows a 2 hour run-time between charges. A 1000mAh battery could run perhaps 2.5 hours.
The website said they would fit my phone which is a Uniden 9480-3 and a list of others check inside the battery compartment of your phone for the model number. I have seven phones throughout my house and they were all dying. These battery packs have brought them back to like new. I am very pleased
No
Sorry, but I only know that it works with Win 7.
Yes
I am not an expert but based on the RoboReel that I installed on the ceiling of my garage, I would not recommend installing it outside. If snow and ice got into the coiloing area it may freeze the unit and cause the motor to shut off. I use my RoboReel for my snowblower, I just pull the cord outside my garage. Alternatively, you could mount on the exterior ensuring that you have a cover over the unit.
MANUFACTURER ANSWER: Thanks for posting your question here, Setiyo! Yes, you can use either our http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008N06I2I or our http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECDM78E with the Dell Venue 8 Pro using the OTG cable. You can see our YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPPY4m8iY0k where we show the Dell Venue 8 Pro connected to multiple monitors using our http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ECDM78E Hope the above information helps! If you need any additional information, please do feel free to shoot us an email at support@plugable.com. We are here to help! Thanks! Regards, Roze Plugable Technologies
Gayle yes it can. One from the Digital port and one from the HDMI port that requires an HDMI cable for your monitor. I currently run 2 monitors and the laptop display as we speak on this Plugable
No, it is not a thin client. It simply extends the external ports for any computer (ex: external monitor, keyboard, mouse, etc.).
The box says 400W
Depends on your motherboard. As long as you have a PCI-E slot, it will work.
Yes. All HDMI ports should include audio and video output.
I doubt it sorry for before, does not look like the same dimensions but check the specs
H: 46(70/35) 70 degree horizonal 35 degree vertical, see link - http://www.dahuasecurity.in/products/ipc-hfw2100-7.html
It does NOT. You will have to supply power directly or POE.
Don't know about 7027. I use on 8706B Sylvania Portable DVD, dual screen. Works great.
Yea perfect thanks
It didn't work for me.
I used this with a no named brand tablet. It didn't require any drivers to be installed. Its basically just an adapter so I really doubt you'd have to worry about any drivers. Just a word of caution, this is a MINI USB interface, not a full USB.
Yes - came with a power adapter.
I can see no reason it wouldn't, normally the boards could care less about the type of operating system you are using.
Well I bought two for my kids and they just use WiFi I didn't see any setting for 4g network and not it's not expensive to use as love as you have a hotspot or WiFi you can access anything GPS etc...
yes there is a case by HDE on amazon... no keyboard... comes in several colors...compat with 8, 9, 10in android tablets. not perfact but its a protective case... i have one for my 9in agptek
There is only one cord and it's 2 and a half to three feet long.
No my tablit takes a type c. The tablit I have is a Visual Land Android version 4.1.1, the video will play but there will be no sould that is why I need a type c mini hdmi to vga female. I would first do some reshurch on what would work with your thinkpad.
Yes, all motherboards should have a CMOS battery pre-installed.
No , unfortunately the headers are only USB 2.0. No USB 3 onboard.
Hi, Yes it does....It is a great little camera and takes great shots out of the water!
I have no clue. You would need to contact Samsung to see if this works in the Galaxy S3 and the Galaxy Light???
It wil fit to your tablet. I bought the same model in Costco and it fit perfect.
really unimportant with a sub. I dont have this sub, but the principal is universal for powered subs. I would use a std rca sub cable and the key is to be able to place it where you maximize its impact. yes should be useable w/ almost all modern recievers
Yeah. It should work. Onkyos support 6 and 8ohms..
Assuming that the Handycam as the standard tripod screw hole on the bottom, yes it would fit this.
Yes, sold as a pair.
Yes but you have to have an external amp or receiver to power the speakers.
No Bluetooth. Bluetooth receivers usually have a "B" in model #
Good question! Just try it and found EOS M can not shot in RAW for HDR and hand Handheld Night Scene. It will automatically switch to JPG for those 2 modes. The other modes can do RAW format.
The 22 is a prime lens, no zoom. There is a 18-55 zoom available. With an adapter, you use other zoom lenses.
No. 90EX Cannot be used as a slave
Yes it works great....
Yes. All newer canon speedlights work on all of their digital bodies. Im using it on my 6D to trigger other flashes remotely. www.abesnider.com
You must use AAA batteries with the flash. It does not use the camera battery.
It is designed to sink with the canon m. It has a standard hot shoe base but I'm not sure this would be your best choice.
Chromatic Aberration causes blurry pictures. I have been using this lens for over 4 months and I didn't take any blurry pictures. But also I have been using this only for indoor portrait photos since I bought it. So I am not sure what would be the result outside with nature pictures and more complicated backgrounds. Now I am also curious about this problem too. :-/
Im not sure what "old model" means but I know it does not fit on a Canon Rebel T3i.
It's faster, wider angle, and smaller. It can produced sharp photos too. ;)
No, this is an EF-M which is native to the EOS-M camera. Adapters needed for the EF-S cameras
Sorry, No.. This is only for the Canon M.
Yes, that is the lens I purchased the cap for.
Use this one DROK Digital Display 6-40V to 8-80V DC Boost Converter Regulator Constant Current/Voltage Charger 400W by DROK
No... there are many others listed on Amazon.
I am not sure what side the SIM card is as I only have the wifi version but on the left side of the case it is open so if it's on that side you should have access, but you shouldn't be taking out the SIM card too often? Also I have not had an issue with the wake and sleep function it works just fine. Hope this helps.
Who said anything about nexus 7?? I have the nexus 10
Yes
Hi Guy. I use my iphone to control my ipad. I use the Teleprompt +3 app. You will need to purchase it on both the ipad and the iphone. But once you have both, they sync up via bluetooth and you can control the script from your iphone. You can get an idea of how well the app works by watching a tutorial I created to reduce tongue tension in singers here: https://youtu.be/021lHxaQXCA It's a great little app!!
Mine is the 15" Macbook Pro. The fit is perfect.
Yes, perfectly. I have been using mine for over 2 months now and it's been a great investment.
I would check with the seller. It may depend on what color you pick. Two years ago I got a blue one with a blue keyboard cover. This year I got a purple one and the keyboard cover was clear.
No this one will not work well as a corner mount.
si, si aplico
Sorry.this one can't fit.
Yes.it is.
Yes, there is a funcin in the stereo to activate every botton
you might have to update it are it's because of the cheapness of the device
Probablly, ... I would verify by calling Emotiva customer support. Also, Emotiva's new Fusion Flex amplifier....has two imputs built right in for nominal cost increase if you have not purchased the Mini X yet.
it will sleep when it's not in use. the blue ring will turn to yellowish orange. when it picks up a signal, it will come back on. like if you have your turntable plugged to it and you drop the needle after not being used, the amp will come on.
Not as hot as other amps. It's an amp so you will have some heat, it needs to be well ventilated. It doesn't require any additional fans or cooling. It's a very good amp. I hope this helps.
Use the XPA5 for the front & center and two surround channels. Your receiver has plenty of power to run the remaiining surround channels.
The weight capacity id 22lb each stand and the height is about 22" (58 cm)
Yes, both are AF-S, they are pretty decent lenses for beginners. just want to let you know they are 18-55mm, F3.5 - 5.6 and 55-200mm, F4-5.6, if aperture is important to you.
Unless you are on cable or satellite, you will need an antenna for Over-The-Air local broadcasts. Just like any TV. If you have strong local channels, a simple rabbit ears will probably work fine.
No, laptops require a different type of RAM card
My husband owns these headphones, and I sit about 3 feet away from him on my own computer often when he's playing online. If I listen very hard I can just hear the sound of voices, but not enough to know what they're saying. I have heard people though when they were excited and shouting, but still not audible enough to be distinctive. I don't think you'd be disturbing anyone in another room, other than by your own voice when speaking maybe. Hope this helps.
Thank you for your time. In regards to your inquiry this kit is available with a T-mount made specifically for Nikon AF lenses. This particular kit is for the Nikon 1 Series, however we do have the other listed as well.
Yes they have a 9db antennae that may get you some extra range. Not sure if they a bigger one. I did not see one on there web site.
Yes on both questions.
The charger weighs 2 1/2 ounces.
Yes, its works perfectly with the Sony battery too. In fact, I never even charge any of my batteries in the camera, I only use this charger.

Sure-with WiFi. My wife thinks it is super- but compared to the coby she had - two cans on a string would be super! This is one of the better 7 inch tablets.
I'm not sure about that specific camera, but I can tell you that the camera box is around 7.5" x 7.0 ". My camera, a Sony A65 with standard 18-70 mm lens is just about 7" long and just fits. I do love the bag, although I do end up keeping my longer lens (70-210 mm) in the top compartment. The bag is very well made, comfortable, and I think it will last awhile. Hope this helps.
The 5001z in a replacement for the 5001a. The pk5001z is an updated version it will work for you.
Yes it does
I'm almost positive that there are 2 screws for mounting. The glass shelf itself can only hold approx. 22 lbs. Get the wall anchors that are the metal butterfly, they will hold a good amount of weight. They use them on the ceiling mounts for hanging plants. Hope this information helps.
Black glass when looking from the top, but looking from the bottom it looks like a coating of some type...you can not see through it
Wall to front of shelf 20in cover on wall 9 1/4in by 3in
It was a tight fit, but I was able to insert a 3 pronged plug into the second wall outlet. A 2 pronged plug should fit nicely.
Scheduled to be on sale for $97 at 5pm Pst.
The box is approximately 51" by 7" by 31" if that's what you mean.
You have to format the disk with the DVR, it cannot read the windows file format, The instructions tell you how to format the disk in the dvr, then reboot and your set.
I don't know. I order this item for someone. Sorry
no
No, but not sure why you would need them. It would still work as any normal keyboard, although any Win7/8 specific keys might not work within XP. As long as you have a USB port to plug the dongle into, you should be good to go.
It does not.
Yes it will. It is the device that configures and remembers the settings. So pair away. :)
the business keyboard length is longer, according to the description.
Yes, a very small one.
Battery AA. Life of battery is extremely long. I think I have replaced it once since I purchased mouse. The battery is replaceable. Just a note it really is a great wireless mouse works perfectly. It is small but works wonderful.
was a good way to ship and i and the owner of te lap top is so conform whit this thing tanks
This battery has extended legs on each side. Original L655 battery does not. Think it will be too long.
Do you mean the screen or the back cover? The screen is adequately viewed from the front and if you choose the frost cover, the color of the iPod is definitely seen through it. The black would cover the iPod without showing the color of the product.
You can see in the tittle "...(Original 1st Generation)...", and down in the description the next : "..1st GENERATION Google Nexus 7 (NOT COMPATIBLE for New 2nd Generation Nexus 7).." the first negeration was released in septembre-octobur 2012, Regards.
Sorry, don't know. The protector for the Nexus 7 has cut-out for camera at top of screen. If you do a search on Amazon for "Polaroid 7 tablet" you'll probably find the right one.
I contacted them. They said do system reset and redownload google play. They said its an android problem. I sent mine back for refund. Good luck
Yes
I think so - it's pretty sturdy.
they come with the bracket
Yes
Yes.
It should fit and should be placed in carefully.The clamps will hold it in place but be easy on them anyway.
No, it's not but you can buy an adaptor and make it work.
Yes, but it's not of good quality and doesn't fit tight
It works with my IPad. Not sure about the case though
Yes
You can just use the usb cable on any laptop, dockstation, desktop usb entrance to recharge it.
Two Normal lens or one wide angle, not the zoom lenses like the 70-300. But the Lowepro exchange 200 AW will do.
Yes. It came with hard cardboard to cover it. Do worry about damage~
You also have to shut off your iPod. Unless you unplug it.
I would avoid using using this product when the Dream Lite Pillow Pet is left in, on or near bassinets, cribs, mattresses, playpens or anywhere a infant, toddler or young child can easily get tangled in the cord while sleeping. Placement on a nightstand or elsewhere in the room when using overnight with the AC Adapter is highly recommended.
my camera (not including the video screen or the waterproof case) weighs in at a mere 1/4 pound. Add on a mounting bracket for another 1/8 lb. Maybe the entire package with charger and hardware is 2.4lbs. Take off for the wild blue yonder! P. Brown
I don't know, and NO. But I must say I'm not happy with it. There is a pause in the recording every second or so - regularly, making the video herky jerky.
No, it is not waterproof.
yes
It will easily allow moving pictures to either a PC or a Mac computer. Not having a Nook, I don't know if the Nook will connect to either computer. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
It works fine with my Galaxy S3 phone. It should work with any micro SD card used in a Galaxy Note 2.
i will let you know in few days,i just install it ,i learing how to use it
Yes. The stands can be adjusted from approximately 3ft up to the maximum height.
It comes with a remote
I am not sure, my husband only used it a couple of times before it quit working.
Yes
Yeah, this turntable needs an amp. Or you can use on a computer too on USB. But amp, home theater, are the best option.
Yes and they sound remarkable well for no bigger then they are. I have the ones I bought already wrapped for Christmas or I would tell you the wattage.
No, the Crosley CR6010A-Re Collegiate is not equipped with a record changer. Crosley produced until recently a 'Stack-o-matic' record changer, also called Collegiate.
No microphone. The interface cable is proprietary for swann dvr.
Power supply and pan tilt controller
All record
Yes it is.
I purchased this camera as a retirement present for one of our employees. I'm not familiar with the warranty. I'm sorry a I was not able to assist your query.
It depends con the fittings man, what fittings you planning to buy?
Hi there, the most important item for the XSPC Rasa is the computer case. Is your computer case big enough to fit the radiator and the pump? The XSPC comes with variable backplates 1366,1155,775,AMD2+ and AMD3+. The system should work fine.
D3200 and D3100 should be the same body..
Yes, it should work with the extended battery. The whole bottom of it is open so it shouldn't interfere. I don't have the extended battery so I have not tried it personally with my camera however.
Pink
It fits the ipad 2 perfectly.
It came in a padded envelope, so I would say it is just a few ounces lighter than the shipping weight.
I played a region 2 DVD(UK) In The Machine The Other day and It Played Automatically With No Problem
Bulbs will work for either as long as it's the correct size.
I live 45 miles away from the stations. This antenna easily picked up all the stations I wanted. Good luck! Please check out www.tvfool.com for more info on stations you can get in your area.
According to the manual this player uses the NTSC color format only. The manual can be found here. https://docs.sony.com/release/SLVD271P.pdf
No
Yes, the SLV-D271P does have a built in analog tuner. However, you will need a digital converter box, if you plan to watch TV with an antenna. Here is a link to a very good digital converter box! http://www.amazon.com/Zinwell-ZAT-970A-Digital-Converter-Antenna/dp/B001DVZXC0/ref=sr_1_1?m=A32C9PML1J3Y0V&s=merchant-items&ie=UTF8&qid=1408892972&sr=1-1&keywords=Zinwell+ZAT-970A
Yes
If my memory serves me correctly, yes. The insertion point to stay on the tripod is a small screw-like post. If the T3i has an inset screw hole, then yes.
These are the Monarch 7 8x42 ED ATB. ED=extra low dispersion glass, ATB=all terrain binoculars.
These binoculars are very bright, Relatively light and compact and good for all uses. Best binoculars I have ever owned.
This system is water resisitant , but if you want completer water proofness I'd suggest buying the clear acrylic watr sports case . I have ridden in the rain on my bicycle in heavy rain with out the case and it's been fine . for diving , surfing I'd get the case . Hope this helps .
The beep can be controlled with the volume; lowest volume, no beep. This does not affect the recording volume.
Yes but it is absolute garbage. It won't lock into position without breaking the fixture. Even the optional mount is junk. Plan on making your own mounts.
Yes, I have three and working like charm no issues. Ensure you always update firmware
Yes to both. Not a big matter anyways, I think cord noise on this small in-ears is unevitable.
Long enough to put your phone in your pocket, with out it shorting you. But it does get a bit in the way during workouts, so I just run the cord through my shirt.
Not sure...I have a Rebel t3 and this lens works great
yes
don't know how many I usually just listen to Pandora but it works with Netflix if you connect a cable to your modem and then one to your aMp if you have a Yamaha amp. Nice & solid.
Tienes que removerle el plastico de la punta y asi entra directo! Jajajajajaja a mi me pas tambien! Espero haberte ayudado
I charges using a micro usb cable, so you can charge it using your computer, or from a wall outlet using a power adapter.
Yes. My primary adapter is 500 and the rest of my house is mixed and matched with 200s and 500s, and it all works great. Just make sure they're all the same brand!
the unit comes with us standard maps! you can simply download your maps using an sd card!
I don't know
A hammer is very effective. Then go buy a Nook.
No
I tested using crystal mark. The read is 94MB/s, write is 64MB/s
It will depend on whether the reader port is USB 2 or USB 3. The limit is going to be the read speed of the port. If you use a USB 3 port and reader, it's super fast. The write speed is super fast. The read spead to your computer is limited by the computer device speed. I use a reader for my USB 3 port and it is FAST!
Hey Judith, My answer for you is.... send it back, get your money back..I ordered two , one kept shutting off by itself, the other, the speaker crackling bad... sent them both back and bought a Samsung Galaxy Android, more expensive, but you do get what you pay for, for sure!! bought two of them, no problems whatsoever!!! Walmart...sorry Amazon! :) I do love you Amazon, but for the money, and a good product..best one out there, reviews and all!! hope this helped you! Wilmasue
Yes my son in joy it
Yes
Dual band mode selects the best of the two bands available. It can help with speed. Ultimately speed on your local network is controlled by the slowest of all components: router, access points, drives, etc.
According to the Denon web site (usa.denon.com -- pdf file under the this model), the power output is 30 W.
Galaxy S5 yes Avant? But anything that charges using a USB can be charged simply by pluging your cable in. Cables are included for apple products.
Yes
I haven't used it to charge an iPad. I have used it to charge my iPhone and it charged to 100% three times before I had to charge the myCharge. I see no reason it couldn't charge an iPad, but it may require more power.
Don't have a clue what you mean by this question. Sorry.
Works perfectly with my iPod Classic and Bose Soundlink Mini Bluetooth speaker.
Yes, it does
Blocks phone numbers automatically. No option to key in numbers.
It uses EEPROM technology also referred as non-volatile memory which retains the programming even when disconnected from the power source. Regards,
Blocked number ring once. Cordless phones brands may ring twice.
Yes
No
I have iPad 3, and it fits perfectly. If iPad 4 is exactly same size as iPad 3, it will fit. I absolutely LOVE this product!
I don't know
Yes, specifically ordered this size and dual powered unit for our Aliner camper. Use a flat screen swivel arm mounting that we can put on and off mount (with pintle & gudgeon application) easily when we open and close our camper.
Short answer: Yes. This unit, model NTD-1553 has INPUTS: Antenna in, PC audio, VGA, RGB video, composite video+L/R audio, HDMI, S-Video, USB, and OUTPUTS: Earphone, composite video+L/R audio
You do need power. I ran mine from a lightbulb adapter. It is WiFi for the connection to the Internet. If I remember correctly you need to set it up first via a wired connection so you can tell it your WiFi network name and password.
No! that would be nice if it did.
Yes it does, and you need it to be able to use 3/4 of the recorder's functions. Its part number is NB887UD if yours is missing. If you search it up on Amazon, it's black, rectangular, with mostly white but some red buttons.
If your phone is docked and the devices are connected on the AUX setting, you can simply set an alarm on your phone however you want it to go off. The phone alarm will play through the alarm clock. I don't believe the clock itself will play a musical alarm.
Sorry, we do not
Thank you message! The format of this product is Japan specification. You can only recording of Japanese specifications. Best regards!
Yes. This is just the cable modem. I had to buy a seperate wifi router
yes it does i ordered a red one from hde snd it works well like it works so well
The power supply states an input on 120-240 Volts AC. It came with different adapters for different country type on outlets. I like the camera, works well, not too much range at nigthtime. Records motion events well.
110~220 v...definitely
No. There is no tower. The processor and mother board are integrated into the monitor.
I use this switch in my workshop with cheap shop lights. Those lights have two 40 Watt fluorescent lights and an ordinary ballast. The switch always works.
I dont own a PS3/4 but on Xbox it would work and Xbox One no. You could likely find an adapter for it.
No, it doesn't. You don't need a cd key to play Dota 2, however. It is free to play on Steam.
I have only, and honestly, tried these on my PS3 which does work through its USB adapter. I have not tried it on the Xbox yet. You can try to check google to see if someone else has had any experience trying.
no way,
Yes
If the RX100 II have the same dimensions as the RX100, then I would think that you would have the same disappointing results that I did. The bottom support fits perfectly but the top cover is bulky and awkward. The top cover has to be removed when you open it to take a picture, otherwise it may fall off and possibly get lost. I hope this information is useful.
No. .. Not at all.
Actually it has improved! Yesterday, my Kindle was down to 25%. It only took a little over two hours to reach a full charge. More than sufficient for my purposes.
Hello Gzed: This power adapter comes without showing a brand. However, If you remove a small piece of tape; Toshiba is printed on the unit where the tape was. What this means I'm sure. The adapter works great just like the one that came with my laptop.
Yes it can but if you leave it on rge charger all the time you can damage the battery. Better to just charge when needed.
Yes it comes with a battery charger, the price is really good and it is a great camera
It does come with a warranty. The third filter is a fluorescent filter. I haven't found an occasion yet where I've needed it, though.
I have a MacBook Pro and it's great if you need to stream from your computer to a tv. Your tv has to have the HDMI outlet. I will say I use this only when showing iTunes content or things from my computer that cannot be streamed via Chromecast.
These are intended to convert an HDMI digital output from a source, to a VGA display. Only one way.
nope it does not have enough power it needs an additional power source
yes
Yes the lights can be turned off. Just the push of the button.
I bought my cable and went to this website to add my GPSMap 295 into the database - the device was during the process, then I purchased the updates to the airmaps and uploaded them to the GPS , https://fly.garmin.com/fly-garmin/portables/ Hope this works out for you - Mine worked well, but like you, it did take a bit of time to work through the process...
It works fine for 8.1 as well as 7 so there's no reason why it shouldn't work with any others
I don't use a split ring / key chain, however the attachment hole is oval and is approx 1/16" x 1/8" inch...
VTech series CS 6229, 6229-2, 6229-3, 6229-4, 6229-5, DS 3101, 3111-2, 6111, 6111-2, 6121, 6122, 6201, 6211
Yes
the camera slot is in the middle and your camera is to the side,so that is a problem .Other slots may not align,do check that.
The case is 8 inches by 4 1/2 inches by 3/4 inches.
No it's just the case.
Not sure about a next book, I looked up a cover for a hkc tablet And this is what came up so I bought it. What a joke!!! All the ports , headphones, charger ect, can not be used eith it on. What!!! You have to take the cover off to charge the tablet. I so not recommend this cover at all
We have two of these cases and haven't needed to clean them as of yet, but since this is a leather case I would clean it with whatever you might use for leather. Any mild soap should work fine. Nothing abrasive.
I'm pretty sure this will work. I have done this with a DVD Player. With the A/V cable, plug the yellow and white into your TV leaving the red hanging off to the side (it doesn't look pretty, but should work...you may want to tape the red prong off to the side so it doesn't touch a metal surface). Plug all three connections into the Roku. It should work on your TV even if it is an older model.
Using Roku, you can watch Netflix streaming without tying up your computer. It does use your wireless system, but does not affect what you are doing on the computer; we routinely use our computers for a different purpose in one room while streaming video in another room. Just fyi, you could also use devices like Wii to watch Netflix streaming, but the navigation is pretty shaky, so Roku does a better job with an easier set-up if you are only interested in streaming video and not games.
The width of visual land 7" is smaller than the Google Nexus 7 so I would say it will fit. However, based on the power and volume button placing this cover might or might not be the best for it. You have to compare the button positions before buying this. Hope it helps.
I actually have the 1TB model. I am not sure, but I don't think that this feature is available in the 1 TB model.
Price only! I mean for 1TB you will pay $80 or $90 US dollars, for 2T $150 or $160. For this model external HDD.
Of course. USB 3.0 is backward compatible with USB 2.0, however, it will run at USB 2.0 speeds...
I had the same problem when I 1st purchased this product. Apple then had an update and I haven't had a problem since. This is the only external hard drive I've used with my MacBook Air.
Yes. The charge lasts for quite a while and hasn't been an issue do us. Of course, it depends on how much you use it, look at photos taken, and play with the controls.
Yes
Alston, My Alpine unit required a dash mount kit to fit in my VW, My advice would be to contact Alpine directly, www.alpine-usa.com or (800) ALPINE-1 (1-800-257-4631) Best of luck, George Mustillo
Hello, I remember choosing between the two as well. What I found out is it was the same (tray load). Its lower price is due to the fact that it doesn't come with the Multimedia Suite, which I didn't want anyway.
Yes the Jabra Revo headset will fit inside this case. There are even pockets that will hold the two support cables for the Revo headset.
yes it is,.
The regular Google Play store comes installed on this unit. You don't have to install it after the fact as with many 'from China' tablets. It works great, though Android 4 is incompatible with a few apps. Nothing major. I have All the apps I needed working fine.
Yes I was able to make it work but don't get this tablet when I got mine the headphone Jack was broken and they wouldn't replace it pos tablet
I am sorry but I am not familiar with the Jabra c820 headphones. These pads did it fit my Sony headphones perfectly.
Yes. It has a USB cable to interface with your computer and a software disc.
Yes only digital... Well it might have a small optical zoom (5x or 10x) but I would not use the digital zoom as it gets very grainy. Honestly stopped using it after a year, case cracker twice, and the battery overheats causing it to drain really fast. Wouldn't film 10min with out powering down, and it was "fully charged'. I can't really recommend this camera. Sony point and shoots take better video...
No
My understanding is that when you go to like, digital channel 10-2 versus analog channel 10, it's a different frequency and data rate than analog channels, and it may take the receiver a few seconds to lock in on it (even if it's programmed in).
This was bought for a galaxy tab 2 & it fits perfectly, very snug, not loose like some others
What are you looking to do with the card? This site may help. http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/gaming-graphics-card-review,3107.html
The only thing I can tell you is that if you have a regular USB connection it should work. The computer will dictate the information transferred so if your Garmin accepts Apple formatted information it should work. I am not a computer geek so I am not really sure how it all works.
The case comes with two fans. A large one up front and and a small one in the back.
Have you thought about trying a USB wireless adapter? Something like this? TP-LINK model# TL-WN722N (I have not tried it, but it goes for about $15 and gets pretty good reviews)
I am 6 3 and have no issues good luck
The Xperia Tablet S has a different USB/Charging connector than the original Tablet S. This only works with the newer Xperia Tablet.
It runs off the main
I live outside the Chicago area, probably 30miles line of sight and this product completely failed. Hit and miss... I even added an amp with no resolution. I was very disappointed in this product.
Yes.
I do but it wasn't a big deal for me.
I have the instructions and would be happy to scan and email them to you. Just let me know where to send them. Wendywee
Just talk with the cam close by u loudly
You configure it to work with whatever application you plan to use the camera with and then you record it from the software. It's not a very good camera for video, but it works for something.
You can record from any audio source,don't know about i tunes,I'm not knowledgeable about modern technology, this is why I love the MiCorder,I can record from any source,LP's,cassettes,CD's without using a computer,great little machine,hope this helps....RKS
It should work with no problem. According to the label on the plug, the input is 12v-24v with output of 15v at 1.2amp.
Whatever is required for the ASUS 101/Prime tablet. If that is the type of tablet you have.
It is terrible, do not buy it
it came charged, and I've only charged once or twice since buying it last month...
Ive never heard of those! To download to mine i used iTunes and switched the songs to mp3 format - they have a button for that. Sorry im no help for you
Yes. I have this Bose Acoustimass as a Center Channel Speaker on a Denon A/V Receiver with Line Level Speaker Terminal Outputs (speaker Wire type with the Red and Black Spring Connector.) Using 16 or 18 Gauge Speker wire. No fancy connectors needed.
The Sony Xperia Tablet S SGPT123US/S only supports: Bluetooth Standard Version 3.0 Wi-Fi : IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n No 3G.
Yes. Just download the Android App. No problems.
This thing doesn't work it respond to any wireless internet wave .
Yes indeed. Once the red lights start blinking and while looking into the eye spot you'll see a spot that reflects like a flash it'll apear bright red flash that's the lens of the hidden camera. As far with signal depends on what type of electronic is nearby within the room
By now you have probably discovered that the instruction sheet is useless. You can practice detecting RF signals by using your cell phone or microwave oven. This item does detect RF signals is useless for the laser detection. Good luck
No, but I have two tablet the cable to link them did not work on one of the key pads.
Yes it can adjust to fit a 10in tablet but the connection is wrong , a part is missing that connects the keyboard and the Pen is not for touch screen
I'm sorry I have no idea. I bought it for a notebook.
Hey Carolyn, You do not need a mouse with this keyboard it comes with a pen that you use to navigate the tablet.
My experience is around 12-15 secs delay giving the internet speed with Comcast of 6 Mbps download and 28.85 Mbps uploads.
Yes
i am sorry i did not use it on windows 8 i used on windows 7
Yes, if the Compaq Armada E500 is a Parallel ATA or (PATA/IDE) HD then it should be a great upgrade! And it looks like the Armada E500 is a IDE hard drive. But just check the specs and make sure.
Yes, it goes through a full spectrum of colors, including white.. You can pause it on any color of your choosing or have it constantly changing at any speed you like. This is one of my favorite parts on my rig because the lighting is bright and shows off the hardware, plus its a super easy install.
The stream connects to the same network that your Roamio is connected to... In my situation, my Roamio is ethernet connected to my local network by plugging in an ethernet cable to the output RJ-45 on the Roamio, and into an available port on my 8-port switch. (This connection is managed in Tivo network settings.) The Stream is also connected to my local network the same way. Connect one end of an RJ-45 ethernet cable connector into the Stream and the other end into an available port in your local switch. The connection is managed by the Tivo Roamio.
no, it's a proprietary connector (on card) which fits a breakout cable (provided with card) which in turn provides 2 DVI ports. so in short - 2 DVI output, no VGA. You can of course place a DVI to VGA adapter (passive) on one of the DVI outputs (cable) and thus achieve DVI+VGA but it seems too much hassle given there are many card that will provide that (DVI+VGA) natively, IF that is what you're looking for. Hope that helps.
Yes both DVD and TV work on the 12 volts. Exelent product we have it on our boat.
TV is junk don't buy it. Has one not two HDMI inputs. Over air reception died then the whole thing died. Tried to get a refund but they will only repair/replace.
Yes
Yes
Yes this lens work on all Canon EOS Rebel cameras.
Yes.
The box states it is the EFS 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS. Not the IS II. However, it has the same lens number as the IS II on the box. Sorry for the mixed answer but that's all I know.
Yes. It will work with that radio.
Sorry, do not know. There are two connectors - each with 3 contacts similar to stereo headsets. They provide for speaker, mike, transmit button, as well as the connection for programming from a computer. They are different size plugs. I do not know what contact goes to what signal. I am sure a wiring diagram from the manufacturer would tell you.
I had to pull it open by the edges. I was very dissatisfied with this piece of equipment
its a single din unitand I believe the Ford Mazda used a double dinall you have to get is an install kit
Yes it works with my RX100 so I assume it would work with yours as well.
The one I received was blue just like I wanted.
I imagine it would be 3 or 4 however I have not used mine in such a manner.
If you scroll down to the Product Details it will give you the exact dimensions and weight for the selected product size. The 19" version that I have has about 4" to spare with the 15" cabinet space that I have.
No, for two reasons. First, the 276c only supports Bluechart g2, not Bluechart g2 Vision. Second, the 276c uses a Garmin Data Card. Unfortunately, they are difficult to purchase outside of the Garmin website. Thank you for your inquiry.
I use it in Garmin 740S. It only enhances your vision of the bottom. To be honest I wasn't really impressed with it.
Not unless you root it. might want to conract their support
No per searches on Amazon
I do not believe that battery will work. The tabs on the side, are too wide for the notebook you have.
Read the product description. It says that the shelf is included.
It's USB 3.
speed and no eternal power supply it's powered from the usb port
Not 100% sure...I believe the 9233 (given the higher number) is the latest model. The only difference I can tell is the external cosmetics.
The minimum requirement listed on newegg is 450 W, but I would recommend a 550 to be safe. I'm running an i7-975X @ 3.33 GHz, 8GB RAM, 2 x SATAs, 2 x 20 cm LED fans, 1 x 12 cm fan, and this beauty on a generic 460 W. Everything seems okay. GPU stress test is stable. Prime95 for 24 hours is stable. Hope this helps.
Might want too r.m.a that my only goes up to 45 c degrees friend. Msi will replace it or so will Amazon. That is a little warm there. Just side note use evga precision app it may help u out.
If the battery is the one specified for use in the RX 100M/3B, it should work. However if that is not, the case. check your manual and make sure it is the one specified&gt; I have DSC HX 400/V and the charger and batteries work well for me. BOB
Yes, the camera has a built in microphone.
Hi, The old Panasonic software does not support this camera, but the new software on CD does and it Rockz! NOTE: New Panasonic software can be a challenge to run normally and it is still not ready (2014/06/27) for Prime Time... GLTA
If I remember I used it on a dell dimension 2350 (really old desktop) with xp like a year ago and I got it to work.it has the driver mini cd included
Worked fine
No it will not it's compatable with the ipad 2-4 not the iPad Air
No
No you cannot do that. The slowest speed is like a slow live panoramic . Nice and smooth but too fast for time lapse. It's a good panner but not great. It is the only one worth a damn for under 1000 that I have seen.
no, I did install one, but hardly use it. There are some CD/DVD/BR that do not image correctly to the hard disk, but copy ok when duplicated from one drive to the other (like MS windows)
I would doubt it. I believe the layout of the Ethernet and USB ports has changed.
I don't think so. I ended up returning mine because of noise interference.
I haven't tried it that far.
Yes
From what I can see online, yes.
I baught 2 ,had to have one replace came with cracked screen. I played hell to get a new one sent. They are junk didnt last but a few months. Waste of money they never worked right!
no did not it was to big but I had to cut it to size.
If they say it is for the Kindle you have, then you have to trust that you will be getting the right one. If it is wrong you can always return it.
Yes these do. I actually needed the ones for the original kindle and tried to make these work. Either way difficult to put on without dust. Support gave me some excellent ideas that would help like installing in a steamy bathroom. The moisture in the air will help prevent dust from floating in the air.
As long as you have your pl tone
There has to be an opening of some sort, or the ability to push the velcro strap through somehow. If your headrest is actually a part of the seat, this one wont work.
yes, it will fit in any headrest. This is just a piece of elastic with velcro on it which wraps around the headrest.
Sorry, I don't know the deminsion s of ipad1 but it works great with ipad2.
I don't think so. You can check the mfg website which has all the dimensions:http://www.kata-bags.us/3n1-22-dl-for-dslr-w-mid-range-zoom-lens-3-4-lenses-flash-ktdl-3n1-22?tab=dimensions The bigger one can fit though. Good luck
i used mine on live no problem. It even says its a microsoft drive on my xbox
Hi Diana, the answer is yes, it will work on any type of car seat, as far as I can tell, because it has an adjustable strap with velcro. Kind of like a belt with velcro:))
No. It'll be too loose.
Problems with the cables are rare. We send a New cable if there is any problem with it.
Yes
a cahrger and a USB cord are included.
Yes it does
No
No it would be to thick the iPad Air is thin and would slide around, type in survivor case for iPad Air 2 it will show the one that fits.
Fits great..!! Ours is a 3!
No. It's not that clear that you would be able to video through it.
Yes perfectly
It does. But I don't think they live up to the claim of 1200mAh, it probably has as much juice as the Canon originals at it's best, not more.
Yes it does have the four screw holes
Yes. You use the Windows Media Center PC SE remote codes with it.
Yep, it works on my S400CA just fine, and any other recent 65W Asus laptops, I assume.
Nope. But not difficult to use.
Thats exactly what i use it for. I connect the optical out of my tv to connect a set of speakers with 3.5mm connector
Hi Anna! This case was made only for the classic 30GB model. We have cases available for later models of the iPod, though none at the moment for the 5th generation. Apologies for that. If there's anything else, just let me know. I can be contacted directly via this link:
it backs up for power surges - it does have a time limit on how long it stays on without power. I absolutely love it - it has the two alarms - either by soothing sounds/radio or alarm noise - best clock/radio ever!!
No, that is the exact model I have, and it won't fit. It only works on 2011 or newer. Their restocking fees are outrageous, so I never sent mine back.
I don't think it's the same one. Is your battery screwed in with a sticker that says not to remove or replace?
Its very quiet. I have it in my living room next to my DVD amp etc..you cannot tell it is on.
I would guess with about 99.998% certainty....no. You will need to back up those drives. I'd say preferrably, you will buy all new drives for this or any NAS enclosure you're setting up. HTH.
No
No I think it looks a little better on the black phone actually. I have seen it on both!
Check this ... http://www.synology.com/products/compare_spec.php?lang=enu&compare_list%5B%5D=DS713%2B&compare_list%5B%5D=DS213 The main diff I see is Max. 713 has an Expansion Unit plus other obvious enhancements being a recent model
Apps funtion I dontn think. But Im able to get connectivity with Bluetooth no problems. I have an Android phone note 3.
yes, there is both AM and FM tuner.
Hi Amanda, Here are the Compatible iPod/iPhone models: iPod touch 4th generation, iPod touch 3rd generation, iPod touch 2nd generation, iPod nano 6th generation, iPod nano 5th generation (video camera), iPod nano 4th generation (video), iPod nano 3rd generation (video),iPod classic 160 GB (2009), iPhone 4S, iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 3G. -Anthony
Yes it will. Only one of the plugs can be 3-pronged though (that round grounding plug under the two flat ones) Source: Traveled to Italy and Spain
Yes absolutely, that's what I use it for!
I would go with the 18/135 lense . Have had both , 18 is newer , better technology , wider and lighter . Pictures are outstanding
You still get your fingerprints but they're easily taken care of.
It's definitely not anti glare but with the brightness up its ok for the most part
No way...I don't even think my belt could get around an arm that big! HA! It's pretty tight on my arm, and there's no way my arm is 19" around.
Initially, my reader had the 1.0.03.09110 US version. After purchase I made upgrade to version 1.0.04.11081. You can dowload it from here: http://projects.mobileread.com/reader/users/porkupan/rupor/ReleasesT2/FW/PRS-T2_Updater_1.0.04.11081.exe if you want to make full backup of version 1.0.03.09110 US, you may use the instruction from this russian site: http://www.the-ebook.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=25373 After firmware upgrade I've got Android version 2.2.3. I wish you luck!
i have the same problem tho i had mine for a few weeks, i notice when you try to put 2 new batteries in the light flashes then thats the last you see of it :/
I don't know if it works legally in Venezuela (in terms of frequency, broadcast power, etc.), but computer USB ports are pretty standardized. It draws power from the USB port, and the computer communicates with it over that same port. So, in terms of technical functionality, it should work anywhere that you have a powered-up computer with a USB port (probably USB-2). It handles many flavors of Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n, maybe others), which are all pretty much worldwide standards as well...
Yes it will work. Make sure you use the installation disc.
my radio never worked from out of the box from all the people I talked to u need to get a different kind of radio
I bought cover like this last year, looks good and fits perfectly , I'm happy.
I believe it is!
1 this works only with the white model. 2 if you do not have the date of made check it online with your number, check on ebay too. Good luck
The dimensions not have. But fits perfectly in Apple Macbook 13" A1342 2009 2010. the weight is 0.520 kg or 1.146 lb
You can not use them while they are charging. The charger goes into the phone jack. You cannot monitor them either. They are silent when charging whether they are on or off.
Yes they do
the zoom is about 3x; depending on which shooting mode you choose you can take up to 10 fps.
no external strobe for this housing at this time
We have not had any problems so far. Went scuba diving in Fiji for a month and pictures came out great. This is a nice case that delivers well and has not been challenging to maintain or use. We never missed a shot we wanted to get.
Can't answer sorry. Haven't used it for video yet.
I have the 4 port Orico which is working well on my 2008 Mac Pro running OS X 10.10
Dear Bernard , Thank you so much for your mail.Please kindly know that this item is ready for Mac OS 10.8.2 or later only and not ready for Mac 10.8. Wish you a Great Day. Best Regards. ORICO Customer Care Team
I would think so but I use them for Android.
Yes
are you using a connecting cable 3.5mm with two out put ends to plug into your aux imput on the back of your receiver? if you really want hi-end playback, get a nuforce dac and use this type of cable or a single 3.5mm connecting cable from mp3 player to a receiver or intergrated amp and the sound quality will blow you away, happy listening:)
No, It won't fit.
As long as you have a windows media player, I dont see why not. I buy my music from Amazon.com, you just have to download their cloud player and it works fine!
See my other long answer for more details. Short answer is "a lot."
It comes with a new cable as well.
No, you can only store pics and video's, I love this player easy to operate and sounds great.
Yes
Yes, u can add any songs u like.
4,2 front 2 rear and an amp if you want
Hi, please send us more details about your concern at socialsupport@am.sony.com, give us your contact details and the exact model number of your unit so that we can assist you further. Thanks. Ely.
Hi, this Sony Car Stereo has a standard single din stereo head with an approximate dimension of 178 mm 50 mm 177 mm (w/h/d). Mounting dimension is 182 mm 53 mm 160 mm. You may check the dash board of your 2003 acura tl if it supports single din. -Ely
You can make it work. I had to buy a kit to make it fit in mine, but my yote didn't have a stock stereo in it.
No, just a voice recorder. There's no record option when in FM radio mode.
720p / 60Hz. Watch standard cable and DVD's in the bedroom.
Yes it will
I do some pretty vigorous bike riding and mow the lawn with them with no issues. They come with 4 different sizes of removable soft ear pieces. I went one size smaller than the factory installed ones for a better more secure fit. Hope this helps.
Sorry, don't have the paperwork any more...
It will indeed. The button failed not too long after owning these earphones with my own personal experience.
Works great with my galaxy s3. You need to download the soundabout app to make sure sound only comes though the headphones. Also the klipsch app works great. I use it with poweramp as my music player, and i love it.
Coax cable with 12v power supply
NTSC only according to the Loftek website.
Mine is 3rd Generation and it fits well.
110V only.
Yes it does. Please be careful of the keyboard though. It is not the best and I believ it is run of the luck on what you get. The customer service was fairly good though!!
We have used them with: Garmin GPS, Car installed GPS and Motorolla smart phones but not any tablets.
No, there's no microSD slot on the Nexus 7. I haven't found that external storage exists on any of the tablets that I've researched.
I do not own Kaavie Exceptionalz but from what I see it should work as it has the same locking technology as smatree. If it doesnt why worry just return it.
Yes, this product will work with a Directv remote
I do not have the box so this is a guestimate. From what I remember about 4ft W x 16in D x 16in H . It was MUCH bigger than the unit itself;mostly packing material.
none that i know of; this item seems only to allow games and videos/movies in MP4 and maybe wmv. also pictures but won't except emulators or any apps i tried to load. U can get free games from CoolRoms.com u might have to change some to bin (binary format) Item does only what is advertised(MAYBE!) buyer beware!
comes without instructions or warranty,battery life vary s. dose not except different emulators, i am sure u can't upgrade the firmware but never tried. it's cheaply made from China, poorly packed. mine came in Styrofoam box wrapped in yellow packaging tape.many games are in Chinese.What u see is what u get.
most of these games come with no instructions(i personally believe these games are a knock-off or have been maybe redirected to others....who put the online for sale.....).SO U WILL NOT GET ANY INSTRUCTION FROM THEM. I tried several sellers and offered to buy instructions(even a photo copy) GOT NO REPLY&gt;Good luck on your search!!!!
No you can not.
YES, it has an AM, FM, IPOD, and AUX . . . I love this player. It is the best purchase, and well worth the few dollars you pay for it. It is MUCH better than BOSE.
No. Dell uses a proprietary power supply. You can find them in the internet for around $30.
Yes
According to the Lexar website (Lexar.com) there is a one year limited warranty.
yes.
I have an XBox 360, PS3, and WII U connected to my tv through this device and have not noticed any additional lag time due to it. Everything seems to work fine.
Robert, I am not sure. I have a smaller version of this converter. I was trying it with my Direct TV receiver box to see if I could change my display settings and I kept getting an error message saying my TV was not HD compatible which is true as my TV does not have any HDMI inputs. So no, I could not go from 480 to 1080 in my situation. Sorry I couldn't be of more help. Good luck!
few seconds
The power adapter that come with it supports 110-240 volts 50/60 cycles. It does have American style plugs to plug it into power however. You would need an adapter to match your power socket. It's possible it ships with different plugs in different countries but the one I bought in the USA came set up for the USA outlets.
I believe 857u has the edition off yellow pixel or fourth pixel color, CAN'T QUITE REMEMBER , strug gleled with the same thing when I bought mine.
No actual comparison, yet I inclined to Sharp for the following reasons: 1.- panel manufactured in Japan; 2.- Sharp manufactures the largest TV; 3.- this Aquos has 4 color components for color red, green, blue and Yelow - no one else has that; 4.- my old Sharp Aquos still functions w/o problem after 7 years; 5.- embedded software may be a little less sofisticated than Samsung's; 6.- Sharp customer service is outstanding; my experience with Samsung customer service was less than satisfactory. Good luck in your choice Ray!
I havent had any issues with streaming with this cable it works perfect for me ... Its a good buy
Typically the digitizer, which is the glass, is what breaks when an iPad is dropped. The LCD screen is a separate part below the glass which is not usually damaged by a fall. I have used this replacement glass to replace several broken iPad screens from falls with good results.
Yes, there is an earphone jack on the front of the unit.
It does not have binding posts.
Apparently. If you click on "find out more" and scroll down there's a list of all the cards that apply. This one is on it.
I would have preferred the wooden man instead of the speakers..maybe it would have lasted more than 3 days..
I hear it will last for 8 to 9 hours before requiring a charge.
Dimensions: 7-1/2'' W x 3-1/2'' H x 0.8'' D (190 x 90 x 21 mm), Weight: 9.6 oz. (272 g).
Yes.
I purchased an RCA indoor tv antenna which is being used for FM reception. It works well, however you are looking at a HDTV antenna with transmission of different waves, therefor it probably will not work.
hello. when my cord detached from the head part of the plug I went to the marquis website and sent them an email and they sent me a replacement cord free of charge.
The color and image looks washed out on any screen that isn't white or near white.
Not wireless, no. But you can connect xbox to the projector with a standard HDMI cable. It's great fun to take it in the yard at night!
Specifically for the Dell Inspiron, I don't know because it seems to depend on the version of blue tooth on your computer. On my Gateway laptop I had to upgrade my blue tooth adapter to the most recent version for the speaker to work for me. A new adapter can be bought for about $10 - $15. Be aware however, I'm not real happy with the quality of the sound as it breaks up quite a bit even when just separated by a couple of feet between the computer and speaker.
Your assumption is correct: it does not take any filter, as well as any other lens of this kind. It comes with a removable hood, to protect the lens from bumps and avoid glare on the photos and also with a lens cap that fits and hold perfectly on the front of the glass (with the removable hood attached).
I'm sure it will, as I have a Canon Eos rebel T3i. It does take some time to figure out the proper settings.
The sound is really good, I have not used it by a pool but it should be good
Yes
power supply model SC 10DLC,INPUT 100-240V -50/60 HZ 9.3A, OUTPUT 5V=1A
It should fit. It was originally designed for the Note, so it has a flash slot as well as for the S Pen which the P5210 does not have.Therefore these two slots will be there with no function.
I returned it and bought a Roo case from Amazon, it was better contructed than the Samsung case, which was flimsy. Good luck.
No you can't, this is for macbook. And also otherwise the quality of the cable was crappy, it stopped working on 2nd use. I don't encourage anybody to touch this piece of garbage.
With a v-mount battery you can carry this light around -- it is a nice portable light for run-and-gun shooting, not hot, light weight, no cord, etc. You can also run it from its cord and transformer. You will probably want a stand for it for conventional video lighting. Obviously, you need a charger for your battery. I like two batteries, so I can swap one while the other charges.
Please disregard as I have found that it DOES WORK with a regular 2.5 inch non flash based hard drive. Your hard drive should work fine in it as long as it's a 2.5 inch drive. Sorry for the mis-understanding.
This one should give your Pavilion a good strong 6 hours with normal usage.
I just tried it both around a corner and through a wall and it does indeed work in those situations.
It is for all 3
See JD's review, he says they do.
There is a green input port marked "AUX" on one side of the 5.1 adaptor. You will need to have a male-to-male 3.5mm audio cable (assuming your CD player has a standard 3.5mm audio out...), and then connect one end to this AUX port. Note that this will only have a stereo (2 channel) output and not 5 channel as CD players with 3.5mm outputs will only output stereo sound.
Unfortunately I couldn't use it at all. And the cost to send it back was more than the product itself! This docking station is for older tablets with 30 pin connector and I have the smaller 9 pin connector. I hope this helps.
No it does not. I purchased the earlier version and this did fit that version but the tablet was defective and I returned it and ordered the 2014 version and it did not fit.
We have had this tv in our very bright living room since November. Absolutely love the picture quality & have not experienced any glare problems. Hope this helps!
When I purchased the Sony KDL50EX645 I also bought CHEETAH MOUNTS APTMM2B Flush Tilt TV Wall Mount Bracket. Very easy to install. Works great. Paid $27.99 in January 2013.
No it does not. It will only come with the stand.
Check out CNET review, they have the setting.
No, mine did not. However I purchased one.
Mine is fine . I bet if you contact Sharp they will give you a software update.
Not sure. My MBP is a mid-2010 model. Sorry I couldn't help more.
This is a very good camera with both manual and automatic settings. If you know what you are doing regarding photography, you can take very good photos of your paintings, that could be printed easily at 11x14 or bigger with good quality.
It was purchased as a birthday present for my son. I do believe he told me he had to go to Best Buy for a specialty USB cable because of the size of the port. I hope this helps.
use the mini USB cable to connect to device and the USB window will pop-up, click on turn on USB storage. in the load mode you can copy and delete. Good luck!
When you search the Samsung website for MV900, it displays MV900F The website does not have any info on MV900 Unless it is an old model that is no longer available, there really is no MV900
I only had it for a short time. It was very basic... I don't have it in my possession now to help you, I bought a Samsung galaxy tab 2 as a replacement but I will try.
Yes. It is possible.
When you first plug it in, the charging symbol should show up on the screen. If it doesn't, use the AC adaptor. If that doesn't work, you may have a bad battery, or a problem with the unit itself.
yes it does and it comes with the usb cable
I am using a Sandisk Micro SD 16GB I have had not problems with photos nor HD video Sorry, I dont know the speed It is at least 3 or 4 years old so it is not the very fast chip
It takes a Micro-SD card..
Yes
It comes with an indoor wire antenna which can be connected. However, I did not notice any difference in reception between it and the fixed antenna. Hellmut
No just for data
I used only one( which works well) and then used a power strip to plug in both! You shouldn't need two. This works for me no issues at all. If you want or need two, one for each, reverse application power strip, then the two protectors and then plug washer & dryer in. Other option Walmart or any hardware store will have an outlet splitter for a couple of dollars! One of these options if not all three will work!
Not sure I have that one for my washer, you could try Tripp Lite SPIKECUBE Surge Protector Wallmount Direct Plug In 120V 1 Outlet 600 Joule by Tripp Lite
Any usb keyboard will work, I personally use a wireless keyboard that had a usb dongle so I can sit in my couch.
Yes. Works great
No but the other sound blaster called omega can. http://www.soundblaster.com/gaming/headsets.aspx here are some of the headsets available
Yes it does
It receives and transmits considerably better then the antenna that came with my UV-82, I bought 1 for each of the UV-82 radios I own, great antenna with a good price tag as well as looks great!!!
No
This speaker has one external cable which connects using the same type of audio jack used for headphones.
not that I know of,this card is already over clocked from the factory so it can be used as a stand alone .to sli these cards might not be worth the money scince you drop down to 8x on the second one. most feel from what ive read will not.they don't feel that they would gain anything from sli.they would save or buy a better card/cards .its the old question of to sli or not to sli.
doesn't work with Comcast phone/computer system
About the same size as a purse
Oh yeah , it has lot's of room!
yeah, it should be no problem. it will fit a Asus eeepc with no problem And regular iPad is fine too.
It does cover it partially. It depends on the size of the card you want to put in. The fan is the real problem. It's case is a little bulbous and protrudes into the slot below a little bit. I have a small, old coax cable card there which is just fine, but only because it is so small.
Yes, it came with XP Installed....I really like this computer...Fast and quite reliable....However be aware that Microsoft will discontinue Windows XP in a couple of months.
32 bit
Presuming it's an m42 mount lens then yes. The adapter has the infinity glass insert and is only 11 bucks, go for it.
This guy has an on/off switch so you can turn it off when not in use. I have taken several time lapses of 300+ pics and I al still using Google the original batteries. Two things to consider: 1. These are stick batteries, so it's easier to carry additional batteries with you. 2. The draw back of on/off switch is that you have to reset all your parameters every time you turn your timer on as the settings are wiped out every time you turn it off. I hope this answer red your question.
Yes ..Ii have an ipad 3 and this worked just fine
I couldn't tell you. I bought it because the product is what I needed and it is a good product.
Yes it will work for the ipad 4
Yes, mine is an iPad 4 and snapped in. I didn't try it with my husband's iPad 3, but I think the 2 and 4 are thicker than the 3. I don't really think cases are fully interchangeable between the different models unless it's just the magnetic front cover thingie you can buy from Apple. So perhaps yours is sliding out because it's an iPad 3? Hopefully that helps. If not, I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
Yes I have it installing in my computer and run very smooth..
I don't know, I returned it. But I don't see why not, it's just like any other wireless mouse, you plug the receiver into your computer's USB and a battery into the mouse - voila, your mouse works.
There is a clock and timer. Page 26 of the instruction manual.
This is a wonderful sounding system. While there is always a learning curve with new equipment, switching between sources including the USB input is simple once you learn the buttons used for switching. This is very musical system.
The one I bought in late 2013 is compatible with an iPhone 5.
yes, it does fit quite well in fact. Great for traveling for a little extra protection.
No problem, I leave mine on all time. Only distraction is the light on the sub woofer stays on all the time and lights up the room at night. I have had then unit for a year
110 only
The 0.35X should be considered a fisheye lens. The 0.43, although a wide angle, is not quite as wide.
I don't see why it wouldn't. Most modern computers have USB ports as well as CD/DVD drives, which is what you'll need to use the mouse. You'll only need the disk they send to install the drivers. Once they're installed, you'll have to configure them to your specifications. However, the driver for the mouse could very well be Windows only. I'd contact the parent company for further compatibility questions, though.
Yes. They come with cable and power adapters.
The arm goes back and the vinyl stops spinning automatically. But you have to turn the power/volume knob down to completely turn off the power.
I have an Ipad2, and it works on mine. It has the 30 pin connector. Charges fast, and is pretty loud!
Im not sure. I wonder that too
Depends on what kind of tablet you have. Although I think most tablets use micro sdhc or sdxc. This one is normal sized. Micro sd card most often needs an sd adapter to be read in some card readers.
It's been a while but maybe I used the camera's format function. I am using it regularly, so it does work! Did I format with PC? Don't remember. If still an issue I'd try SCT support but should be easier than that.
I don't know, as my iPad never succeeded in syncing with the keyboard. My daughter has gotten used to using the iPad key on screen, so it isn't that big a deal. If it worked (and I have other bluetooth keyboards), you can type to the iPad from several feet away. It does not have to be physically in the case. The key board is fixed to a panel that can be moved wherever you want it.
The case is fairly light without the keyboard, maybe 1 - 1.5 pounds.
Yes with iphone
I'm away from the system, but pretty sure each cord set for the cameras are 50ft. The local electronics guy at Radio Shack said I should have no problems going up to 200ft, but I cannot confirm. I recommend calling or online chatting Q-See customer support for a definitive answer. They have been very helpful in my dealings with them. Hope this helps.
I had 2 andriids and 2 iphones plugged in during a tailgate party and they did full charges.
I am not 100% sure. This is the first time I have ordered Bose off of Amazon. The seller was Bose, though. I have also bought Bose from other places. Honestly, the warranty was always up before I needed it. The products last long and I am very satisfied with them, but I take care of my things. I had an the earphones replaced before the warranty was up and it was replaced for free and I didn't buy it from Amazon. I would double check with Amazon to make sure. I hope this helps a little.
The labels are for the drawers only.
I haven't opened the package containing the sleeves - I purchased my own sleeves - but it looks like there are 75 double-sided sleeves , fifteen each of five different colors.
Find out what your connection name is. Do this by doing a wifi scan if you dont already know what it is it should be located on the router. You will have to type in your "wep" number which is found on the back of your router which is provided by your cable provider.
Hi Lisa. No it doesn't it does connect wifi. I love it. I take it to work and read my books. I really like for the price. I haven't checked into whether you can add a data plan to it though.
I have a Smith Evolve snowboard helmet and the drop-ins work great. Still disappointed that there is not a volume control separate from Ipod/Iphone.
Mod: mine connect to my IPHONE and i assume any other playing type devise
Not very well. I have a Giro and when I try to use these they bulge out onto my ear uncomfortably. They would fit better if the Giro had a larger cutout in the foam for them, but since I'm not willing to doctor up my helmet's foam with an exacto knife I do not use them in that helmet.
Yes and it can be adjusted further if need be. Be careful of the extension distance.
yes,sure.It can use on the car.
No. It's simple plug & play.
Not that I can see. The strap is best used to keep the cover tight. Closing the cover turns off the screen. Opening the cover turns on the screen. Sorry for the delay.
I put it in a zip up case and that worked. Not sure about your case, i would say as long as it bigger than 10.1 i might work.
It's a fancy name for Fake leather. I like the case though. It's a durable as anything else sold
If the retailer will let you return and trade up, do it immediately. Your troubles with Stealth are just beginning.
This is so much more protective than the actual case that the headphones come with. I bought this as I travel a lot and wanted more protection for my headphones.
This is a fax modem. As such it will connect with a fax machine on the other end through a telephone line. This modem supports Windows 7 but not Window 8 (unless something has changed), even though USR says 8 is supported. Model 5639 does not support voice. Go to the US Robotics web page, all the answers are there.
Depends on what Internet service provider you have. Some dial up providers systems are not compatible with windows 8.1. It will install and dial but may not establish a connection. It does work with windows 7.
Yes it works with Android. Look at the Triggertrap app in the Android PlayStore. Works fine with my Galaxy S2 and my Sony a65 DSLR. NOTE: You need to buy the dongle + the appropriate cable for your camera.
Yes - download iTunes (if you computer is Windows or Mac) and then play the CD with Itunes and choose the Pioneer XW.... from the Air Play selector within iTunes.
What device do you play 365 live through currently
The battery replaces the subwoofer in the A3. That's the main difference.
It's on mine.

Cleans 12", 10" and 7". I've cleaned hundreds of all size records and it does a good job.
It doesn't. It only does pictures in a slideshow
7" - 128MB, 8" - 128MB, 10.1" - 256MB
Just 120 V input. You may be able to get an adapter separately that would work. I'd check for options that are online.
The VSD220's optical type touch will work with paint programs that are geared more towards the use of a finger but might have some lag when it comes to quick strokes. Touch devices with no pressure sensors depend on stroke speed rather than pressure to create thick or fine lines. A stylus will work with the device.
I was never able to get my brand new frame to work; I also was unable to get HP Support to tell me HOW to get it to work. I gave up after a month. If I were you, I'd buy a different frame. Judging from comments found on Amazon and on several other sites RE: this particular model, I was not alone.
It depends on what you plan on driving, Video cards (SLI), sound card, HDD, etc... I am using a 1050w, the more the merrier.
Hi Brandon, in the box you will find : HDMI cable, VGA Cable, DVI Cable ,DisplayPort Cable, Audio 3.5 mm stereo plug (male) to 3.5 mm stereo plug (male) cable and USB Cable.
No, the ASUS is only going to do 1920 by 1080 max.
Yeah it's worth the buy for a beginner photographer.
1/8
It is worth the $35 for the kit for the mobility and the two flash
Yes
It came with both. Wall & lighter.
No WiFi.
16x optical zoom before it goes into digital zoom.
Yes the iso speed can be changed. Instructions are on page 96 of the manual.
I have taken pictures of birds in flight with this camera on auto and they came out great. There are also specific settings for action shots in the manual mode.
I have the SX130 and when researching the camera, I read many reviews that state rechargeable batteries must be used or else you will be replacing the alkaline AA batteries often. Alkaline batteries are not meant to be used in high capacity electronics except in an emergency when you can't get rechargeables. Many reviewers have used Sanyo Enloop NiMH rechargeables and I have used Rayovac NiMH Pre-charged Rechargables. Try them and I think you will be happy with them.
Bout 4 3/8 by bout 2 1/2 n by bout I mean reallyclose if not exact it was just little hard to measure cuz it on a device
Since there are so many products in the aftermarket I can only assume the name was designed to mirror a better-known brand. The product is very minimally priced, so I would take a chance that this is the one you need! Hope this helps!
I don't know. I have a USB connection too. Maybe call apple support, or go to an apple store.
Yes, it should work just fine. The wall wart power supply indicates input voltage of either 100-240 volts A/C and accepts 50/60 Hz. It has the standard USA two prong plug.
I think isn't 220v ready out of the box, because I use it on 110v
Canon, Nikon and Pentax each have their own TTL flash metering systems, respectively E-TTL, i-TTL, and P-TTL. They all use a weak pre-flash that is metered and used to calculate flash power level required for correct exposure. E-TTL = Evaluative "Through the Lens", i-TTL = Intelligent "Through the Lens", P-TTL = Preflash "Through the Lens". All three are pre-flash based evaluative flash metering systems.
Make sure the flash and the camera is set for ETT-L.
Can't answer that as I don't own either - Sorry
This is obviously dependent on location and how hard the watch has to try to capture the GPS signal (are you concealed from skyview at any point, etc.). You can expect anywhere from 4-5 hrs of continuous use. My last run was greater than 4 hrs and I took it off the charger and went running, it lasted roughly 4 hrs that day. And that seems to be the norm for where I am. Hope that helps.
Yes, you can recive voice with a ordinary phone
it probably does, but I wouldn't get this camera anyway....the picture quality is very poor. I only bought it because my client only has satellite internet so the quality didn't have to be good. You'll be happier spending a dew extra dollars on a higher quality camera.
Good evening, the VGA cable used by Z-modo is the 15pin VGA cable. If you have a computer monitor chances are it will have the same cable you need. If your plans are to purchase a new monitor most new monitors are already set with the cable in the packaging. Hope this helps.
yes
THERE ARE 540 TV lines in the old cameras THEN YOUR HD CAMERAS HAS 700 - 1000 -720- 1080p CAMERAS ARE THE BEST AND YOU NEED a 1080 dvr
I'm sorry to say I haven had the system installed yet. But I believe it is not audio
you need a converter, it only has coaxial audio and rca sound inputs.
yes, has threads on the waterproof case to thread onto tripod.
Here's the one made for this camera (I just ordered it): http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CSMMPXI/ref=oh_details_o01_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Yes it's exactly same.
Unit successfully works with iphone 4s and 5.
Have to order seperately
Yes This camerA can be used On a motorcycle helmet with adhesive mount
Corsair's warranty program is very good. I suggest you contact them about a replacement unit.
If you're replacing a drive, it should boot to it. Best way to find out-try it. if it doesn't boot, go into bios and make necessary change. You can always use F8 key to select boot device too.
Theoretically, it is faster. However, you will need a high quality SSD drive like a Samsung 840 Pro 256GB (or larger) to get the full benefit of the Apricorn adapter.
As far as I can see, it's the exact same product. Newegg just gave it a more descriptive title is all.
Yes, you can have a ups to plug your psu into. I would looking at the AFC BE750G Power Saving Battery Back-UPS it will last for about 30 minutes after the power goes out.
They are all separate/modular
4 PCI-e , 2 SATA (4 plug each), 2 Floppy, 2 Molex (4 plug- with fan connection on end of each) Note: I have this PSU--you will love it. Quiet, fan hardly ever runs. See the product photos.
The reception in some areas may not be as good as others. if adjusting the length of the antenna hasn't helped trying wrapping a small piece of wire around the antenna and run it to a higher spot in the room. If that does not help they may be an internal issue such as the antenna connection itself.
15'. I had it 30' from my router, but it would drop off in the evening to little to know signal strenght. So I put the Extender half way between router & where I have my laptop & were I like to use my Eeepad, & it never drops off & my signal is always Excellent.
There is no built in screen protector. The Lifeproof cases uses the iPad's screen to provide the water tight seal. However, you can buy a screen protector from Zagg that works great. Check it out: http://www.amazon.com/ZAGG-invisibleSHIELD-LifeProof-N%C3%BC%C3%BCd-Cases/dp/B00996MZD6
yes,
I have the kenwood tk-2200 with the two pin accessory jack, and the head set works with my radios. I found that any earpiece that fits the baofend radios will also fit the kenwood two pin radios.
This product will work with any product with a HDMI port/interface! Thus, if your tv has a HDMI input and the blu-Ray player has HDMI out, then it will work! However, this product is designed to allow muntiple HDMI compatible devices to share 1 HDMI port in a tv! Thus, unless you are planning to hook up more than just the blu-ray player to you tv, then there is no need for this product!
No, it only contains the 18-55 lens.
Not so far, seems pretty good
LCD means the screen size on the back of the camera where you look at pictures. Black = black camera body. Silver = silver camera body.
Most definitely that's the same camera that I have
I don't know. It broke after the first use. Just the Mic. Everything else was legit.
Yes, it can be connected
The Nikon s800c uses Android 2.3 (Gingerbread). No, it cannot be updated.
Sometimes in low light
There is no screw mount for a tripod on the bottom so it would not accept a normal tripod.
Isabella, in manual (M) mode, the shutter speed on the P7700 can be set from 1/4000 to 60 seconds. There is no bulb (B) setting as we used to see in the older Nikon 35mm film cameras.
It will work with USB port.
Yes it is
I don't know whether this will help or not. A recent firmware upgrade to the Nikon D3100 made non OEM batteries non functional (even if they worked fine before the upgrade) This affected several Nikon cameras but the D3100 is the only one that I am certain about. If I had to put money on it though I think that the D5100 was one of the lines affected. Unfortunately I don't think that the firmware upgrade can be rolled back.
It will fit tablets like the Nexus 7 which measure 7.9" x 4.5" x 0.3".
No. Its separate.
No you can set it up in 4,8 or 12 but remember the track wheels are fixed length so you don't actually get 12 feet of tracking more like 2.5, 6.5 and 10.5 respectively.
It used to be the generation number. After generation 4, western digital dropped the reference and just uses "RE" now.
That should work just find. Remember that it is the OS that will or will not recognize the size of the drive(s), not the hardware in most cases. But motherboard BIOS might be questioned and looked into just to double check
I've never had two different kinds of RAM not work with each other, but if the sticks are not completely identical (and placed into the correct color coding spots), you won't be able to utilize quad-channel. Something to keep in mind. If your motherboard only supports dual-channel configurations, then yes, that setup should work nicely as long as you put the two vengeance sticks in one color of ram slot and the dominators in the other color.
The charger can be used both voltages. You must find an outlet adpater to use the charger.
I have never peso ally used headphones with them but they do have a standard jack on the side.
The MC-36A utilizes a 10-pin connector. If the D7100 has a corresponding 10-pin connection, the MC-36A should work. Suggest you contact Nikon USA to confirm.
i dont know, they dont even work on my iphone
Buttons were functionalon some devices, mic functional on even fewer devices
8-14 days
when you open the computer case and see the PCI-E slots, it will make sense. This is a very easy product to install. Make sure you remove the back part of the case to allow the antennae to stick out.
Yes, on the Pro X2 series.
I don't think so. It only works if the camera is within a few feet of the phone/tablet. The card's wifi lives on the battery of the camera, so don't expect it to be very powerful.
MP3 from 32k to 320k. WAV 16 & 24 bit. 44.1, 48 and 96k sample rates.
The mic plug is a standard 3.5 mm. It does not supply power.
Hi Brian, I was trying to find out the answer. BOSE WANTS YOU TO LISTEN TO PRODUCTS... I don't believe they list watts anywhere. Maybe if you call them. What I can tell you is.. DO NOT BUY THE FIRST ONE. The SOUNDLINK ll is the one to get. I have iphone 5. It PAIRS PERFECTLY. It SOUNDS GREAT!!!! GOODLUCK ! GREAT HOLIDAYS
I would call Bose support. I just purchased a Samsung Note II and asked Bose if I could use it with the speaker. They said no, only an iPhone would work.
Yes it will turn off to a "standby" mode after disuse, and then turn on again when airplay request to play. Note that if left indefinitely under battery power only, the battery will eventually run down and it won't be able to turn on when airplay sends request.
The listening device, power cord and USB cable for initial set up via computer, and manual/warranty information. Optional accessories include battery pack and cover. Optional accessories are not included but may be purchased separately.
I bought the Nikon Coolpix S6400 16MP camera and it takes great pictures. The zoom is amazing and downloading the pictures is a snap. If you want a reasonably inexpensive, but worth it's weight in gold, camera...get a Nikon. It is an easy point and shoot camera. I have 3 different Sony cameras, including the touchscreen one, and the Nikon is just as good.
I'm sorry I don't know I gave this as a gift.
I have it on my 15in. MacBook Pro with Retina. If fits perfectly. it is an exact fit and if you are looking directly at the laptop you don't realize it is on there. I forget that even have it on until others on my side point it out as i try to show them stuff. I love it and it is never in the way.
This a very good camera so far, I have only owned it since last fall, as for the degrees, I'm not sure where the figure came from, as it only gets down in the 20's here where I live, So I can't really say how it works at that temp.
Yes
It should. There is nearly 1/2" of circumference room left around the other lenses I have. The length should be ok as well.
taiwan
Worked quite well with our Toshiba laptop Satelitte C655
It worked just fine for me
There is only one 12v rail, but it can handle 540w - just shy of the total output. Unless you're really pushing the total capacity (which you shouldn't do), it shouldn't make an important difference.
I'm not sure I have Cobra radios and the work great! They have a very small headphone connection jack. So if that is what you have I would take a shot.
Mono.
There are magnets to keep the cover attached. thanks
Yes it's fits quite fine.
It will fit your 15" laptop if you don't put the camera in.
It shows that at major freeway interchanges only, when seeing complex exits are relevant, in my experience. I like this gps btw. :)
This device only converts HDMI to VGA, so if your wireless adapter has an HDMI output, yes. This device does not receive wireless signals.
You can convert HDMI to VGA.
yes, This works for VGA. I tried it with
I have a Nikon d 3200 with an 18-55mm and a 55-200. I can fit my camera with lens attached and my 55-200 in the bag with some room left. Full disclosure getting in the bag on the fly is a pain, good for travel on flight and stuff.
LOL! I think it's just for aesthetics. Sometimes I hang stuff on it (ie: hand sanitizer) but mostly I just like the way it looks.
Yes it does without a glitch. Just be careful when putting it in a purse or backpack because the keys are prone to popping off if it's handled roughly. It fit's nicely in a large Ziploc bag ;o) !
It takes M6 screws 12mm. long It is VESA compliant. The screws supplied for the base that came with the TV will not fit for wall or VESA compliant stands.
Console gaming, yes, since it has HDMI but it does not have VGA for PC gaming. Console gaming looks beautiful on this TV's 1080p.
the difference is the one touch equalizer. nifty, but not altogether necessary.
No. It's a single phone connection. Look into a wireless headset.
No, it has neither.
Its only got the Intel graphics which is actually surprisingly capable for gaming. Was playing Fear 3 at 8x600 near 60hz.
Pamela I bought it for someone out of country. Sorry I don't have an answer for you.
If your laptop originally has a SATA drive, you most likely can replace it with whatever size you desire as long as a replacement drive is SATA as well. Just be careful in the disassembly of the laptop to mind what goes where. and in what order. I've replaced 80 Gig drives with 1 Tb drives and they keep right on going. Hope this helps!
Yes
We are very happy with the performance of this accessory and consider it a very good value.
As far as I know it does not give automatic alerts. It has a weather radio, AM and FM.
I really don't know what that means, it was bought as a gift and I can tell you they have been very happy with it.
I am not sure, you may need to use an adapter, but if it is a 7" tablet, I think that you can get it to work. My tablet is an android, "no-name", and it works like a champ!
The "U" shaped brackets were smaller than what I was trying to do... I wanted to mount it on my mountain bike. The "hose clamp" style worked great, and has a pretty long size range. Sorry I don't have an actual measurement.
I use mine on a HP pavilion dm 1 so I really don't know. It is perfect for my laptop.
Not sure about that, I only have nexus 7
Can be used with any GoPro. Suggest using same nut off another fixture and epoxy in place; only negative. Much easier to rotate in desired position than standard GoPro suction mount. Will not be sorry.
Yes
I'm not sure. I've only used it on a 4x4 running at &gt;70mph off road. Try asking RAM. They are used by pro's so I wouldn't doubt that it might be fine at even greater speeds.
It works flawlessly. However motherboard design is little quirky still I love it.Also fx 4350 works without any problems on this mother board.
this charger works with any usb. I use an adapter that goes from the usb to my iphone 4s. so if you can find a usb adapter that goes to the ipod, you will be fine
Yes
I just measured and it's 46 inches almost 4 ft
I wear these, and when I"m wearing sunglasses for long periods, and they feel fine. They become more comfortable as time goes on. I do long power walks with them on, and they feel great, and sound fantastic!
My daughter used it with her iTouch (2nd generation, I think) and her Windows phone. I don't know about the iPhone 5S. We did have to return the headphones after only three weeks because the right side stopped working. I got her some Kicker Cush headphones instead that she loves. Good luck.
SanDisk Extreme 16GB SDHC UHS-1 Flash Memory Card Speed Up To 45MB/s, Frustration-Free Packaging- SDSDX-016G-AFFP --That's what I ordered and use. A card with 8GB storage will work fine too. by SanDisk
Sometimes it takes the camera brain a while to think about what it's doing. To prod it along, hold the shutter button down a bit. Maybe halfway. It should figure out what you're pointing at and set its focus from there. Then push the shutter all the way down to take the picture.
Yes, it does, 75 Mb. of storage. When you first turn on the camera to use it, you need to format the internal memory if you want to use it, just like you would format a new SD card.
Yes, you can use any bluetooth device
No
I think so, but it might be an awkward fit. The left and right "organizer" area both measure 3 1/4" by 4 1/2" (by about 1" deep), so it would fit there. The middle section is barely 3" wide, and there is a plate underneath to support a phone there, so it isn't a "bucket" like the left and right sides. I'd be more concerned with the length of your iPhone 6 + case. Your iPhone could extend over the rear slot intended for a tablet / Nook / Kindle. Hope that helped a little.
Yes and I have the tough black cover on it with no problem
A high speed internet connection is required to the DVR to view anything remotely. Also an internet connection or 3G/4g lte is required in a smartphone or tablet to view anything once the DVR is connected to the internet. DMZ is also required on the DVR network to allow outside access through your internet router.
Single Din refers to the height of the stereo or 'head unit' (180mm x 50mm) as opposed to Double DIN (180mm x 100mm). Single Din head units are often half the height of a 'full size' factory installed stereo.
Yes.
Yes, but will need a wiring harness and possibly a bracket adapter to install the aftermarket system. Most stereo shops can wire in an auxiliary cord to the factory deck.
Yes
You need to find the right installation kit the fits both the radio and your vehicle. Start with the radio. Which is awesome!!!
Yes I love my CD player it has the Bluetooth USB and a lot more future its a great CD player
I never got around to checking that. I returned it once I saw that it did not function on a Vizio tv
It should work it works for my ps4 and my ps4 has hdcp so it is hdcp compliant
HDMI has both video and audio - if your TV has HDMI input and the Blue Ray has HDMI out - then you shouldn't need this box. Just conect the HDMI cable.
I don't believe so. I have a Samsung Galaxy 2 tablet and it has front and rear cameras. I know some tablets only have rear cameras, but I have not seen one with only a front faced camera. If you already have the device make sure on the camera screen there isn't and icon to flup the camera direction, it is easy to miss. Hope this helps.
Yes
The sound plays through the cars stereo speakers, I have tunned in my stereo 108.00 FM and transmitter configured on 108.00 FM, I put a kingston 4gb flash drive with mp3 and mp4, when play mp4 you can see the video on the screen and sound through car speakers.
Hello Rena Thanks for you email and sorry to hear that! What is you Ipad 1 system ,it is latest edition IOS? Could you upgrade you ipad IOS? or download TVOUT or DISPLAY OUT to have a try.if not work ,pls let's us know ,we will try to solove problem ,pls don't worry ,we must be not let's our customer lose We apologize for the inconvenience and looking forward to your reply, we will do our best to solve this problem! Have a Good Day! Best Wishes, Sunny, FIVEstar Accessory
Yes. It comes with a charger and a USB/MicroUSB cable.
I don't understand the question.
YES
Check with a local PC, or electronics store. May have to splice one end to a matching compatible "end", rather than keep looking for an adapter, or take both cables to one who can join them.
If the model number isn't at the bottom of the page on the ad then you are in the same position I was in.I took a chance and it worked for me.I would take a chance IF your TV/Monitor takes a plug in the back that is shaped like a figure 8 on it's side.This would be recessed in the TV back with a pin through ea. loop of the figure 8.This seems to be a standard plug for Samsung but you are gambling.
Yes it does Thanks
No it does not. It shows minimal if any of the bottom of the lake. I have found it to work best when you are in 5-12 foot of water. Anything over 12 foot and it is just a water depth and temp sensor. Remember... you get what you pay for. If you are putting it on a john boat to bluegil fish it is great. If you are putting it on a bass boat expecting to find structure, buy another model
Fresh water fishing
Actually, even at plane, the unit does pretty well.
Yes, this does include the transducer, it also includes a GPS antenna, mounting bracket, and all wiring needed to hook this unit up. The length of the transducer cable is measured at 20ft.
sorry but haven't tried it yet my son had one and loves it
We have been out 3 days running 8-10 hrs per day before battery died.
we have a murs dakota alert & it fits fine. Like this product
Sorry but, I have never been able to get this cable to work with my Icom hand held walkie talkie. kw
It should you might have to download the usb driver for the chip set you might want to google the radio programming software or maybe rt systems has what your looking for
I reality can't say if it will work on your IC-41W. I cannot get my Windows 7 to recognize the cable I have for my IC-R6. John
Yes it is, i use internet through 3G network everyday
I'd say yes. I think it was build (or at least its region was meant to be) on Italy, yet i'm using it in Colombia flawlessly; either connecting to Internet using a 3G network or making cell calls. Expect an european plug, however. Not a big deal.
Yes it is
Just tried it, and yes, it will charge both at the same time.
Its a good 3.5 to 4 hrs but leave mine charging with AC power most of time. I would recommend upgrading the memory to max amount for performance.
Yes. Which I use constantly!
Yes it does. I'm using the Acer now-- I use it every day.
Yes, I have a Minix Neo x5, and it works great for an android box.
it should. but not the av 2 hdmi one. This should be the one.
It says USB because it has a USB power cord included but it doesn't really need it but it is indeed hdmi to AV..
Hi A.V! Katie here, with The Friendly Swede. We're just doing a bit of housekeeping and I came across your question. So sorry that I'm just seeing it now. The answer to your question, is YES...these pens are made to work with any and all touchscreen devices. Sounds like you ended up getting the pens, and I certainly hope they are working out for you. If there is anything further I can do for you, please contact me through this link:
Hi Adam! Maureen here from The Friendly Swede:-) My sincere apologies for missing your question previously! The answer to your question is YES! These stylus will work beautifully on any touchscreen (capacitive) device which does include yours! Anything else, please let me know here at this link:
Great camera in day light however not so great in dark areas!
If you want keys instead of the classic dial, the X-E1 may not be the camera for you. The aperture dial is on the lens itself, like in many film cameras. You can set the function key if you prefer to use that for aperture adjustment instead.
very good and nice&#65281;
Sorry, no, It will not allow both.
I cannot speak directly about the Ipad 4, however, because the Noisehush is compatible with Bluetooth 3.0 and backwards, my assumption would be that it WOULD work with the Ipad 4. The item's Bluetooth works just fine and is backwards compatible. I have used this item on my PC and various Apple and other digital products with no problems whatsoever. Hope that helps.
I can't say 1000% yes but it works flawlessly with my Samsung note 2 I'm pretty sure it will work with any Bluetooth device
Dear Jon, Thanks so much for your inquiry. When streaming music, it often has more to do with which music streaming source you are using to determine what level of gapping that will occur. Normally the more the streaming service compresses their music, the more gapping can potentially occur. Please let me know if I can answer any additional questions for you! Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo
Although it would probably accommodate the D5300 with the proposed lens, the dimensions of the D3200 being almost identical to the D5300, I would not recommend it because the material is too cheap for the asking price.
Yes
yes: http://support.roku.com/entries/423947-Can-I-play-back-media-on-my-Roku-player-from-my-USB-hard-drive-
Yes--under settings.
It had problems with my Directv Box. It would display the video initially, but when changing the channel to one with a different video signal (1080p channel to 720P channel, etc.) the screen would take 5-10 seconds to show the video if I was lucky, but most of the time the screen would go black and I could only hear the audio. It worked great with my PS3, Xbox, and PC.
Any laptop/desktop with an HDMI port, any device (laptop, tablet, phone) with a video out port using an HDMI dongle. We use our ARIES Pro with our MacBook Pros and Surface Pros, using the same mini display to HDMI dongle. Works much better than the Apple TV (which we also have).
I hooked it to my PS3 and had zero lag.
I couldn't tell you, Dave. I already had the remote triggers when I got these strobes. Sorry.
It's not listed as an outdoor cable on the box or the casing, and I wouldn't expose it directly to the elements. I have installed it under a covered eve without any issue, but not exposed to direct sunlight.
I believe you should be able to Daniel, but you may need a VGA to monitor box.
Do you mean HDMI? HDE connections are for gamming devices. This is very different from TV or VIDEO devices.
about two feet
I do believe you can go into the settings and set it up manually. I did mine with the button on my modem. It finds it automatically and all I had to do was put my network password in.
yes it comes with power adaptor, but don't waste your money on it, it has very limited channels. buy a ROKU or other brands will have much more channels.
I believe it does, it's been about two years ago when I purchased the camera
It comes with one mount that attaches to the camera's clear case and, I believe, 2(?) curved adhesive mounts plus one flat adhesive mount.
Yes, the one we purchased included a hard drive. It was sold by TigerDirect.com through Amazon. We've had the system for about a year and it is doing well. I have to wonder why they selected these connectors for outdoor use. I have wrapped them in heat-shrink tubing to protect from moisture. Otherwise ok. good luck,
My camera was professionally installed by a stereo electronics shop. It comes on about one second after the gear shift lever is put in reverse. It appeared that all of the necessary wiring harnesses were included. As some of the reviewers mentioned the hot and the ground leads are quite small in gauge.
If the dog is engaged in the bottom motor dic and the motor does not drive the motor, you have a defective unit. If all the wiring is correct that could be the answer. My works perfectly over the past 10 months or so. We do not have cable but do have plenety of stations on the air. Good luck. Rob
I believe this antenna is a waste of money. I live 10 miles from Youngstown Ohio and I do not consistently get reception from the channels based out of there. I purchased it to receive channels from Cleveland which I live sixty miles from and there has been no chance of receiving there channels. My antenna is mounted on the peak of a two story house.
A inexpensive pair of rabbit ears will do the job better
They work for me with no issue. Used all day Sunday, turning camera off and on several times and now it is Monday and Camera shows full charge.
Hi there Ted; The Pro should indeed work great!
Change the "pen mark" on the app or program you are using.
I have no idea.
It is plentiful , tight , controlled , not better than my big desk top amps but really good in general. I recommend this DAC amp greatly
Mine works fine. No issues at all.
If the DVD went in with out forcing it in then all you should need to do is first put it on DVD mode. Then turn the tv off. Turn the tv back on and hit the eject button on the tv until the screen says either eject or open. If this doesn't work I would contact rca.
Directly through the iphone
My LB1 High Performance lap top battery has performed great since I bought it, lasting two hours or better and keeping a full charge when not in use
the battery has been working fine in the computer.
No it doesn't block the vents. The cut outs are fine and I haven't really noticed it heating up. It only heats up when I'm watching movies on Netflix.
Hi Eddie, I have mine now for abt 2months, however the little clip on the top cover is not tight enough, hence when opening your MBP, the top cover feels a bit loose.
Couldn't say for sure on the A7S but it is well placed and a large opening that works on my D7100 and D5300.
No, not in order for it to work.
Yes
Correct. This will give you multiple remote users simultaneous access to your 2012R2 server.
With only two PCs to log into the Server you won't need them. Also this particular License Pack is only useable if YOU are building the Windows 2012 server. They are not keys you can add after the initial build (eg they can't be used with a server you are buying from Dell, HP, etc.)
Answer from Titantech: Yes, it fits your 2007 honda accord with a single din radio.
All i can tell you is the GPS on this device is piece of crap. You enter address for direction it will take you somewhere else. Don't buy this HONDA ACCORD 7 (2003-2007) 8" CAR DVD GPS Navi .
No
Yes, it is the best that I have used. I have an Ipad 2, I do not know about the Ipad4.. If it has the same connector it should work
A wireless meteor to connect to.
Dear Friend :the car radio should fit your car ,and we have the map for Greece.
Not at all. Really easy to click, very little pressure.
All buttons are real buttons. Just scrolling wheel is touch
Yes you can use rechargeable batteries but they won't last as long as the lithium
I am not familiar with what port I phone 5 has, but this is a mini USB port. Energizer do make a charger for IPhone. I think it is on this same page at the top. If not, search Energizer instant charger IPhone on Amazon and it should come up.
According to their website, it comes with a '1 Year Worry-Free Warranty'. Site: http://www.nightowlsp.com/Products/Covert-Security_2/CS-Mini-DVR-4GB
Hi Otis, Yes it comes with a heatsink and fan. Thanks, PCrush
No . Am3 is not compatible with am3+ . Only am3+ is backwards compatible with am3 . But if I am mistaken please correct me
Yes. Compatible with 32 and 64 bit software.
the i5 3350p is socket lga 1155, and the optiplex 960 MT is socket 775. you may want to consider a motherboard upgrade as well--also note this processor is being discontinued by intel.
I don't believe it makes a difference, mine were AMD processors.
Yes this card will will work with all cameras that can take CF cards. Check your cameras card type before buying.
We are almost getting 5 ghz to reach 100 yards. We use it for outdoor coverage and the has enough power to also go though buildings to the interior. But under 100 yards.
Yes, very well
Pair of AA batteries needed. Batteries were included in package as far as I remember.
Yeah man made for it!
This is has a 2.5" size, which is the standard notebook size (some ultra thin ultrabooks have a 1.8" bays in which this disk does not fit). If you plan to use it on a desktop with 3.5" or 5.25" bays then you have to buy a separate adapter. They cost about $6.00
If I remember correctly, it came 4 tiny screws and a quick start note. I remember downloading the SSD Toolkit to clone the HDD to the SDD. Then it was a simple swap once the clone was finished.
No
I don't see why not. It is an excellent card and very fast on my Nikon D700.
Yes, it is.
Yes, with any audio CD burning software. Even iTunes, if you record in MP3, save to your computer and import to iTunes like a song file.
I have Premium 12.
Yes, onto your computer by either using a usb cable or by removing the microSD card and plugging it into your computer. As far as downloading directly onto an external drive...I doubt it.
yes
We purchased this device for the same purpose and have not been disappointed. It does a great job picking up voices from every direction. We especially like it for traveling when our meetings are off site. The recorder is very compact and easy to use.
No this is like any other bare motherboard kit, no OS, memory, or storage - just case motherboard and CPU
I'm using it as a server running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, text mode. Works excellent. Apache, PHP 5 and MySQL.
Yes it will.
US only, you'll need a voltage adapter to use in other countries.
1.912 see Dwg http://www.rammount.com/Portals/0/Skins/NationalProducts/drawings/ram238.pdf
I use the Ram Nuvi Cradle for the 2555 with the RAM-B-238 U Diamond adapter plate and it all works great
If you are a Prime member you can choose that shipping option. Otherwise, shipping is $2.99.
I would say yes, it would work for a "pocket" case, without the strap, of course. Only with baggy pants, though. :-)
It is not programmable.
Yes iv can't see anyvreason this wouldn't work for the upgrade.. I had this case and the trooper they both work really well love the space.
Yes, but you'll need a program on the Android to process the data. I've used a Bluetooth serial terminal on an android Nexus 7 with it and they communicated with each fine.
Yes you can! You just need to make sure your pins are setup correctly in mach 3 setup. Also remember that this is just the breakout board and you still need the controller chips for the motors.
Yes You can start it with out battery. But not with with a remote what you need to do is just press the power button on the projector until you see all lights are blinking on the projector, but the batteries last for 45 if you using a movie on the sd not vga cable. Good luck.
I am using the Samsung ssg 3050 they work
According to the Carry Speed webite, they sell only circular polarizers in two sizes. I do not know of any other magnetic filters.
Hi David, most likely it will. Samething happened to me. I got around it by changing the screen cable from the MB to the screen. A little more work but better result.
Yes, or it can fit behind the screen.
Hi Howard, yes it will. It's easier though to just change the LCD cable for an led type. These dells came with both type screens so there are two cables one for inverter screens and one for without. Hope this answers your question.
not sure if this one does from amazon. HSN offers the one with light at lower price
2 slots, with 1/4" clearance to the next slot below.
No
The OS shouldn't matter. It does work with 3 monitors but no more. If you want to use more than 3 then this card isn't for you. Very good card for gaming on low to medium settings, if you want a somewhat strong card for a low price, go with this, if you want a very good card, go with the nvidia 680, I have that in my PC for gaming.
I can personally confirm that it only requires one six-pin connector. Just checked inside my case to make sure.
The rear (where the fan is located) measures 3-7/16" high by 5-7/8" wide, the depth (front to rear) is 5-1/2".
i had to purchase my card through directv for 20.00
if its not out of date it will work- contact directv and they will gladly help you - as they did me before i made this great purchase -cards must be activated and prices vary
Yes, both lenses are by Sony.
Yes. There are a couple of apps with the camera that are very functional for uploading to smartphone, iPad etc.
Yes it will
I would assume so. I am using it on a Samsung Note 10. My tab 2 charger wasn't strong enough, on the Note I was seeing a charge with a red error. The charger was too weak. This one works great. The black caps on the connector piece surrounding the metal have come off once but they clicked back on with no problem.
No, the cable is working very well for me with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1
Yes
No
A good quality one would have no problem with 2.
No
I will but not in a large case. Mine is in a life proof case. I have to remove it from the case before putting it In the armband.
Nope. Pretty much designed for a bare iphone 5.
Hello R. Calloway- The "A" setting is optimized for Apple products, the "C" setting is optimized for Samsung tablets and the "B" setting is for most other products. Regards, The AV House Team
I have a 13" MacBook Air and the cover fits fine for me.
It's a pair !
I would say yes. Works perfectly for the TG-2, which looks to be virtually the same size as the TG-3.
This case has one compartment to house the camera and no pockets. No room for extra battery or wires. Could fit an extra SD card in with the camera, but it would likely fall out when you removed the camera. The upside is that it's compact and really handy. I sometimes attach it to my belt / belt loop or my backpack waist or sternum strap.
Yes. You must press the DAY/NIGHT and HOUR buttons at the same time. Also, for US/METRIC, you must press the PREV and MIN buttons at the same time.
How does windows 8 cd = office? That cd should come with a windows key. However if you buy a computer with windows preinstalled you will not see the coa sticker anymore. The keys are now imbedded in the bios.
Yes, but you are better off with Windows 7, if your computer is new enough. Find tutorials on Youtube.
OEM stands for original equipment manufacturer. These lisences are usually suitable if you are building a system from scratch and need to load the software and it OS into it.
Yes it does. Hope this helps :--))
Yes, but you have to send the unit to China, so it costs more for shipping than to just buy a new one. Also, I do not recommend this flash. The light quality is very poor, with a slow, sloppy fall off and hot center. While I love other products from this company, this one is a dud.
No. You need a second yn622n-tx connected to the off camera flash for it to receive the wireless signal from the yn622n-tx connected to your camera. I don't recommend this flash (YN-568EX) the battery compartment cover retention tab broke on the two I purchased after the third battery change
I have not idea, since the one I ordered did not work at all.
What do you mean by delay? As I can't see both TV sets, I can't answer this question. (If I understood coorectly delay = time between the sending and receiving)
The cables seemed to be just the right length for my ATX tower. You may have some issues if you need them to be longer. Otherwise I have been happy with the unit, especially for the price.
No. You need the ones with an i after the model #.
yes, the thing is you have to send it back and then you will be out of your (broken) headphones for a week or more. And these break quick, they look water resistant, but they are NOT. Don't buy! Buy the Sennheiser/Adidas MX 680i Sports Earbuds ! a thousand times better!
No they don't. Though they are relatively flat and come in a soft black case.
The bass is very subdued in comparison. It's a warm natural sound.
Yes. There are minor aesthetic modifications-- mostly positive, I think. I had a pair for about two weeks when the right earpiece failed. I sent them back.
I changed to Fiio's cord right when I got the unit. But UE's cord is softer than Fiio's, so I don't think there should be an issue with cord noise.
Hypothetically, you could do this with a Bluetooth receiver since it's a standard audio jack that plugs into the headset. Additionally, 3rd party devices such as certain Roku models come with remotes which support audio headsets such as this one. However, this is not a wireless headset.
No. You have to plug the wire in for the headphone to work. But the wire never gets damaged or pulled too hard because it pops out under stress.
It can be replaced. I dont know about cheaply I would say no because it has the mic and voulume control.
Yes I have. The only caveat is that L-R are inversed. Luckily these headphones can be worn both ways.
Ultimate Ears
Yes, its a 3.5mm jack so its going to work on you laptop and phone. It has a mic, volume and pause/play button and made specifically for Apple products like iPod and iPhone. I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 volume control doesnt work but pause/play button works, skips songs and answer calls. Wire feels very durable and not that long.
Not sure about the alarm sound, however the alarm is loud
My little girl loves it.
YES
Nah bro it ain't worth it
atleast 10-12 feet
I can only answer question from my experience. In Australia we do not have FIOS but it appears to need 25-50Mbs. I am using my DPQ 3212 for general internet and VOIP and video download. I am currently achieving 101.45Mbs download via Optical cable. This appears to be well in excess of your requirement. It has been an extremely reliable modem and as I am using it I can highly recommend it.
Probably not. I bought one from an Amazon seller and my cable provider (Cox) refused to provision it. It seems you can buy data-only modems anywhere and they will accept it, but they will only provision voice(telephone)-data modems that they sell. You are most likely stuck with buying one from your cable provider. If you really want to try I will sell you mine for half price!
Yes
Hi Ricardo, it is plug and play 09 Suburban LTZ w/Bose. And it retains Onstar and rear entertainment system. For factory backup camera, if you want to display on this unit; need to connect two wires. Will provide detailed instructions. Thanks
It has a small stand
You may be viewing in the full-screen mode which distorts things. Try using a different setting like actual size I believe.
The unit I received must be plugs into the wall - it does not have any compartment for batteries.
If your Magelan GPS has a video input and the ability to view video from a video source then it should work fine. You will have to check your Magelan manual for further information. I purchased a small video screen that also acts as a rear view mirror. It attaches directly to your existing mirror.
No charger, but you can get a rechargeable battery set.
If its shape, size and stuff is all the same as Mac Pro 13" then yes ;-)
Yes you can. There are diferrent type of level user set-up.
I have Swann cameras connected to mine that work fine...Model #770 & 780
Only if you want to be able to monitor activity over the internet.
Yes, But this DVR does not worth with remote control, thus rendering it quite useless.
Its a high end point and shoot. It delivers really good photos. Super easy to use.
supposedly. it does not have anything in the menus so i don't think you can turn it off but p.148 in the manual says it has "lens-shift type optical stabilization"
NO WAY ! It happens because the whole optical block is weak. The required movement to open it is violent. The zoom is altered by this movement. I tried to be very careful with the second i received, but the same trouble occured.
It's being sold here at Amazon, as far as other vendors, this camera is now considered to be an old model, it was released over a year ago.
Hello Ioannis Yes, as long as it's an Olympus OM mount, it'll work. That lens doesn't seem to have an aperture lever shield so compatibility isn't a problem.
Hello Don, If you're referring to the lever shield on the bayonet side, yes. That shield will touch the bottom of the adapter before it's allowed to mount. There are ways to modify either the lens or the adapter, feel free to contact us directly for more suggestions. Thank you!
I have 5 om lenses and all of them worked fine with this adapter on nikon d3100
Fantastic, I'm not exactly sure if any of these games are FPS games, but I've used the mouse to play tera, mass effect 3, and prototype. All with incredible results. The DPI are interchangeable, with a little button on the top that changes colors whether it's on high or low DPI. It's very lightweight and like I said before very responsive.
basic network cable
Just needs to be hooked to a screen not a computer. If it is connected to a public IP address, it may be accessed remotely by a computer browser however.
Not exactly sure. I have a Nikon F2.8 80mm-200mm. It fits through and it's a damn big lens but I wouldn't want to go much bigger. Check out the specs of that lens and it'll give u exact size.
Focus, Release and Bulb only
slide out the cover (sleeve) you will see an area of the main body or shaft that has "DOT LIKE" PIMPLES. That is where you need to slide the cover out. By the way it is the same compartment where you will find the DIP switches if you want to change the frequency.
a little longer... maybe same width twice as long and maybe thinner than ipad mini....but it is a very confortable size for adult hands
I've been using mines for a week now and I had the same problem when I turned mines on. I was under the impression that the blue battery light meant that it was dying too. I think that just means that the keyboard is on when it flashes on. I turned it on and off until my iPad found it. There may be more clear instructions in the owners manual though. Goodluck!
Only when you put the mini sd card in. But not when you plug your phone in.
It does display the song name.
Yes. It has a cable for charging and radio
Hey Lee, I would suggest that you try to update the headunit first, thats the way for it to work because of the compatibility of the phone
Nope. Wrong socket on the motherboard. Video card is irrelevant to basic compatibility because this APU has a built in graphics chip. New motherboard with compatible socket (FM2 or FM2+) should only run you $50 or so...but make sure to check on your RAM as you will likely also need new RAM because your Inspirion probably has DDR2 and any new system will need DDR3.
Yes. According to information found on another merchant site this is in fact a trinity core. Which is weird because I have owned this processor for awhile now and never noticed that. For 30$ more you can get the Black edition with over clocking enabled. However both are good processors the black is recommended for gaming
No... I'm pretty sure the 740 line was long discontinued before AMD FM sockets came out.
I actually had mine in a pretty small, mini-itx build. It stayed reasonably cool during most day-to-day operations with the stock fan, between 35C and 50C--and that's without any other case fans. As long as you aren't doing anything too CPU-intensive, I'd consider the stock fan pretty adequate. Good luck with you build
Yes, I have been very pleased with this processor. The only thing to remember is that this unit relies on your RAM for anything gaming related. I paired mine with 8 Gb's of 1600mhz RAM and can run most games on high to max. Photoshop and even video editing should be breeze. Hope that helps your decision. Make sure to take a look at the A8-6600k too! it is the next gen of this unit and its on sale right now. ;)
Hello Yes, it is designed for the current Paperwhite. The most recent one was released in 2013. Thank you
Don't have remote for mine, did'nt they carry remote
I don't understand the question, but the sound is very good, I use them in the office to hear music, acceptable quality, can regulate the output of bass, I can recommend it, good price, good sound
Mine worked until I recharged it. Then the camera said it wasn't compatible and won't let me use it anymore. I literally had to toss it out. -.-
It works perfectly in my D5100, so I am pretty sure it will work in the D5200.
I have. It's with me now on an overseas vacation. I will have this bag for a long time. No rips no tears and I'm a traveling maniac.
It could probably hold the clothes but not the shoes also. Either or but not all.
You can expand up to 8. 4 is good, out of the box. The laptop really works well when you pop in a SSD. That's what we do and we are very happy with the performance. Hope this helps.
Mine (brand new) shipped shrink-wrapped in a retail (mostly white with some red) box. It wasn't difficult to open. It will work with a 802.11g wifi printer (I use my g printer with it).
Mine is hooked up through my Mac and it is sync'd to my Samsung 4g cell. Works great!
Mine did. It was even the latest 'official' version from Buffalo too.
I have had issues with my internet supplier but never with my Buffalo. I have to reconfigure once because of a problem my internet supplier had with their modem. But Buffalo works great.
I can't tell you for sure, but if your GPS does not have a place to insert an SD chip or a micro-SD chip, then clearly it won't work, because that's how these maps are delivered. Also, it would have to be compatible with Garmin maps, and again, I have no idea.
Can not be done without a converter.
Hi. you should check with radioshak. they might have something for you. Thank you
Good question, I also need the to know. I plan to connect an old amp to the new 4065 bl . Then connect out doors speakers to the old amp. This model ((4065) does not support two room connection. My alternative plan is to buy a portable AirPlay speaker.
It's a pair
I was reading that it was easier to acquire your money back from Amazon if you wanted to return it. I doubt that Amazon and others would be selling it at list price.
I believe you can. I think it will over ride or by pass you connections if you prefer too. I would call Sony ES Technical Support to be 100% sure. (877)-619-7669
Yes, this card is capable of 2 way SLI.
I have a 430w you should be fine with anything higher
Yes it is. Must have a USB cable though. Great monitor.
Its a dual slot card @ 6inches in length. Check your chassis to see if it will fit.
This graphics card would have far, far more power than you need for any of those games, possibly even all three of them running at once, with a lot of stuff going on. I don't have this anymore, but have a card still with far more power than I need, and that has less power than this one. So, to answer your question, yes, if you want to play these with a LOT of power.
Yes. It is a great little recorder and very compatible with Dragon Naturally Speaking. I record meetings and then it translates to text.
Fine for voice. I've never used it for anything else.
This case is horrible. I do not recommend it. It is cheap, the button broke off the case day 1, I ended up losing the money because it could not be returned. I purchased a much nicer case, FYY Fully Armed Leather Case for ASUS Transformer Book T100...This case actually fit the item. Sold by: fyycase

Yes
There is a flap with two snaps that connect the two parts, so they separate easily.
Synthetic and black
no it is not
Synthetic and black
No. You should check out ones made for aero bars. Check out barfly TT mount. Hope that helps
Yes, they should work without problems.
Don't do it!
Yes - that should work. I have mid 2012 13" and it works perfectly. It's the same A1278 model.
Hi, we ordered it and installed it ourselves on our daughter's NV55c57u laptop and it fit perfectly. Not to mention the money we saved doing it ourselves. HTH
One of the Phottix Atlas will serve as your transmitter so you could control 3 Speedlights with two kits. Although if your Speedlights have a slave (flash when they see another flash) function you could use one Phottix Atlas as a transmitter, one as receiver and set three Speedlights to trigger as slaves.
The "tower" sits on a bar behind and below the screen. It was very difficult to get up and running. Hope you have better luck.
No
The glossy version will have glare, the anti glossy will have significantly less glare. Its a matter of preference
Yes, that's what I have and there is plenty of room. It is a nice case.
Yes
Yes it is original authentic Panasonic and does come with charger and two batteries. Camera truly is fantastic no matter what your photographic skill is only fault I find is view finder is a little bit of a pain to open
No sir. It did not come with one, however, We didn't realize we needed to purchase it with the screen until we had paid for it. It only 25 dollars for the map on with a sd card , but my husband download a map that was compatible with the product and brought a SD card to put the map on. Work very well no complaints so far. It does ask before you buy if you would like to purchase a map. Hope this help with your decision.
Hello, Unfortunately we do not have plans to have this unit for your Volkswagen Golf MK6.
It can stream only music over Bluetooth no videos yet. How ever you can connect your phone with usb and play it from your phone memory
When I use the Bluetooth to connect to my music on my iPad, the spartan mini turns the iPad speakers off.
Yes.
no does not matter ,and this blue ray player works great.
Nothing on the box, the manual or TV options even hints of this feature, so I say no.
Yes 4
TV without Stand/WxHxD: 42.9"x25.8"x1.4" TV with Stand: 42.9"x28.7"x10.6" Shipping Dimensions: 52.0"x31.9"x5.3" From "Spec Sheets_2012_H"E_LCD_47LS4500-2.pdf" downloaded from manufacture's web site.
I'm 6'4" tall and 245 and it fits great. Lots of room for adjustment. Even fits my wife who is much smaller.
I went on safari in Africa for 8 days and carried a Canon 100-400L which is a very heavy lens with no problems. It was very comfortable too!
Nope. I only use Joby strap for my Nikon D800e+24-70. Its safe.
I use mine in NZ, 240v. Comes with as external power adapter with figure 8 style socket, so you can use a local power cord, eg I use my PS3 power cord. Muz
I used with a Samsun tablet which is probably compatible. For the cost..it's totally worth it..and I could not find one anywhere else. Standard 30 pin and USB port..
Sorry, I don't believe you can get that type of range from this unit without a significant antenna mod .. and in which case you may run into issues with the FCC if you are operating in the US.
The bios version is f5
As far as I know, one for CPU and 2 for system. There could be more, that's just how may are in my setup.
Yes
Ipad fits perfectly, also the bigger kindle fire. I'm sorry I'm not sure about the galaxy note... this is a very nice case though. I'm very happy with it.
The units that are available from us have a serial number starting with 'B'.
I have a Mac Pro 5,1. Yes it will work as bootable, but not fast to load. Also, you can't use option to select drives on boot. It's a bit of a PITA.
Looks like it should have a PCIe 1X and 16X slot. This card will work in the 16X slot, but most likely you'll have a video card in this slot. It will not work in the 1X slot. Do a google image search for PCIe 2X, 8X and 16X slots and compare the images to your slots.
Absolutely. I have two sets of these; each is hooked to a PC.
I'm not sure, You'd need to compare the specs on both. It would need to be the same dimensions as the kindle kind of clips into the case. I'm thinking that maybe I got such a good deal because they knew they were obsoleting the old and the case maybe doesn't fit the new...
Yes it does. The cutouts are on the sides, but not the back. The sound is very good with the case on!
yes it does put it into sleep mode but i prefer to power mine off when not in use due to the charging time.
Not your 60D, this is a manual flash, you have to set it each time you want to take a flash photo. To get the automatic camera settings you need a TTL flash.
I don't know about that but this flash is fully manual. It will not monitor anything thru your camera and mine stopped working the 2nd time I turned it on. I would not recommend it. If you want a TTL ring flash that is fully automatic you will have to go for the Canon ring flash, about $500.
It will not fit the MkII unless you buy a larger mounting ring. The largest that comes with it is 77mm and the 24-70 mkII is 82mm
Any "AA" batteries work.
I don't know about that, I use it on a Nikon Camera. My guess is that it is compatible with both cameras.
It will work with it if your lens has a diameter for filters that is one listed in the adapting rings that come with the flash. It will work, but so far, I have not got good photography results with the unit.
I've only used the clear so far,and I haven't seen any altering of my shots.
Yes it does I love it.
No, the design of the case will not fit the newer Fire HD 7", rooCase is molded plastic, so it will not fit.
Yes...Here is the link to the manual... http://gdlp01.c-wss.com/gds/2/0300008482/01/pssx500is-cug-en.pdf
Dear, Yes. You will receive the camera in less than 5 days from the date of the purchase. Thank you!
SSD is a marketing name. The real name should be SSS (Solid State Storage), and this computer does have that. As far as speed is concerned the most important factor is the interface that is used to get date in and out of the SSS. Apple uses PCie which is the fastest interface their is for accessing this type of storage device.
I just got done talking with Apple Care. YES, you can have your cake and eat it too. You'll need to create a simple memory partition that Apple will talk you through. Just make sure you either choose the 512 GB or 1 TB memory option since Windows 8.1 takes up a lot of space.
no it will be sent to you via express less than a week
Hi, yes, these apps are the same. No, the price is bigger from Apple.
No for two reasons 1) Mac does not have all engineering applications and if you think using bootcamp for windows then you can buy 3 PCs in Mac price. 2) without a video card your mac will get heated up and might cause a damage if it is operated for a long time.
Yes
Hi Ryan, this Sony E-mount lens SEL35F18 is an APS-C sensor format (23.5mm). As for your Sony A7II, this one has a full frame sensor (35mm). Using this lens will give you the cropping factor making some border around the image. What you needed to do is to set the camera to APS-C Size Capture which can be set on the menu of your A7II. You may go to: MENU &#8594; (Custom Settings) &#8594;[APS-C Size Capture] &#8594; On. Hope this helps. -Ely
yes, 40.5mm.
The lens will work, but whether you can use it depends on how into doing post processing you are. If you're just looking for an easy point and shoot lens for the nex-3 I would avoid this lens. This lens needs a lot of software image correction. On the newer NEX cameras the image correction is built in and automatic. On your nex-3 (and likewise the first gen nex-5 and nex-7) you need to load the pictures you take onto the pc and do the correction yourself in software. Hope this helps!
Hi Kortney, yes it does. -Vincent
Hi C. A. Vonk, You may have to contact the manufacturer of the case regarding this question. Thanks. -Anthony
Yes, there are 3 attachable that will work. The most current being the VF-4.
According to the Olympus web site, the two lens kit comes with two Olympus M.Zuiko lenses. However, the product link attached to this question does not appear to be the two lens kit. Be sure to order the correct kit... :)
From the product description: Dimensions (WxHxD) - 4.32 x 2.53 x 1.33 in. without lens
Nope - this is just the basic Olympus 14-42. Nothing fancy. You're talking about this one: http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-14-42mm-F3-5-5-6-G-Series-Digital/dp/B005J5TZVG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1382120139&sr=8-2&keywords=panasonic+14-42
It's a very nice portrait lens but how you are going to use a 120mm lens for landscape It depends on you you!! The Lens is a perfect Macro lens and I love to have it with me whenever I use my EM5.
Yes it will fit. I have the same configuration. Best ro you building your system.
Those things are noted by Amazon not us, both models are the same except for the color difference.
If it says with the lens, it should. The import version carries different warranty, but the product is the same as far as I know. Hope this helps.
The lens is threaded for a 37mm filter of any kind. So Yes. See: http://www.getolympus.com/us/en/m-zuiko-14-42mm-f3-5-5-6-ii.html
There is a feature on the TV that will turn it off due to inactivity. If you go into the settings you can change that to an extended period of time, but I am not sure if you can turn it off completely. If it isn't that than I am not sure what the issue would be from. Hope this helps.
The picture from an angle is more than acceptable. My TV is setup on the short wall of a rectangular room, so it's not really an issue for me, but having just stood and watched for a while on the side of the tv, it's not that bad. The picture/colors don't degrade much until you reach an almost unwatchable angle, so it's almost a non-issue. Aside from the issues I've had with the networking rendering the TV useless, I wouldn't hesitate to purchase this tv again.
I don't know what the current firmware version is or where to find it. I never had to do anything ,but set the television up. if anything updated it didn't know it.
I purchased the Square Trade warranty on mine when I ordered it here on Amazon. Since we haven't gotten past the first year, I haven't had a chance to utilize it yet. I have had a repair (a defect from the factory), but I think that was handled by Vizio themselves. Otherwise, the TV has been wonderful so far.
the A2 has a built in WiFi the A0 is an older model. I have the a2 it has a good picture even in alalog.
No. Any standard mount will work as the screw holes are in the right place. Love this tv.
I used a HDMI cable instead and connected the TV and cable box via the HDMI ports.
Pick out to programs you want in the same folder, then drag one onto the other
Hi, it is soft silicon cover.
If you have wifi in your house, it is fairly easy to follow the setup and connect to your home network. The tv then has some apps that are ready to go (YouTube, Facebook, Skype, etc.). As I mentioned in a previous review, no browser so you can't just go to any website you want, only what the apps allow.
You should be able to plug in a pair of headphones into the TV and be able to hear fine. If plugged in all the way, there should be no "noise" coming out of the Television itself. We currently have normal speakers plugged into ours and no sound comes out of the TV speakers, only the speakers plugged in.
No there is not a working browser! I'm hoping for a future update with a new app from Vizio... You can't navigate to any web pages unless taken there by way of the pre-installed apps. This was an oversight on my part as that is something I expected but didn't ask the question. Otherwise, this TV is nice for a bedroom with no issues to date.
It is fixed to the headphone. Its not the length of cable that is the problem it is the placement - no problem though if you are a leftie...I'm not I tend to use my Vox Amplug because you can use a decent set of headphones with it. Hope that helps !
Yes, it has an Aux to plug in your ipod, and listen to your music and what you're playing at the same time.
Radio, 110v power supply, car adapter fixed extending antennna and a suction window antenna
I have found these headphone to sound excellent!! Good for DJ'ing? I give it a big Yes...Compared to Beats (which I owned a pair) Beats have a tendency to snap (the headband that is) after a couple of times of warranty replacement I got rid of them...But I have been a DJ since 1973...yeah a long time...my Favorite are the KOSS PRO-4 AA's which I used then and own a pair now...
I hooked mine up to a 19 inch computer monitor that I already had.
Yes
I don't have the hx50v so I can not say for sure. The filter is 30mm in diameter. The outer 1mm has adhesive on it which attaches to the front of the lens barrel, so, if a 30mm diameter disc will fit on your lens barrel, and you only need 28mm clear to not block light to the lens, it will probably work.
No, I recommend getting a better quality system
You have to check the night owl web site.
Best Regards Jose. I do not think possible. Everything is charged to ipod through Itunes software.
Swiping right should work. It works on ours. Maybe contact the manufacturer? Sorry I couldn't be more helpful. Good luck and have a Happy New Year!
I have copied numerous books from CD into ITunes and then synced them to my IPod. I assume that copying Audible books is similar. Check out this page: http://www.audible.com/dc
Not without getting lightning cable to 30pin adapter,this cable was meant for iPhone 5,5c,5s ipad4,mini,air and 5th generation iPods
Yes, it has a USB cable you can connect to your computer, however, it does not come with connection to the electrical outlet, that has to be bought separately.
You transfer music to the iPod with software , most people use iTunes but other options are available.
A USB to your computer. It works with your music files. I use Windows Media Player. When you plug it in it opens the program and you drag songs onto the sync list, then click sync, and in a few seconds the music is loaded.
32GB does yes. 16GB no.
I would get an iPod classic, put all of your music on it and then get an iPod dock by Klipsch or Bose
Hi! You need to download iTunes on the computer, open up an account with them and buy the music you enjoy.
Haven't used the shuffle for audiobooks but should work fine. Just don't try to load the entire Library of Congress.
The iPod touch does not include a carrying case. I suggest you buy one for a few bucks to protect your investment.
No, you cannot. There is not enough memory for a full audio book
Yes, very well
Yes
Yes
Yes.
yes, it has wifi capabilities.
Yes.Magicjack app(magicApp) is available at itunes appstore and gives you unlimited calls/text wherever you have WiFi for $2/month or $15/year($1.25/month).You can call landlines and mobile numbers and text to mobile numbers. Many tablet/ipod touch owners are unaware they can use their device as a WiFi phone.It works like a speaker phone and if you want a private conversation,just plug in earbuds/headphones as the mic will still pick up your voice.No special headset needed. The app is free if you use magicjack home phone service for $3/month.Here is an amazon link for magicjack GO home phone device: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LN0OM14/ref=cm_cd_asin_lnk
Yes it does and I use Bluetooth headphones with it, sounds great too by the way!
Need wifi connection. iPod has no 3G at all. Only wifi. If no wifi, you cannot do anything that requires internet (like a call)
No.....you put your own music on it through iTunes or otherwise.
iPod touch's yellow is not really yellow. It is a combination of yellow and green. You should go to apple store and see it.
No. This iPod uses the new Apple lightning connector. The iPod classics all used the 30 pin connector.
I'm not positive but I believe you can use both. On my 2nd generation iPod touch I believe I found a few mp3 files and I saved them to my computer and when I went into my iTunes I just copied the mp3 files into my iTunes library.
hi, i never had any problem i have connected listening to music, so, it charges, when i used for walking in the morning is only for an hour, wonderful product
It has the new connector and a headphone pin.
These should work fine. I do not have a D5200 (I've got D5100) but I do not see any reason why this won't work.
NO, as long as you have access to a WiFi available, you can facetime. that is the difference between the IPod and IPad/IPhone. Ipod is WIFI ONLY, IPad is by choice, either wifi or Cellular, IPhone is BOTH
No but i hear they are not going to make ipod anymore so dont waste money. I like my fourth gen better than my 5th gen
I am not sure because I am not familiar with the system you have but I can tell you what I have learned since receiving my 7th Generation IPOD, it does not have the regular 30 pin plug in. I had a speaker with 30 pin and bought an adaptor, still did not work, so I ended up buying a blue tooth capable speaker. Works great this way.
Go to the genre, swipe down so you get "All albums", swipe down again for "all songs", swipe down again, and there it is :)
When I opened the plastic box, I got the iPod which was on top, and at the bottom came the lighting USB connector, the apple ear pods, the loop which comes in the color that you got your iPod, apple stickers, and instruction manual
I like Bose sound systems (great sound and base) but I haven't tried many other systems so I can't fairly say it's the best.
Yes
Yes, I can understand totally of not using earplugs. It has speakers. I am so grateful because I have been always using plugs with my older iPod.
Yes. This is how I have it set up right now.
Also, not sure what phone Angel has but my Samsung Galaxy 3 runs this phone just fine. I love it.
about 4 hours. I mostly have it plugged in for exercise videos in the basement.
I find this radio to be alittle complicated. I am not sure. I am still trying to figure out some of the features.
No- I bought it because I thought it would charge an iPhone. It does not- so I returned it. And so far I have not found an emergency charger except a Lithium battery for about a $100 which you need electricity to charge it!!!!!!!!
Rx1R will have more detailed version of the cloud - so for landscapes and sky shots i would recommend rx1r
Hi Patricia, Sony RMTDSLR2 Remote Commander is compatible on the Sony A7M2 Camera. -Vincent
The RX100 II does not appear on the compatibility list at Sony's website.
I've purchased two of these and neither one work with any software. I would not recommend this cable to anyone for any reason.
Dear John, You may view all the colors available for the CaseCrown cases for the Kindle Fire HD 8 (2012) and HDX 8 here (you can view the different colors by clicking on the different colored thumbnails): http://www.amazon.com/CaseCrown-Standby-Amazon-Kindle-feature/dp/B0097GCNMG/
I am not aware of a Kindle Fire 8" model. This one is for the Kindle Fire HD (not HDX) 8.9" tablet. I hope this helps. :-)
No. As you see it in this picture it is 1 5/8" wide by 4 5/8" tall by 3/4" deep/thick. The max depth is 1 3/8" when you use the rear flip out door to support it at an angle. Much like the flip outs on the bottom of a keyboard. It will fold flat into a recess making it 3/4" thick. It is a very handy device. I recommend it for lectures and meetings where taking notes is inconvenient.
Don't know about yours, but ours just bends open all the way backwards and tucks into the little flap on back and "mission accomplished".
Yes
It's the same just conect the two wires. ono on the left and the other one on the right. mine was the same way and it works perfect.
I use 12 gauge on my fronts and 14 on my surrounds with no issues. The 12 gauge was a little difficult to get wrapped back around and then screw down, but I really don't know of any banana plug that would we easier, without going to the kind where they use a screw to fasten. This is the easier, cleaner look in my opinion!
Yes. You can look at the back of the Onkyo 8050 (2nd image on Amazon at http://www.amazon.com/Onkyo-TX-8050-Network-Stereo-Receiver/dp/B004UR486G). These plugs fit in the red and black posts marked as "Speakers".
I really don't know how the sound bar is connected. I used my pigtail to connect a DVD recorder and a Blu Ray player to the same HDMI jack. It works fine that way. Of course, I can only use one at a time--either the Blu Ray player or the Recorder/player.
You can, but the auto switching function only works when boththings are off and one gets turned on. Since I doubt you turn off your DVR you would have to manually press a button on the pigtsil to switch sources. You really need to plug in two things that get turned off most of the time like an Xbox and a blue ray player. Then it works perfect.
It just a 2X1 switch. It's not changing or converting anything. If your computer has a HDMI output, it should work.
You should be able to use either a 250 Watt like the one I bought http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0097KU6NU?ref_=pe_527950_33920250 or this 350 Watt which someone said in reviews they could fit into exactly your model PC.
Yes. My son purchased Battlefield 4, only to find out he needed extra space to play it. So we actually purchased this hard drive specifically for Battlefield 4.
They are ~7.25 inches tall, but with the volume knob you'll need 8 inches of. Leafs cd to fit.
No, sorry. Completely different CPU.
Any standard heat sink will work for it. I just transferred my stock Dell heat sink. I usually don't worry about what heat sink I'm using until I upgrade the processor. The board went in my back up pc that has a FX 4130.
Not really
If your NEX-7 has a standard tripod socket then the plate will attach to your camera. The real question is if you have a tripod that is compatible with this plate/bracket.
The BookArc comes with 2 rubber-like inserts for the notch that fits the MBP. I found the smaller one holds my MBP nicely with its silicone case/skin on. Without that it would be a little wobbly. I'm sure TwelveSouth is working on it, though.
You need both hands in less you were to mount it correctly to a table if it was firmly attached to the table then you could pull it out, otherwise you need to use one hand to hold it while you pull the laptop out
No
No wait...NO! It's only for the previous generation and that's 2012. Sorry.
Yes. The Kindle Fire HD 7" is what I have.
Doubtful. I wouldn't purchase this if I were you, the holes don't line up right, no matter if it's inserted right-left or left-right.
Yes it works on 5 and 5S, not sure about 5C. Myself and my kids have dropped this phone tons of times on all sorts of grounds indoors and outdoors and my phone has made it through no cracks.
It protects the back, but does not include a screen protector for the front.
Yes that is what I have. I just got the new one, same size and everything. Fits like a glove. Has cut outs for the speakers and buttons and all. It is really nice for the price!!
Unfortunately, no--you'll be limited to 2.0 transfer speeds. The purpose of the adapter is to allow cases with front USB 3.0 ports to connect to motherboards that only support USB 2.0 because the header has a different pin configuration. Without the adapter, you wouldn't be able to physically connect the wiring or use the front USB ports of the case at all.
You should be able to use a USB 2.0 cable to connect your hard drive to your computer. USB 3.0 is compatible with 2.0. You'll just get 2.0 speeds.
Yes
It will be close, you would be better with a full case rig.
Hello, Yes this card, although a little bit longer than a standard card, can & will fit your mid-tower case.
No - just two pair, and they are the ones that need to be charged before using - like a cell phone.
My tv came with 2 pair of rechargeable glasses.
Yes
Dear friends, Thanks for your inquiry ,we have more than 200 pieces in stock ,and shipping via DHL or Fedex need more than 400usd If you have any other questions,please let us know at any time ,thanks Have a nice day BR PUYU
Excellent computer and very worthy of praise and acquisition program but did not have Microsoft Office for free
No
perfect, but sometimes the camera doesn't work
According to the manual, yes. I don't have 3D glasses so haven't tested this.
alienware m17x and m18x you can.
yes there is warranty, not just local but 'International'. very good if you bring it to travel abroad. There should be a sticker on the laptop just beside the mousepad saying 'International Warranty'. in case of trouble abroad just look for a samsung service center and have it fix for free.
The hard drives are 2 x 500GB 7200rpm
At the time I bought it, it came with Windows Home Premium. There may be other options now.
Same problem. I got a faster and better router and upgraded my mps from 20 to 50. Still drops a lot (Default gateway not found)... Bought a external USB wireless adapter and now it works perfectly. Well not perfectly, it is like a spare tire; quick fix but does not really solve problem. A computer this expensive shouldn't need an auxiliary part that sticks out the side.
Don't do this. Windows 8 brings a lot to the tablet; the new start menu may seem silly on your desktop computer, but on a tablet with a touch screen it is a compelling improvement that you will (really!) quickly come to appreciate.
Not refurbished, brand new, warranty warranty is based on the bottom of the bar code
I have it mounted on the ceiling. Yes, It was easy to adjust. Just remove the cover and loosen a set screw, aim, tighten the set screw, replace the cover and wallah done.
Yes
It does detect rear. But the rear sensor isn't very big and I've never been hit from the back so I don't know how well it works.
Yes,it plugs into the lighter port.
No, it plugs into cigarette lighter or accessories outlet
Keep in mind if it DOES fit, it'll block any camera in the back, and it's not real quick and easy to get in and out. It works well for my original iPad because there is no camera on the back of that unit.
I have had no issues with these batteries in my D7100. I haven't used them a great deal yet but so far everything works exactly as the OEM battery did, including the battery age gauge.
Will fit with no problem.
It's less than 1/3. 15 minutes of video maybe. Never charges more than 70% and the charger indicates a charging error by rapidly blinking the amber light. I absolutely don't recommend this. The seller refunded me promptly.
It works with my D7000
No
Yes, the light is on the key. And if you were wondering, yes it is quite visible.
Hi Brandon. Do you mean that the - and + are reversed? Mine is the same way but it doesn't affect anything.
I don't have that model, but it fits perfectly and protects really well.
I do not know. But be aware there have been issues with the cover working properly on the Asus TF700t. Multiple attempts at contacting Gum Drop and the re-seller of the cover have gone unanswered. Basically, tech support and customer service is non-existent. Too bad Otterbox does not make covers for Asus tablets, but I guess Asus is not "mainstream" (read "lucrative" or "profitable") enough for Otterbox.
No
No it doesn't. It still has the best sound possible. Pretty good case if you ask me .
Yes it will. One end goes into the cigarette lighter socket and the other goes into your phone's headphone jack. This transmitter will broadcast the music being played from your phone or mp3 player over an FM signal which your car antenna will pickup from outside. Adjust the station frequency on the transmitters digital screen and match the station on your car radio. Choose a station that has static so it is not competing with the strong signal of a clear sounding radio station. Push play and turn up the volume, that's it!
No, just the glass and the plug strip you see. No touch pad..the shipping was faster than was told..excellent service from the people....sorry it took so long to get back, severe storms in ares past couple of days.....thx for asking my opinion...appreciate it !!!
i go by if it still works but has cracks you dont need the LCD. but if u want to be certain without taking it apart just buy both.
No
no, the original 7.0+
There on ear really unless u have really small ears
As an Xbox fanboy it'd be hard for me to answer that with any accuracy. However, it uses Bluetooth technology which I think pS3 uses so I'd assume you could. It works with my phone thru Bluetooth. Sorry I couldn't answer definitively.
I am using this laptop. I purchased it last year in October. It has 4 GB of RAM and 500 GB HDD.
No.
Yes within thirty days.
Yes , when did you buy your phone?
SL..I would't know...I am an end user..you need to ask ST directly as they are the ones providing the insurance..not me!
Yes
Yes, it is.
Yes, it fits
No, wired only.
Hi Jane, Thanks for your enquiry. I'm sorry but you won't be able to use any other case while the Kindle is in the Beachbuoy. If there is anything further that we can do for you please do not hesitate to contact us. Many Thanks. Team@proporta
Yes, we'll worth the money. Better then the original
The cover is a perfect fit.
Yes, it is cut out on the cover.
Yes this was a great buy
Answer from Titantech: Yes, it works on your Mazda 3 Sport 2011 in US. The map is upgradable to 2013.
Yes no problem, it's a good article. You can play music from iphone throught ipod's input at the radio good luck
Does it say it will? no huh.... theres a search bar on amazon and here you go.... http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Inspiron-3521-Laptop-Keyboard/dp/B00H4FFHYS/ref=sr_1_11?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1386644095&sr=1-11&keywords=DELL+INSPIRON+15+3521+keyboard
Yes
I had to play with the settings several times to get the steering wheel controls to work.
Check this link out, It explains all acceptable wifi cards for your laptop. It sure looks like the 5300 is there. http://www.lenovo.com/us/en/PDFs/Thinkpad_t400_and_t500_datasheet.html
You not only have to worry about chipset compatibility, you also need be concerned about the BIOS being used. I do not see an immediate problem with the chip set. However, without knowing version and manufacturer of the BIOS, I would have to say, I do not know.
I'm not sure ... Search the dell community forums for a better answer (or google) ... but it was cheap enough for me to gamble ... I actually have one if you want to pay shipping and try it
The 18-135 mm lens that comes with the kit is a steel mount NOT plastic.
Yes, it does include Chinese.
I think it would hold a tablet up to 15mm or possibly a bit thicker, if it slopes to an edge then the body could be quite a bit thicker.
Camera, battery, lens, manual, strap, cap, lens hood,
yes. this is a good camera in low light.I used sensitivity up to 6400 and I got good noise all the way through
SORRY NO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING
Yes, the K-5 II includes Polish as a language option. See http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/K5/K5MODES.HTM for a sample of all menu options.
It's difficult to say since this device hardly ever works properly. Read the reviews. You're better off buying another Kindle than this piece of junk.
You shouldn't need a code for the bluetooth. Turn off bluetooth on both the device and keyboard, when you turn them back on and try to connect the device will tell you the code to type in on the keyboard and press enter.
Why not just your phone? Your phone probably have better resolutions plus it can record videos unlike this device.
Yes, you can. However, it does not work on batteries. It is powered through the USB cable or an A/C power cord sold separately. Though, someone on here said it runs on two AA batteries. I just haven't noticed a place to put batterie because that is not how I use it.
There is a backspace and other multi-directional keys on the Logitech K811. I have never seen their F1 key nor used it. This keyboard is, hands-down, the best bluetooth keyboard I have tried (3 so far, including Brookstone and Apple).
This works great with my Toshiba running 8.1. My laptop didn't have BT built in so I added a BT4.0 usb dongle. I'm very happy with this keyboard.
Yes you may. I have one in front of me on my desk.
4 days
Yes
It is certainly the best lens for newborn photos in the Nikkor line. But realize that because of the smallish sensor you will not get as much bokeh as with other camera systems.
NO. You will want the 35mm f/1.8 DX lens, which is the exact DX equivalent to this lens. Link: http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-35mm-1-8G-Digital-Cameras/dp/B001S2PPT0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1371226517&sr=8-1&keywords=nikon+35mm
As an owner of a couple of Nikon's with video capability (D800 and D300s), it depends on the lens. AF-S lenses are quite a bit quieter than AF lenses, however, if you are planning on using auto focus during production, off camera sound is a must. The onboard mic will pick up any autofocus noise.
Because Amazon is changing.... It used to be my default online store to buy stuff, even they are a little more expensive occasionally. Now they started charging 8% sales tax in CA. That's a deal breaker when I'm buying the D600+24-70mm lens because I'd have to pay $300 for tax. I bought from B&H, no tax no shipping.
It travels the same in both directions - its a little but clumsy because of the "lock" button that has to be pressed down at the same time -- but its the same in both directions.
No. You will need the Nikon MB-D11 for the Nikon D7000.
You do not need with it! D5300 comes with integrated wi-fi, there is no point on buying this
Hi Charles T. In fact is for that model (the same that I just...well...Lets say that now I dont know what camera to buy to replace my dear a65) Well. Yes. It makes the proprietary shoe of Sony on the most of the old alpha camera series (the a58 is newer and has the standard or MultiShoe or simply put the same shoe as Nikon, cannon, and so on). Good Luck!
As the iphone 5 and 5s are the same size yes it. And I like it a lot.
I'm not sure about a video because I have never tried it, but I have 300+ photo inspirational quotes loaded and they do loop over and over during the course of the day, plus I also loaded some MP3 music files that also play and loop. I would think that a video files would also loop.
I would say the actual use time (listening time, not including idle-connectivity) to be around 6 hours. I was a little disappointed by this, but if its charged with your phone/mp3 each time it should be no problem. Don't know about the bluetooth connectivity, but its worked with all my Android devices with no problems.
I use it for hiking and exercise. Not sure about extreme waterproff.
Yes it does
I believe it does, but because I read so many reviews about other tv's breaking down within a year or less, I went ahead and purchased the extended warranty.
Probably not. The graphics card is a built-in part of the motherboard and there are no PCI or any other kind of slots on the motherboard to add cards to the motherboard on this laptop. I am betting that no laptop will let you add any graphics cards to any of them either.
Sorry.
I don't know. However it is really simple to look for it: go to HP.com and look for the model, then you will see (I think) a section with accessories. I'm pretty sure a battery replacement will be in there
The view basic pc info in Windows 8 screen shows the laptop as having 6GB installed RAMM.
The only adapter that was included with my computer was the electrical cord. Still not sold on Windows 8... I have had the computer 2 months but still cling to my old with the old Window 7. It works fine I guess.. but I still get annoying pop up windows/programs by simply touching the touch pad.
i had this unit for 2 + years and been totally thru it, never seeing anything about bluetooth
I don't know I put a galaxy tab 2 10.1 on this item and can tell you that it works great for me. Sorry I wasn't more help.
Hi, I bought it for my child leappad 2.it fits very well.but I am not sure about multicolors
I don't think so.. the video goes into a software application provided with the device. The viewing image is not even your whole computer screen, it would be like playing on a gameboy.
I just measured mine. From 3.5mm plug to the earbud the wire is just shy of 49 inches long.
No they are not
These phones do not plug into the TV. A transmitter plugs into the TV. Older TVs might disable the speakers if you plug the transmitter into the speaker output jacks. New TVs have separate output plugs for wireless phones. I have a late model flat screen TV that runs the speakers and the transmitter simultaneously and I can listen even when my wife mutes the sound during commercials.
You shouldn't have to. My unit plugged into my cable box because we have cable tv. If you don't have cable, you can plug it directly into the tv. The box that the headphones charge on in the picture comes with the connecting cables.
I can't answer that. I just know it's a great headset. We had it professionally hooked up because we have cable and a universal remote and my husband is one who wants it all right the first time!
Bose QC25 are great but they have a cord and these Sony mdr-1rbt are Bluetooth and can be plugged in with 3mm cord. i guess just depends on what you are looking for in a headphone the Bose QC25 that i tried on at best buy sounded much better than these but don't have Bluetooth capability and thats why i chose these over those. Sony has great sound too but bose has much better noise cancelling capability. Overall both great headphones and have their pros and cons just up to you which ones you get. Hope this helped.
All you do is place the headset on the charging station, which is also the receiver. The battery is internal and charges just by sitting on the docking station.
No. There is no audio out on the Bose Solo TV sound system. You could perhaps install a 'Y' from your TV and shut the Bose down when you want to listen privately, but it cannot connect to the Bose. If your TV out is 1/8" stereo jack then this might work. http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103870 If your TV out is RCA the perhaps two of these is your answer. http://www.radioshack.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2103709&numProdsPerPage=60
I'm not sure how far, but I have been as much as 50 feet and they worked the same as if I was 5 feet. I have also been outside on my patio and they worked.
OEM. And top of the line.
It is different, the "nc" has noise cancelling and is more expensive. This headphone is great, really shows off music well and at the price, a no-brainer!
Quite honestly, no. They're really good for music, but the extra bass distorts the way the dialogue sounds when a movie is playing.
No
Yes. Exactly what I did on mine.
I have no idea. I would send Cowon an e-mail and ask them
yes its come with case but im not recommend you buy this headphones..
Not sure what you mean by "SN". My Acer Aspire E1-571-6481 did not come with Microsoft Office installed. I like the machine overall, it
Around 4-5 hrs with normal usage (movies, music and MS office software). Hope this helps.
~ 3 hours,maybe slightly more
You have to purchase them separately.
no it is not
Nothing works good with minecraft. Go read a book. Just kidding. yes, this computer will work fine with minecraft. Really depends on your internet speed and your router.
8GB
No problem as long as your printer is wireless ready.
No
If you purchase as is it comes with Windows 8 (ugh!), but if you go to Acer they may be able to do something to sell it with Windows 7. I did not ask. You may have to purchase windows 7, uninstall windows 8 and install windows 7.
Sorry about the long winded answer. Computer is my wife's so bear with me. First I hope you are within the 60 or 90 day window since purchase. Otherwise it costs to get answer from Micosoft Windows. Apparently it was a code problem (small bit of code was left out of the version Windows 8 loaded on our Acer). The support tech did some tech magic, fixed the code and it worked. I hope this helps. Bottom line is call Microsoft, Windows 8.
Thanks for your interest in this lens. Yes, the lens will work with the camera but it is a manual focus lens only.
We can confirm it is compatible. As stated in the description: This T-mount adapter is specifically designed to fit T-mount (screw-mount) lenses to a Canon EOS mount SLR/DSLR camera.
Its a manual mine still in a box ha ha used once!!!
Thank you for your interest in our package deal! In regards to your inquiry, this lens is compatible with the Nikon D3100. You will have to use the Precision Design T Mount for Nikon included in this bundle for the lens to adapter to the D3100. Also, this lens is Manual Focus and works in Manual Mode only. Therefore, you will lose any automatic function.
The keyboard and mouse aren't wireless, I don't know about the motherboard.
fast and has everything you need .I have it hooked up to my 60inch TV I don't like windows 8 you can put windows 7 on it but I just put stardock on it to make it look like windows 7.
This is made for the Garmin 200 series GPS only .
It is compatible if you have the proper connecting cable. Make sure you select the TC-DC2 connector when you buy it. I have a D5100 and have used it successfully.
Yes, the Nikon D90 requires the Triggertrap Mobile Kit MD3&#8209;DC2, please see: http://shop.triggertrap.com/collections/triggertrap-mobile-kits for more details.
Yes it actually comes with the connector for both the camera (Canon 60D) to the Triggertrap and the Triggertrap to the mobile device.
It should work with any computer (Lenovo or not) that has built in Bluetooth.
Yes it does.
I really don't know. When I bought it I went to BestBuy to get suggestions on what to buy. I suggest you go to Best Buy and talk to a sales rep. there as they seem to have more knowledge than other places I went to. Good Luck Julie B. George L. Swanson Jr.
Yes
I would search ebay. Since this power cord is very similar to laptop power supplies, you could just purchase a laptop outlet power supply plug and use it.
It comes with a built-in DVD writer. Thanks, PCrush
Hi Joshua! It comes with Intel HD4000 Graphics card as mentioned in the website, so this one will basically work with standard games ok but not great whatsoever. This pc itself is great for everything else and with a good card it would become amazing I'm sure. You can go to Lenovo.com and there you should be able to see the "customize" buying option as well, to choose from different components for it.
Probably it will. However, I have to tell you that I had a very bad experience with this laptop. The motherbooard just crashed in a few months. I had to send it to Lenovo support service. They fixed it, but I guess the quality is not that good. Good luck
Hi, My Lenovo has 8 GB but maybe there are some cheaper versions that come with 6GB as well as less disk capacity . I think it depends on what you read at the site you are checking. regards Michael
Yes it comes with flash player installed
Slide the small cover off of the back, it covers the camera. Sd slot is on the left side. I used a 32g card and have had no issues.
Normal simcard
Sorry, it doesn't have one :/
There is no bluetooth and the MS Office trial is 30 days.
No; it has an USB 2.0 Mini B receptacle connector which is attached to the device
I purchased for my Lenovo and does not work with windows 8. Could not find any drivers to download.
The yoga 11 I ordered from Amazon did not come with a Digitizer Pen S note. I returned this computer because of Windows 8 RT and re-ordered the Yoga 11s. It did not come with a Digitizer Pen S note either but I am satisfied with the computer.
You get a free trial period, then have to buy the product to continue to use after the trial.
i7-3517
Im sorry, I do not have this item.
Absolutely!! This screen protector is the best I've ever had. It's so clear, you can't tell there is a cover over the screen. No interference with the stylus...none at all. Product, highly recommended! Melody
No but you can buy the older models with windows 7. But, why would you not want windows 8?
You can through shipito.com
Yes
I can't help with this question. I haven't had mine very long and don't remember where I put the information on the warrenty. Sorry.
No it is not.
There are two gaming laptop series by Asus: G55VW and G75VW; first one is 15.6" while the second is 17.3". So G55VW-DH71 is definitely a 15.6-Inch Laptop.
I did not receiver either.
No. When I got it I was comparing to another Asus model that was the same size but with touch screen, but I can't remember what it was called. The touchscreen models have touchscreen prominently featured in the title or text.
i believe so
If you like music, you probably will not e satisfied with the sound from the laptop. when playing music, I always rout my sound to some external speakers or player.
Jason, I have had mine for a couple of months and the battery lasts 5 - 7 hours depending on what I am doing. This is a great machine and very fast.
The machines are identical except for the processor 1.7 GHz vs 1.9 GHz
Yes it does.
I don't know since I do not use Bluetooth but I think the answer is NO
Remove the bottom cover.
It is best to pair matching memory. So you'll want to buy another 4gb stick if that's what you currently have. Make sure the frequency is the same too, the majority will be 1600MHz. If you want to be sure you'll need to look up manufacturers specs online for look on your existing memory or it might be on the memory itself. Hope that helps.
No, this is not a touchscreen model.
64
2h for me 'cuz i usually play games
Yes, I did exactly that with no detrimental effect to the speed or distance.I had a old satellite tv cable that ran from the living room to the roof, and one that ran from the office to the roof.I patched the cable together next to the old satellite dish, and hooked up a router in the living room to our router in the office.I got excellent transmission from the router to the living room.
If you have a Digital Audio output, you should be able to convert it to analog. One note, the picture shown is deceptive. There is only one little block not two. They are showing both a front and back view.
A cortex A-8 is a processor...not a tablet...
No
There is no way to switch voltage - looks to be 110 only.
Unsure about your projector. Sorry
The screen size is 10"x6.5" with viewing size 9"x5"
This product is not made to hook to anything. It has been excellent for my 8 year old. It is easy to grip and protects the tablet very well.
This is a great case. I've had mine for a little over a year now and it has protected Mr nexas well. I don't know if there is a difference between yours and mine but the case is so good I would try to research it to find out. Wish I had a yes or no answer for you but I don't.
Dropped, thrown and stepped on by a two year old. They make the nexus 7 a little ugly but protects it well.
A normal usb cable not a micro usb.
Hard to say.. that's a cheap price, so I would guess its recycled. I paid 10.00 for mine new. Check ebay, or just do a Google search and compare prices.
I believe it should but to be sure you may want to open up your laptop to see which configuration the wireless card is.
Yes, provided you have an sd card installed, after the OS load there is just over 2GB free on these models... just got 2 for XMAS for the kiddies
Yes you can.
It is normal. But, I would recommend you should turn if off (using power button on the remote or on Consolette app) when you don't use it
No....there are two separate cords.
Don't even buy it I never got mines to even work waste of money
I do not believe so for iOS. Other platforms can be configured differently. There is a list of supported games on the steelseries web site. Some iOS games will allow controls to be configured but not all. The Free pad uses the iOS standard that was developed by the makers of iCade. http://faq.steelseries.com/questions/438/What+IOS+games+are+compatible+with+the+SteelSeries+Free+Mobile+Controller%3F
I don't know; I've only used mine under OSX. The steele series doesn't list Linux ( http://steelseries.com/us/products/other/steelseries-free-mobile-wireless-controller#faq ), but neither does it for the 3GC controller, but people have had some success with that ( http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2043372 ). Probably best to hit up some linux gaming sites -- as there are a lot of unofficial hacks for that system to make things work, whereas few developers will make legally binding claims to work with that system (alas).
I would think so...my son uses these with a portable dvd player and with his nabi tablet. So they should work just fine with a portable cd player.
It means that there are five Light Emitting Diodes mounted on a printed wiring board behind the lens of the light's housing one in the center and one in each corner
I've never daisy chained using two different connections, but I don't think that would be a problem. The drive does daisy chain, yes. I've daisy chained several G-Technology drives using the FW800.
If you have FireWire 800 you can daisy chain several drives together. I have a 12 core mac that can do that, not sure on a PC . The drives can be formatted for PC. The best thing would be to ask customer support at G-Tech, they have been very good at answering my questions in the past.
With the Q10 you can only use the 1.03 firmware. The Pentax Q is a different camera (earlier version of the Q10)
Simple sd card
4"
I hooked mine straight with no relay.
I can't give a definite answer on the MacBook Air, but I've used it with my MacBook Pro Retina and it works perfectly. The only issue I've had with it was that it wasn't compatible with my external USB 3 card that I put in my Mac Tower. So if it's just for your Air, I'd say you're safe giving it a go. Hope that helps.
Yes. It will work with Windows Vista.
Its an excellent camera, with great picture quality. I used my phone a few times to view it and though there is a lag in the video feed but the video quality is pretty good.
It is work on iPhone don't need to connected to wi-fi.
Only the solo and I'm trying to sell mine because ivgotbthe wrong ones
These are only stickers
Yes
This item is a skin for the beats headphones. The headphones are not included.
It should work on an HP. It just replaces your cd drive and your computer treats the new hard drive you install in the caddy like any other expandable memory plugged into it
Yes
No it does not block the camera at all.
Hi, Elizabeth. I don't believe so, though I suppose I can't be sure. If I were you I would look for cases specifically designed for the C models. Good luck, Mark
Sorry, do not use dock!
No
No.
We stream movies quite often. I do it through a HDMI cable connecting my laptop to a TV. we watch Amazon Instant Videos most often.
no, not a touchscreen...
No, it doesn't. But, it does come with a 30-day free trial....
YES
You would need both and would want a better reciver also
It does not!
3-4 hours I think
Yes these are probably already updated to iOS 8.
I used to have an iPod that had my name and phone number engraved in the back. There is really nothing you can do to remove it unless you filed it out which would ruin the iPod.
Yes it does
Does pretty well in low light; however I always shoot raw and post process in Lightroom 5.
110 for sure. Haven't looked at the power pack to see if its dual rated
Yes, it does. You have to reformat to fat32.
Yes, you can actually set up 2 devices on it. One through the 3.5mm audio headset and one opitical.
No its simple just purchase the correct cables and good ones. I bought the cables from emotiva when I purchased the amp.
Yes I use it to Bi Amp couple of Klipsch RF-83
It did when I bought the white model back last November. If you shoot a lot, I'd suggest acquiring a 2nd battery since I seem to get about 225 shots / full charge, and I like having a 2nd battery charged and ready to go so I can keep shooting. But it did come with one battery.
Very much you can.In fact I download to drop box and later upload to Flickr..It's simple to use with android.I use for both android and Ipad,no issues at all.
I have had my PowerShot for more than a year now and have never had a lens error.
Like you, I have to wear sunglasses with my prescription in them. I have always had a problem looking at the LCD screens with my sunglasses on. What I do, is take my sunglasses off, and rely on the EVF. I am lost without it, especially with my vision. I think I get better photos that way.
What is the question?
I own (and love) both of these cameras, but the 6D is my new favorite for the grandchildren. It is quieter and you will never need a flash. The high ISO means you can use a faster shutter indoors -- fewer blurry kids.
Jason A. Kentros comments on 5/14/2013: "This is a good soundbar, but if Bluetooth isn't a requirement I'd recommend the SB100, better value overall, and for those with your own subwoofer it's the obvious choice as the SB100 has a sub output."
I would say that 2 to 3 hours. You can buy the battery pack and go twice as much.
Transcend Class 10s work just fine for the All-I codec.
Yes I purchased it for my ultra book and it works perfectly.
It is VERY bulky. It's designed to be foolproof, so it's almost like a bumper. I used my ipod in a gym where it's constantly being dropped, so it suits that need very well, but for something you want to keep in your pocket, there are probably better options
You definitely can but you'll need your own copy of windows 7. If you're worried about the start bar missing in windows 8, you can always download a mod to add it back in. I believe Microsoft is also deciding to release an official version as well.
No. This is a desk top computer. It's all connected with wires and a plug to the wall.
The VGA port is disabled presumably because the video card uses an HDMI slot instead. Acer will have disabled the slot to prevent conflicts between the video / graphics card and the main board. I presume it could be reversed but that would be a question for Acer. I presume you have a monitor without an HDMI slot. If so you might get a cable that converts HDMI to RGA.
Yes it is
No. This computer has only one CD/DVD drive. In order to burn from CD to CD, it would be necessary to rip from the original CD, store on the computer, then burn the copy. As an alternative, you could delete the information after you are done copying to the CD.
Yes
No unfortunately it has to be directly from microsoft but as for anything else its perfect
No i Haven't had that problem. I had it for a while and haven't had any problems. Try removing your hard drive restart you game with out and then shut down put it back in if it still says format then you have something corrupted on the drive. could be something you copied over.
yes, you can. open the camera app and take a picture.
None. Sorry. This is a very cheap (though good) tablet, but it doesnt come with any warranty (any paper) with it...
It has a web browser included that you can surf the web. You can use any email you want but gmail is built in and recommended.
To make a long story short, you have to use HDMI, Composite doesn't work. more info here (you are out of luck for a SD TV set.) http://androidtvbox.us/topic/component-rbg-does-not-work/
I honestly don't know. Sorry. But If the iPad mini retina is thinner than the regular iPad mini then I doubt it. I could be wrong so check the specs and see if it's listed to fit.
Just the case
I'm not sure..but I don't believe it will..the I-Blason case for 7.9 inch iPad mini may be a bit small..but there are similar I-Blason cases that will fit..check I-Blason..sorry I couldn't help more.
Yes you can Plug, not pug anything into it just like any type of screen or monitor. You do have to plug it into a wall for power..
You can download Netflix and Hulu but I don't know about Hayday.
The unit has built in speakers. I believe the headphone jack referred to is the one on the phone. I have not done this, but if you have digital music on the iphone you can play it through the Pyle speakers with a cord connecting the headphone jack on the phone to the similar jack on the side of the Pyle.
Yes
Please if you have not bought this DON"T. It is a real piece of junk on so many levels. If you have one there are some people on E-bay that sell needles at a very reasonable price. You could check with them. Just type in phono needles. as far as tone arms I do not know.
It is not pre-calibrated, the pre-calibrated one is the PA279Q, which costs $300 more and comes with actually a LOT more features and such. However, these come with really great factory settings and there are many color profiles available to improve it even more with relative ease. If you are not worried about the money and don't intend to use this for gaming, but rather photo editing and such, I'd definitely go with the PA279Q because it has a lot more color features.
Yes
I use the Bear Motion leather case with my iPad 4. It will slip on about 3/4 of the way befor the case stops it. In this position it does almost as good a job amplifying sound as it does when fully seated on the iPad. However, it can only be fully seated with the case removed.
I have not seen any effect to camera or flash.
Hi Jerome, Most of our flash drives, including this DTGE9, are formatted to FAT32 by default. The FAT32 file system is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. Thank you for your interest in Kingston Flash drives! -Jewel, Kingston US Technical Support
Se is the silver USB and ge is the gold version.
When I got mine I had 2 basic mounts, one for a flat surface and another for something like a helmet. It came with a 4gig card but I got a 16 gig at RadioShack for cheap. This model is water proof but only up to 3 feet. They aren't real obvious about that. You have to buy an underwater case to solve that issue.
I didn't try that?sorry.i use this cable to go from my kindle to my hdtv(watching movies)the cord you would want is USB to mini hdmi(for kindle)and I don't know if it would do what you want.
No. The aperature adjustments are not able to be made by the user. That was a good question to ask though! I have used it in what I consider "normal indoor" light with great success, but in very dim light it starts to go....
No, once the memory card is full it stops recording. But also it is battery operated so even if it could eventually the battery would die.
Should not it is a plug and play. My machine at work is similarly tighly controlled and I had not problems.
not sure, i dont how many slots are on the board.
No.
I've compared it with my SB-800 and SB-900. The brightness is comparable to both though the illumination pattern is a little less even than the Nikons. iTTL works well and with the Yongnuo YN-622N you have an affordable, full iTTL Pocket Wizard work-alike. Unlike the SB-800 and SB-900 this unit can not act as a Nikon CLS IR commander, but will work CLS IR as slave.
My flash was broken a couple of months after the buying, the seller doesnt take responsability, he send me with Yongnuo. they told me that I had to send the flash to China to reclaim warranty, and I had to pay all the shipping charges
Yes
The color of this unit is beige. For comparison think of a cream or almond as in window blinds.
Yes
No, it does not. But you get one free when you go to AT&T and activate it.
1. Adjustable Height: column connector extends 5" - 22.7" (increments of .98") Metric = 398 mm-578 mm (with increments of 22.5 mm)
It is the full mount kit with an extendable column. It includes everything you need to ceiling-mount your projector.
Yes, HID ballasts are required
Probably not these bulbs are made for 35watts
I've got it nearly a year ago and no longer have the box. I have a 42" flat screen tv on it, which I estimate weighs 25 or 30 pounds. No indication of stress at this weight.
Not as shipped but all you need to do is order a bluetooth antenna and it will connect to any bluetooth device.
It comes with a Blue ray disc combo drive. Cannot burn blue ray dvds onto another blue ray dvd, only read/view them. Blue ray trademark belongs to Sony.
there is the typical trial version of office if i am not wrong, but to get the full version you have to buy a key, pretty standard for new machines. I reccomend uninstalling the trial and installing any office you have handy (or buy) i did it with office 2007 and no problems so far.
I've looked everywhere for the answer to this and Toshiba just says "Windows 8." However, if you go to the Toshiba website and configure your own ultrabook, it does say Windows 8 Premium for the Windows 8 option. I'm assuming that it is Windows 64 bits but wish they would actually say that. Assuming they go with the 64 might be totally wrong.
Look at my review on this laptop....
It is for model B
I think all I did was put the model number in and find the remote that looked like the one I had turned out to be the right one. If you are sure if it will work maybe contact the seller to see if they can help out.
Yes
I would not advise it for that at all. It's not that flexible . It's great for adjusting into fixed position and then left alone (e.g. for video conferencing. )
Every android device has a different usb connection, so there are different types of adapters. I have a adapter for Samsung Galaxy, but I prefer use the USB 3.0 Card Reader through laptop
I haven't tried it, but I expect it to be one long scene. Though I don't see why that'd be a problem as you'll be using iMovie to start and stop the recording - so you have control, just not from the camera.
The Vonnic is a small computer that is good at video and audio recording. You provide the hard drive to store the AV. There is a monitor output, and a mouse, and software to 'see' the setup and the cameras both in record and playback. There is even a USB port to take a portable copy of the parts you want to later see on another computer.
Send it back mine didn't work either
i am sorry not sure how to answer this because i have an xp and it is working fine for me
I would not recommend it. The iPhone sits a bit loosely but stays in place while docked vertically. I don't think it will stay put if docked horizontally.
I have had no issues with these batteries and I use them in my D800 as well as D750. I imagine your D7100 will work just fine, providing that camera takes the EN-EL 15 battery/replacement.
it comes wired for 110 standard electrical service. They will provide a EU version for a price.
Hello Tara, I haven't used it in the bathroom. I leave the door a little open and turn on the tunes with the volume up and enjoy my music without getting the humidity into the radio. Good luck and enjoy the sound quality. JohnZ
Hi there, I got the retina display pro15 and the case fits really good.
It should work for anything with a micro four thirds mount, so yes.
yes built in
110 is 110 no problem except this film is not very good--look for a german film etec as 110 format is still very popular in europe
Yes. The connectors are male on both ends so that you can connect either end to the HDMI sockets on TVs.
Bud I am not sure. I have it running from a blue ray player to an LCD tv. I run netflix and internet features through it from the blueray device if any of that information helps.
Yes, this replaces the perimeter foam around the speaker cone. I removed all of the cracked and brittle foam and then put them on my 4410's and they sound great. Be careful with the glue, also look on youtube for walkthroughs. I did it in probably about an hour's time and I'm happy with the results.
no, you have to purchase the glasses separately.
no. I believe all you can set is "large" or "small" speakers.
I don't see why not. It read and burned a CD just fine for me under Windows XP thru Mac OS bootcamp. Didn't even need to install any drivers although a disc is included. I bought mine for XV barely used if at all.
Yes, I used it to install MS Office on my son's laptop.
The system requirements are as listed for OSX. OSX version 10.5.4 or higher is needed. This drive will not likely be supported by Apple devices during the boot process. Such as installing an OS.
I could never get the radio to work at all!
Per the children in the house......lick and stick. I, myself would use something else to get it moistened. They said works well on flat surfaces. It will only stick on wall for a short time and fall. Do not remove the black pad!!!
yes you can. there is supposed to be a cord it hooks into the little hole that looks like an old phone charger it hooks into the hole than it has a little head phone jack on it then you just turn on the music on your phone
It is the full verison of windows but not the PRO version of windows. So, it doesn't come with the all of the networking options, such as remote desktop or windows media center.
The USB cable is six feet long
As long as you have a DVD-ROM drive in your PC, then yes, although depending on how much data you have , you might need few of them and software to do the backups
It fits on the Macbook Air 12". It's ever so slightly off. It's negligible because it's barely noticeable. It'ssligtly off on the top edge keys that I rarely use
Supposed to be Gigabit 10/100/1000
After two routers (I thought maybe just the first one was defective), I was unable to stream video while using this router. If you like to watch netflix, I would try a different router.
it has magnetic closure, no strip just screen cover sticking on the body frame.
The body is some form of durable plastic, as are both of my Canons. But I haven't gotten any marks on it yet. Seems very durable.
No, these do not include a clip. That being said, I have owned these for about three months and I'm incredibly happy with them.
Kinda prefer hard drive docking stations actually. Especially ones straight up and down. Easier on the motor. One I'm using is Vantec e-sata in white. Think it only goes to 3TB so when I go to 4 TB I gotta look for a new one. I mostly prefer it because I can stick a 3-4 inch mini fan behind it if it gets too warm. And cases don't do much for heat dissipation even the ones that are supposed to. Only one that did they don't make anymore :(
No.
around 3 lbs. Just weighted it
No it will not work. You have 2 options for faux either install aftermarket radio which I did or order the AUX from this website http://www.xcarlink.co.uk/home.php
The harness is not included. If your connector on the back of the radio is a one piece connector that does not split into 3 parts, you will need a harness like the PIE AA3-HAR. There is a video that discusses this at http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=-HSOc7vAnOI
Look at vhd mh2a think it will be what u need
That's a somewhat unusual speaker impedance. Your best bet is to consult the speaker manufacturer for their recommendation. However, you should be fine with 14 AWG for a run of up to 50'. 12 AWG gets rather expensive.
Yes, less than 50' go with 16 gauge, greater than 50' go with 14 gauge
It will but I doubt you need 14 awg unless you are running the wire great distances, like over 100 feet.
C&E 100 Feet 14AWG Enhanced is for external use only and not CL2 rated it's no good for in walls. C&E makes a good CL2 rated in wall Speaker wire. http://www.amazon.com/14AWG-2-Conductor-Speaker-In-Wall-Installation/dp/B009EADB08/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1420676586&sr=8-1&keywords=cl2+speaker+wire. I used this speaker wire up and around for my rear speakers and it's 100% copper not plated like some wires they are selling.
I unfortunately can't answer your question, but I would like to know if you ended up buying these (or the XL version), as I just bought the Fidelio X1 myself...
The manufacturer lists the dimensions as 7.5 x 7.2 x 4 inches, measuring my case I'd say these are the outside dimensions.
Yes. Both lenses are image stabilized.
It's fairly small. Great for an amateur or as a travel tripod. Not very sturdy or stable enough for astrophotography. I already broke mine. Get at least a a Targus or Manfrotto for anything more professional.
Yes, this memory works fine with MBP 2011 (early or late)
Yes. I ordered my 27" iMac in Dec12, and the added memory works fine with it.
Yes
I do not believe there is a limit to activities, only devices (15). You can download the user manual from myharmony.com, it will tell you just about everything you need to know.
Al, sorry for the delay - I did some testing and they disappear when you speed up or slow the movie down.
There are a lot of things that can affect the speed. I use WD red drives which are relatively "slow" drives, but I use my Synology units for disk imaging and not just direct file storage, speed is less important than reliability. Using this system in a true RAID fashion will also be slower than simply using the individual drives as storage locations.
Of course! The NAS works with both Windows and OSX based systems, and you can setup afp or smb connections to it. I use a part of the drive to store my Time Machine backup.
depends on the amount of cameras/sound you have going in...i currently have no sound and 4 cameras and my system holds two weeks worth of data
it should but be carefull some t.v.s wont its a 50/50 chance when buying these remotes i usually go by the #on the remotes
Yes
Mine came with a stand in the box. I don't know if you can buy a replacement. Here is the form to request a part on their website: http://westinghouseelectronics.com/support/partsreq/ Ebay has one right now for $60. Search for westinghouse uw40t2bw stand.
No it is not
No
I don't know, but one word of warning. It doesn't have a keyboard.
Yes!!!!
Sure does but now my blue ray burned out from a power surge.
I dont believe so , i just went to check it doesnt say i apologize
It is reusable and it comes in a resealable bag. You cannot clean it. It is reusable until it is filled with dirt or dust and loses its stickiness.
The case has a standard size (for the portable action cameras) screw hole... so, if you have a mount like that, yes.. mine did not come with any mounts, but I ordered a few other brands at the same time, and have used their mounts for this... haven't used any of them as helmet cams yet though.
Never worked and returned it.
Internal battery, usb charging cord
Yes. It will work in D270 1694
Put it out of the window.
The LED light is green. The front face is black. no sure what you are asking.
IDE is a parallel or PATA interface. SATA is a serial interface. So, it won't work directly, but you can get a serial to parallel interface cable to do the conversion.
Yes, it have an ethernet port. you can connect it to Internet and download free applications and actualizations from ubuntu "repositories"
A 32 bit OS will only support up to 4GB of RAM but a 64 bit OS will support up to 512GB with Windows 8 professional. Most modern computers use a 64 bit OS. This motherboard works fine with either.
Elio, yes this motherboard is compatible with that mid tower case. the motherboard's size is ATX and that tower supports both ATX and micro ATX.
Yes, but they're not good. That is, not very loud. Better off getting a cheap pair of speakers anyways.
Yes, you can set the monitor to wake up the computer from "normal" sleep,not "hybrid sleep". It will not wake up from Hibernate.
Glossy, but not excessively so.
i7-3630QM, no doubt
There is a camera on the computer. You can probably find software that records videos, but I have never done it.
Yes it can.
Yes. They have a separate "data" partition that I just formatted and installed ubuntu on. All the components (wifi, eth, touchpad, sound) seems to be working for me. The touch screen works as well, though I don't have much use for it. I didn't use it on Win8 either.
Yes, but you need to download at the window 8 store
I haven't tried PowerPoint but it should work. Hand writing in OneNote is fantastic even if you're handwriting is not very good. It converts to typewritten letters perfectly and you can format just like you're in Word. This functionality has been the envy of my iPad using friends, although I tell them OneNote app is available for iPad, but I'm not sure if it works as well on that platform.
Yes. There is an audio jack.
Yes, on the actual stereo and on the remote. But the volume can also be toggled on your device paired with the stereo.
this is for E14 based screw bulb.
Yes. There is a dimmer switch on the cord. I have four of these lights. I love using them and they come in handy a lot. I will recommend if you order them to get extension cords.
Battery pack.
I'm not sure there is any way to effectively block out airplane engine noise as those engines vibrate everything and those vibrations are felt as much as heard. But I can tell you for certain that it's really effective at blocking out my 5 year old son's video gaming and my wife's requests for me to paint things or pick heavy things up to move them a few inches to the left... then to the right... then put them back down where they were to begin with.
Yes
There's only one port. I doubt that you can connect 2 even with additional cables
yes, it'll work
According to the specs, the QC-804 can record 1080p 30 fps for each channel simultaneously. Google "qc804 manual" and it's the 1st result: specs are on page 79. Sidenote: if you step up to the QC-808, that frame rate drops to 15 fps.
The F1 has six quarter inch receivers, I would thick it would. I can't say for sure because I do not own a ball head. I currently have a Manfrotto Bogen Pan head mount tripod.
No, it does not. You would need an adaptor to do so. You can get that here: Apple Lightning to 30-Pin Adapter http://amzn.com/B009A5EIWC
No, there is no cd drive on the unit
ES File explorer will allow you to access network drives and then stream files. It will also connect via FTP to "cloud" drives.
If it's a wireless keyboard it will work, but probably not if it snaps into the iPad
Yes, it's am3+ compatible, but this mobo won't perform as good as a true am3+ mobo. This is just an old am3 mobo with an updated bios so that it can run am3+ What I recommend you is to buy a truly am3+, non 760g
Question. Not statement, as it is completely useless when you type one word and do not actually ask a question or clarification. If you are wondering if this motherboard uses memory, the answer is yes. If you meant something else, you may want to be specific.
Don't think its too far. Maybe 30 to 50 feet in an open space. Never tried distance since I mostly use it in my car or in just one room. Its well built. Better wimax reception than any freedompop compatible phones. Starts up and connects in about 1 min.
This particular modem from FreedomPop is 4G only. You'll want to get one of their other hotspots that has both 4G and 3G capability as an alternative.
There are more listed on the Internet (Google). I have another one, too, called Clear C.
The mobile hotspot device allows devices to connect to it through wifi. This stick device connects to one device thru usb.
I bought mine for a 3rd gen iPad. It works great. Sorry, I don't own a Kindle, just 3 iPads.
No, It keeps popping out.
I' really not sure what you are asking here. If you look at the listing you can see that the input connector is in the middle of the side with three connectors. The other four connectors are -7.0DB outputs. I have not actually used the item yet, but I have other Extreme brand splitters that work well.
Nof that I am aware of. The housing is solid. Just returned from a backpacking trip to Thailand. The housing held up without a hitch and is very easy to operate underwated. Usually housing this nice are much more expensive. Very highly recommended!
about 200 shots out of a fully charged battery
Hey there! This one will not fit the s200. You may want to go for the wp dc600. Here's a link:http://www.amazon.com/Canon-WP-DC600-Waterproof-Digital-Camera/dp/B00006NSRW
I just came back from a week live aboard in Palau, 5 dives a day. No problems, great pics. About 100 feet was deepest dive, case is rated to 130 feet
No, the rating needed is IP66 or IP67. this is industry protection specifications. this camera is not rated for it.
Use Cat5 Patch cable or similar wire just cut off the connectors and use two wires out of the 5 or 6 to connect the plus and minus connections between the dvr and the camera.
"11.5 x 14 inches" says the description but my lot is 12" x 14.5"
Yes. A cable and software are supplied.
You need to buy this item: http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Vengeance-Laptop-Memory-CMSX16GX3M2A1600C10/dp/B0076W9Q5A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1356547572&sr=8-1&keywords=corsair+vengeance+sodim and then install in the laptop replacing the memory modules for these.
For a look at the spec, here is a good link, but it is the slightly older model, with the larger screen and this link does NOT have the same processor (it is an AM18XR2), but it gives you a good idea of overall specs for what is basically the same machine: http://i.walmart.com/i/rb/0088411608402.pdf
Yes, it has a Chiclet keyboard, completely backlit. The graphics card available are NVIDIA GeForce GT 630M with 1GB GDDR5 VRAM NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM
Yes you can do it
i am wondering also, someone please advise.
15 inch screen
yes its warranty is international in fact ive bought a second laptop for my daughter in USA if your planning a trip its costs a lot less there on amazon i got it for 28000 rs paid in inr delivered in potomac washington dc
I noticed it was a little hidden. It is on the very side of the box, in another little side compartment.
I don't know, but it's not a very high-end PC. I'm a writer (use words not pix) and I find its performance close to unacceptably slow. I really wish I'd gone higher end and also not gone w/ Dell. Their products and service aren't what they used to be in my opinion. In fact I've decided never to buy another Dell PC. Hope this helps!
Perhaps it is somewhere in the documentation that came with the PC in the box? Try looking there.
hello my friend, i dont know, my keyboard is yamaha psr-550 and funtion is wonderfull, sorry i speak spanish, i hope help, salutation
In accord with Newegg.com, this product has a NVIDIA GeForce GT 630M, with 1gb. But I am not shure. I already called to Amazon Support and they were not able to inform this.
1366 x 768
No it won't work ... iPhone 5 works only with Apple TV .
Yes it uses hot swap drives. No you can't use non hot swap drives without causing some issues.
Will connect to Bluetooth but sound quality on opposite end not so good.
Only the stand for the back drop can fit in that case, maybe one or two of the muslins if you roll them up but nothing else
You can change tracks with the sports model by double pressing the large button on the control box, triple pressing skips to previous track if the current track has just started, and to the beginning of the currently playing track if one is about 30 seconds in.
It been working perfectly with my CP-900 for a year and the CP-910 uses the same battery, so I don't see any problem.
Hi! Sorry, this went to my junk file :( I LOVE this speaker!!! It charges up quickly and the speaker works really really well. I charged it in the sun a few days ago and it still has a full charge. It plays inside, in the dark, anywhere as long as it has a charge. There is a small light that is blue when there is a charge and red when it needs a re-charge. You can't go wrong with this thing :)
I upgraded the memory to 8 gb. It was not easy. I had to practically take the whole laptop apart. Took about 2 hours. Then again, I am not an IT guy. If you know someone who knows what they are doing, should be easy. Just make sure to get memory specific to this specific HP envy.
Laptop screen too bright and have Little Screen and no CD or DVD that's why i don't like this laptop
The universal design of the mounting brackets in my opinion will hold just about any tv. As far as the weight goes, you could mount a tank to your wall with this unit. It is VERY heavy duty and in most cases I would say it's heavier than even the Max size tv you can mount. Very good unit.
I have a 51in Samsung. I think it's universal
The tv mount in question has scissor arms and not a elbow type arm. The tv mount won't move side to side very much. Now, this is a real strong tv mount and is built really well. The hardware that comes with it is on the cheap side. I would recommend running some 2x4's or something across the studs and mount it to that. Also, you could cut the Sheetrock out and add some support to the studs. Hope this helps.
No, it does not. There are helmet and hat attachments, but no ear attachments.
I personally couldn't get it to work all the time and that's standing right next to it. It also gets so hot it may burn your skin if its next to your face. I had it on a cap very hot. I returned it and purchased a go-pro its been a great little product.
We got ours from walmart for only 26.99. I would try going there instead of paying the outlandish prices listed here.
No, I haven't resorted to cutting out the cut-outs to get the power and volume buttons to work. But I can see how that could be the problem if the manufacturers were sloppy in making the case.
No just leave it on..close ur case done..open ur case n it turns bck on...
It has a magnetic closer
Yes, all impossible project film for sx70 cameras still have the battery within the film pack.
So Lisa your Kindle is slipped in tightly in the case, correct? Then you have the Kindle turned on? If your answers are yes then you should have a nice snug fit when you close case. OK now open an your Kindle should wake up. Hope this helps.
Yes, it has a build in rechargeable battery with USB connection if you don't have a computer there are chargers available.
very hard to find. I ended up giving all three I bought to goodwill.
Yes, because it fits an iPhone 5S with an Otterbox. Only in landscape (horizontal) though, the GripTight does not expand enough for portrait orientation.
Have used it for mostly video and the charge would last several days. Didn't have any problems with battery.
Oh no I was talking about the soft case which supposed to fit like a glove but rather kinda like a five year-old borrowed a shirt from his grand dad!
This particular mouse isn't wireless, however ThermalTake does have a wireless version of the level 10. Look at a review of the wireless one on youtube, there should be a video that would answer your question.
The Monoprice pen has a plastic nib. It is not a stylus. If your tablet uses a plastic nib pen, the Monoprice may work okay.
Yes, but Mac books have their sata cables built in with the power. Not sure where you plan on putting the hard drive, unless you are swapping, and at that point you wouldn't need a new cable.
Yes
One will handle a pair
I'm pretty sure it doesn't accept wire that thick. I had to reduce the wire to a thinner size.
Yes, I have done that.
Yes
This drive can be partitioned, no problem. However it is recommended by Apple that you do not use a partitioned hard drive for time machine.
Are you asking if a Canon dslr camera will fit in this bag? I have a Canon Rebel T3 camera and 2 extra lenses that all fit in ok. My bag looks the same and I like much better than the more traditional bags.
I assume it's a combined modem/router bought or rented from your ISP. The easiest workaround would be to buy a second wireless router, plug it into a line on the ISP router. You can then setup a wireless network using "your" router.
The seller means wireless LAN...you still need to plug the provided power supply into the wall.
I was only able to get the max resolution, via a display port cable. I have tried 2 different dual link dvi cables, but they never went above 1920x1080.
I use with a macbook air and it works great.....
Very good viewing angle. I used two as dual screen for gaming and App developer.
Nope, sorry.
Yes
I was unable to use the converter in recessed outlets. Same would be true in kenya
It is a glossy glass surface, but it's reflectivity would depend upon the ambient light in the room.
You should contact Amazon. Dell didn't sell the product they manufactured it in this case.
It can be done but it will void your warranty and is a very delicate operation. It requires removing the front screen and carefully popping out the motherboard.
No word of wacom or stylus, apparently it's a 10 point multi touch ips display, not pressure sensitive.
No built-in drive. Very common for ultra books
The warranty was only US. You have to send the computer to the repair shop and they send it back to your US address. You have also to pay (FedEx, etc.) for delivering to the repair shop in Texas. Hope, it clarifies.
The basic difference in them is the telescopic once give you the same color light on high and low beam the non telescopic the low beam is the same color as a normal headlight
Yes, it fits mine, it is just a bit tight
yes. need modem 3g
Hi, actually don't know as since I only used it with huawei D32W / E-Mobile...sorry...
Yes this has 4 ports of RJ45,and this is support for GSM/GPRS/EDGE 850/900/1800/1900MHz and yes this has a sim slot, buy with us we will ship out by usps express mail thank u.. lahiru
yes, underneath the unit
When look in my computer's info it sees it as the GTX 650 so I'd say its the 2GB video card not the 1GB (Well that's what my computer says Any way)
Hi Paul, yes you can hook up 2 monitors.
Hi Allen, you sure can. We sell 120GB up 1TB SSD.
Hi Michael, this computer has 1 PCI Express x16 Slot.
I bought the MSI GE60 and it does have an ethernet port
Yes
Yes it has an HDMI and a VGA port
I've played World of Warcraft, Star Wars the Old Republic, Diablo III all at their highest video settings.
I think it is very good after you get your settings adjusted. The settings from the factory need to be tweaked.
The warranty is one year. I purchased at Costco which doubled the warranty to two years.
Yes, the material is very thin and the lid closes without any problems. Also it's a very comfortable typing experience with it on.
You cannot Bluetooth is not supported on this device. Between that and close to a 40% failure rate I'd find something else. The RPL Warranty is only good for 2 weeks! after that you have to pay 50% and shipping for both units, When my 1st one failed, I simply Parted it out. it wasn't worth the money But it was my Daughters Christmas present so I just bought her a new one. so far this one works, but is so limited it is little more than a toy, or memo pad with limited internet.....
Mine have not cracked or broken. If you intentionally tried to break them you could probably do it. I've bent them and they have never cracked.
Have you tried it? Kindle says it can use USB keyboard. I tried it with Polaroid and Nexus 7 and it worked fine. It comes with 2USB adapters.
Yes it will I hooked one up to mine. I bought an infrared camera and instalation was a breeze.
Yes, this tablet uses wi-fi and you can download apps from play store using it's wi-fi as long as you have internet access. (I apologize if that comes off as being arrogant--but not everyone is tech savvy even this day)
No. you cannot plug your cable directly into this. if you have a cable box with an HDMI output you can plug that into this unit to send to your TV. I believe the two input types are HDMI and VGA.
Unfortunately, there is only one CPU fan and one case fan connector. If you need additional case fans, you will need a molex fan adapter.
It records all video or just motion. Your choice. When recording all video it will make the motion detected parts turn red in the timeline. The normal video timeline is green. Red equals "alarm" (motion) in the timeline.
Hello William, The instructions to setup the date and time can be found on page 29 of the manual. Please see the link to the manual here: http://qsee.custhelp.com/ci/fattach/get/111581/1359762014/redirect/1/filename/QS%20Manual%20v3_web.pdf
Hello Cole, How much video you can store on your DVR's hard drive depends on several factors. Please follow this link to determine how many days of footage you can get based on your resolution settings: http://qsee.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/14/kw/how%20long%20will%20my%20dvr%20record%3F
sorry, I was asked to comment on my purchase... I just purchased the DVR by itself, not the kit. The Camera kit says it includes 60ft cables for the cameras
If your Xfinity box has HDMI, then you can hook it up, but this unit doesn't have speakers. you would have to hook up speakers to the headphone jack, or connect the cable box up to some sort of sound system.
The output of 3 volt can be done but I am not sure about 12V I would need to do a test. Will keep you posted.
Sorry, I don't do games.
If the CPU uses the FM2+ socket-type, it won't fit in an FM2 socket because it has additional pins. FM2 CPUs will fit in both sockets. More here - http://www.tomshardware.com/news/Kaveri-AMD-FM2-FM2b-Socket,22949.html
Only supports A series FM2 socket Processors with integrated graphics.
This board is limited to the FM2 socket, which is the AMD "A" Series. That said the AMD A series has many excellent APU's available for a very reasonable price. The A-10 6800 is a super bargain for the price. It is very fast and the on-board APU graphics are very good. This board does allow a graphics card if your prefer. I do strongly suggest not less than 8 gig RAM, though I personally use 16 gig.
Yes, any normal ddr3 will work. ECC memory is for servers.
yep, I've used PNY with this MB with no problem...
Has not seemed at all fragile!
No
Yes but it is not a fast gamer. More for "On the go computing", due to small size and light weight. If Gaming is your thing, you will be disappointed. It is a great business box though.
Yes you absolutely can. i have 2- 4tb seagate go flex drives sitting on these and daisy chained together into a thunderbolt port on a iMac. they can also be used in the same mannor on usb 2.0/3.0 they work great
I am listening to these headphones right now on my Lenovo. The button however does nothing in the computer and my computer has a separate jack for Headphones and Mic so the mic isnt working the way it does with my phone.
Color
Yes it should fit. I have the IPad with retina display and I also have a keyboard that goes with it and they both fit in the case.
The mouse works on Windows 8. My son says the lights aren't too bright.
Sorry i don't know as i use the mouse with my Dell Laptop
Yes I'm actually currently using two of these for dual displays on my computer now.
Please provide the model number of your Vizio TV.
Yes, we can make videos too
There is no additional lens package with this set.
This camera is the best ever canon in its class I have ever had. Easy to handle, very high quality pictures, I've even shot the moon pictures, very interesting. worth the money.
It is made in Japan
yes
5 to 6 inches
Beach is a respected supplier. However, to be certain look them up on line, get their phone number, call them up and ask if the Canon factory warranty is included. Generally, Amazon does not deal with gray market companies, but it is always good to check in advance.
Yes, It supports
Yes, you can record a show on one channel and watch another show on another channel. Or you can record a show on one channel and "chase" it, i.e. come home when you've recorded the first half of the show and start watching at the beginning. Or you can watch an already recorded show while recording a show. --Lee Gold
No. All audio inputs are RCA cables.
yes
since it is a really good computer, it would be great to have a really good OS. unfortunately, it is not offered for sale (anywhere) with Windows 7 & Windows 8 is a POS. DO NOT BUY THIS h8-1430. Shop around for a computer with Win 7, & configure it the best you can.
It ships with Microsoft Windows 8 (64-bit) - so, yes.
No blu-ray player
I'm not sure how it would be with that particular program but I do know that it works really well for movies, video and gaming. My son and I play minecraft and skyrim on it all the time and have no lag or filching problems. I hope this can help a bit.

It doesn't include a monitor, and no, there isn't an HDMI port. it comes with a wireless keyboard and mouse.
No, it does not come with a monitor, but it does come with a basic keyboard and mouse. Most desksides I see are unbundled from monitors because there are so many factors in what is the right monitor for a particular buyer -- size, color reproduction,... -- that any given choice would be inappropriate for many of the potential customers.
Yes it has HDMI,VGA and the other one I think is DVI for a second screen. Hope that helps.
When the amp is installed to your stock system, use your system as normal. The MP3 option can be used without a receiver.
led has richer color
There is no lock and no double zipper. Just a regular zipper with a little dangle piece.
are you talking about the keyboard that fits on the mini ipad? I have the mini ipad AND the logitech keyboard. I keep the two pieces together and it fits in well with the case. At first it was a bit snug when zipping but now after a couple of months it zips right up with no problems at all. the zipper has not scratched the ipad or the keyboard at all. I only use the case when I put it in my purse.
Don't know I have a 06 Murano and it did not fut
not sure. did not fit in my 2010 Nissan Pathfinder. To return it I had to send it to China!I would not recommend buying this item just do two if it doesn't fit all the costs involved in shipping it back. Hope this helps you
I think so only because it's the glasses that make the screen 3D but your projector has to be able to play 3D also
Yes it does
That actually varies a lot on the output of the phone. On my HTC One I can't get any louder than 75% without it being deafening, because they are REALLY loud. On my Macbook I can't exceed 50% because it's even louder. Overall, volume should not be an issue as these are very loud headphones.
The cups are rather large. If by chance they are not large enough the padding is very comfortable. My ears have piercings and guaged ..these fit very nicely over them.
I've got a MSI 970A-G46 ATX AM3+ motherboard in mine.
I think it is compatible with IOS
It's not Bluetooth enabled the cord can be changed if it gets damaged
Yes they will. I haven't installed them in your model car but I have a friend that has. So you should be ok. Best bet will be to check online just to make sure.
Yes
Yes
I have not used Wavepad very much but with Recording Device set to What-U-Hear I was always able to record an mp3 from my hard drive's music library playing through RealPlayer. Tools &gt; Options... &gt; Recording &gt; Recording Device &gt; Device: What-U-hear (Sound Blaster Z)
Yes, that was what I got. These are great speakers!
They can be hooked up to anything that outputs via standard 2-strand speaker wire (+/-) - if your TV has those sorts of outputs, or you're planning on driving them with some sort of amp then, yes.
An oil well, but looks (and feels) pretty real.
No Can't even get the support from d-link to add it to their mud link service
The only way that you can use the the DAC is through a digital coaxial cable or optical. If you hook it to your comuter using red and white analog the DAC will not be used. If you have a CD player with a dock or USB connection hooked with a digital coaxial or optical to the 9050 then that would work... the p3000r's 32 bit burrbbrown DAC sound significantly better and it has a USB input.... too bad its super pricey
I don't believe so... I think the Macbook Pros only have SD card readers. This is a CF card, much larger. You can look this up online fairly easily. But I recommend the USB 3.0 Kingson reader. It's worked great for me.
I bought 2 of the Dell 24" ST2421L monitor for $179/each with reasonable resolution, but the graphics card can handle higher resolution monitors. You can connect 1 monitor via the included VGA 15pin cable and VGA/DVI-D adapter. You will need a separate DVI-D M-M cable for the 2nd monitor. I went cheap and bought a 4' length for $10, but highly recommend 6' or longer especially if you route it to your HDTV big screen TV.
No. Mine works fine.
I do not know. I'm sorry.
300W If you upgrade the video card, be sure to change the power supply too!
The whole stand is not reclining, but you can tilt the lcd.
Yes
yes
No, the K-5 iis uses the same battery as the K-7 and K-5, not the K10D, K20D battery.
All you need is a Sirius radio compatible with this dock...The kit has everything to connect..
Yes
Yes, I set the volume knob half way on the powered speaker, then I can safely turn the volume up or down on my computer 8.1
Hello, This product is a Japanese model. However, it is possible to switch the language to English. It is selling well all over the world, but everyone is able to use it without a problem. Manuals and Package are written in Japanese. I hope this information will be helpful. We hope that we can be of service to you in the future. Thank you very much. J-Made
Nope. Sorry. But don't let that change your mind, this is a really good laptop.
Thank you for your question. It is added to the playlist you want to put when you press and hold the album title or song you want to hear. It is very easy.
I don't know as I never did it. If I were you, I would call acer and ask them. Sorry I couldn't help. Good luck!
Sorry, I don't watch movies on my Lap Top.
I have this computer and it can pretty much play anything you want, I haven't found a game yet that it can't run smoothly, hope this helps.
Recovery disks from a company (dell, hp, etc.) usually don't work on generic systems.
The heatsink would fit the CPU, so since this is an LGA-775, you need an LGA-775 CPU heatsink, as for the chassis, I have no idea.
Sorry but no. I do not carry RAM or processors for resale.
I'm assuming your are referring to the onboard RAM, when you say DDR2. The RAM, such as DDR2, is unimportant in this instance. What you need to find out is if your motherboard has a PCI Express (PCIe)slot. This card requires a PCIe slot of x4 or higher in order to work. Majority of all new main board will have PCIe slots, however, some older boards that used DDR2 ram, still used the older AGP graphics slot which is incompatible with PCIe. Please refer to you motherboard or computer manufacturers specifications or manual to be sure.
Yes it is backwards compatable ,but may loss a little speed
Yes.
8.5x4.5x1.5 inches roughly
It overwrites old video - if need be, copy files to your computer. As far as iPhone, sorry but I have never tried it
At the lowest quality (32 kbps) it's about 17 hours for the 2 GB internal memory but you can add SD's.
The unit ships with a hex wrench to unscrew four screws on bottom. Whole install took less than five minutes.
Im sure it is a RF controller if you look under the product description I believe it tells that it is controlled by RF (radio frequency) hope I was able to help.
It is suitable for any mac display port to VGA
It's when u first put in as new game and it needs to install, that's game data. It's at the top under the game category in the xmb menu. Some save and transfer, but some don't.
No
It's about 7 -8 feet. I have an 18 Foot Tracker, with the screen next to the console. The Transducer is mounted at the base of the stern. Hope this helps.
This fits the Samsung Galaxy Not 10.1 N8013 perfectly. I had purchased the tablet for my husband for christmas and also the Sleek Impact-Resistant Protective Silicone Cover. He really loves the tablet and was very pleased with the cover. I highly recommend.
I would recommend contacting Kanex directly. I do not believe the unit will support ARC. Here is the number (888) 975-1368
No
If you do a lot of typing, this might not be the best keyboard. I do a lot of typing, but it is intermittent. I just don't sit there and type for hours at a time. If you like this style, Sculpt does have a slightly bigger model with a few extra accessory keys that might provide more conveyance as well as comfort.
I bought this for my wife to use with her iPad 2. It works great, I was even able to get it to pair with my iphone 4.
It's useless and just opens MSN, I think they made it opens Skype in windows 8.
Yes
I don't think so
This drive goes with a lot of sony laptops just google this specific drive and it's will say which it's compatible with that what I did and it works great better than my original.
Yes It works, at least in my laptop is still working normally around 8 months so far!
dont know, i haven't tried yet been so busy, i was hopeing to get lucky that the old OS would come back. It didn't
Don't get this one. The one they sent was a dud and I got my money back.
It comes with several different sized ear pieces. After a bit of experimenting I found the one that fit best and it stays in pretty well. I don't think they would stay in during exercise but walking is fine. Just used them on a long haul flight to Asia and they were comfortable the whole time. Ear size might make a big difference so YMMV.
Yes, it will work on the HP dv3; no you do not need the drive caddy kit. You just re-use the one your existing hard drive is screwed in to. And make sure to disconnect the pins connector from the old one and put on the replacement.
Most likely. If it is a different size than original, then the original software seems not to work and you need to do a generic windows install. For me that required finding an old Win ME disk, then upgrading to XP then upgrading to Win7. Ugh. But in the end it all worked out and back up and running.
Yes you can
If you mean the lens, it's 6mm fixed.
I did it a couple years ago so my memory is foggy, but do recall being stumped for a while and then suddenly discovering the solution. I think you have to take off the guard first. Here's a diagram that will help you see how it comes apart: http://www.ereplacementparts.com/black-and-decker-gh1000-type-string-trimmer-parts-c-4167_9518_183331.html
Dual line
Yes, we have it in stock now Jongoh. Thank you.
I don't know, because I threw it away about 2 weeks after using it. It quit working.
I never put it in a docking station so I'm not sure, I would assume that you would.
NO
Idk but it's thick as hell. So thick it's a pain to bend the cable.
If it says SSC it is an SSC card.
Yes this is true
Yes
I don't know , the outside diameter seems to fit my 2 wire at&t (PACE) u-verse box yet the center pin is mush smaller on the uverse box and will not make a reliable connection. Check the specs and if pin diameter and outside diameter matches up you should be good
Yes it will. I have an Asus G72GX and I upgraded to this CPU also and saw a modest boost in performance.
99% it must workt,you have installed T6400 cpu,I had T6600,yours cpu has lower speed-2.0 ghz,that's only one difference ,so go ahead with T9600.
Yes, you can use it in flight, the NC feature completely blocks the engines noise, you won't hear the flight attendants notices too. Also, they won't let you use it during take off or landing, but it's a great gadget for traveling without the hassle of cables. I hope it helps. John
Yes it does, it has a low battery alarm beeping continuously about 5 minutes before shut down to let you switch to usb power. Plugging the usb charging cable resets the headphones, but once turned on again it works and charges at the same time. I hope it helps, please read my full commentary at customer reviews. John
2 AA batteries required
Make sure you have the latest bluetooth drivers and bluetooth stack (4.0) from the HP website.
Yes they do
No, the Tiamat 2.2's do not come with a case.
Yes it will work if you pair it to your laptop via bluetooth. Once the call is initiated you can walk as far as your connection will allow.
Yes, it has a QAM tuner for unscrambled cable channels, as described in FAQ #5 and subsequent duscussion here (copy link text and paste in your browser's address window): http://www.avsforum.com/t/940657/magnavox-537-535-533-515-513-2160a-2160-2080-philips-3576-3575/120#post_12470932
It does. Push DVD button and let it load or push play.
I am using it on a USB 2.0 but I have also used it on USB 2.0
Yes, I am running Mavericks (OS X 10.9 per my About This Mac). it runs fine without a driver update. It actually seems to run better under Mavericks and the new Safari than before.
it's only a converter and does not contain a graphics card - your pc or mac will need to power it. You can download the drivers if need be from the manufacturer's site.
I have an A10-5800k on mine at home and at work. I am very happy with them. If I was buying them today I might go with the A10-6800k, but I have no experience or have I done any research on that so I can't say it would be better.
Yes
I don't think so. I believe the keyboard is slightly different. If there is a small spacer between the ESC key and the ? key, it won't fit.
16 1/2" x 56"
because the hdmi ports have metal prongs on both side and the more you use it the more wore out it gets eventually making it poor and hard to use properly
60 days
Will not work if your CR-V has the stereo with the multi disc CD player. I reported this to the seller when I returned mine for that reason. Looks like they did not change the listing though. The similar item that is listed for my 2006 Civic works great.
Yes it will
No. You want the hon/aux dmx v.2x
I don't have the adapter, but there is nothing blocking the port so I think it would fit.
the case weighs 9 oz. (255g)
No, the ad is misleading. I bought it for the same reason and was really disappointed.
It slides into a plastic frame. We had no problem with them coming loose...even with little boys carrying them around. Sorry for the edit...I was thinking about my Dad's HD+ case (no keyboard.) The Nook does sit very securely in this bluetooth case.
Yes. This keyboard is designed to work with any Nook HD whether it's stock or rooted.
The red light stays on the entire time it's charging. It turns off when it's done. I had an issue where it wasn't charging and the red light would go on and off, but that ended up being my usb port.
I'm pretty sure it's not dual voltage but the charger it Takes is what most cell phones take.
From what I could tell it is a matter of one version having 2GB of dedicated video RAM (B040K), and the other having 1GB of dedicated vRAM as well as "WiDi" wireless display technology (B022K).
It's windows 8, I just got mine last week and have updated to windows 8.1
Of course! It's like your computer that you don't need the lights on. You can set up the brightness. It's very good tablet for a good price.
This tablet was the biggest piece of crap I ever purchased on here. Literally all three that ie bought have died or broken in the first three months. I finally bought a kindle because this thing was not user friendly at all. I never evern could put any email accts in them and could only use the apps on it that were already there.
I would assume so but it would do it poorly. I haven't done it myself so I don't have an exact answer. Depends on the game and how graphics intensive it is
Yup! I have mine on a PCI-e 2.0 (x16) and have no problems what so ever. As long as it gets the juice, you'll be just fine.
Did you install the drivers for the DVI output? Pretty sure that the board only comes with native drivers for VGA.
The GV-N65TOC-1G is marginally faster though I would suspect that they would perform similarly. In Crysis you would see about a 5 frame drop on the '650 Ti' vs the '650 Ti OC'.
According to my digital kitchen scales, the case weighs 3 3/8 ounces empty, and with the paperwhite it weighs 10 5/8 ounces. I hope this helps with your decision.
Yes.
I wouldn't recommend that build for this case. Heat build-up.
Hi Michael, Yes, these are compatible. Also the DG30s are better than the DG20s. The 20s are a slightly bigger lens...which gut feel told me they would be better. But after an A-B comparison, the slightly smaller lens of the 30s disappeared, they were lighter, less flicker and they were more comfortable. I wear prescription glasses, and these fit over, no problem. So another plus for your near-sighted guests!
The glasses come boxed with a drawstring carrying bag and a mini usb to usb charger
I did the same and I returned them back. Mine LC-70LE847U is compatible with AN-3DG30. I found that advice somewhere in intaernet. I bought 3DG30 on Amazon and they do work with my TV
Yes
Bart I am finding nothing with the 527C230 number. Should the "5" be an "S"?
No unfortunately, but decent WiFi adapters pretty cheap. I got a Rosewill one for $20.
About 4 or 5 hours with no issues. I think you can pull of 8.
6.7 inches or 17.1 centimeters. The Asus GTX 670 mini and the Asus GTX 760 mini fit perfectly.
If you are referring to 3D glasses, no they are not included.
There is no Horizontal correction only Vertical.
Don't know, sorry.
Hi Julie, I do not know if it supports 3D mapping. All I know is that I can hook up my IPad or Mac air and do all types of presentations, still or video with the right type of adaptor. This is what I have used it for, other than direct cable entertainment. As long as it gets a computer 1 YPbPr1, or computer 2 YPbPr2, HDMI, Video, or S- Video source/signal it will display. I hope this gives you some insight for your project/work. John
Ups grand is 5 dayes if you need faster dilver cast u more depend on your city but average of 2 dayes is $20 more
Yes
I purchased mine on Nov 19, 2012. Assuming this is still the same model, I can say with confidence that it does. I boot to an SSD using this card.
NO IT DOES NOT HOLD CD BOOKLETS.
Yes. I have used both my iPhone 4 and my iPod in the docking station and they work fine. One thing that could cause trouble is the size of your phone case. My phone case is small and it fits. A large case would need to be removed to use the dock.
As far as I know it's the same system and the only difference is the bundling.
For the most part. I had trouble with installing the Cyberlink software from the drive and ended up copying the install to the local drive to make it work. I can watch DVDs but not bluray discs as the cyperlink software that comes with the device does not support windows 8 and high def at the same time. They want me to upgrade. Not sure if it is worth it.
We normally travel with 2 or 3 devices but we mostly use our iPads for everything. Our rule of thumb is to use 3 gigs for 3 to 5 days. Month long trips we can get by with 10 gigs. Your mileage may vary.
I believe if you go to "settings" and click "language and keyboard", that you can change the language to Spanish or a different language. The Android keyboard should display and use Spanish. I personally, do not use it with any language other than English, so I am not sure how easy it is to work with once you've changed the language setting.
Press slightly down and Push cover towards the back.
Yes, the X Grip have the adapter for use this microphone.
Yes 12v is too much, use only 5v unless you want to replace that surface mount regulator.
17 inches, no rack mounting can be attached, but I have it in a rack just sitting on a racked component.
I don't know. Have you rebooted it? Sometimes if a computer locks up, rebooting will kind of re-set everything.
Very good
It seems like Ebay is the only place to go for this batteries - http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/181197518738?lpid=82
3.8 lbs for laptop weight. 6.3 pounds for shipping weight.
Sorry, i'm not sure .
Windows 8
Yes it does. You can turn it on, half it at half-brightness, or have it completely off. It's really simple to control.
Not sure but I doubt it. The volume stopped working on mine FIVE times. They have replaced these FIVE times. I would choose a different model.
Of course! Any MP3 player with a headphone jack. Bottom line these are great headphones with great sound quality and comfort. Hope you like them!
You should be able to place it back by pushing it hard enough until it clicks. To be clear, are you talking about the SD chip? I don't have any problems with mine so I would suggest you ask a professional if you can't fix it by just hearing the click. It shouldn't be that much of a problem.
Very light, just like 5 pages of paper. The leather is so fragile and peeling off everywhere, I would say it doesn't look like leather at all. Compare to my old IPad 2 leather case which was way better and durable and never see any leather cracks thru the end. Hopefully this product's quality can be improved in the future since it has a nice design though.
It's a shade lighter than burgundy red .
I don't know the answer for sure. But if you compare the dimensions of the iPad mini & new retina display model via the Apple website that will tell you for sure. I don't think the size of the iPad changed with the new retina display- -but I'd check with Apple just to be sure.
Not if you lay it snap side up when closed or do not try to tuck it under when propped open
Yes /it does have a Smart Cover feature -Once you put on - go to settings - and turn on !!
If it has a standard auxiliary plug outlet then yes it will. I'm currently using it on an older stereo system which requires an audio in and out chord " red and yellow ended chords that plug into the back of the stereo system. Still works great and I like the fact that if I'm in a dirty or dusty environment I can still use the phone to play music while it's safely stored in a cleaner area.
5-6 Hours constant streaming iPhone 5 BT 4.0 to Flex BT 3.0, thing is tho, it hasn't died on me yet, cause the phone always dies first...
I've never been in the rain wearing them. As far as sweat, well, they are for runners.
Geez, it's not a regular laptop. It runs on an ARM chip, not Intel. If Quicken makes a Chrome browser extension, you are in luck, but you can't just install stuff like on Windows or OSX. It is essentially a browser. I am buying one, so that is not a putdown. I use my Android tablets more than my computers at home, so I can't wait to give it a go. I bought the 3G model when I read about it, cancelling my wi-fi order.
Hold the "function" key then press F7. This will toggle the mouse pad off and on
Does not come with mouse, works well with wireless.
I don't know what the resolution is, but the play back and the camera are both good quality. I use the camera for Skype and there is seldom pixilation. When I play movies off the net there is no buffering, the only buffering problem occurs when there is a video off yahoo, or msn news.
no.
Yeah this model has a button on the lower right side for HDMI in and out. I hook this thing up to my 42in. Sony Bravia In 1080p
It says max memory is 8 in the specs. That is usually a motherboard limitation.
I have a Sigma 150-500 and your lens looks similar in size and unfortunately it will not hold my 7d, 5d mark II or canon rebel with this lens attached. It will however hold any of my cameras with the 100mm canon lens that I have attached to any of them. Cheers!
Yes you can
Yes it works well for Skype, but has no rear facing camera, so it's only good for face to face video calls.
no. It comes with Android
I loosely wrapped the cables around the arm, making sure they were placed where they wouldn't get bound up in the hinge. That has worked fine so far.
yes
yes you can use this worldwide under the Verizon wireless network only it can be used In Over 200 Countries Including Gsm Networks! I will expidite ship this item to you if you decide to buy Jojo Compre con confianza le da las gracias tener un bendiga y jojo increble da
Well, I had to ask for them after they shipped, was sent later on the first order, second order didnt get them. No cables, no cloth
you can do anything with a "conventional" non trunking(ltr) system ! trunking radios use special logic and switching that are not available on these type of radio yet!
It works with any tablets that that have micro sd port.
Yes, you can use this card to store music, photos or videos. I bought this for my son's Samsung Galaxy 3 . You can use that stick to transfer anything on the old card to your pc, and then copy it onto the new card and install the card into your phone.
Yes
No the SD card must be class 10
Yes
Yes FM2 fully supported
Here is a list of all CPU's compatible with this board. Athlon II x4 750 is listed there too so it should work no problem. http://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/FM2A75%20Pro4-M/index.us.asp?cat=CPU
Leather but not the highest quality. The front lens area is too short to use the accessory self opening lens cap. Not a bad deal .
I'm not sure. I use this case for my Panasonic LX7. I bought this case about a year ago. I put my camera in it right away and I've never taken the camera out. It's an awesome case and I highly recommend it.
The battery is a 500mA Li-Ion battery. The battery is charged automatically when the video camera is connected to your PC via the USB cable. The battery will be fully charged in approximately 5 hours after inserting into the computer.
No, this version is only for Pc
Contrary to popular belief, it's not due to BF4. It is due to Bitcoin/Litecoin mining. Nvidia cards aren't very good for mining, but these cards are known to be very good for mining from what I have heard. Now that mining is on the rise, the price also increased.
I would go with no smaller than 600 watts and at least 80 plus bronze
I think so, but i recommend you to buy sapphire 7970, i its better, i buy this but the otherone is better
Yes, the specifications on the product page state: "Integrated 720p HD webcam".
AMD FX-6300
Yes, I replaced the original p/s with a standard ATX model without problems.
It's ok now I had to get another lenovo twist because an error occurred with the computer and it would start properly. After long term use the hinge is fine after long term use.
yes. i have two both connected via HDMI and sound is crystal clear.
Son mui buenos spiker
It should. I have an Ipad mini with Moko keyboard and they fit fine - snug at first, but great fit after a week or so.
GOOD....
Yup!
YES
The Magnavox records the show as it is broadcast. The HD broadcasts fill out my TV screen. My TV controls whether I watch shows in the different options like Nprmal, Full Screen, Stretch, etc. regardless of if it is off of the Magnavox recording or a live broadcast off of my digital antenna. Hope this helps.
Plays right away. Bought one foru son too and they love it!
Yes, it works with mine.
Yes, it works with mine.
yes
For the iPad 4, maybe but definately not the nano
Yes, it works with mine.
Yes ....on my 7 Pro Windows system
No. Works for the Apple products, not any of the Kindles.
Well, when I first got it, I used it for my 1st generation iPad and it worked fine for about a month. After I did the recent update on the iPad, the charger stopped working. It would start to charge, then it would stop as if the connection was bad. I started using a different after market brand and it worked fine. The seller has offered to send me a replacement and I am expecting it to arrive shortly. I was going to update my review after using the replacement.
No, but it's small enough that you don't need one. A little plastic cling wrap so you don't get wax on the lens or body works great.
NO, SINGLE SPEAKER PRICE.
and cheese
A few choices. 1) If you have a Time Machine backup drive, or another backup, you can restore your user account from that. 2) Copy your data onto an external hard drive BEFORE doing the swap, copy it back after 3) Buy a USB enclosure for 2.5" SATA drives, and install your old internal HD into that after removing it. Then, you can use Migration Assistant to copy your old user info to your newly-installed SSD system (or copy the files back off the old drive manually).
Unit comes with a power cord but does not come with a USB cable. My unit works superbly!
Yes, it will work with NES.
Muriel, I bought this converter to hook up an Atari 2600 to my LED TV. Thats almost a thirty year technology gap, and it works flawlessly! I highly recommend this converter! Tom
It mirrored the other drive exactly. You should only be concerned if the new drive is smaller than the drive you are cloning.
In my testing, 2 minutes of video used 41MB, so a 4GB card would hold ~200 minutes of video.
Yes
It sure does. I'm not positive if the provided software allows migration, but it should.
X000NWDRQZ ISF2000 HD Hyper Speed
This one is five feet. It'll say in the description HD-5, HD-9 is 9 feet and so on.
I could never get mine to work properly, and after 5 weeks of attempting to follow instructions, calling, etc. When I tried to return it, they wouldn't take it, or even replace it since it was past the 30 day period for returns...so I have a nearly 500.00 piece of "equipment" just sitting in the garage now...
Hello Nailton. Yes, Amazon offers overnight shipping! Please let us know if you have any other questions!
Press the center "enter" button and the letter/number screen should pop up
David it comes with a earphone with a mic built in.
Did you ever resolve this? I have just tried to recharge my batteries after long non use - one seems to have fully discharged and unit won't come on. I stated to charge second battery and it too is discharging. I have taken it off charger in case I lose it too. Love to know your outcome.
Yes. Compatible with both. Thank you
2 Yes'
about 50mm or just shy of 2"
no my friend,it coms without door strike...just what is on the picture. Fobs is no registrated on the unit. you have to do that
It should the exhaust on the case has a 120mm fan on it. I don't personally own that water cooler but looking at mine it should fit just fine and work good :)
The solar cells provide a charge to the lithium ion battery in the radio, and should take about 24 hours of direct sunlight exposure for a full charge. How many days that ends up being would depend on how many hours of sun you get per day-
yes. They are about $7 to replace (and can be found on Amazon) but the one included should last for many years. Keep the plastic tab that comes with the battery. You can use it to prolong battery life when you are not using it. Just don't ever crank the power with the tab in place.
Yes, my Windows 8.1 laptop picked it up right away.
It does have a C-media controller, and usb 3 is fully backwards compatible, so any usb 1 or 2 device will work on usb 3 ports.
Just go to their website and answer a couple questions. I got a replacement screen protector because there were bubbles when I tried installing the first set.
I wrote on them with a larger marker, works fine.
I have a 15.6" dell and it fits perfect with a little room to work with.
becareful with that unit ,mine did not work properly , it should fit ,there are metra kit if it don;t , my advise is to get this radio install soon as possible to make sure its working properly , in case you need a refund . Eonon was my option
Yes must be with iOS 6 at least with iPad 2?
Yes, I've checked with couple of reviews of the 610 and its definite yes
It comes pre-applied to the heat sync
This is just a quad-core AMD CPU. No video processor is built into it. You'll need a separate video card.
is the tf 600t outlet the same as the tf700?
There is a VGA, HDNI and DVI port on the back graphics card. We are only driving a 26' monitor, so I don't know if it drive multiple monitors.
Don't know. We ended up returning that computer. They sold us an open box item without disclosing it and it was missing parts.
DDR2 memory requires an AM2 CPU. *DDR3 and DDR2 are supported separately. **DDR3 memory is only supported by installing AM3/AM3+ CPU. ***Due to the operating system limitation, the actual memory size may be less than 4GB for the reservation for system usage under Windows 32-bit OS.

You can put a socket am3 cpu on a socket am3+ motherboard but u cant put a am3+cpu on an am3 socket mb
Probably not. The CPU is really good, but the graphics card will probably need to be upgraded to play SWOR on High. For it's price, it's a good computer to play on Medium.
Yes...this computer can be upgraded.Be careful with video card upgrades,the slot is placed in such a way that in may not be possible to install 2 cards.My computer has three fans,one for the interior,one for the power supply and one for the CPU.If additional fans can be installed,I donot know;but there is an open connector plug.I hope this helps you.
Stock cooler is fine. It's noisy, though. It may also depend on your case set up - you might have less air flow in your case and/or maybe running Crossfire or SLI with 2 hot GPUs. I have since bought a Coolermaster Hyper 212 EVO, which is awesome. I have a Coolermaster HAF Tower, so I have good air flow in my case naturally. In any case, I doubt you'll have over-heating issues with the stock fan and heatsink without overclocking it.
Yes, very well.
There is no warranty but the price and quality is so good, that if you get 6 months of use out of it, you're money ahead. It's really a great product for super cheap! It's almost too good to be true.
Pretty insignificant. Sounds great.
I Agree with previous two answers. I had one unit that failed in minutes, Was sent another. It has worked perfectly for many months.
It doesn't take batteries; it's mains powered only.
It will charge your phone only when it is in certain input modes, such as USB or bluetooth, but not if you are listening to the radio.
No
Yes, we ship with UPS/Fedex. You may be asked to pay local duties/taxes on delivery.
Camera Body, Battery and Charger, software and manual.
I use a number of Minolta autofocus lenses, don't know about the flash
Yes, the lens are A or Alpha lens. Your old Sony camera lens should fit fine.
No
This was the thinnest caddy that I found. So I would give it a try. Others are not as thin. I know I ordered two others before I found this one to fit. The others were much cheaper but that probably explains why the tolerances were off.
You can hot swap.
You won't be fitting a 12.5mm drive in anything that wasn't specifically made for it. This case is not designed for anything but 9.5mm ones.
The package I purchased came with a 980MA Canon battery made in Japan and an aftermarket 1480MA not marked with any country of manufacture. After 15 months of use there is no difference in performance between the two batteries other than the 1480MA gives about 30% longer use and takes longer to recharge.
Apps are available for viewing IP Cameras on platforms MAC, iOS( iPhone/iPad, Android, Linux and even Windows (Tablet & Phone). The cameras work perfectly. If Ip Camera apps can be loaded on the Kindle Fire is a question for Kindle tech support.
Yes, the D5200 uses the EN-EL14 battery
Yes
I would assume it works with all Dell Latitudes. I use same adapters on the last 6 years of latitudes, from 610's to 5540's.

Just depends on the amp u really wanna get somen true watts
Each chamber has it's own terminal
It is 12 inch for 12inch subwoofer. Note:the speaker mounts on the outside and really needs a grill to protect the speaker cone
No, the opening does not accommodate docking stations
You may be able to get 3G connectivity by using an external Mobile Router Hotspot WiFi that uses the same network as your mobile phone carrier.
if you have a dongle its going to work with any carrier
Oh I am sorry. You only got the speed dome. My mistake. That did not come with a DVR. I added that to a system.
The brackets provided with the camera allow for mounting on the side of a house (vertical) on the under hang of the roof or ceiling (Soffit, horizontal) A support could be made to roof mount. 47C (or 116.6 F) would not be a remarkable summer temperature in the summer sun in the U.S. My camera is mounted on a west facing exposure and gets considerable heat (I haven't measured.) It functioned as expected last summer.
The charger is rated for international power, so you could use it outside North America with the correct adapter for the country you are visiting.
I bought this charger to charge the battery which comes with the Cyber-Shot DSC-W530 camera. That battery is the NP-BN1, and it works great!
Robert, I don't think so and here's why, there are two settings for battery types. The one you might be interested in shows a large N followed by small D T R K. That's all I can tell you as my paper work is long gone. But... I's think Sony could tell you for sure.
Yes. You can put it on right or left side of headsets
You don't! I put mine in the windshield bag.
I did not get any instructions either. However that being said... It's not hard to install. Red to power side of battery and black to ground. I installed mine inside my saddle bag and ran remote up to handle bar for quick change of Chanel
Yes it required PoE. It ships with a RJ45 power dongle if you don't have an PoE ethernet switch
32 BIT
I don't know where you read this. There are four external ports: Headphone jack, Micro SD card receptacle, Micro HD port, and a Micro USB port. The W510-1422 has a 64gb SSD, but no external SATA port.
No it does not have wifi.
yes,
Probably not. It plugs into the phone's headphone socket so you'd technically be able to answer calls, but the cable is too short to allow you to talk into the phone while it's plugged in. You could of course just unplug the phone and use it normally!
The same model can have different processors. If it doesn't clearly specify a duo core; then I wouldn't trust it as so.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evxZKTTMDuY Hope this helps, this video is how I learned how to program my remote.
it comes with a power cord so you can charge it with your computer
Read only...
It is one module, But: It can only take a total of 8GB of RAM. I read Dave's comment (no offence Dave) and bought two banks of 8GB and it only recognized 8GB if it. Called Technical Support and they verified it can only handle up to 8GB. So now I have one bank of 8 in the puter and one bank of 8 and 4 in my drawer; can't nave to much backup memory:)
Yes ... with full set of numbers on the right side; in addition to the top row. Seems to have been designed for business purposes but if you are not it shouldn not be a distraction. I found this keyboard is at the right height and distance from my sitting position and very comfortable to use and I do a lot of typing and not by hunt and peck.
Yes only takes pic from one side. So only face shots
You can download SKYPE from the Google Play store. I tested it out and it does work.
Yes but you have to buy an adapter or plug it into a usb port or charger.
They do not invert
Unfortunately no. It's not a dock able laptop, also the battery is internal and completely closed in so removing it isn't an option
The CT15-A5 is the second generation release with the brand new trackpad hardware made by Synaptic. (it is NOT a mere upgrade of the OS to Win 8). I own the CT15-A5 and the trackpad is one of the best features of this laptop. I believe VIZIO also made some internal hardware improvements for battery life. The 2nd generation (win 8 gen) is different hardware despite the same form factor.
no
Your music system should have blutooth option. If you are playing the video from laptop or ar desktop that has usb port then You need to buy bluetooth adapter for the laptop/desktop. Its a small USB device. This will convert your sound from your laptop/desktop to music system. After you connect the music to your sound system through blooth, Goto sound settings and select default as bluetooth/sound system name.
it connects up just like any other external USB drive.
Their website indicates that there are a pair of SATA III 7200 drives in the product. I don't know about swapping them out for other drives.
It shoots very well in 1080 with a little tweaking. I prefer to use a lower setting for storage reasons, personally. Don't know anything about viewing on 4K.
I had this on my Hero 3 and work perfect to point exactly where i want to take the picture or the video; specially while scuba diving or riding my bike. But you are right if you have your phone, probably do not need it; just remember, exist a few seconds delay of the image when using your phone app.
I do not believe a 13" MacBook Air will fit. I have an 11" MacBook Air, it's a tight fit and even tighter to get it out. It takes finese just to remove it.
Not compatible.
My 2012 Impala came with OnStar but not XM, I bought this to add satellite radio to my car, and yes OnStar still works with this kit.
My guess is that there is significant foam padding lining the outside shell of the pack. The portion of the pack that touches your back is very well padded--I can't feel the camera on my back. Now if you're looking for a great, comfortable pack for long day hikes, this has worked out wonderfully for me. But by all means, this is a very small pack. My Nikon D90 with 55-300mm lens plus strap and 28-80mm lens barely fit in the camera compartment.
It would deff. hold the dslr with the lense mounted. The camera compartment has divission but you can arrange them anyway you want. The flash would fit in the top compartment, but it would not hold everything mounted. It is a great bag though, I got it for my dad and he loves it. Has special compartment for the ipad and another for his phone, as well as a cover bag for when it is raining.
Sony SVS15127PXB has core i7 processor 100% positive.
Yes, sort of. It is a photocopy of the original. But it comes in box with that copy of the manual and a set of ear buds. You can also download the manual from Sandisk's website. http://www.sandisk.com/products/music-video-players/clip-zip/
No, it is not. Feel free to ask any thing else. Bob
Hope this helps....to be clear it DOES NOT have USB .....
Yes.
Window 8 and I believe it's 4 MB RAM
Yes, but the Corsair is going to have a higher voltage and possible increasing the temp of the laptop but wouldn't be much.
I don't think that it will fit. You mac is a little bigger than a macbook pro.
No idea. I never figured out how to get it working with my voip device.
I know nothing about AT&T services, I don't live in USA but I tested this router with many VoIPs and with the Internet connection ranging from 1Mbps to 10Mbps. It handled everything flawlessly. The only thing I don't like about this multifunctional router is using it as NAS, copying and writing to/from hard-discs are very slow.
buenos dias en realidad el equipo me salio malsimo al mes no funciono hice el reclamo y nada
yes it is....on the spec sheet near the bottom it lists all the HP computers it fits and the zbook 14 is one of them
I'm not familiar with the flash but the triggers do have HSS capability.
No, it's not hard-wired. There's a USB interface port on the back and it comes with a separate USB cable. The device works great. I'm an IT Director and purchased several of them for staff who have new slim laptops that do not have a CD/DVD drives. The cable is short (2 feet) which works fine when connected to a laptop but a longer USB would have been preferable.
Yes. Mine did :)
Yes it will
I don't have a smart case on my iPad mini and it fists pretty snug in this sleeve.
You can download Apps from other stores but Google Play is not supported. Cheers!
Yes sir.
Yes
Yes
I am not sure but the A5 sometimes has connection issues you just have to reset it. I dont use mine to listen to music just news and stuff on my bedside, maybe you should lok at the A7
yes. It will work in D270-1618
It supplies the audio for a 27" computer monitor I'm using for an office TV and works perfectly.
The speakers are wired. I don't know how long the wires are, I'm not using it at the moment. As I recall, however, they're pretty standard.
Elaine, no problem. Please send is an email through Amazon with your order number and we can start the process. Thanks, Tech Armor Support
I would not recommend this product. I had this case on my mbpro retina, and it ruined the screen. The screen would flicker uncontrollably and I had to take it to the apple store to get it fixed. The apple store said that the cover is what caused my brand new computer to malfunction, since the cover it a tight fit. Don't buy this cover, it is not worth the money and it doesn't fit the computer. This case was a rip off.
It's completely clear with a smooth slick finish. It's not soft touch like the black one
twas good. still good. havent had an issue. battery life is up and it was shipped in a timely manner. charge came through just fine and had a good experience.
Its not that loud. If there's background noise its very hard yo hear
I have no idea; My longest trip over the summer was 2 1/2 hours and that no problem at all. Hope that help a little.
No, it does not has a coaxial cable input, and no PCIe slot either. It is made of notebook components.
Turn on the unit to the radio option, tune to the station that you want to preset, hold down the sleep/memory button until P-01 blinks, use the +/- buttons to choose the preset station number that you want and then hit the sleep/memory button again and it's set. I think they may have left those instructions out of the manual.
Yes, you can snooze it. Read through the directions thoroughly. The iLuv VibroBlue Bluetooth has many functions so knowing how all of the features work can really help you enjoy this product that much more!
No. You can only set up 2 alarms at a time.
No it's all wired besides the Bluetooth
Yes it can. This headset is extremely comfortable and has good sound. However, there seems to be a small whine in it that I can hear as well as the buttons and plastic feel kind of cheap. I returned the pair.
Hi Trudy! You can identify iPod Shuffle models by both the shape and the on board features: 1st Gen - White, made out of plastic. Control pad on board. USB connector built in. No transfer cable is needed with this model. 2nd Gen - Rectangular. Made out of metal. Control pad is on board. Comes in a variety of colors. 3rd Gen - Elongated rectangle. Made out of metal. No controls (other than the on/off/shuffle switch). Multiple colors available. 4th Gen - Square. Made out of metal. Control pad on board. Multiple colors available.
Yes! That's why I bought it. It is also the one that fits the LCD case.
yes you can, but we would have to remove the rear foam piece and install a new foam piece so you can clearly see the lcd. we will have that model available soon from RageCams
No this is just a case. No computer hardware is included.
I know that it will layered recording for musicians, but I am not sure about the multiple files aspect for dictation. I had to return mine because Olympus didn't have the voice guidance feature on that model and as a blind person, that made it a bit hard to operate. Hoping you are able to find that out. It is an excellent stereo digital recorder for sure. If they had put the voice guidance feature on that unit I would have kept it or sure.
Pretty much any color you want, red, blue, green, purple, orange, pink, white and they transition to those colors with a turn knob so if you want a purple that has a hint of more blue you can also do that. I was pretty impressed with the amount of colors available. You can also turn on and off different areas if you only want lights on the front and not the inside.
For the top you can do 280/360mm and bottom 240/280mm,and up to 60mm thickness, you might be able to fit larger but that's what it official supports.
No this is just a case. No computer hardware is included.
Yes, but it's all manual.
Yes and no the alarm clock portion of the clock seems to work when plugged into the USB but the camera does not work while it is plugged into the USB. If it did it would be a super amazing device there would be no time limit on its ability to record.
Yes.
According to Acer's website the laptop has the following: -- 10/100 Fast Ethernet, 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN; Connect to a broadband modem with wired Ethernet or wirelessly connect to a Wi-Fi signal or hotspot with the 802.11b/g/n connection built into your PC -- 15.6" HD CineCrystal LED-backlit display; Intel HD Graphics with 128MB of dedicated system memory supporting Microsoft DirectX 10
It has a built-in flash but no external flash comes with this kit
there is 6 inch Hdmi to mini hdmi cable, professional dust blower, universal screen for the ldc screen, and spare usb to mini usb cable
I use it for my Sigma 18-250mm f3.5-6.3 DC MACRO OS HSM, which is a 62mm.
The L and B refer to lens and base. You can buy just the base and a custom lens or the base and lens together. I bought both the base and the 18-55 lens that comes with it and a separate 10mm ultra wide angle lens. Both work very well.
yes it does
Please be specific. What is the model 1466? You know but many people don't know what it mean just like me even though you shown the pix. By the way, it is only fit on Apple laptop 13" screen. That is all I know.
Hi, Every laptop has it own and specific cover. Answer for your question is NO
It sure does ,put the camera in the right place. Works perfect . Happy trails backing up.....
Yes but it's more so matte like than shiny and see through.
Abdullah, if you have double DIN space available, then you can use it. This unit is good other than GPS. MAP is old. I could not find upgraded GPS map any where.
Yes
Good Eveining, The GPS is normally the current maps of USA and CANADA. I would assume that they would be the up to date ones. For the updates you would probably have to speak with the manufacturer. Unfortunately the cost is your decision. There are pros and cons for GPS so i would just think about if it is worth it to you financially. Thank you.
about 6 inches at 4 inches it was not very crisp
It is perfect, fits like a glove.
I bought one for my MacBook Pro. It fits great and I love it...as my scotty dog likes to "bump" it with his head to try to shut it. And I bought one for my iPad. It's a great way to protect the outside. If they say it fits the IPad Air, I would give it a shot. If it doesn't, I'm sure it's returnable.
There is no usb plug , if this is what you are looking for .
Thank you for your help. I will check it and make the necessary changes and contact Amazon. Thank you again.
It's way too old for any Dell warranty to still apply. Individual third-party sellers may offer warranties, but this model is several years past the manufacturer warranty.
So far, I have about 1,070 songs and it still has a gig left.
the dimension is 3.5 X 1.6 X 0.2 inches
Honest opinion as much as this may suck to hear, take the hot swap out. Mine was faulty and from reviews I've seen I'm far from the only one it happened too. A hot swap would a been nice but I had error after error on my raid and soon as I took it out no more errors.
Yes it is, I'm running 8 with it right now.
I'm not familiar with your speakers, and I know of any that come with cable if your speakers have a double connect (back) one indicating +&- with holes they will work, these cables are designed to be pushed into holes (banana connect) I hope this helps.
One of the cables is black and the other is gray. I believe it is the positive that is gray. For the price they are very nice cables for what it's worth.
Hi: Not sure what a "5 mp3 DVD" is. In general, most DVD players will play music CD's just fine. In this particular case, I would either try before you buy or contact LG directly, just to be sure. As far as extra cables go, I would think that the standard audio/video cables are all that you would need. Again, check with LG. Go here: https://www.lg.com/us/support/message-customer-support
Yes, plenty of room for the Surface and other accessories.
The strap is about 40 ish inches, but if the tablet is more than about 7-8 inches wide, I dont think it will fit comfortably.
Not unless you folded them a few times. The bag is only 12" tall by 9" wide. It does, however, fit an 8.5x11 spiral notebook.
What is the size in inches
Negative.
Noise cancelling, which actively cancels out incoming sounds, is not found on this headset. Noise isolating, which passively blocks incoming sounds, is what this set of headphone does, and it does a descent job. You can still hear external sound, but it's muffled. I used these on a plane recently and they worked just fine. I would give these a 7 or 8 on a scale of 1 (hear all external noise) to 10 (hear no external noise).
The pause button works on Android and Windows Mobile.
I really couldn't say as these are my first headphones. Previously I'd only had the ear buds that came with my Ipod...but after a month of pretty frequent use, I love them and am pleased with their sound more and more. Still a thumbs up purchase to me.
It comes with a standard 3.5mm computer jack. You will need an adapter if you wish to use it in a standard 1/4" aviation audio input (if you're a pilot, or just listening to the comms radio.) However, these are not pilot headphone - so if that's your aim, do not get these. If you're just a passenger on a commercial plane, this headset will be just fine. All passengers should have standard 3.5mm audio jacks near their seat for entertainment.
Unfortunately no. No way to mute except using the inline control or via console or pc
Looks like an internal battery.
You can't
Yes I can. Do you have one? Or looking too buy one?
Susan, This is a great speaker for golf carts, office use, Etc. however you would probably be better off getting a bluetooth waterproof shower speaker as I don't believe this product would be loud enough to hear clearly in the shower.
It does! It comes with a USB cable you can either plug into a computer, or into a wall-charger made for a USB plug.
does this telescope have a full height stand
When you close the cover it goes to sleep mode but is easily awakened so that is good as you are not using Juice..:)
Yes. I bought a Kindle paperwhite 2 weeks ago along with this case, and the case fits perfectly.
From what I've read the 700x is more comfortable and for me they are, but as many people have said they fit a large head. Also 700x are a updated version, with a slightly adjusted bass response. Complaints of the original 700s was that they were lacking bass. I power them with asus essence stx sound card and would rate them very highly for their price, comfort, sound quality. Maybe like a 9/10
In my opinion, if I had to do it again I wouldn't. These headphones are cheaply made and are huge and pretty much I'm entirely disappointed in Audio Technica for how they've let things get. Their headphones used to mean quality and now they mean cheap plastic parts, cheap wires and cheap sound.
I use these daily on my PS4 plugged straight into the controller along with a Zalman Mic. I do not use a mix amp though I know someone who uses these with a Astro Mix amp and they work beautifully. As far as sound, you can clearly hear foot steps and tell from which direction. These have a very neutral sound, not a lot of base but they are very clear and sharp. The only plus you gain with let's say an Astro Mix Amp would be you gain "Digital Surround" if that's your thing. Hope this helps.
Yes
No
No
As far as I know, This should be able to use these on a ps4, with the 3.5mm jack on the controller. You can use these for skype, but you will need to purchase an additional microphone.
Like 48ohm not sure, but they are easy to drive.
Yes
I don't think so. Best check with Asus directly
There really is no way to adjust the height of the monitors individually, all I can think is adjusting the tension on the monitor that's lower in case it's too loose but that mainly affects the angle the monitor faces you.
It is welded to the base. You cannot remove it. You will have to look for one that is inter-changeable.
Jerry, it's pretty easy to replace these screens. I knew how to (but looked up video on YouTube to make sure I did it correctly).
About average really. Given the fact that on ear headphones doesn't block as much because they don't cover over the ears. But sound quality is superb than beats equivalent on ear hp's
Yes this is made to stand the tv without drilling holes in your walls. You have the option to set the tv on a shelf or drill holes on the wall. This one is solid & heavy duty no reason to worry the tv will not tip over.
Yes
7 cables all different colors!
It sure can, but only up to 30 feet deep or so and manually operated. Also, don't expect high quality images. You'll need to color correct the footage using a filter or in post production to get more vivid colors
I'm sorry I don't remember.
yes, a front camera. I don't like to use it.
I believe the cloud service has been discontinued, so no.
Not really. The keyboard attaches just find with the cover on, however, when you separate the ipad mini and attempt to put it in the slot in the keyboard for use, the cover makes the mini too thick to fit in that slot and it keeps falling over. You can wedge it in for a while but it eventually wiggles loose and falls over. It's too bad 'cause it's a nice cover. Removing the cover each time you want to use the keyboard would be a hassle and likely stretch it out eventually.
You have to mount to the wall
It works with my Direct TV remote for volume and powering off and on. All other functions (modes, sources, bass, ect) has to be accessed by the included remote.
Hi Jon, I have used the lens with myGF3, G3 and OMD E-5. Works great and love the size versus when using my Panasonic 45-200.
Yes. It will work great on the D5200 or any other Nikon camera which supports i-TTL Flash. The flash is best used in conjunction with a macro lens.
Please choose this one http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009SHYDM2
Yes, the 335 series supports sata2. Full specifications can be found at the Intel site here: http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/solid-state-drives/solid-state-drives-335-series.html
Yep as long as you have a good mobile signal from your carrier. You'll of course need to add the device to your mobile plan.
No, it is not. We are finding out that with the Windows 8, it would be much more user friendly if it were a touch screen. I hope this helps!
Yes
To my knowledge, these wifi cards are compatible with most makes of laptop, except for HP and Lenovo(IBM). I have an HP. Didn't do quite enough research bf attempting to install. Want mine?? LOL
3.5 connector only, no usb. Yes there is a separate connector for the mic.
Yes, the headphones themselves are stereo but with razer synapse you can make any headphones 7.1
No you can not.
It comes with the converter that is also from razer, make sure you tell him to grab razer surround software once he gets the headset
13inches in depth by 22inch wide
I only have one usb port on mine. It is powered with the power switch, goes on and off with the TV.
yes it will fit on your cpu it comes with clear instructions and both amd and intel adapters dont forget heat grease take the plastic of the copper and make sure you'r case has enough room
Perfect for your camera...it's good for ultra high speed equipment, high def output, and 64GB? wow, a lot of pix...I use it with a Canon 5d, and I get results, I mean, results...good luck...
Yes. I bought it to install in my Samsung Galaxy s4 and it works perfectly. I also bought one for my Samsung Galaxy tab 3 and it works great with it too.
Not sure. That's a question better answered by the seller.
Yes, I have this in my Galaxy note 10.1 and it works. Very fast too.
It looks like leather, and even smells like leather, but could be some type of composite. For the price, I would assume it is a composite. It's a very attractive case, but I don't know any way to tell if it is genuine leather.
The I got was not Matte -- they will almost always say that in the add. BTW, I have an anti-glare on my smartphone and while it does cut down on glare, the display still gets "washed out" in sunlight
I bought this so called shield for my iPad mini and it did an awful job of covering the screen. It did not line up and it was full of bubbles after several attempts to correct the problems. It looked so bad I put it in the trash. A co-worker was nice enough to give me a screen cover since she had an extra one from the brand she bought. My advice, don't waste your money.
No it does not
Yes. But honestly go for a folio type case. My ipad is constantly falling out of this stupid keyboard thing and I always feel like it's going to break my ipad
It comes with a special cord. I think you'll have to order directly from the company
Possibly
1A to watts calculation with voltage of 12V DC For DC power supply, watts are equal to amps times volts. watts = amps volts watts = 1A 12V = 12W
Very easy, just make sure you secure it. I plugged it in the first time and it fell out and I was worried that it didn't fit. Stupid me, I didn't push it all the way in so that it would snap into the socket LOL After that plug in the IDE cable and power plug and you're done. Works flawlessly.
Plastic. After used it for some time now, I found that the earbuds kept falling out of my ears. I used it for work out. Need better design to stay in the ears.
Yes
Yes. Go to print options; envelopes or labels, and you are on your way.
it's 65watts, so it all depends what else you are running. I'd suggest to use a power supply calculator online to figure it out.
A plastic card, similar to a credit card, containing data on a magnetized strip that can electronically unlock a door or activate a machine.
No difference that I can see. Just have to hang onto the key card to reload.
Not sure if it will run on XP. If you use MS Outlook or Outlook Express to manage your email, OFFICE 2013 does not handle "Pop" email accounts. I installed "Thunderbird" as an email client on Windows 8. I also found the Word 2013 moved a lot of features around but did not find any useful (to me) improvements in Word 2013 over 2010 and if you are replacing Word 2003, all your drop-down menus are gone.
Yes.
Yes
Yes it does, I haven't used it tho.
Yes just like laptops, the router is agnostic
I purchased my board almost a year ago brand new, not a used or refurbished one. It came with a 90 day warranty and we've had no problems with it so far. Easy to install and it came with all the documentation and cd.
Stiff
Yes that is what I used mine on
You don't need the rails, but you can use just the riser block to mount a QR plate to. I don't recall what mounting options are on the bottom of the cage itself, but I never take the riser off.
I have had this and used the item for 5 months. No degradation in performance during my use.
I believe they are made in China, but with Japanese cells. I do know someone who sells these and they can answer your questions. "Blue Nook" They are located in La Verne California and sell Wasabi batteries. I use Wasabi batteries in all my Canon cameras...7D, G1X, EosM SD950IS etc. I've never had an issue with them.
In short, yes. It charges both my Nexus 7 gen one and my Nexus 5 just fine. It also charges my wife's LG Flex with no issues. The connector has gotten a bit loose after my two year old decided to walk off with the tablet plugged in .... twenty times or so... But it still works!
Yes, the charger fits. It also shuts down and blinks when it get too hot, which is an added extra that I like.
640 x 480 pixel MJPEG resolution at up to 20 frames per second the pictures I have sent by email to me are really unbelieveable.
It charges a 5s, so it should charge a 5c

I have the second generation iPad mini. But Targus has covers to fit all iPad models.
hi, no sorry. thanks
No, has 4 USB ports
It should instantly respond once the tablet and tv are turned onto the right input. Recently I have had trouble with my input to the cable connecting fully but that should not be your trouble. You may have to change the settings on your tablet to switch views to show it on a different screen.
It said 200 on the box it came in and let me just say for the money it is beating the altec lansing one that I paid 450 for and it only lasted a year and a half. This one sounds great what I want and need it works awesome with my tv ot dvd player. worth the money.
Not sure...my computer runs Windows.
Inspire T6300 100 -240V ~ 50/60Hz 600 - 350mA
80 watts
Yes but you need to change one end to a female. It will not work if both ends of you cable are the same.
Depends on which sound card you have. Mine has an adjustment.
I will be honest. I didn't play but I red on forums it should. You can also google it
For ours. No you do not. Everything is fully updated. No issues etc. No errors saying not genuine and all that nonsense. Thanks
Different sellers have 32bit or 64bit, the one I got was a 64bit
Yup
It's just numlock caps lock and scroll lock. They aren't too bad from an angle but then I stood up and looked down at them and hurt my eyes.
I used this on my Sony T Series notebook to replaced the existing non SSD hard drive. If your equipment is originally equip with the 1.8 hard drive then this should work. but if it comes with the standard 2.5 SATA then you will need an adapter. Thanks
Simply put, no. This is compatible with all of the office and professional software I use, but is lighter/more portable to read. I find it especially ergonomic to do my readings in the morning and evening, as well as carry around the office in one hand.
No
I do not believe so
Not to my knowledge.
From the specs on the manufacturer's website, it says it supports iSCSI but I have never tried making an iSCSI connection with them. You might also want to consider how much I/O performance you need for your ESX application(s) as I have found most NAS devices like this to have marginal real world I/O performance, especially IOPS. If you plan on running any VMs that required moderate to high I/O loads, it might not keep up.
No
Yes
It works my D500i-B1 perfectly, i'm unsure about the E320i-B2 however i called vizio 877-878-4946 and they helped me and like i said, it work great with my unit, hope it works out for you. Eric
That is really going to depend on the rest of your rig's specs. What are you running now? I.e. CPU, ram, os....
Yes
Yes, of course it has.
two ring and three ring are different, but they should still work. the third ring/connector is for a microphone. that extra ring/connector gets used for a lot of different things, but if you're just using headphones, it shouldn't make a bit of difference. the two rings are for stereo, so this will work fine with your headphones.
Yes
Windows 7 64 bit
No. Only one hard drive slot due to tiny form factor.
fail
It comes with Windows 7 Pro installed as part of Microsoft's downgrade option, but actually comes with the license key for Windows 8 and an installation DVD for Windows 8 if you would like to upgrade it yourself.
It has both connection capability
Not sure what you mean by "Expresscard" There is a slot in the front for a Micro SD card.
Either search for it on amazon or contact lenovo directly.
It seems that the only power supply upgrade available is to 320W. FRU # 54Y8841. I found this information at Lenovo's Web site: http://support.lenovo.com/en_US/product-and-parts/partsDBLookup.page Select ThinkCentre M72e (Tower Form Factor) PDF to download FRU list.
It is not a touch screen model.
No
No
My Lenovo ThinkPad Edge E530 came with 4GB RAM which I upgraded to the maximum of 8GB by adding a Lenovo 4GB RAM module (RAM types must be the same). Hope this helps.
Windows 7 is the operating system out of the box. You don't need to do anything.
Yes
Yes
That's all you need
Ubuntu has a lot of broadcom drivers blacklisted, so in order to use most of them you need to first un-blacklist them first. However, to answer your question, Yes. Ubuntu 10.04 and up will support this card. Just plug and play. Linux Mint 13 and up will support this card fine as well. Anything older than that I cannot say. But I have used this card with distributions as old as Ubuntu 10.04 and Mint 13. I hope this helps.
You may have to download new drivers but Vista's native generic drivers should be able to get it going enough for you to Get online and download load them
I use it for Skype, it has been great
Yes it does. I bought it for the Sony DSC-HX50V and it fits.
No its not. Works great on the RX1 and the RX100 mk2. The Olympus version however is. Its in fact the same one that Leica "repurposes" with their name on it.
No it doesn't record video, but it can be set up to take a snapshot and email it to you when motion is detected.
No, my daughter likes everything about this case and keyboard.
I am not exactly sure how far it will work, but I would not think this mouse would be ideal for your needs. I can only get mine to click forward. It will not click "Back" no matter how many times I press the Back button. The third button is supposed to be programable, but no software or instructions were provided on how to get this done.
Yes. Even stands up on its own so you don't have to hold it!
If you're talking about the screen protectors similar to what we use on the iPhones then the answer is yes.
it has two outputs, one is audio, the other one is usb to dc adapter
I purchased two at different times during sale periods; both were new.
No, it's HD, but not blu ray.
yes
It is a partial Microsoft Office Suite. It contains A basic version of Word and Excel. It is provided in hope you will purchase the FULL Office Suite. It provides functionality on a basic level.
Yes
I would recommend that you contact the manufacturer directly
voltage is contolled by the power source adapter which has the capability to do 110/240 v both
You can't even expose the cameras to the elements.
you should be fine, these work both outdoors and indoors. They're water proof.
Everything comes ready to install. However if you need more cable you'll have to buy more along with couplings.
I don't have Ipad 4 so I would not know if it work
No idea..never try before..sorry
No. It will not.
I am having the same issue also. I had the charger plugged in and it got bumped and broken the solder connection inside the tablet. There may be a chance an individual who works on cell phones and tablets may be able to resolder.
yes
No
how to preset stations ?
Yes, it does fit Ipad mini 1. Dimensions of all the Ipad minis are same (7.87"X5.3"X.28").
Very easy. Just charge and sync to tablet via Bluetooth.
This remote should work with your vehicle, however to make 100% sure that it will, match up the numbers on your current remote to the numbers on this remote. If they match, it will work. If you do not have a remote to compare to, give your local dealership service department a call and ask them for your key fob part number to your vehicle. Hopefully this helps. keylessentryremotefob.com
yes
No just COAXIAL , HDMI , LAN... it does not have A/V.. or anything older.. BESTBUY.COM sometimes has good deals.. refurbished doesnt mean anything bad. It just means whatever problem it had was repaired.. give it a try and see if you find what you like. And they have free shipping sometimes and half price on some items
I haven't used the tripod yet. I can't imagine that it would support a camera. Very small
Yes it does, though I didn't bother to install it.
Semi clear not like glass but maybe an empty milk bottle
Ues
Clear and glossy finished. Shows the MacBook Pro nicely underneath.
This is my first case, so I am unfamiliar with the Speck case. My apologies.
No
It's a hard case, but the case has a smooth finish.
Yes it does, it fits perfectly I bought this for the newest Retina Display MacBook Pro late 2013 model and it fits perfectly :)
Contact the maker "J. B. Camera designs" he has some 'beta' screws that will solve your problem. I contacted him, he asked for my mailing address and sent me two replacement screws. Works great on a tripod now. Hamish
I just love this grip. I now have it on my 2 em5 bodies. It makes the camera fit snuggly in the palm of your hand. On one body I use the Oly neck strap and the other I have set up with the Joby DSLR wrist strap. The wrist strap makes street photography less obvious but secures the camera to my wrist. You can't go wrong no matter which way you prefer to carry your camera.
As far as I know there will be no problem at all.
No VESA mount
I contacted Pur & they told me that after the light turns red (about 30 days) to watch the water flow from the filter & change filter when it starts to be a small stream. If your light truly IS NOT WORKING then contact Pur via their web site since this seems like a manufacturing problem.
im not sure...It fits the ipod nano perfectly. But I have seen a lot of people complaining that the clip part breaks very easily....I never use mine so I haven't put any stress on it but I love it so far.
About 14 feet long. The lights have a pretty long lead wire to the first light fixture (about 8 feet). Each light is about 14 inches apart. The end of the string of lights has a lead of about 14" also with a termination plug for another string if wanted.
No
Mine only came with 110 power...but I bought it from a dealer in the US
Revao7
I think the answer to this is pretty obvious. This cooler is just barely better than the stock one. Only meant to cool 40Watts or so.
It will work with any intel processor with socket 1150, I have an Intel i7 and it fits perfectly.
If over clocking causes higher stress and temp on the chip. I would use the bigger noctua cooler. I have used my computer under normal conditions without issue , however under load the temp rose and caused the secondary fans to be called in. Temp returned to normal and aux turned off . This would not have happened with the larger cooler. All is well and I still like the coller it works well. High stress requires additional cooling . Rare for me , may not be for you. Take care
Yes
Sorry it doesn't but antenna doesn't cost much
I've used "IP Cam Viewer" on my Android phone and can view 4 cams at once. Should work on a tablet. They have a free "lite" version that works well, but with limited features...but still should meet your needs.
I'm not sure what a pop out dvd player is but I think they work on any factory or after market ones that you have installed. They work on IR and I don't know of any factory or after market that wouldn't. I've purchased 2 sets and they work on my 2008 Chev Avalanche LTZ and my wife's 2008 Buick Enclave. We're extremely happy with them and highly recommend them, especially at that price.
Yes, it can fit your car.
No they don't.
Yes
Regular red And white audio connectors
I don't see any headphone jack on mine, we use the wireless RF ones. They work great.
no the screen is not detachable.
Just get a sata hard drive and it plugs right in works good for me
No Arabic , just English. They were real simple and easy to understand . (With lots of pictures lol.) it shouldn't be hard to translate. If I can help any more feel free to ask. Thanks. Jeremy
Yes this will fit your 04 impala
The camera with the grip fits snugly in the Sony soft case. It easily fits into my jacket vest pocket. The grip is a must to hold the camera more securely. The flash on the left camera top requires that the camera is held by the body on the left side.
Not I, but I recommend this grip highly. It really helps hold the small camera. In fact, I believe Sony should include it with the purchase of the camera.
New products have warranty registration cards in the box. Used wouldn't have warranty obviously. .
No, Its too small. I order bought one for my daughter in November for a Christmas present, by the time she opened the package it was too late to send back so now I can't return it
No. I got it and I was excited but when I try it on my laptop it did not clip on it. So I just need to send it back.
No
I didn't do it and won't do it. I leave it as beautiful as it is, if its worn out it has its beauty too.....
The Kavaj cover I have will not hold a stylus. I'm not certain if this is true for all of Kavaj leather covers. My cover is very compact, very form-fitting on my iPad mini with retina display.
I have not used the Cool Gear adapter hard drive as boot up drive..., but have you adjusted your bios settings to allow boot up from a USB hard drive?
The hooks are made of a very rugged, quality plastic material. The buckles are metal. This is a very good bag. So good that after I used mine for a while, I ordered another one. You will not be disappointed, for I highly recommend this item. Thanks for your question. Tony
1) Yes it is for 4 years but you have to renew each year online 2) The office is installed on your drive. The pack doesn't include a CD so you have to download it online using the provided serial number. After you do so, office is downloaded on your drive and you don't need to have internet access to use it.
Have no such problem, can't help
No
yes, it is. but is a great laptop and very happy with it.
by click key (F5)
You can install the OS on this drive and boot from it, yes, in essence it can replace (or compliment) your internal drive. Important question: Does your MacMini have USB 3? If so, it should be OK. But be advised that with a USB 2 or Firewire connection, your speeds will be slower and it will not be nearly as responsive as your internal drive. You might want to read this: http://www.macworld.com/article/2039427/how-fast-is-usb-3-0-really-.html
If it's about the same size as the Speck Candyshell Grip case you shouldn't have any problems.
Maybe. If you like steam then yes, it is better.
Glenn, I have not tried however I'm sure you'd be able to. Apologies for not being more helpful.
No stuff
Surprising enough, yes it will work. Go to main menu, System/Device Manager/Mouse Settings, add device, connect and pair. When using a mouse, a cursor will appear and work with all menus and apps
I have the Samsung Galaxy note 2 and it works with the keyboard.
while I am not the seller of this item I will say it worked for my galaxy s3, s4, and galaxy note 3. so i would think any smart phone with a mini USB. will work.
It will work. We got one and used it a year ago to view a downloaded program on our TV. I would not work for us either on the first try, but a change to one of the S3 settings fixed that. Sadly, I can't remember what it was, but we read it in the other comments on the product. Sorry I'm not of more assistance other than confirming it can be done.
I use it on PC, but the AmScope site has a mac download. It is a very simple USB Camera (Of varying resolution depending on which model you get. I bought this microscope for my 4 year old daughter (Yes, she is way too young for it) but we use it together and it should last a really long time. Awesome microscope. The site--&gt; http://site.amscope.com/download-mu
I believe it was one year - but you better off calling Asus as they change
Glossy
with some work . it detects radio waves so any interference will throw you off track.
As I remember it's up to 32G. To tell you true I'm not happy with this machine. It's not reliable. I bought another one. That was better & chipper.
No it dose not. You cable or satellite provider should have some app or website where you can watch Live TV.
you can download all Google TV compatible apps which is Android 3.0 system, however most android 4.0 apps will not not appear nor would they work. You can try side loading apps (through sd card and a loader) but most don't work with android 3.0 Google TV supposed to be eventually upgraded to system 4.0 but thus far hasn't come
Yes- you should have more than enough room.
The lense comes with 2 options, a 1 year Nikon Inc. USA limited warranty and a +4 years Nikon Inc. USA Extended Service Coverage that requires you register on line within 10 days of the purchase. The agreement and registration form comes with the lens. I hope this is helpful.
Yes it does. That will make the lens a 140-400mm f/8 and at f/8 it will auto focus on all modern full frame DSLRs (D6X0, D750 and the D8X0). Also the D7100. I cannot speak for the D5XXX or D3XXX cameras, never having tried it there. If you need to know first hand, let me know and I will try it.
I have this lens, actually the f/2.8, and I purchased a sling pack from target for $30. Although it doesn't afford much protection, if you're just carrying around your camera with this lens attached, it fits perfectly. Just turn the hood around Nd put it in. No need to buy a $100 bag if you don't need to. Hope this helps.
Yes it does and it's a wonderful lens !
It should since it's low voltage. Technically haswell CPUs support both 1.5v and 1.35v, but manufacturers may force you to use low voltage models only.
From what I have found, yes. I have had multiple devices connected at the same time.
No data. This is a charge cord only.
Hello gordon slupe, Most Samsung devices need the grey cable but the Note 2 needs the all black cable. I attached a link below. http://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-High-Speed-USB-2-0--Male/dp/B008DVMRXG/ref=sr_1_32?m=A1DCPNQKKEISZB&s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1376595336&sr=1-32&keywords=mediabridge Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@mediabridgeproducts.com
The lens , I don't know. What I know, is that you can't change it and it is very narrow angle. For me, to narrow.
I plug it into the mic jack on my computer and record using software like Audacity. I presume you could plug it into any recording device with a microphone jack.
I don't understand the question. This earphone/microphone doesn't limit your recording. Recording time is determined by the recording device, like your phone or dedicated voice recorder. Depending on storage, most newer recording devices can record well past two hours.
Yes, and touch even works to some extent with Windows 7, but only for a few features.
I believe it is one year. There service is good. I had to make a claim on my 39 inch and I had no problems. They sent me a new tv instead of fixing the old one. Took about ten days.
I believe the E model is the smart TV with built in WiFi.
No, according to the specs it only has the following connectors: One (1) Coaxial DTV/TV cable antenna, One (1) Y, Pb/Cb, Pr/Cr component video with L/R audio, One (1) HDMI Port
No, neither the palmrest nor trackpad sticker have any wordings/symbols on it.
No, just cd to cassette tape.
CFD S05
Digital tuner locks stations well if they are local, and doesn't seem to have the static old radios are known for. Antenna is good, but won't pull in stations like a car radio.
If your computer has a DVI connection, you should be able to use this cable to display your computer's video output on you HDMI equipped TV. However, since you don't have HDMI output on you computer, it won't provide audio to the TV. You'll need to connect to external speakers for audio.
Yes, you can open PDFs. No, you can't open Flash items on any iDevice natively. I read somewhere that there is an app you can install to show Flash, but I have not looked into it.
Yes
I am not a tech person BUT our iPad 4s worked off from the wi fi I had for my computers. Just be sure you have your password.
I am from the US and used my iPad in Australia with an converter. I had no problems.
No unless you pay for the warranty
This Verizon model did come with a slot in upper left hand corner that accommodates a regular sized sim card. I am not currently using it as a 3 or 4G device so I cannot speak to its speed.
Your iPad must also be equipped with cellular when purchased in addition to the wifi that is installed in every iPad.
Yes. You can also purchase Applecare which will give you tech support and accidental damage coverage for two years with $50 deductible. Their tech support for the iPad is not very good as the people are very poorly trained. The iPad 4 is pretty indestructible as I slammed my car door on it and it didn't even scratch it (i have it in a Speck case with a handle, which I highly recommend). The new iPad Air is thinner and may be fragile.
You are able to use the Wi-Fi. You do not need Verizon. Is long as you have a Wi-Fi signal you are able to use it.
I would guess that it is unlocked I have not had any problems with it. I did have to get my iPhone unlocked when I switched carriers and know what a pain that was but the iPad has no issues like that.
I know there is a way. The IT guy at my clinic set up my bosses iPad and iPhone to do this task. However, since I did not have my iPad had to perform this task, I do not know the particulars.
Have you tried holding down both the HOME button and the POWER button at the same time. In about 5-10 seconds it should force a hard boot.
Ours was new not locked by mobile company. We do not use a sim card with ours, not sure if you can.
Dear Jessie, Thank you for your question regarding our DVI to DVI Digital Dual-Link Cable. This cable will work with the miniDP to DVI adapter as it's compatible with adapter that accepts DVI single link. Please contact us at service@bluerigger.com if you have any additional questions. Thanks, BlueRigger LLC service@bluerigger.com
WiFi + cellular means the iPad or iPhone can use either mode to communicate with internet. WiFi alone is simply a stand alone method to communicate with the internet. If you are not in a location that has WiFi, you cannot communicate, period.
sorry we do not
I have no knowledge of Data Services in Brazil. I do know that all Iphone/Ipads that are configured to work on VERIZON's network will work on any network. They are UNLOCKED and will work on any GSM network.
im not the owner of this but if you want an upgrade like that it would be some kind of 400$ or 450$ more solid state drives (ssd) are really expensive
Hi Carlos, Yes, the YS-01 is one of Sea & Sea
there are no fees if you own your own modem but if you do not , that fee is determined by YOUR local company, its different for each company
yes it should
I have looked through the description and there is no reference of a kit. You get the tablet, an ac adapter, and a microfiber cloth.
PPT files can be edited with one of the pre-installed applications, but only through typing in the changes, not through handwritten notes.
Simple, the camera is new and the demand exceeds supply. However, the #1 reason is that somebody will pay $535 to get it.
It comes with a USB cable only to connect to the computer and charge the battery. I bought a separate charger with an extra battery. Also you will need a micro scan card for memory. Get the micro- not the standard. The camera also comes with brackets to mount the camera. I do recommend the head piece to mount it to your forehead for videos.
Well, not the one I received. It does come with the Waterproof housing and although it does not have a key ring remote, you can pair it with an android phone or iphone and then use your phone as the remote. I have done that and it is a really nice feature because it allows you to set your camera at the right angle before you set off on your adventure. I'm still learning, but I use my while I ride motorcycle. We plan to test the waterproof housing this summer.
no not for working out
I am not happy with this model. I bought another one without the bells and whistles as a gift and they loved it. Simple to install and easy access to the batteries. No video or picture taking capability which I really want. Didn't need the extras. Battery life maybe a month or so.
The adapter sends whatever video signal is on your iPad to VGA. It works with Netflix, so it should work with Amazon Prime Instant Video.
For iphone 6+ yes, for the app maybe, i was try with facebook and whatsapp and it wokerd very well, for example i'm a teacher and i doing my class in a tv with VGA. I can see all my apps there and i always work with keynote and is fantastic, try and met me know.
Each book will maintain its own bookmark upon exit. The FF-RW function works ok, the longer you hold down the button the faster it goes. Books will resume position after shutdown. I have both the Clip and ZIP, with the current firmware upgrade. I use mine exclusively for audio books.
Hi, MaryAnn - yes that's why we bought it. Now we don't need the little converter box we had been using to grab the antenna signals. The antenna wire (coax from the antenna) goes straight into the Magnavox unit, and then you connect the Magnavox directly to your TV. Works great!
Yes, it does have a viewfinder and an LCD.
: CMOS sensor is a kind of sensor that is normally 10 times less sensitivity then CCD sensor. As human eye can see object under 1 lux illumination ( full moon night ). CCD sensor normally will see better or as good as human eye in the range of 0.1 ~3 lux and are 3 to 10 times more sensitive then CMOS sensor.
Yes! Definitely. the MiniSuit Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 Aluminum Keyboard Case Cover (N8000 N8010 N8013) is an excellent product. Light, Responsive and functional.
The easiest way to tell is to look at the back. If the Nexus name is in portrait mode, it's the old model. If it's larger type and in landscape mode, it the newer model. Otherwise, you can measure the width. The old model is 120mm wide, the new model is 114mm wide.
No. It is too top heavy to use that way
The manufacturer did not make this case with a clasp, the case features a "Latchless self adhesive cover". At this time, I do not believe another version of this case will be made.
So far so good. The links are plastic - I guess as sturdy as plastic can be. The quick release has come in handy when setting on tripod and other situations but there are still the dangling pieces attached to the camera.
I believe the iPad air is yet another upgrade from the gen 4 iPads. Its thinner and lighter and I think the buttons have been moved slightly.
Yes it will cut old style sim to Nano sim. It is ship from New Jersey, PA,SC and other amazon fulfillment center which location is close to you for fast delivery.
No it doesn't work ! wrong size plug
Yes it will work I would make sure I use electrical tape to cover take joining part
Yes, but very thin. Not as thick as one for iPhone .
I believe so. I don't think the size changed with the 2nd generation.
The screen protector is part of the top piece. This case is a three piece case. Bottom shell, top shell with screen protector attached, and the silicone that goes around it.
I really don't know. I bought this one specifically for the 5th generation.
just for one, and if you look you can find the 75T for the same price and they are a lot better speaker, amazon isn't the only one selling these
No, you would have to drill it yourself.
When I purchased the 75T's, I had the same question. The most detailed comparisons I found said that the low frequency range was slightly larger for the 75T's and that the highs are somewhat muted. The overall consensus was that it is very difficult to hear any difference between the two speakers; both are great pieces of equipment.
Reboot. Reinstall.
If you are outside you do not need a shoe sensor. The GPS will measure your location, distance, and speed. If inside, you will need the shoe sensor since a GPS will not work indoors. It needs a view of the sky to get satellite reception.
Yes. It uses FM spectrum so it goes through walls pretty well.
Yes, it will work as long as the Plasma has standard RCA red and white audio input jacks on it.
It comes with "Rechargeable Battery Pack (NP-BN), Batery Charger, Multi-USB, Wrist Strap, Instruction Manual" according to: http://www.sony-asia.com/product/dsc-w670 and/or http://www.sony.co.uk/support/en/product/DSC-W670/specifications There is also good technical information at those sites that is not explained on Amazon's product page.

I use it on my nx300 and its a little small light gets in on one side but it still works ok.
You should be able to upgrade that system. First you need to use windows vista upgrade advisor go to this address. http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=31870
None.
I couldn't say, I never use it for that.
Yes, this isn't solely touch screen. The mouse it comes with is a wireless mouse, and is pretty good.
It does not. There is not even a trial home version on this computer.
Truthfully, I don't know which iPad I have, because my husband bought it originally, and I wasn't with him at the purchase. I'd call the Otterbox people. I'm sorry.
Corner is made of fabrics to hold. No scratches. Don't worry.
yes it comes with Word, Powerpoint, Outlook and Excel
The case has plenty of room for most anything needed to fit. Should be no problem.
I can't imagine why they wouldn't. I've had mine plugged into a mini Mac and an iMac G4 both are desktops but the audio plug is the same.
I don't see why not.
I'm not sure about that. I know you need a different one for the S2 and Note 1 but I can't say anything about the galaxy tab
I'm assuming that you're connecting to a television. Depending on how old your TV is, you may have to go into the settings menu on the TV and select the audio source as HDMI. If your audio source going to the TV was previously "optical" or "digital", etc. then it may require a manual change in the menu settings back to HDMI. Just a guess. Good luck.
I'm not sure, This works great on my Note 2. Doesn't hurt to try, Can always return it. I went to Radio Shack looking for an MHL cable and they wanted $40+ for one. So for the price, It's worth the try.
6 ft Mine stopped working after a few usage
It is my understanding that it will.
Yes
It does but not an HDMI connection
The one I have is branded and has the model number if that helps Carl.
It should work, I used mine in a Dell also.
Rafael, unfortunately as of now, we do not ship internationally. I cannot however speak on behalf of other vendors.
I have another case for my phone now. When I used the one that you are inquiring about also protected my phone well also.
No.
I measured the center section and it is 9" long x 8" wide x 6" deep. So it seems that should be plenty. I put an hp 17" laptop in the rear section and it barely fit, but that would me more than adequate for a Mac. Above the center section is a smaller section which could accommodate the lenses, flash, etc. I have been very happy with the bag and even had the company name embroidered on the top flap which makes the gear look even more professional.
I bought this one for my Surface RT, and I had to cut some of the plastic off near the MicroHDMI side. The beveled edge of the surface makes it difficult to find a cord that will fit, but after shaving off the plastic a little, it fits just fine. Picture on my tv is perfectly clear when using this cord to plug in my surface RT. And it was WAYYY cheaper than the Microsoft one.
It's for output from the Surface to a TV, so no.
Yes, and I'm typing this response with a touch cover on my Surface Pro 3. However, keyboard was made for smaller surface screen and doesn't fully cover the 12" wide SP3.
Yes, upper left side ... just above the volume control... 1/8" standard jack size for stereo (3 conductor): see 3rd picture down in http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/getting-started/surface-rt-features I have not tried using a 4 conductor 1/8" plug for earphones and microphone -- smart phones use this type. The internal jack on the smart phones are designed in such a manner that they can use either the 3-conductor plugs for earphone-only or the 4-conductor for ear+mic.
Yes - either by USB or wireless
to eject in macbook air, turn on finder, plug in the drive, wait for it to show up at the bottom of the finder, then to eject the disk in the drive, hit and hold "command" and enter the letter e, and it should eject. Any other time do the same thing to eject whatever you put into the drive. If you are using windows, go to "computer", right click on that drive after highlighting it, then the meno should give you the option to eject.
Yes
It's supposed to but I've only burned a data and JPEG cd so far. I haven't tried a DVD or music yet.
This keyboard did not work at all for me.
No it does not. But it was such a good deal I don't mind.
Hi...My son bought it for the new generation but never got to use it. I took it out of the package and it seemed to be very sturdy and the the style is true to the picture. So it fits the last few ipads.
Not sure ifit would fit but do not buy this unit. It is very cheap and nothing works like it should. I paid to have it installed and taken out the same day.
The A6-4400M processor has two cores. One floats.
Monitor is 23"wide x 16"tall, 27" diagonal.
It is working very good. I appreciate that. Thank you so much
I would say not since the case is for the camera only
Sorry since I don't have a Nikon p600 I have no idea....
The case is not a full-grain leather, but is a pleather type. Still, a very nice product for the price.
You can use either, just be sure that your video card has all the power connectors socketed, otherwise you will have degraded performance, some cards will not work at all unless fully powered. Match the cable to you video card it does not matter which power receptacle that you use. They are just labeled for convenience.
There is no noise, infact my daughter is now bluetoothing it to her iPod in class and it disturbs no one
Yes, it has an easel stand that props up behind to hold the iPad up horizontally for viewing. It does not have a way to hold the iPad up vertically.
Hi, yes you can! You may able to find it it in any Radio Shack or Target store. The opening is an standar size; if look around your house for an old charger like from a black berry, that will fit. Hope this helps.

Hello David, The Cerwin Vega P1800SX has an 18mm reinforced wood cabinet enclosure along with a 18 gauge perforated steel grille.
The connections are reverse SMA - so yes, if you have those connections on your antenna. But, you lose the MIMO function if all three antenna ports aren't used.
It is sturdy.
We unfortunately don't offer shipping to the UK at this time through our Amazon storefront. However, we do so through direct sales, and other sales channels.
I don't have the max weight the strap will float, but he Nikon Coolpix Floating Strap was apparently designed for the Nikon Coolpix AW100. I have an AW110 which is slightly heavier than the AW100. The AW110 exceeds the weight the strap will float. If you can find the specs of the AW100 online, you should be able to determine the weight of the AW100. That's probably about the max weight the strap will float. Hope that helps.
There is no problem accessing the touchscreen. This case is really nicer than it thought it would be. You only need to remove it to access the battery and memory card or to attach the USB cable.
Yes
no, this case is too small
No. This unit only works with NON JBL equipped Camry
im not sure mine is a 2013 model galaxy note 10.1 also this keyboard sucks its cheap i got t used t once and now t sits in my desk drawer its more of a hassle then useful
It requires a power outlet
I would know since I'm in California but I wouldn't buy this camera. The resolution is terrible
Yup, same size still.
Don't know
I haven't run in the rain yet, but they can handle a fair amount of sweat. I live in Florida and have worn them on some long runs. So far, so good.
It has the improved metal support for hinges. The laptop is much more sturdy since replacing the bart
Hello PK, to my knowledge this should fit all C655 Toshiba models. It fit mine perfect. Exact match.
Yes
The battery I bought works perfect. I paid less than $20. I highly recommend them. I bought a new power cord too.
The blueparrotts should be fine in this case. Just be careful with the mouthpiece.
Yes
It should be able to do so, I use with my Nexus 7. But you might need a custom kernel that supports OTG + Charging. I believe Franco Kernel for the Nexus 5 does such. Hope it helps.
I can confirm that the case and the screen protector both fits well. the retina is only a tiny bit thicker than the original.
I'm guessing you are asking if the smart cover will remain flat against the back of the case magnetically when you are using the iPad. There is no magnet on the back of the case and the iPad magnets are not strong enough to hold it to the back when the case is on, so the answer is no. If you want that and are willing to pay more, the case by Spigen has a magnet on the back to do that.
Emily, My Pipo S1 which is a Jellybean 4.1. supports Adobe 11.1. I hope I have answered your question. I have seen this question before so you might ask whatever brand's costumer service you are looking at.
No..
Yes, the default lens fits with the camera. Not sure if a telephoto or any other large lens would.
No
This player only has an HDMI output. Does your TV have component video inputs? These would be three RCA jacks that are blue, red and green. If so, you can get an HDMI to component video adapter. I've never used one and have no idea how well they work. If you just have a yellow RCA video input jack, then you'd be better off buying a non-blu ray player, as you can't get high definition video through the single yellow video input. Hope this helps!
I'm pretty sure it's only for the kindle fire hd model.. but if you're looking for one for your ellipsis tablet i'd suggest you search for that model name/keyboard. That's how I found this one for my kindle. Here is one link but there is many to look at. http://www.amazon.com/Leather-Carrying-Ellipsis-Bluetooth-Keyboard/dp/B00GNNNMEO/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1386033574&sr=8-1&keywords=verizon+7+ellipsis+tablet+keyboard
Yes
Yes
The clasp that attaches to your clothing is very sturdy and remains closed. I think you could attach a cord under that and it will remain secure.
It should hug your iPod nice and tight. I am sorry but u must have gotten a defect.
Its probably fine if it still works, however check the edges to make sure they werent damaged. These cases dint provide tht much protection.
Just make sure you select the right model that's all they just offer this case for different models
No. Need a TL-50,56,58 or 64
Possibly. L505d was actually a series of laptops, with several variations, some of which did use similar processors. Without knowing which l505d you have, I can't give a definitve answer.
http://www.easterncctv.com/accessories/pt2018.htm you can download the manual there as well many other vendors websites, do a google search for ptz controllers and look for the controller it is sold at lots of cctv security websites often they have the specs/manuals
Thank you for your inquiry. We don't carry Sony EVI - D70 PTZ cameras therefore we cannot test it for you. However, we can tell you that all PTZ cameras out there works under the same concept and this controller keyboard supposed to work on all of them.
The length and width of the Ipad mini and Ipad mini with retina are identical. The only difference is depth. The iPad mini is .3 mm thinner than the iPad mini with retina. The Joy Factory has sufficient room to accommodate that difference. That said, I still ahve my Joy Factory, but I do not believe it offered enough protection so I went with and currently use the Otter Box. Bill
Only if you have another receiver. Otherwise, no.
Sorry. I don't know the answer to your question. But, the part I purchased does work on a Velbon Vel Flo 9 (Model PH-368). Considering the cost of the OEM replacement part, it might be worth the gamble.
The magnification with my 18 to 55mm zoom lens set at 55mm is 6X. The distance frim the subject is about 4 inches.
Hello John Thank you for your inquiry. You would first turn the lights on by pressing the button labeled "Lights" on the front left side. Once the light button is on you can adjust the color of the lights by using the remote provided.
Technically they are small compact sub woofers. Think of it as a vibrator that you attach to your furniture. It really adds a noticeable boost to movies and music. I have four installed in a seven seat sectional powered buy a cheap $100 Pyle amp. It is way more effective than I thought it would be. If you want your room to go boom I recommend these.
no
They are 16.5 inches exactly and have holes that run all the way from the top to the bottom.
It handles my Insignia 39" tv with no problem. No idea on the maximum it will hold, but it seems very strong.
The remote does need to be pointed directly at the IR receiver. However, the receiver can be located away from the TV or other equipment. The distance away is only limited by the length of the wires. So it could be the floor, ceiling or coffee table.
USB\VID_0A5C&PID_21E8&REV_0112
well done ) You need to copy the necessary files on a flash drive before you format the laptop.
It attaches to your lens, not to the body.
This holder ls made specificaly to hold the Mac Book Pro or the Mac Book Air. It comes with 2 adaptors (the white plastic part in the middle) so you can use it with either laptops. They will fit snugly.
I haven't had to charge mine very often but I'd say an iPhone/iPad charger would work great. You just have to have the right USB cable, which I believe would be a USB Micro.
I don't know, as I have the mini non-retina, and it works great.
The battery compartment is located underneath wheel area. Turn the mouse over and remove the cover with a tiny screwdriver by inserting it on the end and lifting upward. Make sure to get the battery positioned wth the "+" end towards the bottom of the mouse.
charge the unit,insert dongle,push buttom and your synced
I have not found any yet. So 4 of the buttons are waste for me.... :-(
I can answer part of your question. The DPI button is small, located by your index finger, opposite the main left-click button.
Not sure. But I believe it is specially made for ativ pc's. It has a button which I think is used by skecher-artists that may only be detected by ativ. You should ask the dell support.
So it does not work with ATIV Smart PC 500T that I own but I don't know if it will work for series 7. If you want to try it let me know and I will send it to you in exchange for the shipping cost.
The attachments can be removed really easily :)
No, only work with TPT2.
I've used on an old laptop and two newer laptops. It's as easy as plugging into the port! In my opinion, even though I've only tried on three, I think there would be no problem.
I have 4 of these and 2 tab 2 tablets. They work great.
I'm pretty sure this will work, the holes are under your carpet or vinyl, you will have to cut it out to find the hole.
Yes you can. It automatically keeps the last 50 caller IDs and you can select any of them and add them to the phone book on the system.
The base unit is wall-mountable, but you need to buy a separate bracket: http://www.uniden.com/accessories/wall-mount-for-dect15-d16+d17-series/invt/gbct2d7740zg
If you go to the Xpand Website there are lists with what glasses work with specific tv models. They are also helpful if you have questions and email them. Hope this helps.
Thank you for your email. We are actually having a promotion now.
yes
I measured the cord and it's 71 inches long. Probably meant to be 6 ft, but it's close. Now that is just the length of the cord.
Yes..:-)
Yes.
Yeah there is a little button on the top corner that removes the face plate.
I'm not sure but I think it displays Japanese. I have some songs that have titles in Japanese and I'm pretty sure I've never seen the blocks instead of the characters and I'm also pretty sure that if it can do Japanese, it can do Chinese.
Pioneer gm- 8601 or hifonics brx 1100.1d... A good 1 ohm stable amp
I don't think that will work unless you have an amplified tube or subwoofer. That subwoofer out is unpowered meaning signal only so it is designed to fed into an amplifier
It was supposed to be the single unit but I never received my order
No. Allowable voltage is 10.8 - 15.1 volts per Specifications page of the Owner's Manual (pages 21-24).
Oringnal wat
I did not need an amp for these units. I am using an pioneer avic navi unit. Any upgraded stereo unit has more than enough power to run these and still sound good
yes they do come with a crossover and i would use them they are perfect match for the speakers it will sound clear and filter out the bad stuff most likely there is either an amp supplying power to just that tweeter or there is a resister in line that is acting like a crossover in you 05 acura in either case i would us the crossover that is with the pioneers, i have them on there own amp 4 channel for my highs and mids very happy .
I have the original paperwhite, fits nicely
Yes and no. They sound alright without burn-in but after roughly a week or so of use they start to become extraordinary. Although that's also just your ears adjusting to the sound. If you're on the fence about these though, definitely get them. They are, in my experience, far better than just about anything within their (amazon) price-range.
you just plug the USB 3.0 into your USB port. Then you plug a network cable into the adapter.they mean there's no power adapter needed besides the power supplied from the USB port.
Yes, i believe so. While i don't have a smart cover; i have a logitech bluetooth keyboard which is thicker than a smart cover and mine fits because this sleeve stretches to accommodate it.
I don't believe so I never tried. I just used it to simply watch DVDs. But I'm pretty sure you can't.
sorry to answer late, this equipment works well but the back camera was defective and you also need download the map for argentina.
Yes it is a 2.0 x16 slot card. You won't have problems fitting this card in your computer because of its size. Its a very nice card for the price. I have one in my computer for a while now without anything going wrong with it.
it will run a program so you can send sms text and also access internet. Hopefully you'll have better luck than I. I have it in Costa Rica and I could only access 2G networks
well, i just could tell this is not good modem for me in usa. after set apn each sim cards, "simple mobile sim internet plan" and "t-mobile sim $3 per day plan" were not working as 3g. and sometime not working even 2g connection, i'm not sure if it's other country.
It should be well more than enough to cover it. That combination, even overclocked, should use around 500W of power, taking into account everything you'll have in your system.
It should work but knowing the rest of the system would help also try pcpartpicker.com and build your system there and it will give est. wattage
I dont know, I have not seen any devices fr LG phones
The Rikomagic MK802 IIIs (notice the "S" at the end) is the updated version of this and has bluetooth. The MK802 III you have to use a bluetooth dongle with.
Sure...call as much as you want lol
320gb and 4gb of memory
the built in audio cord is about 6" and the supplied usb cord is very thin like dental floss,speakers and great
Yes... but, please be aware that these speakers tho' they sound great have a design flaw in the cord/plug. It is only about 8 inches long and within a week pulls lose from the unit and is almost impossible to fix .. we lost two of them within a month.. be careful.. lame engineering and product design.
Almost. The top and sides are round but the bottom (where the wire is that's attached to the speaker) is flat with three little rubber feet
Yes they are
6 x 8 is thestocksize and 5 x 7 will direct fit.6 x 9 do not fit without modification.
Yes they do, I bought some a few months ago.
They are a pair.
Hi Mr. Veguett. The answer to your question is 4 ohms.
yes
Don't know, personally. ... but I've heard the kickers have more bass. The pioneers have pretty decent bass and really good clarity. The kickers weigh quite a more, comparitively, with a bigger magnet, hence the bass. That's all I really know. Hope it helps.
If memory serves me correctly ,I bought a bushing adapter from manfrotto ,which I do not see on amazon any longer but I found a bushing adapter from Rock Steady that is one quarter to three eighth bushing adapter that is stainless steel with a rubber gasket. It is similar to the manfrotto bushing ,that works great with the quick release on my heavy duty ravelelli tripod with a pan head .Hope this helps
No
Yes.
yes but you have to supply the cord.
Crappy speakers! Echoy, tinny sound. We added an inexpensive speaker that plugged into the earphone jack and USB port that totally fixed the sound.
I'm looking at ir. It is a diagnostic port only, you cannot show video from a USB drive, but you should be able to get power from it. Good luck.
It will not work, it has less than 5 inches long neck.. That's it
No, you won't. Case cover doesn't have undercut along the side, where magnetic cover attached.
Yes it does.Its a perfect fit
Yes it does support Auto 110V-220V. The specification read Input: 100-240V~50/60Hz 0.6A. Output: 12V-1.5A.
About 30mm
I doesn't fit properly, but will fit inside. the tripod works okay.
This model is not designed for night use. However customers use them to monitor outside through windows and at night with a light source next to them.
This IP camera has a Graphical User Interface similar to a router in which you remote into the device and configure its settings for use.
no bag, not sure where you can pick one up.
Unfortunately, this particular model is not SLI ready. If you want SLI you have to buy the GTX 650 TI BOOST.
I don't understand the question.
No
Mine came with different ear piece sizes but no carrying case
I wouldn't know. They work for my phone (an Lg Optimus f3) so who's to say they won't work for yours? Of course that's just my opinion. If you're not sure, you can find someone a bit more tech savy than me. Sorry that this doesn't answer your question, but good luck with finding out the answer you're looking for.
Nope no case with these
They will work fine on your 4S.
No
yes, i dont use the doors and windows units. they are not very reliable. the motion detectors are the best. everything comes programed but you can only use the motion detectors. another point, the motion detectors i only have to change the baterries every 6 months or so.
yes they are antennas that pull out longer.
Yes, and yes. If the smoke detector goes off, then the whole alarm goes. It calls the numbers that you have listed, You can also add more fire alarms to the system, I don't know if it has a limit, but I personally have three fire alarms with it.
The MacBook Air has an Intel i5 processor which contains two separate processors. It can process two threads simultaneously.
Go to RadioReference.com and look up your city/town. If they are digital, the squelch codes will be NCS or DCS, if not (if they are analog) it will show a PL for the squelch code.
No, but it helps. Most agencies of every type use multiple frequencies now. Either assigned for different uses (dispatch calls, information, SWAT, detectives, etc.) or in a trunking scheme (multiple frequencies that change via computer control). By using the search feature, you can pick these up, but it may take you a while to decipher who is who and why. You can search on the internet for frequencies in your area, or become acquainted with a ham operator, or even call your local news radio station. All of these sources could probably help you out with local freq's.
About 6 steps Press hold to stop Scanning Use the dial to set the frequency Press Hold again to tune to that frequency Press Function&Program to save - the lowest unused preset will be brought up Press finc&program again to save
Hi, I don't particularly remember, because I bought and returned these over a year ago. If I remember right, though- one of the things that annoyed me was the lack of isolation. They're not completely open like open back headphones, nor do they make a complete seal, so you get this annoying in-between where you can't understand anything going on around you, but it still interferes with music listening. Does that make sense?
It should be there. My remote has a "netflix" button on it. But the app is also on there. You could try going to the Apps and downloading it from there. My irritation is that I got Amazon Prime and it won't work on my Samsung blu ray player with the smart hub.
I bought it for a regular iPad mini, but I'm sure the new iPad mini would fit perfectly. The AQUA iPearl case is better than I expected, especially for the price.
No, it is false. The camera deletes the older file and starts recording in that new space. I have proved it with a 32gb it works good.
Hello Jan, I'm Jewel with Kingston Technical Support, here to address your question. If you have the 15 or 17-inch Mid 2010 Macbook Pro those do support 2.5inch 9.5mm SATA drives. As such our V300 SSD will fit within the drive bay. For any further assistance, please call us at 1-800-435-0640 (USA and Canada only) M - F 6am - 6pm PT and I or another available Technician will assist you. Thank you for selecting Kingston as your upgrade partner.
yes it did for me but when it did it made my recovery just big enough for the files on it and windows kept giving me error messages that recovery was out of space. So I used " paragon partition manager 2013 free " to expand my "factory_image (f:)" drive. No problems after that. Im not the greatest but I was able to figure this out just by trial and error. You might even have better luck. Hope this answers our question. Feel free to comment back.
I'm happy with the purchase, I replaced an Integra DHC80.2 and I wouldn't say the sound is superior like many reviewers claim but I do like it better because it is less bright than the Integra which is my personal preference (matter of taste). That said, to appreciate the sound quality of this unit, you need to have very good speakers and decent room acoustics. If you have both then you will like it, it is really detailed and clean. Otherwise, put your money on speakers.
I wouldnt say night and day,is there a difference yes. The Marantz has the audyssey xt32 calbration with sub eq-ht that calibrates dual subs which would make a big difference if you have dual subwoofers. The Marantz has better DACs and is made to be used with separate amps. The biggest difference is in the separate external amps and Audyssey calibration for dual subs.
Try a file manager such as Astro or ES Explorer. I had the same issue with an Android 4.0.4 based TV Dongle and found both of those file managers to be quite helpful. They are both available in Google Play as well. Hope it helps.
My phone doesn't get hot in it. If you're a heavy internet user (like streaming media) that causes any phone to get hot.
Nope i went through that and you will just have to return in it only works with sprint.
Sorry but I don't know as my phone is an LG Optimus that I purchased from Sprint a little over a year ago. I would go to the Sprint Store if there is one close by and see what Otter Box cases they have specifically for your phone and then if it's cheaper to order on-line from Amazon. My first Otter box I bought at the Sprint Store. This case is amazing and I highly recommend you find one that works for your LG Mach.
Yes... It does and brand new
Yes , its attached to the pc it self, bottom back
Yes
Most of these Nexus 7 keyboard/docks are actually the same product, just re-branded by different companies. So, the Mini Suit is most probably identical. (Look at the "Q" key in pics. On all these IDENTICAL keyboards the "Q" key is HUGE.) So, get the one with the cheapest price. :)
I don't know the dimensions but also has a keyboard on my mini and it's closed, no problem. The only issue is lack of space for accessories like charging wiring.
Likely not , it's snug fit with just the standard apple folding cover
Look for the serial number on your laptop. In the laptop case description, it shows which serial numbers this case is compatible with.
It's more of a lite sky blue than an aqua, which was what I wanted, so I was pretty happy. It also snaps in really well and stays on. This is actually the 2nd case cover I've ordered. The first one was a different brand and the top kept falling off. It was very frustrating! The iPearl case is SOOO much better. I absolutely love it and would recommend it to anyone.
I think so, but I used it with the touch keyboard. It worked fine with that one, so I think it would be no different with the type model. Do note that left-right swipes can be difficult due to the lack of cutouts to facilitate such motions. Best of luck,
Cannot confirm for W500 however it is fit n function compatible with Thinkpad W520
Will fit lenses with 72mm diameter. Depends I the lens mounted to your camera.
Well according to dxo mark, this lens not only has image stabilization but its also a lot sharper than the 24-70 II
No
I have read reviews that this is compatible with the Surface PRO 2. I own a Pro 1 so I really did not test it. I also went to Best Buy one day and the rep said it is compatible. The difference is that the touch keyboard cover for the PRO 2 is a bit thinner and has options for colors.
Of course it will fit.. It just a little smaller than your tablet but you don't care, right ?
plug it into your pc. open the removable disk drive. click on TAG, type in your updated time and date in the same format, click file, click save, click exit.
1) The router is 4G LTE 2) It is working with any standard sim card and frequency which supported. 3) You may use it in mostly countries but may have some problems with Japan and Canada, they have another frequency. 4) You could connect your PC/Laptop by LAN port or Wireless. thank you
The poder adapter is 110/220. The unit uses 12V.
John the camera comes with a wall wart which plugs into an AC outlet and converts to DC voltage. It will plug into the back of your Wansview camera.
Yes that's what it's made for
It works okay. A much better case is the manvex case that one fits well with or without the keyboard and you can adjust the screen angle
You won't ruin it. Just unvelcro it and slide the tablet out, do what you have to and put it back on/in. I have taken cover off several time with no problem. First time though I did forget about the velcro. Hope this is helpful.
The case does not come with keyboard. Its just the case.
I have the actual keyboard with keys not the touch, and it fits just fine!
I have the tablet and touch keyboard - with the case closed it is right about an inch thick. It is just the right thickness to not be flimsy, but not so thick that it feels bulky.
Yes it does
I'm pretty sure it's too big to fit your kindle fire. you can find several other kindle cases on Amazon.
I personally have not tried this with a cell phone and have used it with Windows 7 only. My thought is that it should be compatible with Win8 too.
Dear Veeral, Thank you for your inquiry. There is a switch in the back of the A19 to switch the voltage from 120V to 220V. Please let me know if I can be of any additional assistance. Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo
Hi! I use this cover with my surface and it fits very well. Hope this helps!
It fits the surface pro, but not pro 2
Yes you do I just double checked to confirm..
No it is not covered, the photo is misleading.
Yes. The case can be used with or without the Type Cover 2 keyboard. Plus it's really easy to attach and detach.
Mine is 2.53GHZ
I have found there are 4 distinctly different digitizer versions available: 1) No markings on the ribbon cable, with a white barcode 2) 69.10I21.G01 markings on the ribbon cable 3) 69.10I21.G03 markings on the ribbon cable 4) 5158N FPC-1 markings on the ribbon cable. If my memory serves correct, based on your firmware version of ELAN 3011-4822, you will have 5158n and any of the others very likely will NOT be compatible.
Yes, I will as it works very well with my iPad Air.
No, works with Bluetooth. But not a good deal. You have to download the app, which doesn't work properly. The features are unusable. Can't save or change the names of the files or folders. I wasted my money. The app that works with it needs to be updated and repaired.
Any kind of paper. A5 pad
I couldn't get one to work on mine without the power adapter. Then again, I have yet to find a TV that would power any of my Chromecasts, so I have had to use the power adapter for all of them. I have tried (all relatively new (less than 3 years old) models: Samsung plasma, Sharp Aquos LED, Vizio LED, and W1070, and the Chromecast always needs the power adapter, so I think that their "Powered by the HDMI port" claim is a bit of a stretch for all but a very few models.
No it is not a touch screen.
Yes, it's includes
One requires batteries. One doesn't. The glasses without batteries are less cumbersome and I have a great 3d picture. Visio 3d made me dizzy. Lg is very impressive
Unit Dimensions (WxHxD) 42.9" x 25.8" x 1.4" Dimensions With Stand 42.9" x 28.4" x 10.6" Unit Weight 43.4 lbs. The TV itself is really thin.
I'm a bit unclear on what you mean by universal, but it will work with any computer/tablet that has a USB port.
It connects with usb transmitter.
No. There is no visible red laser optic light.
I do not know if it works on a regular kindle fire. I actually sent mine back because there were two letter "e" and no "r". The e that was in the r's place was falling off. I bought a different keyboard which is working very well with my kindle fire HD. From the top of your kindle, pull down, go to wireless, then bluetooth and see if there is a place to pair your kindle with a keyboard.
I have an 8.9, but if I ever have trouble with a Bluetooth device connecting, it's because the device is interchanged or another device is interfering.-
Mine did yes.
I don't have a retina display mini, so can't confirm, sorry.
Yeah!
They are not pet immune. You'd just have to angle them high enough so they don't detect pets. Or maybe cover the bottom part of the lens. The window sensors only detect someone sliding a window up. It's a transmitter/magnet. You put the transmitter on half of the window, say bottom half, and the magnet on the top half. When someone slides the window open it separates them and it goes off.
Thanks for your interests in our item. No, it does not have a US power plug.
I want to know the same thing
It should. I've recently purchased this lens and I've been very pleased with how it well performs. I was particularly impressed with how sharp the focus was and how well it froze the action while shooting a marching band performance at night. Of course you have to turn up your ISO and adjust your settings on your camera.
Yes it will work on all EF/EFs mount
Yes.
Go to Silicon Powe website and download software for your Firma. You can diagnostic your flash drive.
Obvious joke aside, find a USB port and plug this in. It'll work fine and last a long time.
No it's in line with my Nikon primes, it has a noticeable stop but then continues to float beyond that point.
Yes, it does have microphone/earphone plugs.
i fall to sleep , with mine all the , time thus since i've had them they've , been quite durable that's why , i chose them because they advertised to be durable , they've live to my standards !
not sure never heard of the sound of the LP2. in general i found nothing special about this headset.they look good,and price doesnot justify it's price
Not a trans-Atlantic flight but i did use them straight through a few cross country long flights in the US. They are very comfortable and you can leave them on for extended periods of time. The noise isolation is pretty good on the flight as well.
I use these for gaming, listening to music, handling phonecalls, anything really. They're super comfortable although they get quite heavy after three hours or so. I wouldn't recommend doing anything for that long anyway
No, since the M-100 is pretty efficient. But a good quality DAC and amplifier may give you even better sound.
I think you have something on backwards
It appears to be glossy glass.
No. You can buy an external drive if you really need one. Jim
Yes
It's about 3.5lbs
Yes.. It works perfectly with ipad
My son used the tower, he said bit look like it should fit depending on motherboard your using. Hope that helps.
Yes they do.
Worked great for me. Have it running as a bootable drive over thunderbolt through a Thunderbolt Display.
Yes, woks perfectly. I bought it for the same one.
It is a USB charge so you either have to use a computer or a wall USB charger
This package really has problems. I think only one item in the entire 11-item package actually worked. Very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend buying it.
Yes, it works with Hero 4 Black. It is possible to watch the video while recording.
no
If your video switcher software accepts composite plugs then it should work.
I've used it to record audio directly from a DJ audio mixer. It worked perfectly and the sound was clear.
my craig soundbar isnt working with the setup of the rca plugs what else can i do...i have a sony bravia 32in tv
It won't hit the screen because there is a level of distance from the case and the screen
Yes, you can. :)
Yes, you can feel and see the raindrop texture. Very cool texture and color.
on the bottom of the camera where the grip plugs in there is a rubber cover. that cover is removed and stored on a the grip for further use without the grip in place.
No, it's actually 8pin and then 2x (6+2)pins. Amperage aside, you can use the split side for 6pin or 8pin ports.
not too long. its the short kind.
There is no optical drive included.
Most software can be download directly from the vendors website. Most vendors offer a download image that you can download, right click and mount to a drive letter which is recognized as a drive letter you can install from. If no download you can purchase usb cd/dvd drive to attach to your system.
mini HDMI. You will need an HDMI to min-HDMI cable: www.amazon.com/Gold-Plated-HDMI-Mini-cable/dp/B00104XCVO
Intel i7
Yes.
I can't say for sure on the ps3. But it does work for a turtle beach x12 on the PC and Mac (just tested it for you)
Nope! Love them!
yes
ask the manuf.of lcd37-09-i dont know what ns-etc is
Not sure about the one I got but I did a search in Amazon for "remote for Insignia NS-DXA1" and came up with http://www.amazon.com/INSIGNIA-Replacement-Control-NSDXA1APT-AKB36157101/dp/B009D5IDA2/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1423759090&sr=1-1&keywords=remote+for+insignia+NS-DXA1 which actually looks different from mine. Hope it works out OK, have a Blessed day !
Indeed. I'm in fact responding to you right now on my S4 while it and my ipad are charging. I was concerned when I received it because the packaging alluded that multiple requiring 1A could be charged at once but only one if the unit requires 2A (like an ipad). I can confirm however that I can charge my S4 and ipad at the same time. It may take longer, I'm not sure. But if I plug both in when going to bed, both are charged when I wake in the morning.
No clear answer. It depends on many things
Yes. It works fine for me. Safe.
Yes.
Hello Ryan, No this adapter will not work with a Nintendo Wii. These adapters will only work with Laptops or Desktops. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@mediabridgeproducts.com
Im not sure as long as your motherboard has space for ram sticks you should be fine. I believe all ram sticks are the same so they can fit any motherboard as long as you have open slots
Sure. Just use Keynote and get familiure with the 3 functions on the remote. Enjoy.
Well I have a 50 inch tv weighing 60lbs. it works great as for 92 lbs. I dont think you would have a problem as the sag free wall mount is well made and its only 12lbs. more than max weight, they always low ball the max weight on everything so theres that extra buffer if the thing could only hold 80 for real they probably wouldve rated it for 70. good luck hope I helped
Amazon does not allow it, I think media link was just flying under the radar so far.
Based on other customer reviews, I would say no- it does not contain enough Internet for todays most common needs. I would suggest upgrading to something faster- a 9600 baud modem would be good, though a 14,400 would really give you a big boost.
Excellent camera.
this does not include the sd cards/ as stated on the box "This box does not include microSD card"
No, you have to purchase a program separately. Art programs such Inkscape(OSX, Windows, Linux) Gimp(OSX, Windows), and FireAlpaca( OSX, Windows) are some good free art programs, though.
Pump is included; uses molex connector, it's audible at stock speed even in dampened and correctly bled case, if the goal is purely to get into water cooling. If you're trying to upgrade, save and bit something higher end.
Yes, it did, inside the reservoir.
No
The Jlab I have is for 110V. When I was in Europe, before I left, bought a adapter for 220V to 110V
Yes it can.
It has stereo speakers up front and a bass radiator in back. They suggest for increased bass to put the speaker up against a wall to reflect the bass.
No, sorry, it does NOT have a VESA mounting pattern. The back of this monitor is mostly sealed and flat except for the input/output ports and will only mount on the OEM stand that comes with it.
yes up to 32gb micro sd card
Glossy Black Finish 9inch (16:9) 800 x 480, WVGA Display Supports 802.11b/g/n Networks Google Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) 512MB DDR3 RAM Memory 4GB NAND Flash Storage Built-in Speakers Built-in G-Sensor 0.3 MP Front Facing Camera Comes with Pre-Loaded Apps and 2 Family Movies I/O Ports: One (1) Micro USB Port One (1) Standard 3.5mm Headphone Jack One (1) Microphone Jack One (1) DC in One (1) Micro SDHC Card Slot (Supports upto 32GB) Power & Battery Specifications: Rechargable Lithium Battery 4000mAh Up to 5 Hours of Battery Life Input: 100-240VAC 50/60Hz, 0.3A Max Output: 5V--- 2000mA
No. This is a model specific docking/charging station for ASUS TF300T tablet.
You need a ipod tripod adaptor. The cheapest one is to search for "Cell Phone Universal Bracket Adapter Mount Holder For Tripod iPhone" or "tripod adaptor for iphone". My compact Canon G15 cost around $300 and takes near DSLR photos. An iphone5 can cost over $500 so you should use caution on windy days.
The mic is located atop the front part of the unit near the lens. You will see 2 screws and the mic is the small hole between the 2 screws.
Brian, just measured distance of infrared at night. I get a distance of 45' do not have any leaves or tree limbs in the way of night vision as this will decrease the distance. Do some more research on a better camera, hope this helps.
Yes, not a flash drive if that's what you were wondering.
You sure can, or if you're not using a third or fourth channel on your receiver you can plug into that too. Hope this helps
I would think you could put 2 light kits in the model if it's big enough to house the control modules. They would function as 2 separate systems though. There really is no way to combine 2 kits without wire splicing and then I'm not sure that the module could handle the additional lights.
Yes, the system uses the power from a receiver channel, not the power pack, so it will work just fine. Nate
yes it has wi-fi. i dont know about the router. contact the maufacter of the router ,see if it would work. i dont see why it wouldnt because routers connects up to multiple devices,at one time.
It comes with the lens, but it's not attached to the body. It's a E-mount lens so it's detachable, and you can put other lenses. You can also buy a lens adapter and use Nikon lenses with it. It's a great camera for the price, especially with this package of extras.
no problem with continuous shot. no BURST
It will definitely fit! Id suggest getting a quick release plate as well! I got the opteka follow focus cause it was cheap....its not the best.
In Venezuela I did not work. should give more information to avoid problems. I lost my money. I could only connect to the telephone line input that is internally
We have it activated with EMC Security, Suwanee, GA. I don't know anything else.. F
Thank you for your inquiry. We can confirm the GSMVLP5-4G is indeed compatible with the Vista-20P.
no, you need to call a monitoring company a have them register it on their network.
This part definitely supports both 2.4 and 5 GHz; I'm currently using it at 5GHz. But I think I'm using 802.11n; max throughput is around 240-270 Mb/s (using Linux Mint 16 and an Intel wifi PCIe card). So I can't say about 802.11ac.
The connectors for these antennas are RP-SMA (reverse polarity SMA - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMA_connector#Reverse_polarity_SMA). If the connectors on the back of your PC look like the large connectors on the cables included with these antennas, they should work.
No, it is purchased separately along with the hand grip.
No Keyboard No NFC on my A04 model
Good
I would have to say yes, since the "jaws" open much wider than the width of my iPad mini. An iPad is 6.6" wide, and the mini is only 1-1/4" narrower.
This battery is NOT the right one for the C710-2847. I read the first answer and so I ordered it. Just received it and it is not the correct one there is no way for it to work.
Vendor is using stock wii images.
Yes, I have a Wii U and it works great with the console
Looking at these other answers, I'm flabbergasted by what they say. The remote is called two in one because it is the wii-mote with the wii motion plus accessory integrated into the remote. Hince "1X Remote Plus ( Remote and Motion Plus 2 in 1 )" in the description. Motion plus is required for certain games that rely on more precise movement detection such as Red Steel 2 or Wii Sports Resort.
I haven't tested it but other reviews are saying you cannot use two transmitters in one house. You can always buy two, test them, and return for full refund.
It's not for full range audio, it's a sub link. It only transmits the lower frequencies. This is not intended for streaming.
Drivers for this device are supplied by Microsoft Windows 7 update. The drivers should automatically be installed when Windows 7 recognizes the newly installed drive. If Windows incorrectly identifies the drive, try uninstalling the mislabeled drive in the 'Device Manager' and restart the computer. Windows should then detect the new drive and automatically install the correct driver.
I used it on my Sharp TV, so I believe it is universal.
I don't know about the specific model you've asked about, but it does fit my Samsung 70" tv.
I have not tried it with a 4TB, only a 3TB, but it works fine with that. Orico's site says it is compatible with all SATA III Hard drives, so I suspect that it would work fine with a 4TB. I believe that Amazon would let you return it if it is not compatible. The OS may limit your partition(s) size, but that would be true even if installed internally in your system.
This is my first HP I am happy with it!
Yes it does, it has one HDMI output, it also has three USB ports and one networking Ethernet port, and one monitor out
Yes
The one I got was a 64 bit
There is no HDMI port with this model.
I do not know, didn't keep.
Hold unto the W88B bluetooth ON switch at the same time have you phone bluetooth search connectivity. When you phone recognize the W88B then click on it. I hope this help, sometimes you have to keep on trying. It is a good device
I'm not sure but I googled the sized differences between 2011 and early 2009, I don't really see a difference. But just to be on the safe side, I would recommend you to email the seller and they probably know.
The small end plugs in to the HD video out port of my Surface RT, so I can then connect a regular sized HDMI cable to the other end. This lets me connect the HDMI cable to an HD TV HDMI port to send video and audio signals to the TV for display and sound. It works great for streaming movies.
Yes, but there is also the newer Surface 2. So, generally seeing just Surface means it's not the Surface 2. I'm using a Surface RT, the first model. Dennis
I have had good experience with the keyboard lasting all day. I've used it in meetings that are daylong, and lasting into the evening, and haven't had any problem with it working the entire time.
It does if you have the double din radio
Had to send my unit back to even get the GPS programmed the first time. Was not happy as we did not get it until after our vacation the second time. Once we got it back it had some maps programmed and has worked good for around town but won't know about out of state or updates until we take our next big trip. Be careful ordering unless you have time to converse and return. Seller was very prompt with responses and tried several things before finally letting us return for updated product.
YES,have audio.
of course, yes
Actually I'm using this GPS in Mexico, I know that this GPs works only in USA , Canada and Mexico. Pienso que no se puede descargar algn otro Mapa de otro pas.
I'm sorry, I don't remember... I think you go thru settings but I'm not sure....we got rid of that tablet because we didn't like it very much, I'm sure as you can see its not very user friendly. Sorry I couldn't be much help!!!
built in to connect to your home be,or hotspots like dennys and a lot of restaurants
Yes of course. I use this lens for photos all the time. The quality is great! Just sometimes hard because of it being full manual.
We have not heard from Rokinon about a new lens being released as of yet. However, the manufacturer of Rokinon is Elite and they can be reached by calling 800-441-1100
I have a Dell Inspiron notebook that I use it with. I have only used it to run other types of programs, haven't tried any games. Probably would depend on game specs if it would satisfy the requirement.
it is supposed to come with one mine was just missing, it is a great reciever for the money i had to buy a special remote it was 80 dollars but the one that would have came with it is nice ,,,,, hope that helps you
As you can see http://us.transcend-info.com/support/cate-2 Transcend has removed all mention of the WiFi cards from their site which implies they are End of Life.
i've never had a need to do so, but i believe that there are a number of apps that would allow you to view raw images.
There are two other models that will work with Android tablets. I use one of them with my Kindle Fire HD and I love it. The most current version (920-004569) is not only not discounted, it is selling for a whopping $69 including shipping.
Certainly, typing this answer with the keyboard on an iPad Air.
You can do both actions. Also, the reader is plastic, nit metal.
2.0
no
Yes
From end to end, 21.5 inches.
It gets water behind the lens and also makes the picture/video appear blurry. Waste of money
I only have the GoPro 2, bought the dive housing and the snap on red filter. I used it in a recent dive trip and it worked great.
This is our Elite Series camera and comes with a 3 year warranty. It is the most current version, but we also have 2 Megapixel and 3 Megapixel versions available.
Yes, the light boxes have an opening on the top and the front.
I'm no professional but I believe the built-in mic(5.1ch) is superior to the directional(2.1ch?) that is included in this kit. During my first few times with the rig on the camera I found myself forgetting to turn on the external mic while it was plugged into the camera, resulting in no audio for those video recordings. Don't plan on using it for everyday recording and only if I need its directional capabilities.
I've found no way to adjust the volume on mine other than to use the source device (computer, ipod, iphone, etc).
I bought it for a gift and she uses the Bluetooth application to play music from iPhone and to talk hands free on her phone. The range is very good. About 200-300 square feet.
It won't stick unless it's smooth. Like glass or Luke a countertop. Can't have any bumps or pores.
Yes
I'm not sure. I've had mine for awhile but I have a 1st generation iPad. It works fine for me.
I haven't seen any so far..maybe in the future.
Yes you can even set it up on the stand and take video I did it the other day with my niece I love it!
yes it does and a screen protector plus a cleaning cloth.
Yes it does . It doesn't charge as fast but you can keep working.
That mic is a flimsey peice of crap. Don't even buy it.
This item will not work with CX160
The plastic inner case on mine is all white. The rubberized outer case is black!
Unfortunate no, the SC440 is limited to 4x1GB ECC Unbuffered modules
No it does not support regular FM radio it only supports Internet radio
Sure, there are sevaral "How to replace" videos on youtube... Check that, this kit is the LCD display, I don't know if yours is damaged. If it's only the glass you should not buy this.
Our batteries are not manufactured by HP. They are brand new generic batteries.
No USB ports available.
You need a USB keyboard and a USB Mouse. You can connect the mouse and keyboard to the monitor, then connect a USB cable from the tower to the monitor. I don't remeber if this monitor came with a USB cable, but if not or you want to see what a USB cable looks like, click this link: http://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-USB-2-0-High-Speed-Gold-Plated/dp/B001MSU1HG/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1398952779&sr=1-3&keywords=usb+cable I hope this helps
Should work just fine 3A =3000 ma. So 1500 ma is just half of the output from the cube.
Everyone just needs to be on the same channel at the same time to talk together.
Peter, I have by connecting the yellow from player to yellow on back of stereo aux and the white the same way. This may vary by the stereo that you have but this has worked for me. Good luck, Jeffrey Doerfler
Its quite small - about 8" deep and 6" across - about 1" high
Its a Rear View Backup Mirror Monitor , you just need to clap it on the rear view mirror.
Try tying he white o he red. I bought a few of these nifty voltmeters and they're pretty accurate. I know the instructions say white to sourcebut trust me tie white and res together and you wont miss. I have 3 and thinking about ordering a few more for the price. Some malaysian electronics are pretty good. Suspect it's in this tablet.
I have a Samsung Galaxy S4 - it works perfectly with my phone.
The instructions were on the back of my package, so don't toss the package too quickly. Actually it is very simple. You are given two short cords. Each has a different kiind of connector. You choose the cord that works with the device you are connecting to and plug that into the headset cord. It is beautifully easy. I truly appreciate this headset because my landline phone has one kind of connection and my ipod has another. I had a difficult time finding the connect for my phone until I found this headset.
Google hasn't started allowing everyone to sell the Acer's this company/individuals are just trying to price gouge people.
Yes. It does not come equipped with USB 3.0. However..unlike the Samsung it does have a VGA, hd camera, Ethernet port, and upgradable options according to Acer. (hard drive & ram)
Hi Lawrence, I am so sorry but I really do not have a clue. Our Canon printers at home are not compatiable with this Chromebook. Best to try to contact the company who makes the Chromebook to see what printers are compatible or how to possibly hook it up to the one you have now. Best of luck.
i did not buy the wireless set. but the sound is really good on the wired version. clear, good bass, natural tone
no
Yes, it will work just fine with that motherboard. The only thing to keep in mind with taller ram sticks is CPU Cooler clearance. Certain aftermarket CPU coolers may result in the 1st DIMM slot being unusable. For example, I have to run my ramm on DIMM #2 and #4 because of my CPU cooler. (stock CPU cooler will not be an issue)
Honestly, the speed means very, very little. You're talking differences of less than 1% performance under most circumstances. 1600MHz is enough for basically everything.
No
It definitely works with i7-3770ks. The Sabertooth Z77 looks like it supports DDR3 1866/1600/1333, which is below this kit's speed. The explicitly approved list for the Sabertooth Z77 is here: http://dlcdnet.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/LGA1155/SABERTOOTH_Z77/SABERTOOTH-Z77-Memory-QVL.pdf.
11-13-13-30 if you're running it at 2133 or 11-13-13-32 if you're running it at 2400
Yes

never used the corsair. My Kingston has had ZERO problems. Currently handles BF4 and the rest on Ultra. I have a great graphics card as well in combination.
Not really. There isn't any sort of belt loop or anything on the case, but you may be able run a belt through the snaps on the back of the case by the lcd screen on the camera.
if the 925 does not have built in wireless charging then yes you will need a charging cover. I had to get the charging cover for my 1020. it works very well.
No, the alarm does not play through the speaker.
3 years, printed on the box.
You need to use the.power supply that comes with it.
I am using OS 10.9 and it is working fine. I have not tried it on old versions of the OS.
This is a substantial piece of equipment that seems well constructed. It's a metal chasis and heavy. The hinged front panel door has a nice smooth action and never feels as flimsy in any way.
This TV is hella dope I got for super cheap and it looks amazing on my Xbox 360 and PC. Great video quality and no lag. I have surround sound and don't use the speakers very often but their alright. Great TV for a great price. One of non regretted purchases.
yes
The battery life is up to 3 hours.
Yes, I bought this tablet strictly for my son to stream netflix and play angry birds. We couldn't do either on the darn thing. Eventually it kept freezing so much that we gave up and returned it.
my guess would be NO!
This headset appears to be for smart phones based on some terms in the product description. There are headsets with mikes for PCs with a USB or dual plug connection. I bought these for gaming in case I wanted to do multi-player ( talk to someone ). When I saw your question, I had to check it out. Although the mike won't work on PC, they still rock for music and gaming.
About 50" long, give a couple either way.
My "go to" recommendation is the Definitive Technology Studio Monitor 450's. They are manufactuer discontinued, but you can still get a pair from Amazon Prime. They've got an unbelieveable response of 24 Hz to 30 kHz - - unheard of for a small book shelf speaker. The secret is a 10 inch pressure activated subwoofer mounted on the side of the unit. Best speakers I've ever heard. Don't take my word for it: go listen to a pair before you buy if you can. Max power input 225 watts. 13 inches tall and 11.44 inches deep.
None
disappointed with the quality control It had one bay which would not charge fully (no matter what battery I put in it) I DO NOT recommend this product
Idk about the Crizal lenses, but they work wonderfully on my lenses with the anti glare coating
No, the new Nexus 7 is thinner, narrower and longer than the older model, so this case won't fit..
Sorry but it does not.
No probably not I had to install the driver off of the disc on win 7
Basically this is just a wireless adapter for a computer that should pick up a wi-fi signal better than an internal wi-fi adapter. This is for the wi-fi connection to the router. This will also plug right into a USB port so it is very easy to install. This does not have anything to do with connecting a computer monitor to TV or Cable box. Hope this helps you.
There will be some distortion, similar to any lens up through probably 25mm. It is very subtle if noticeable at all unless you are right up on the structure. Easily correctable in LR5. Nothing like UWA or FE for distortion.
Fits all Micro Four-Thirds cameras, including your Lumix GF6. Cheers.
Yes. That is the GoPro version i have.
It will work with the standard housing
Many of the first computers featuring Mini DisplayPort connectors were Apple computers, which prefer the white color. Now that more and more PCs are using Mini DisplayPort connectors, Mini DisplayPort cables in black is an excellent suggestion.
Yes
By a third party company, but they are a good set of filters for the price. Plus the rings and holder are of good quality.
they are very cheaply made. the plastic piece that holds the ear piece already came out of its hole but i could just push it back in. I really love them because it keeps them on my ears. good luck!
They seem to fit the apple earbuds specifically, so I doubt the'd fit other types.
If you can plug earbuds into your phone/ipod then you can use these. They hold the earbuds and slip over your ears so your earbuds aren't always falling out. Having a case over your phone/ipod shouldn't matter as long as you can still plug a speaker/earphone connector in.
Hi, Thanks for your question. Our goal is to make products that people love and provide great service. Yes, absolutely, we take care of no charge replacements if anyone has an issue with the EARBUDi's. Thanks Sincerely, Team GOBUDi
Put your headset earpieces in your ear as usual. Then go to the mirror, and hook one of the EarBudiClip around you ear, then snap the white plastic piece to your earpiece stem. Now you have a visual of how to put it together. Now you can set it up without a mirror, etc. I absolutely love mine. They are amazing for running.
You can also use the mini plug. Either USB or a wall plug type Instead of the 5v round plug if that is what you are asking
No
No it does not.
it was pretty great, but in dark rooms no there is not much to do in dark,clarity is great but when zooming in or out while recording it may at times became blurry for a sec, battery wise is great it runs good I'm not so sure but maybe anywhere from 2 hrs constant use to 6 hrs if are not using much in the day.
8x2x31/2
There are seven on the top of the screen and three at the bottom
The image definitely goes through. I bought it for that reason - I project from the back so people can watch from the front (I set the projector to reverse the image). Basically, if you put it in front of french doors at night, whomever is outside looking at the doors will see the movie perfectly.
I never run out memory, but in manual said that the camera will vibrate and turnoff when the memory is full, so i think you cant use it.
Have you sent me a device does not work and has no spare parts in the states of Fdhira on Alaijah
Yes, Pedro, it is and is wonderful. I have two now, one for upstairs and one for downstairs.
It says 2.4 amps / 100-240V and 0.5 amps / 50-60Hz input.
Well, YES, it is! ... you can see it by your self here, at Apple's accesories website: http://store.apple.com/us/product/MD836LL/A/apple-12w-usb-power-adapter?fnode=74 Clic on the "Compatibility" tab and you'll see that the iPod nano is among the devices compatible with this adapter. Hope this answer works for you!
Casey here is an easy way to determine if it will work for your vehicle. This pioneer unit is what they call a "double din" unit. A single din unit usually refers to the size of a typical aftermarket radio we have in our cars. So this being a double din unit you would need the space of two car stereos stacked on top of each other which would be approximately 4-inches from top to bottom..Good luck my friend !
Yeah what's up with that? I'm having the same issue. iPod recently stolen and have been using a USB stick. Guess I'm gonna have to write Pioneer unless I find a solution online. Let me know if you do and I will do the same.

I just measure the deepness of the bracket and it looks like your device will NOT fit on it, the bracket holding my ipad air is only .75" deep.
Hello Destiny. It actually doesn't work with macs. To be honest, I tried a number of things. However, the only option that I could see was to use the software while running VMWare or Parallels so you can run Windows on your Mac, and be able to allow this to work. However, if you're still looking to have something that works similar, but doesn't cost as much, here are some links that may be helpful: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s5EvhHy7eQ or http://johnnylee.net/projects/wii/ . These options use a Wii remote as an IR camera. I hope this helps :)
Yes, it comes with the required software
I believe you should ask the seller. I have o experience with Mac systems only Microsoft OS. Sorry. Gilberto.
It fits, their are two separate cords that comes with it. You have to connect both of them first.
Only one pair is compatible....
No not this unit
I don't think so, unless you have a converter optical to 3.5 jack
Yes. It plays files from USB, aux in and SD card. Plays MP3 and mp4 in my expirience
Got one for the wife and she loves it works great
I'm pretty sure that it does - I just removed Hynix 2GB PC3-10600 DDR3 from my MacBook.
That is the oem sub display output, it allows on some vehicles to keep a factory sub display operating with this aftermarket headunit. It can display things like track info and radio tuning ect depending on the vehicle. A vehicle specific interface is required.
Don't know if it will fit the car but it will work with most back up cameras. The face plate and harness will have to be purchased separately and bought specific to the vehicle. Hope this helps
yes
Yes it can. I have tested it
No, it will not.
I'm using the Bose Jewel speakers (I forgot what model but it goes along with the new V series, and they are not the ultra small ones, they are the standard size). This mount seems to work pretty well, but I don't know if I'd trust it to hold much more weight than that.
While very roomy, the main compartment is not really designed for bulk. The dimensions are 17"L x 11"W, however the bulk aspect would likely not allow for easy closure as the height is only about 7". Not really designed for much bulk other then power cords, adapters, batteries-all slimmer profiles. Very roomy for those, though. Duffel type bag would likely be best alternative.
You can not remove the keyboard from the case. As light as it is though, it's not too bulky when flipping the keyboard back to just use the ipad mini by itself.
We haven't watched movies on it but youtube videos are great. I think it would be fine.
its compatibal with many others cases
Yes, it does.
yes
this card is a radeon card, it works fine, its clean and has a great screen
Yes its comes installed with Windows 8 from factory
No weights, no handle by camera. Just use weights from walmart or target, etc.
I took the screen protector a while ago because started to peel by the corners and it looks good, I'm really enjoying this tablet
No, it is tied to the wireless signal that it produces.
Answer from Titantech: The size is the same. You needn't buy any bezel trim.
Answer from Titantech: Does your car have original navigation? It cann't support original navigation. Please send us a picture of your dashboard.
No it won't
Pretty sure i got a year with mine, It's been a very solid PSU i bought mine back in September and it's been going great since.
This is a TFX type supply which is a standard form factor for desktop computers. Check the one that comes out of your Optiplex to see if it's TFX as well. If it is, the only question that remains is whether the wires are long enough to reach peripherals etc.
It always goes back to the home position
no
azreader, This will connect the television to a wired Ethernet port for television updates. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
No because I don't have one. I do have a 65 in, and I do not know if it swivels, because I have it mounted on the wall. Sorry
Besides the cardboard cover that can't with it no
Yes it does.
I'm not sure cause that part I order was wrong my car is an "03 but I need a "05 part so I'm sorry I couldn't help
I am not sure of the Amps but I would not use this item. I had one its not stable you constantly have to remove and re-plugin the aircard. I moved to a Hotspot with a cig plug problem solved. Even if you need more users they now make Hotspots that hold up to 80 users. This item is no longer needed. In 2015 this is the Mickey Mouse way to get WiFi out of an old ariacrd.
Works wonderfully with PP and is extremely bright. We have had no problem with having to worry too much about darkening the room. I could not figure out how to get the projector linked with the computer to work the slide advance feature (I'm not too technically oriented). Solved the problem, however, for twelve bucks by picking up Oem Presenter with Laser Pointer and Powerpoint Presentation Remote Control Clicker (O-PRC-0130). It is really slick, with forward/reverse feature, plus a laser pointer. It works like a champ. Good luck. Cheers...Ed B.
Hook computer speaker's to it. Using an rca plug that turns into a headphone type jack at the other
100~240VAC (Auto Switching), 50/60Hz (universal)
No Jeff
Hello Captain Understatement, Thanks for your interest! Yes, this item has one USB port and one HDMI port. We hope this works for you because we would love to get your business today!
Try removing the power cord completely, from the tv as well as the outlet, for a half hour or so. It may be a static electricity build up, which needs to drain off.
The Sansui is a very good TV and can compite with other famous brand as equal quality at a very good price.
yes
squaretrade!
No it doen not have GPS and it does not have bluetooth
This is the sites I used! Chirp program site = http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Wiki Sites to help with programming = http://www.baofengradio.com/en/services.asp To fix file above http://shell.windows.com/fileassoc/0409/xml/redir.asp?Ext=LST http://www.miklor.com/ I have found this is a great radio. Very easy to program from computer with Chirp program. AJ

I would think it DOES... but the guy who made it is VERY helpful answering questions... so go to his website and email him. He'll likely answer within minutes. It's a pretty handy tool by the way. I've enjoyed it.
Yes it will. I have a 16gb disk and it stored approx 60 min. of footage.
Yes very durable
Highly highly recommend you not to buy this trash. I brought mine 2 years ago, and it was defected totally as it came out from the box. Yes, it can change to Spanish or any languages you want. Don't buy it, change other brands.
we can send an instruction to you if you can let me know your order #. Thanks
I have never seen the Arc referred to as an EBOK. The Arc is a tablet 1st and a reader secondly. I think that by EBOK they are referring to one of the Kobo E readers.
Yes, all you need to do is to download the audible app in google play. so easy and sounds great
Its amazing I can read all my kindle books on it. I canot read my kobo books on my kindle. Kobo arc is a wonderful tablet thinking about getting another one I use it every day at work and home
yes it works perfectly, it is 110-220v compatible without using anything
Unfortunately no! there is no way to retrieve a note on the RIP itself. Once saved and erased that's the last you're going to see of your note on the board you can modify on the computer later on when you transfer your notes.
Awful. Am about to upgrade to 4 GB and see if that makes a difference.
Yes, you can add two extra fans on the left side panel. Any size. Make sure you have enough fan controller plugins, if not buy a fan controller card to plug into a PCIe slot.
Go to the settings mode and go to join networks & click yes. If it ask for a password put it in
As far as drivers just google audio drivers for whatever computer you have. Your computer shoud have a 3.5mm jack in the back, same as where your regular speakers would plug into.
I recommend them very good
I used this hard drive for my ps3. It says that is works with mostly any laptop. It might if your notebook has a slot for a 2.1 inch sata hard drive compatability.
If I'm understanding your question correctly, you want to play PS4 games on your PS3. The short answer is: you can't. If you want to play PS4 games, you need to have a PS4.
Of course you have to do the whole thing. You would need the restore/ setup CD from PC Mfr.
I installed a screen protector and slid my Kindle into the case without a problem. Now, I took my time and made sure to take the pressure off by slightly lifting the case's framework while sliding the device in (to prevent the screen protector from peeling away at the corners). No problem at all with my experience.
I dont know becouse charger was difective
1200 mAh
Yes, you can charge your kindle. Generally speaking if you have a USB charge cord for any device, you should be able to use Jackery.
The EN model is Pal and is designed for use in Europe. the PJ model is designed for U.S. if you are going to use the camera hers buy the PJ. if you are going to use in Europe buy the EN. The EN model does not have a U.S warranty or the three year extended warranty.
You can not load a CD collection. It has a single CD drawer you can use like a standard CD player. It has AM/FM radio and a dock for the older style Apple products. I plug my iPhone 4S into it and use iTunes. It looks quite nice and adds a lot to room.
Probably because SanDisk produced less of them, meaning a higher per-unit cost. That cost is, in turn, passed onto the consumer. It's unfortunate.
It is for a computer or a USB wall charger.
Nope. Sorry. Pictures on the card can be viewed (via wifi) in a browser on the laptop, but new pictures can't be added to the card from the laptop. It's a one-way street.
Yes. they work with my BenQ W1070 perfectly. Like all 3d Glasses.. you will lose some screen bright while wearing them but I have really enjoyed them with several 3d movies. Worth to buy!
As long as your projector is DLP it should work fine. Works great with my Optoma HD33. Mine even work with my Toshiba 65" LED 3D tv. Active 3D of course.
my projector is a viewsonic, I dont know about the optoma
I don't think so If the adapter needs to contact the entire bottom edge of the nook then no it will not fit with the case on. I don't use one myself.
The cover is broken in now and it fits very snugly when closed. One trick is to use double stick tape to secure the part that sticks to the back of the surface. This prevents it from moving or sliding off of the tablet during use. I don't have any problems with the auto sleep/wake feature. I always turn the power off when I close the cover.
It pairs via Bluetooth, not cable. The cable is to charge the keyboard battery. The directions have instructions on how to put the keyboard into pairing mode and the nook has a section in its options for Bluetooth pairing.
I have been using it on my 9" nook HD since last Christmas with no prolem.
I don't think so...my grandkids have them now and they love them. But I think they only hold them horizontally!
I have had no problems with this cover. It works great, and I don't see any damage to the Nook.
I bought 3 just last month...they all have the holes for the speakers.
It will work with a usb Hub, however there is no way to charge and use it at the same time.
Remove the vertical brackets over so they face inward thereby matching the narrowness of your holes on back of tv
Hello Phillip and thank you for your interest in our product. We do not recommend you adjust the height of the stand while the TV is mounted. You would need to find the desired height before putting the TV on the stand. Please feel free to contact me for further assistance. Thanks again Andrea
It all depends on what you are doing with it
Yes if you use internet to download it first
With RCA inputs, you would need a "y" into mini male cable. Like this: http://www.amazon.com/3-5mm-Stereo-Male-Dual-Y-Cable/dp/B001UG823K/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1427376122&sr=8-6&keywords=Y+rca Hope that helps.
On the European system? If that's what you're asking....no it won't, and I'm not sure if it would work with a converter.
It's Android.
I can't answer specifically for this player, but we had purchased a Vizio 3D Bluray player to go with our Vizio 3D TV. We assumed it would be a perfect combination, but we found that we needed both remotes and they conflicted. Pressing buttons on the TV remote would activate the player, which would then take control of the TV via HDMI, which would exit us out of Netflix or whatever we were watching. Ultimately we returned the Vizio player in favor of a different brand to avoid remote control conflicts.
Visio no longer makes DVD players or updates to the old ones. The dvd players on the market today are very old and folks trying to sell them off. Be fore warned "Do Not Buy Visio DVD"s".
Yes. For me, I used it for the Surface RT and it fit perfectly. I've had it for months and use it daily and I've never had a problem with it.
not sure never used it on anything but Egyptian cotton
It just unscrews, counterclockwise turn from the top. May take a little pressure to get it started to turn off. Leaves a 1/4" x 20 thread stud on the tripod to screw the pistol grip onto.
Model is MD516LL/A Thank you
Yes I do Thanks
Depends on your glasses. I wear glasses and they were the same shape as the 3d so they sat well under. I would imagine if they are too thick or too round it could feel awkward.
I can't imagine why not. I used it to connect an AppleTV to a DVD recorder to record shows from the Apple and it worked fine. I'm not familiar with that particular Comcast unit but I imagine this box will work with any HDMI output. I assume this is for after the fact transfer of shows, I don't believe it would work as a "destination" for the Comcast box.
Absoultely! I tried using only the built-in speakers in the television itself, but they weren't loud enough to hear and sounded distorted at high volume levels. I purchased oCosmo's sound bar and connected it to the television. The sound is much better and volume is more than adequate.
There are softkeys on the unit to control source and volume.
It's running Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. I really haven't played with it much. I know you can go to the Google Play store and get apps. I just don't know how they play out through the sound bar. I'll update review once I do.
Subwoofer is built in.
The Owner's Manual refers to the warranty as a "$100,000 5-year connected products limited warranty". The warranty is for "actual cash value", not "replacement cost value". The rest of the fine print appears to include the common definitions and limitations.
Does not swivel. The only part that moves it the male end that plugs into the wall and it folds in, making it easyier for traveling?
I had issues with them ...they made it right by me
The answer is yes. There are several models of the T100TA comprised of different features. This unit happens to be an older model in 32GB SSD. I have owned both the older version and the new version with 64 GB drive. The EVEcase fit on both.
I have an Intel Pentium 4 with 2.5 g of RAM and it worked fine, but I replaced it with an NVidia 256 because the GeForce could not do the job for a game I wanted to play. Sorry I don't think that answered your question, but I wouldn't want to venture to say it will work on a 386 machine.
I installed this in an older Dell Dimension 5150 with Windows 7 operating system. The Windows 7 Operating System recognized the video card and automatically installed the drivers. No problems with installation.
Yes
I am not a gamer but the unit is set up for just about anything.the dvd works fine and I have burned several cds. go for it. good luck. chas
Integrated graphics, specifically Intel GMA 3000. There is no room to add a dedicated graphics card, so you're stuck with what you get. This is a good computer if you just want to browser the internet and do some word processing, but heavy photo editing and gaming are out of the question.
About 30 feef
I use it with iPod touch 4th gen. and its great sound. To recieve the AptX codec on the Roxio you need an AptX transmitter on the iPod. There are several on line at Amazon, just do a search. I use one by KOKKIA, the i10s tiny blutooth transmitter for iPod, iPhone, iPad. Hope this helps.
there is not a preloaded word processing program. I don't know if there is an app - i haven't looked. good luck.
NO, IT DOES NOT
I don't know. They are all refurbished computers.
Yes
Yes. You can set the VFO to 2.5 Khz steps.
I dont think so. No.
Yes. At least, in my experience, mine seems to have a very narrow threshold for lighting the 100% light, and a very broad threshold for the 75% light. When charging in the sunlight, it takes significantly longer to light the 100% light than the three before it, and it drops back to just the first three quicker as well. Functionally though, it works perfectly.
It won't significantly charge a computer and like many people who have posted complaints, the solar panels on mine ave never worked. It is a goof external battery for cell phones and pads.
Requires an HDMI cable to hook to a TV. NOT included.
This Blu-Ray & DVD player does have an HDMI out connector, buy your own cord. I'm guessing you are asking about the Apple-TV type device from Amazon. I don't have one, so I don't know. Search for the Amazon "box?" pdf and read the requirements section to see if an HDMI connector is all that is needed.
Give a proper rating...warn others......maybe send it back for a detective product if u want to go through the trouble...or deal with it and do not make any changes because it may destroy the properties of the case... GL :)
FYI only, I received a used unit with a dead battery. Not recommended,period.
The button on top does not change colors. It is only a power button to go from flashing light to solid light and then it turns off the third time you push the button. I've never charged it on a USB charge only solar and has never died on me
We actually bought this to monitor an output source during one of our company's live meetings. It handled a live video feed just fine through the HDMI input. Not sure exactly what issue you might be facing.
Yes, it does fit the iPad Mini retina deaplay.
Maybe not, if you mean a Define R3 case. The Fractal web site lists this R4 Midi panel dimensions as being 480MM x 439MM. It lists the define R3 windowed panel as being 480mm x 427mm.
Wrong brand. It's only meant for fractal design's Arc Midi and Define R4. So, I doubt it
My son has been using this mouse with a Dell Inspiron laptop running Windows 7. No problems whatsoever. As long as you are running an up-to-date Windows operating system, you should be able to plug the receiver into a USB port and then the device driver will automatically install. The mouse is also nice and lightweight. Seems robust. I recommend it.
Yes Roman, it will. I'm actually using it on my PC running windows 8.1. I do have a caveat: the mouse has a button that does "page forward and page back". It can be annoying if you have large hands.
It has a regular outlet plug so you could plug it in somewhere but does not have batteries
It is good **** but much better as a blue tooth for phone or computer..
It can be updated to Android v4.1.2 and yes, it has Google Play.
only if you have a verizon sim card... i've taken the one out of my phone and it worked with the tablet
Yes. The USB port is also the charging port. I charge mine from my computer when I'm on it and from the wall charger when I'm not on it.
The Xyboard updates to 4.1.2 for the Verizon version. The wifi only version upgrades only to 4.0.4. Make sure that you do not root before your upgrade.
No, it doesn't . You have to use only a flash or buy an external drive . It does cause problems sometimes.
No, and no side numeric keyboard either! , image not accurate
I have the same problem. Overall I am not impressed. Ill keep it though for a back up. Buy a product called Genius, they are awesome.
Yes
Think of it like a tiny kickstand in the upper corner on the back of the case. I personally would not count on that piece supporting the weight of the device and would not recommend buying the case for that sole feature. The loop hole exists, but I can tell you it will likely not hold up. However the integrity of the primary case shell is outstanding.
Most likley. It may not work with all the features like the volume control or the mic but it will get the music through for about a month or two before it breaks
It fits fine without the keyboard and is flat. I use mine without the keyboard most of the time. Interesting as this is the question I had before I purchased it.
I love mine. I haven't taken it off since I got it. I use the keyboard all the time.
No it does not support Amazon or Amazon Prime, but it does support Vudu.
My Subaru does not have steering wheel controls .
It comes with Windows 8
The battery is removable. It has a release latch that requires a small object (like an ink pen, etc) to slide the latch, so you can't accidentally release the battery.
Yes it does :)
Here is a chart that includes discharge information as it relates to temperature: http://vmaxtanks.com/charge_discharge_charts.pdf
I have a small fridge (4.5CF) and I run it off one of these batteries plus a four 85 AH batteries. The batteries supply more than enough power and I believe one 125 AH battery would run the fridge alone. I run lights, fridge, TV off my system.
No you can not. :)
No it does not
Outside of some google apps, it comes free of bloatware, crapware and manufacturers overlays. One of the best things about the nexus devices.
Yes
Yes it will work
Factory warranty is applied.
Absolutely, this is a great device for movies. If you subscribe to Netflix or hulu or something like that you can stream shows. You can also dowwnload them or copy them from you desktop or laptop to watch when you don't have a good WiFi connection.
I bought this item and Mophie verified that it was not authentic.
Apparently not. My purchase turned out to be counterfeit. If you want to guarantee you get the real thing, physically walk into Best Buy and purchase one. Amazon doesn't seem too concerned about counterfeits being sold on their site. Don't lose $100 like the rest of us.
A trial version of Office 10
The flash unit comes with a bracket you can attach to the bottom of the camera (where you would attach a tripod) and that holds the flash unit off to one side. Remember to set the flash on 2 (i.e. skip the first camera flash) unless you are using red eye reduction - then you go higher. I have been very satisfied with this flash and would recommend it to anyone with a wimpy built in flash (like the GF3)
It can be detached and replaced.
Yes it is
I havefound it is around 3 to 4 hours. Charge it every night.
U can setup office -word its like windows 7 ! i dont remember if is come with word and powerpoint i format the hard disk befor view weeks And i dont know about netflix but its like windows 7 what u can do it there u can do it n windos 8
Go to the Asus website. Its not very user friendly but you can find it there.
Measurements are 9 x 9. Hope that helps!
Yes
No
The Toshiba Satellite C850d-107 Laptop Model uses an autosensing AC adapter with an output voltage of 19V and an output current of 2.37A. We do have this AC Adapter available and you can purchase from this same link and specify your Laptop Model at checkout or a send a message after checkout for confirmation. Hope this helps.
yes
I got a blue one and do not know that answer to your question ... actual color does not mean much to me outside of being able to see the phone on a black surface when I put it down
Did not work with Mophie Juice pack. It is too large for the headphone hole on the Mophie
There is an on-off switch. Just turn it on and plug your input in.
No, the power input is in the back. The two inputs on the front are headphone and 3.5mm for audio.
i don't think so.
System requirements -Windows XP-Vista-Windows 7-8 Mac 10.5 above
No. You would have to by an external adapter for a cd drive. It does however have 2 USB drives.
I don't have a ruler handy, but the case is about one quarter inch larger on all sides than the nexus 7. A good fit. Keyboard held, very securely, by Velcro. I like the case very well so far.
I would think you could as long as it is not raining, since the device is not waterproof. Also, it will only work up to about 50 feet. Blessings...John
Lol. I asked the seller that same question. Yes, you can use a second set. Buy another one...I did!!! I still love them! Have had no problems with any of them.
If you buy the Nikon mount set, they work on a variety of lenses. I don't have a D7000. I have D3200 and D5100 and I use them with the kit lens(18-55), and a Sigma 18-250. They work great with both these lenses. I've been just using one tube at a time. With the Sigma lens, I can get good close-ups at about 12 inches.
I don't use mine any more. It's a Canadian product and really hard to get things like gift cards for it or borrow library books
yes
Hello, thank you for your question. This item is sold by various sellers. Some sellers choose to ship internationally and some do not. The easiest way to check if the item can be shipped to your location would be to add it to your cart and then click the "proceed to checkout" button. An error message will appear if it is not able to be delivered to your destination. If you are able to proceed through the order process you will be shown shipping methods/speed/prices to chose from. I hope this helps!
NO;((
Yes, apparently. However, I have not used it for this purpose. See the link for important details. http://patriotmemory.com/product/detail.jsp?prodline=7&catid=91&prodgroupid=250&id=1353&type=11
This is how it is listed in manual. Power supply: AC 100v~240V 0.2/0.1A 50/60Hz worldwide range (US and Canada plug)
yes. I've purchased the same one and it worked for me.
Im not sure I would call LG thats what I did. They told me what I needed for my DVD player.
No, it is proprietary to that particular LG model
Hello, it worked on my blu ray player great! Watch netflix on TV now. It is so nice.
mine never worked.
Worked twice on 5s and the. Said not supported. I have another Belkin car charger and it works fine. So I don't know.
I would think it does as I believe the mini iPad w retina has the same dimensions as the mini iPad.
No
Yes, a screen protector was included. My daughter opted not to use it. When she applied it, she was unable to get the air bubbles out!
No
Yes, it is equipped with infra-red lights and they light things up out to about 20 or so ft
No, it is not a smart TV. It has an MHL port (1), which means you can hook up a Roku Ready Stick, which essentially makes it a smart TV. You can also hook up a phone via HDMI 1 through that port as well.
remove your bluetooth connection completely and try synching again.
So long as you can search for specific speakers you should be good.
It has the standard micro usb port. Any phone charger will work. I don't remember if it came with one or not but if you don't have an extra phone charger you can purchase an ac/dc adapter with usb and mini usb charger on here for a minimal fee. The battery can't be replaced but there should be no reason. You should be able to recharge.
No you can not dock an iPhone or any type of phone or mp3 player. It is a Bluetooth speaker that does have a MP3 link for players that are not Bluetooth capable. I stream my Pandora and also my downloaded music from my phone or my tablet all the time.
Height: Satellites: 6-1/2" (each); center-channel: 4" Width: Satellites: 3-3/4" (each); center-channel: 15" Depth: Satellites: 4-7/8" (each); center-channel: 3-1/2"
this screen protector has cut-outs (e.g.,camera) for the Samsung Galaxy that might not match on your HP Slate. Look for one that matches your device so you don't cover up these vital screen areas.
I usually just breathe on it and then polish it of with a towel. Works great! If the kids were using it with jelly fingers *sigh* I use a damp cloth to clean it off (without any cleaner or soap).
Ethernet Technology: Gigabit Ethernet Wi-Fi: Yes Wi-Fi Standard: IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n Bluetooth: Yes
Yes
contact geovision support. they are very helpful.
I down loded them from the century link web site
Marvin, I have this unit and 40MBPS with Century Link. So, it should work for you. Kerry
I only send 1000 watts amp to 2 15" speakers so I guess 500watts for each speaker.
Hi Adrian, my 9mm hard disk (standard size 2.5 inch hard disk) seems to be the max this enclosure can take (it is a bit of a squeeze inside the enclosure). Anything fatter would be a problem I reckon. For any fatter hard disk I would go for the Vantec enclosure which specifically states support for 12.5mm thickness.
Hello it has 80cm Regards
no
It has a place to put a small strap.Does not come with the strap though.
Hi John, No, it does not have an HDMI port. It comes, however, with VGA-In, S-Video, Composite Video, Audio-In RCA (L/R), Audio-In (Mini-Jack), and RS-232C ports. Thanks, PCrush
First check batteries on remote. This unit has a 3D sound feature on the remote. It's either off or on. It has no equalizer presets but the nice part is that you have seperate bass and trebel controls. I prefer this rather than presets. I hope this answers your question.
You have to use the remote for the Pyle to to turn audio on. The TV remote will just adjust TV volume. You not not have to have the TV on to use USB, SD etc. Hope this helps.
H 4.7" x W 9.8" x L 23.8"
Yes, it is very easy to switch back and forth from portrait to landscape without loosening anything, and is an excellent product. I wasted money on a cheap model before finding the K&M. Have been extremely pleased. Bill
Make sure you have accessed Bluetooth in settings and turned it to "on" on iPad. Then when you turn keyboard on there should be a blue flash , but light will then go out. Then Try pushing the round button on the very top of the keyboard. There are no directions to do this but it seems to make the keyboard discoverable to the the iPad. Once you push that button iPad should ask if you want to sync keyboard to iPad. When you tell it yes it should work!
This will work perfect. You simply increase the distance between the object and the lens until your stamp or coin fills the whole screen (or whatever portion you desire). It is perfect for making a full screen sized stamp or coin. With the lens touching a stamp, for example, you could see the paper fibers individually.. pull them apart and it will in effect, zoom out.
There is a screen protector, but I didn't like it and took it off. I really like my Otter Box. I've dropped my phone more times than I can count and the Otter Box really protected it well. I buy one with every new phone that I get.
No. It only fits DNA.
It should fit over a Zagg just fine... Plus the Zagg is durable enough to take it
I don't think so - the hinges are quite stiff (not bendy) and are coated with a black shellac.
7200rpm
Yes, the Otterbox is an excellent case and shield to protect your cell phone. If you do decide to purchase the Otterbox, be sure buy the Otterbox Defender model. This includes a screen protector that you will find is very easy to apply.
I have a 15" Samsung laptop and there's about 2" left on the side and about 2.5" on the end
Yes it can. I have the first bose sound dock speaker and works very well
With the dt version, it will fit but according to dell their pci slot can only supply 35 watts of power and the HD 6570 requires 50 watts. Possibly it could run but no guarantees. The 6450 although far less powerful (not that the 6570 is powerful) needs about 31 watts. Hope this helps! Best of luck, Evan.
Yes
You can but not sure if it is particularly for this case
my ipod touch 5th generation OtterBox Defender series case came with no holster much to my dismay, but was told by someone that works at Best Buy that they did not think the holster came with the ipod only for the iphone. And that seems to be the case.
It pretty much covers the blue. It protects super.
It doesn't matter what GB your iPod is, it'll fit. The only thing that matters is that it's an iPod 5th generation. But, to answer your question - yes it wil fit. I have this case (boom color) on a 16 gb.
30 days from date of purchase. However if you register it with Logitech it extends to 1 year.
Don't know as my key board quite working after 3 or 4 uses
New
Yes it was
If you mean a real otterbox; yes it is. It does fit my ipod touch perfect. If you don't have a 5th Gen they you need to look at another one.
It's more like 2 shades of purple. Very elegant.
Yes, you can use all the buttons with this case.
I can't say I've noticed anything like this, I would exchange the unit for a new one.
It doesn't have a stand other than the keyboard dock, if that's what you're asking.
1. No, you can not access the battery. 2. Depends what you are doing, but with they kwybaord attached anywhere from 6-10+ hours. More like 6 if you're playing games, but if you turn the screen brightness down and just surf the internet you'll get decent time out of the battery.
I really don't know, I only have the iPhone 5. My personal opinion is that the Olloclip is a piece of crap, but I have been chastised for making my feelings known by at least one remarkably smart person, who seems to be an expert opinionist on the subject.
Just did some research and I don't think it will fit right. The version for the iPhone 6 is due out in November.
No it is not detachable. Can't answer why they call it a USB cable, it definately is not.
Any device with USB
Yes
I have used Metz 50 AF-1 (for Nikon) flashes with the Odin and they work well
Yes It doe's. Drawing app are already pre installed. My model is 2 years old and the app is on it.
No and the tablet is total crap :)
Hello! This product is not a complete screen fit due to the curved edges of the Galaxy S3 (which is similar to most dry fit S3 protectors). There are models which are full fit but we do not sell them due to how extremely thin they need to be to stick to the curves. If you look at the product images for this product, you will see image number 6 shows exactly the cutout for this model. Thanks! Smooth Global
Yes my husband uses it for his. He says be steady though as you apply and centered.
I use the tablet outdoors when the weather is nice but that would be usually in the shade and I find it satisfactory. Reading the tablet in bright sunshine, for me, is a bit of a challenge. I have found that positioning the tablet so it is shaded in sunlight makes for better reading....like say putting your body between the sun and the Nook.
Assuming it's not dead try plugging it into ur computer and reboot ur device
Hello Wynbeardies, Thank you for contacting us regarding the Nook HD for sale. Unfortunately, Nook tablets do not take pictures. But you can store picture and video files onto its internal storage or in a Micro SD Memory Card, and view them through the Gallery app. If you have any further questions, please feel free to let us know in a reply. We would be happy to assist you. Thank you very much for considering shopping with EZCorp on Amazon.com! Have a great day, Wynbeardies!
Go to the xda developers forum , I think you need 2 different apps that allow you to side load the amazon prime app. In other words, you would be installing the app through the micro sd slot and not from the app store, another way is to root your nook, same as jailbreaking, N2A cards are about 20 dollars and they root your nook very easily
Idk. I use the office suite that is provided but have not tried to download either of those programs.
It is a Nook specific 30 pin connector that cannot be substituted with other 30 pin connectors.
Depends on what your perspective of what "older" means.It's got a pretty decent amount of space for a tablet and the screen is HD,not the original "paper" look with the backlight.
My Nook HD does retrieve email, no problems.
No, Inside only, not built for the elements.
yes
It come with 250 GB Hard Drive and Windows 7 Professional Installation disk. Thank you for your interest
Yes
This is not the best by far what it is is verily acceptable but it does work halfway decent .If I were looking to get a tablet I would go with the one from amazon , I think they call it the amazon fire tablet . The 6 inch one goes for $99.99 and the 7 inch goes for about $139.00 or a little lower on sale
No, there is an individual control coming with the sound bar.
If the battery is 1/4 full, and if you charge it at rate of 2.2 amps, it will take roughly 40 to 45 minutes.
A
I do not know for sure. I use on a W510 and it was worth every penny. You may want to check with tech support on acer.com for the best answer.
It can be tilted, but not raised up or down (you'll have to revert to the old fashioned solution put it on top of an appropriate number of books ... jh
I connected this monitor to a computer running Ubuntu and no CD-ROM was needed.
You can connect via wired LAN through USB-ethernet adaptor.
Do u mean is the stylus pen compatible
At least in my case, although I have MAC as well, the device came with an installation disk for windows only. I used on Windows. PS: Extremely happy with the easy of use and performance in windows.
I used mine with Linux.. It never really tried with Windows 8. It really did not work right...distorted video.....
Yes, will work on win7, and 8/8.1
I've tried current gen consoles on this thing, and I got a ton of controller lag. (Also this capture card is not the real one, its a replacement to the EZcap)
No there is not. However, this is the only downside to the whole cover. When the cover is folded open and you can access the pogo charger port there.
I see a link for the 7" version. Here it is: http://www.amazon.com/MoKo-Slim-fit-Google-Android-Tablet/dp/B008FLYROG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1364918202&sr=8-1&keywords=moko+slim+nexus+7
I have no idea. I did not receive warranty information .
Yes, it does pass audio.
No. Charges at the same rate as a regular Apple cable
yes,how many do u want to buy ,we can ship for u though DHL.
The rubber base that holds the metal plug is L shaped so the cord lies flat against the side of the handset. The metal plug that goes in to the phone is round. The diameter of the plug is smaller than the plug attached to a cell phone headset. I believe this headset can only be used for a portable phone.
I have two small children here with me, and the size seemed to fit them fine. The quality of the sound just was not good.
I believe so. But not 100 percent sure on that. Works good just make sure you put it above your license plate. Mine is on the side and it's way off .
The case itself has quite a bit of space in it. The limiting factor is the water-tight opening. According to the manufacturer, phones at or below the following dimensions will fit: Maximum Height: 4.9"/124mm Maximum Width: 2.6"/67mm Maximum Depth: .75"/19mm I don't know the dimensions of your phone, but as long as it's no more than what's stated above, it should fit.
It might be, I'm not sure, but is adjustable like you just said!
I have used the same controller with a Rebel XSI and a T4 so unless for some reason the T3 has a different plug in it should work. I have used mine for several years and they work great.
Yes, because it has the full Win 8 app; the Surface does not. This tablet is the equivalent of the Surface RT but cost much less.
No. However you could find out from the manufacturer if they have hidden one somewhere that the public can't find. Short answer-no.
It comes with a usb cable and a wall plug in to usb. So yes it has an AC power cord.
The speaker has a battery that lasts at least ten hours. Music can be sent to the speaker wirelessly through a device that has Bluetooth. It can also be directly plugged into a device with a 3.5mm stereo cable. There are many ways to use this in a car, so the answer is yes!
I am familiar with that specific receiver, however, if it has Bluetooth capabilities it should be able to connect with speaker. Keep it mind that this a small speaker with good sound quality , yet it is not a replacement for a main speaker system.
It does come with a velvet (ish) pouch.
I googled "what is the oontz angle amp wattage". I saw an answer of "it pushes out 10 watts". Any thing else, just what the description says. As a user, I can tell you, it plays loud enough for me. It's certainly not meant for orchestral sound, but for a Bluetooth, it works very well. There is a warranty that comes with it. I tossed that paper work, so I can't answer. Cambridge soundworks is the maker of the oontz.
No sure, but it has a USB charging cable and a sound cable. My guess: if you can use headphones, you can use this.
Speaker has it's own volume control. For maximum volume keep iPhone at highest volume and use the speaker to modulate.
Yes, it is listed with "4 GB DDR3 SDRAM". Thanks, Skyline Engineering, Inc.
I haven't looked, it works well for a dash cam. I'm pleased with all that goes with the camera. Simple.
It should...the S4 has a bottom charging port like the S3, and this dock accommodates a few different thicknesses.
Yes. Am a PG& E residential customer in Bay Area and have been using Rainforest EAGLE for more than a year. Initial pairing of the SmartMeter to the EAGLE gateway required a call to PG&E, rest of the setup was easy. I use this device with Bidgely ( http://bidgely.com/ ) cloud based service to view energy use dis aggregation.
the graphics card is a plug in board that improves graphic speed and/or video sharpness.
Yes it works, The drivers you receive with package only come with drivers for windows xp, windows vista but if you have window 7 you are going to have to down load it. don't worry its easy to find. I don't now for windows 8, I'm sure there is a driver I've just never looked for it didn't need it.
Hi, it comes with a CD software, you needn't to download any other software from net. PS: This item will compatible with Windows 2000/XP/Vista/Win7.
No, it does not fit well. You can't work the buttons with the case on.
It includes: * Kanex 4-port USB 3 Hub * 5V/4-amps International Power Adapter * SuperSpeed USB 3 A-Micro B cable
It is charged via usb cable. The usb is built into the right ear bud. There's a led built into the right earbud. It lights up when the cable is plugged into your computer. It turns from red to green when the head phones are fully charged.
Yes, you can play/pause track, step back/ahead, up/down volume, answer/drop calls, turn headphones on/off and perform voice command if available on the phone. A nice voice provides feedback for main actions, and alerts on battery low and connection down.
I tried to transfer itunes from windows x/p to windows 8 but did not have any success.
well the acer iconia w510 is being discontinued, the switch 10 is replaceing it just got one so i am not sure yet how it is it is suppose to better the the w510
If you intend to use your SIM card for internet access, yes it will work. In my opinion, it is better to use wireless internet access.
Yes
The arm between the monitor bracket and the pole is about 9 inches. The monitor bracket (with its hinge) is about 1 and a half inches. The monitor bracket rotates, as does the arm that connects to the pole. This allows a whole lot of adjustment as to the final location of the monitor.
Outside diameter: Just a hair over 1 3/8 inches.
It seems that the clamp would accommodate about 4".
No
It uses full size sim. You'll need an adapter that you can get for a few bucks around here.
Yes it is, with a phone app and it doesn't come with a SIM card
About 5 hours per charge. Obviously it depends on what you're viewing and at what brightness, but we're very happy with the battery.
I don't think its power retain capaity because of 65 Watt power adapter, it will just take more time to charge. Where as 90 Watt adapter can charge it fast. If you feel it is because of 65 watt adapter try 90 watt adapter before purchasing it. I hope this will help...
Yes, I sent mine back. I don't recommend it. You can get better flash on here for same money or less. Look up Yongnu.
It should. It works for my Nikon Camera.
No. I use it on my ipod
Yes
Yes they are.
Sadly no. Because the lens has no threads around it to screw the filter holder on.
Yes they are vary good adapter ring. I would recommend the set Thanks Tom
The ring sizes are based on the size of lens diameter. If you have a lens with a 55mm lens cap, you will use the 55mm ring. Connect the ring to the filter holder and then slide the ring over the lens so the filter is in front of the lens.
Yes they can but if you want all four available on the back of the computer you will need an adapter plate with cables which will extend the internal plugs to the back.
No
It will work but you'll have to shave out most of the ridges that's been molded onto the flat part of the battery. It's a pain but the battery last a long time.
The little connection on the battery is for a charger. You will need a separate charger cable for this. You can charge the radio either using this connection or through the charger that came with the radio.
I dont like is o rady broken
They do not
yes I do believe so... not the big one but the regular hd..I bought it for my black one
Should if it has a remote control.
No. SLR are too heavie.
Yes it does
The Phottix Flash Triggers are made for Canon and Phottix products only. The circuitry is different in other flash manufactures products, my Sigma EF-610DG Super Flash for Canon does not work with the Phottix Flash Trigger. You would have to go to the PocketWizard to use a trigger for all flashes on your Canon. I now use a Canon 580EX ll, 430EX ll, and the Phottix Mitros. I use my sigma with the built in optic flash trigger instead.
It does not come in a box. Mine came meticulously rolled and protected by tissue prior to being placed in a shipping tube 3 and 3/4 inches in diameter and 76 inches long.
Although I have not done it myself but I am pretty sure that these hardwares just need their respective drivers to download.
Close to a foot and a half wide in the front and close to two feet wide in the back. Less then a foot in dept. It is not noticeable after a day or two, and is very stylish, can brig any style room together.
No it's a mic only.
Yes, it will work with the A1398 model (currently using).
Yes, I believe that that should go away in a day or two ... I also you it on my iPad with the Retina display and ha be no evidence of pixelation... Hope this helped... Regards ... Vito
My application of the screen protector is clear without distortion. Your case sounds like an air bubble. Recommend carefully lifting the corner nearest the distortion and reset the shield where there distortion is located. Make sure ther are no air bubbles.
Yes, it can. But you cannot record it on a mac or even inside the flash card that you put inside the camera, even if the manual says you can. You can just watch the videos and setup the camera perfectly.
Yes there is!
Yes
I've enjoyed Skyrim at maximum settings with graphics modifications at playable frame rates. Hope that helps!
Don't know if it will fit. You can get it and try it but if don't fit send it back.
It didn't work on my Note 3. I lost my money.
There may be but without the model number of your tv to see a diagram we cannot tell.
No the manufacturer does not show an additional wire coming with the part. It is probably a seperate part number.
yes
It's not that simple, but yes. Suggest you google this question in your browser: "how to transfer data from one external hard drive to another".
Not sure what your question is, but my drive failed repeatedly when I tried to copy the files from an old drive. I sent it back, got my refund, and bought a Seagate. I was using it with an old Mac OSX.
Yes, I run Maverick's with this drive. Works just fine.
Hi, Our sock is "EX2F". Thanks.
Hi, this Bluetooth USB adapter adds PC connectivity to your existing Plantronics Bluetooth headset. Small enough to keep in the PC for always-ready connectivity.
You don't need an answer . . . you need a new computer!
Yes it does. That's one of the reasons I purchased it..
Yes. WiFi Baby 2.0&#8242;s AC adapter: Input is 100-240v, 50/60hz 0.5A max. Output: 12V, 1000mA. Please see full specs at WiFi Baby website.
Baby Monitor HD by SunshineApps is the app recommended by the WiFi Baby people and works well for us. The added benefit is that if you have a technical question or issue with the monitor's function with your mobile device, the tech help guys will be very familiar with the app and easily walk you through the correct settings, etc. I'm not sure how experienced they are with other software. Anyway, I can't imagine any other app working better, although maybe some others are cheaper. The WiFi Baby recommendation was good enough for me.
For Androids, download the 'Tiny Cam Monitor' app from the App Store. There's a free version and a PRO version for $3.99. Either will work. For iPad, there is a Baby Monitor application that is recommended. I believe there are steps on the wifi baby website on how to do this.
Yes, you creat an account after you get it. I would like to let you know that I will cancel mine because the device does not work properly.
Pocketfinder using the GPS signal, they have a international plan for use out of USA, I use my Pocketfinder in Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina and it Works well.
Yes, any digital flash brand. As long as they say its compatible with 4/3 cameras. Me i'm using Metz, lumix fl360l, & the small Nissin Di466 with the battery compartment (magazine), for quick & fumble free change of battery in the dark. As long as it says compatible &with TTL. The lumix fl360L has an led light for video. But the Nissin Di 4166 is cheap $120+- only & its a good brand. And you can buy extra compartment (magazine) for $24 in amazon. The L in the fl360L designates LED LIGHT for video mode.
yes if the bose are wireles bluetooth
yes.
yes it will work. be sure to download the latest firmware.
While the HP Proliant MicroServer is more than adequate for SOHO or servicing relatively static web pages, a dynamic game environment is going to rapidly consume the processing resources. I am not a gamer, but used to be a capacity planner for a wide variety of commercial UNIX systems. My initial reaction is that unless you are dramatically limiting the number of connections to this server, response time is going to drop off quickly. I cannot specifically tell you if the drop off is at 2 or 20 users, but best guess would be at 4-8.
My thumb drive has windows media files on it and the kenwood reads the files perfectly fine including reading out the bands name, track number, and the name of the song all displayed on the screen. really a descent head unit for the money
In my experince, this device does not work on most PCs so I would guess it wouldn't work with your Kindle.
The answer is no. Ethernet over usb means you can connect your laptop to the mifi with a usb cable and it will appear as a network device, connecting your computer to the Internet via LTE. In other words, you're connecting to the Mifi by USB instead of wifi. HTH.
Hi DooBomb, this system does not come with a card reader.
Yes it will work! The unit has HDMI out. It also extremely short range (5 feet) and needs a direct line of site. Nothing can be in the way between the TV and laptop. Get something like Warpia StreamHD instead!
Mine did not work, so I sent it back for a refund.
Yes, my husband has been recording a lot of the old shows on DVDs and sharing them with the grand kids.
Yes -- nice phone
That I cannot be to sure of. However, I would avoid the Ematic Genesis all together. It's not the type of tablet you may think it is. If you like Kindle Fires or ipad or samsung galaxy tablets, then you will not like the Ematic. It uses a different type of capacitive touch screen that you will not like from the get go.
you could contact the seller if you are not assure about it. it is better to send some pictures of your car's in-dash board to the seller for the their reference. hope it is helpful to you. you could contact the seller through below steps: 1.enter into the shop 2.search and click "See more information about this seller" on the upper right corner 3.search and click "Detailed Seller Information" 4.search and click "summer xiong Customer Service"
Tammy, yes, it came with the warranty card from CANON USA and CANON CANADA. The packaging, CD and warranty card look identical to another lens that I purchased recently at full price. I'm really happy with this purchase, it was a bargain!!!!
Yes, I use this lens on a 60D frame.
Mine is whisper quite. My PC tower sits on my desk about a foot away from my head. I can hardly tell it is on. sounds as if yours might be defective or that something is rubbing or is vibrating.
Yes, you will definitely be able to complete any system build with this power supply. I have had very good luck with it and all Corsair products throughout the many builds I have done.
Not sure I really understand the question. It can connect to WiFi and be used in any hotspot, but it cannot connect to WiDi.
Both. It runs directly off electricity bit has a battery back-up.
I have not tried that because the batt. Lasts so long, but you should be able too.
I'm not too sure about whether they have warranty. They claim to, but I really doubt you'd get anything from them seeing as to how crappy it is to begin with. Sorry :(
Don't know if would fit. If u have single din in dash it won't
It may fit... if it can fit a double din it may with or without the dash kit
This double din is bigger than a normal double din, so a dash kit wouldnt fit it... needs custom dash kit
I have the Bose Soundock II and this receiver allows the Bose remote control to work.
Yes this will work for you. You could even use a 600 one but I personally use this one.
yes why not
No
Yes
hi Douglas, No, this one has no downgrade rights to Windows 7. You may reformat the PC and install a Window 7 OS instead, but you will have to buy the OS, media and license, and it will definitely void the PC's warranty. Thanks PCrush
Yes ,it does.
You should check your time settings. The stick will not keep the current time if rebooted, so it should be configured to download the network time. Mine kept coming up with January 1st, 1970.
Depends on the distance from the device to the porch or room in question. I got spotty service from the device to my bluetooth speaker at a distance of 20 feet, but once it was stationary, the signal cleared up. This varies based on your speaker type/quality.
No, this item has speaker wire on the back of each speaker and sub-woofer. In fact, this item was purchased as a raffle prize therefore, we did not test the unit. Only wireless item is the remote control, unfortunately.
with my tv I needed a receiver or a tuner.
What's the question? How to hook it up?
it only works on 120V you may be able to contact VMI and get something that will make it work properly. here is their contact page: http://www.vminnovations.com/Contact/index.html
Yes it will come out for dvd, game system, etc
yes
yes its brand new, or at least to me it seems to be. no signs of it being used.
yes
a very small battery and at best 2.5 hours on mine
8.1 caused the dimness and a few other problems, so I reset the computer back to factory original...it wasn't worth the trouble for 8.1.
around 5 inches all around and it is thin too but very sturdy.
I would not even attempt to use it as a mouse. It is not a good product. It cannot be programmed to do anything.
No The current software version is as far as this one will go.
No it cannot. It is misleading.
No slides
Yes, the MU300 will work with M150C-I. All our microscope camera fits on all of microscopes. You can choose base on the resolution it requires.
No, I never got the blue ray drive to work. With my Lenovo G505s which is windows 8.1. I recommended buying a name brand one, and one that comes with software. This one does not come with software.
Yes, but you need to have two open usb ports, one of them usb 3.0, with the power being plugged into the usb 3.0. USB 2 doesn't provide enough power.
The grip recognizes the 3rd party battery that I have. It's a great grip - solid, nice feel. My Nikonian brother says that it looks and feels like the Nikon brand grips that he has owned (this is my first Digital Nikon so I will take his word for it.)
Its made of high quality hard plastic.
it has wifi
This desktop comes with 1 year warranty provided by Dell
6#11oz/2924g
sorry! I don't have that answer :(
That is exactly what you do!
I actually just purchased office. When I purchased the laptop it didn't come with office. The little I've used Word and Excel has been good. It didn't slow the computer down at all.
I have a V5 model 471P, which may be different. But it fits. You can contact ACER to see if there is compatibility.
Yes but you will have to purchase the mount separately. I bought a universal mount and it worked great.
No it only has HDMI in
Yes. This is a really nice unit with good graphics. For the money you cannot go wrong
Yes it does. You can Skype, etc.
Both.
It needs a blue tooth to work it should work with the HD Kindle it does not work with first generation Kindle Fire which is what I have. Hope this is helpful
No, But they are sweat proof
Yes there is.
I can tell you that it holds my Toshiba Canvio nicely. If your WD Passport has similar dimensions to 3.11" W x 4.37" D x 0.81" H then you should be ok and still have a little room left. Hope this helps!
5 1/2 x 3 3/4 x 1 deep with mesh pocket
It is not good as I wish.
I can't give an exact distant best dicription I can say I can read street signs at the about the lenght of a football field. Hope that helped.
You bet!
I use it overseas and it works perfectlly with my 3G carrier, it should work the same with T-Mobile.
Have no idea. Never used this option
I bought it for my sister and she lives in Italy and it works over there . I don't know what they use there .
It includes the binoculars, a case with a strap to carry around on your neck, a small cloth to wipe the lenses, a reflective mirror, and plastic covers for the front and back lenses.
We haven't----we used them in Alaska and they were more than adequate to bring things in closer!
It comes with windows 7
Yes they do. My boys use them with their Nabi's in kids mode and my husband and I use them with our iphone, ipad, ipod, and computer in adult mode. The sound in adult mode is great! I love that we can all use the same headphones but adjust them for the kids delicate ears.
Don't know for sure, but it (volume limit) will work when the lights/LEDs are not on. The batteries last a long time on ours, since I only use the LED to check the status from time to time. There is a switch for Parent/Nabi mode and another for LED light. The LED light is just to show status, which I was happy to see since I too worry about battery life, even though LEDs do not draw much current.
Yes, it has for me. I also purchased a screen protector separately for more protection.
It's actually a pretty deep bass. My tv has a lot of treble with absolutely no bass what so ever so this sound bar is a big improvement. The bass is adjustable on the sound bar too so that helps.
Yes
No, I found sensitivity is slightly reduced, but its not a crippling reducton. Actually, I welcomed the sensitivity reduction because it lowered the frequency of unintended touch screen 'events'.
Mini USB. And the chord that it comes with is pretty nifty. It'll also hold a charge for a month or more.
Yes. Ctrl-x, ctrl-v, etc. Like a normal keyboard.
Mine did!
The transducer that comes with this is specific for the sonar features that this model offers. There is a pick list of other types of transducers that it will recognize. If you already have one I would suggest you call Lowrance help line - 800 628-4487 There usually no wait and they can tell you if the transducer you have is compatible with it and what it may be lacking as far as it relates to the sonar capabilities or limitations of theirs. Hope that helps. Brian
Don't know... They work ok
They are on the ear, but they are so soft you can hardly tell they are there. They are the most comfortable I've ever tried.
Yes, exactly
Hi they are great quality just what you would expect from Sony. However, the bass is not as booming as some may like it.
Yes very comfortable!!! I just wouldn't recommend wearing them with earrings but otherwise totally!!! And they work great!!
I should but I cannot promise you this
No it will not, you have to get the exact number 2000-2d29WM
When I received mine, it arrived with a neck strap, USB/AV cable, and one set of "disposable" alkaline batteries and lens cap. You must purchase a memory card separately, as these cameras come with no memory storage. I suggest purchasing a "class 10" rated card. I highly recommend getting a set of rechargeable NiMH batteries and charger to go with it. This is a very nice, feature-rich camera for the price.
I have a iPhone mine works .it should sound should just come out the speakers And use your phones own mic where you normality talk on when you make a call.
sometimes they're under the battery
I installed a Samsung 840 1TB SATA and an Atlas 480GB MSATA in mine, myself, giving me 1.5TB of 6GB/sec SSD speed. Yes the laptop is still covered under the warranty, just not the drive(s). FYI its LIGHTNING fast, and VERY easy to install the drives, just remove the bottom (6 torx screws) and 4 screws for the SATA and 1 screw for the MSATA
Now almost all laptop can use both 110V and 220V with the adaptor.
yes
yes http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/dell/cnet_dell_xps_14_L421X_XPS14-1909sLV_FA.pdf
yes it does on the right side above the DVD drive.
Absolutely 100% better than a PS4. Alienware could not fix my computer after a defect in motherboard and sent me a brand new one. They didn't have the same one I originally ordered so they sent me a better one. If you have the money, definitely get an alienware.
I called Acer Tech support and they sent me the rescue disks. I can't remember if there was a charge for that though
you have to connect tothe wifi in your home by using your wifi passcode i found this item unable to connect strongly to my wifi so I gave it away
This device cannot be connected to a cellular network. I does use a SIM card.
Do not know. I have made in China tablet. Works good.
Hello, Yes it does fit in 07-13, it is awesome.
I highly doubt it. It is made specifically for the 70-200 f/4.0.
I would not buy from this company, ever
No good
I know there are different colors for charging and charged. I'm not sure about syncing, since we haven't done that yet.
Product Dimensions: 15.9 x 18.1 x 17.9 inche Scroll down the page and the information is there.
NZXT has them in stock as of today (4/24/2014)
Circle shape thermal paste is included on the water block.
The skin is only available in Stealth Black and Nebula Red (in this model, at least), but you can program the keyboard and function lights to any custom color theme...and can have them pulse if desired! Mine is a Nebula Red, and have opted to maintain a coordinated theme, but have had a sick time playing with AlienFX software!
No, this computer does not come with a DVD drive. I would not recommend buying this computer, as I purchased it barely three months ago and the hard drive already died.
I don't know, but will ask a friend that might and let you know.
All Intel Core 2 and later Core architecture processors support the 64 bit instruction set. This includes the Core i3, i5 and i7. See http://ark.intel.com/products/72056/Intel-Core-i5-3230M-Processor-3M-Cache-up-to-3_20-GHz-BGA?wapkw=core+i5+3230m
Yes It's Bluetooth. It Can Connect To Anything.
No because it has to have an insert to clip in, but you could buy it and do some customizing yourself.
Yes, you can either use a wireless or USB keyboard.
In theory it should work as long as you have a spare USB port to source power from. This needs both the eSATA AND the USB power port connected in order to power the disk.
Some USB 3.0 adapters are finicky, or dont work. YMMV. If you find something that works, stick with it.
Do not buy this product. It does not keep a charge. The worst mp3 ever.
this is a D2004dh4. It is different from the model of D6110wh8
I did not understand your question
Should work. But i suggest to find 24v DC - AC inverter and hook it directly to your batteries. Converting from 24V to 12V and then to AC voltage is not efficient at all.
It is very close to 12 volts, and varies very little. The voltage is also not adjustable. Mine measured 12.08V.
Yes this will allow you to run 12v lights, I used this for backup cameras and radio, off of a 24v source. In all technicalness, not a word I know, yes the source will last twice as long as a 12v source. 24v batteries are 2 12v batteries combined. Hope this helps!
I don't know friend, I use it on my iPad and as far as I know this pen was designed for using it on tablets.
Mine did.
Yes.
It does not, this model only has one thunderbolt port and you will have to hook that to you mac. Leavin you with hmdi and usb3 with an usb3 to hdmi adapter.
No it is not. Wish it was.
I would not know because that is not the radio they sent me but it was the one I did order glad you got what you ordered
My ilive has an ipod docking station. I don't think it's the same. Try remit123b.
Yes it does.
I do not know what ca might stand for. The cable is of good quality and the casing around the plug is a very hard rubber whereas the casing around the USB end is plastic.
the battery is not rechargeable.. but you can buy replacement battery on Amazon.. I think, If you are a medicare patient you can receive a free kit one a year.
NO, it is only for Windows RT machines--the Surface Pro series uses a 48 Watt power supply--also, the Surface 3 may have a different connector.
Yes. Works for both. We own 5 surfaces. Best thing to do is turn off adaptive brightness. We easily get 8 hours on surface
Yes
just sign in to your account and click on buy the product. it will put in your shopping cart and a window will ask you if you want to check out or keep shopping. keep shopping, and then goto check your cart, and you will see a blue link, when you click on it, you can see exactly what they will charge for shipping. i do not know the exact weight though, sorry.
60 foot cable and yes it works with QSee DVR ,
I have directv with this one. Depends on the receiver you get from dish. If you get an had dish and have an he tv then you should
I have a kindle fire and it reads thesame. You just have to get the kindle app.
Yes it does. I had to look at mine again because I don't Skype or anything so mine's never been used. I have used the main camera with good result.
We purchased this for my mother in law so it is in her possession. As of now, she has not mentioned anything regarding this issue. I've been at her house when she is charging and I didn't see any problem with it. It may be your cord.
BuyVayat is high tech company headquartered in the heart of Silicon Valley(Santa Clara) . They specialize in Andriod tablets and accessories and sell their products throigh Amazon and ebay stores. Zenithink is the model like Ford Focus or Ford Fusion. I Love my tablet!
When you have it in the tablet position, yes it protects and covers the keyboard.
I normally turn off the pc b4 i insert it
Yes, that is the exact model I have, MacBook Pro 7,1 (Apple Icon &gt; About This Mac &gt; More Info ... &gt; 13-inch, Mid 2010.) You can use this item with the 60 or the 85Watt power adapter. Please note: You'll need the proper tools, this item requires 'surgery' into the transformer cube of your power adapter and soldering skills, easy to do though. I mention this because Peter K. Ring Sr mentioned it had no problem 'plugging in' this part. You don't plug it in, you solder it in to the transformer cube.
I'm thinking you're going to need a splitter, at either the unit or after you get into the house.
not sure what you're asking; but the keyboard is fixed to the case - it can't move in any direction.
Yes...all cameras from q-see have the same connections. BNC for Video and PL-21 for power...David
It is listed as the performance bundle, but it is actually the performance and navigation bonus which also includes the city navigator NT on a microsd card ($100) and the extra out front bike mount ($40)
That is exactly what it is great for. Games are troublesome on any Micro SD because tje game has to be rooted to the device in some way so games often don't work. But I use it for photos and videos and it works perfectly.
This has maps of my area, so I would say yes. Also, u can download maps to your computer and upload them to the Garmin.
Yes
yes it have CD/DVD/Drive
Not really. It fits better without the macbook cover. This sleeve looks great though. Very formal.
Yes and loving it
I used it on an Ipad and does not seem to work well for that either.
Honestly I have never tried it with a HD printer only Lexmark
No
Don't know but it does work with the SQUARE reader as there is a spot to access the earplug input with the Kensington.
Yes. But you will void warranties as you will need to drill your own holes. You can remove the part that holds the ipad so you have clearane. You didnt mention if u require signatures at your location . If u do i would mount the stand to some sort of lazy susan affair so you can swing it around so your customer does not have to come behind your sales counter to sign
No it's not combination lock. It has a lock for the SecureBack case that can be pushed to lock but obviously you need the included key to unlock it. And if you need to secure the stand itself to a table or something you will need to get another lock.
I don't see any reason why it wouldn't. Bluetooth is Bluetooth.

I don"t believe so. You should ask Click. Sorry.
According to Verizon, the SCH-U380 is is integrated with Bluetooth version 2.1. The product was designed for use with version 3.0-enabled smartphones.
I think it doesn't work since this phone does not have a Bluetooth function.
I had this same problem, too. put a couple of movies on there and it was almost painful to try to watch. I don't think this device works very well for videos/movies. :/ I doubt the hardware is good enough to provide a proper, synced playback.
The power adapter is a medium sized brick that plugs into the wall. the text on the power adapter reads: INPUT: 100-240V~ ,50/60Hz, 0.8A OUTPUT: 12.0V --- 2500mA
I just got one today from this company, and it did not have a warranty card. I have been trying to resolve this with Amazon and Electronics Basket to no avail so far other than being told by Amazon that I can send it back.
Metal mount
The case was too small for the DMC-ZS6 model. Don't purchase it.
The wire is but the box is not. I put a rubber coating on mine making it water proof it's called plastic dip sold at Wal-Mart good luck
I only use Apple products so I do not know
Absolutely! along with most other lenses. 7 lens adapters ( 52mm-72mm) are included.
I digitizer pen seems to work perfect. It didn't affect any hand touches. I reccomend it!
Yes , it does !!!
Yes, it comes with one battery and a charger. The charger connects directly to the TG-2 and charges the battery that way. It's not like some other cameras I have where you pop the battery out and charge it independent of the camera. I think you can buy one as an accessory.
Not sure what you mean by 'camera chip'. But I assume you mean memory card. I use the "SanDisk Extreme 64 GB SDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Flash Memory Card 80MB/s (SDSDXS-064G-X46) " SD memory card. It works perfectly fine in all modes.
No... separate buttons for still photos & video..
Turn S.A.M.E off for all. Directions are on the back of the paper; lower Right side. Right from the box, If you have no county codes programmed You have nothing to do. Just follow the directions to make sure you have Tornado warnings turned on.
The manual does not show a sleep function and there is no such menu option.
The price is $1,799.97, but I paid $1,558.00 when I bought it...
No sales tax anywhere
I'm not very happy with the camera. As far as it sticking out I got a case for it and that eliminates the problem. I do have issues with blury pictures and the camera has not met my expectations overall. I would not re comend it.
Battery life has been pretty good, easily a few hundred shots to a charge. On a recent trip we tried a solar charger as we had no other electricity, it was hard to get a full charge that way.
Mine was in the box that it came in
Go to the website and download there.
Yes you would have to setup port forwarding.
Yes. I purchased one from Amazon a few months ago, though it no longer seems to be listed. You could try ZooGue's own website for the mini case.
Yes, in portrait when closed and in landscape when open. You don't have to remove it from the case to charge. I'm charging mine now as I type this in landscape.
This is for the hd+ so it is a nine inch case.
If the exterior dimensions of your iPad is the same as ipad4 which I'm pretty sure is the same it should fit perfectly You can also contact the padcaster folks on their website and ask
... all in all I don't think that the battery will make it from LAX to SYD - honestly, the battery life on full-bright screen is not impressive ... 3 - 4 hours ?? IDK, and IDC ... - it's a great ultra-book and battery life was nothing for me to care or worry about. I guess you can always get a battery extension, or fly First Class. ... or take a I-Pad Mini along for those long flights ...
I have not used to amplify my phone conversations, just music.
Yeah it should work. I just looked at mine it's a SONY Type N and on the back is says NP-BN. You should be good.
Yes, or if your laptop has the little slot for your SD card, you can do that too
It is definitely red. No pink undertones at all.
It does have built in memory; however, it is not sufficient enough to hold a good number of photos. Therefore, it would be best for you to buy at least a 2G SD card which is under $10. The battery can be charged internally by hooking it up with the USB cord directly to the computer or a wall outlet. So, you never have to buy batteries.
Hello ; nope it is whitout memory card.
Hi Chezron, please refer on the link given below on how to set one of the camera's settings when transferring files using MAC. Please select PTP/MTP so that your Mac will recognize the camera. Hope this helps. -Ely http://docs.esupport.sony.com/dvimag/DSC-W710_W730_guide/eng/contents/07/02/11/11.html?search=mac
All bets are off with this camera. For one thing, the still/not still question is about 3 heartbeats AFTER you depress the shutter button. Buy something else. Sony once again has watered down their own brand reputation on this one.
The width of the strip at the widest end (the upper rounded part) is 2". The straight lower part is 1 1/2" wide.
This camera records in MP4 and AVCHD. You can easily change it in the menu settings
The included CSR software does not work on a Mac. For Mac, you don't need the software, just plug it in and OS X will automatically install the device.
yes is has a standard remote control on the other side. I would have to say that the device is not very good at all. I will be replacing the one that I have. The keyboard side stopped working.
LaMarin, This is an ethernet adapter - you use it to connect a computer (using the USB socket) to a wired (Ethernet) connection. Other types of adapters can be used to add wireless connectivity. Note on the picture the RJ45 connector on the device itself. Hope this helps -
MANUFACTURER ANSWER: Thank you for posting your question. I'm sorry to say that this device does not support vlan tagging. If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact us at support@plugable.com. David, Plugable Support
Yes it should be compatible, I'm not sure though
Yes, Greg, That screen will work fine. Just be careful with the led connector on rear of LCD Panel. (They can be hard to reconnect.
Wired
Hi Priscilla, The unit comes with a printed manual, however, there is no electronic version available at this point. Sorry :(
It will work if you have a fast charger base.
The rig is based around standard 15mm rails, so yes - what you're proposing is possible. I have already combined this rig with another to make a monster Frankenrig. The joy of industry standards never gets old. ;)
I haven't done this, but a projector with a vga or dvi cable would work just like a screen.
Greetings, Please excuse the quality of the listing. Here is the disambiguation: Intel Atom D2550 @ 1.86GHz (Dual Core w/ Hyperthreading) Best regards, MITXPC
As far as I know I haven't had any issues with it running on older platforms. Look at the seagate website for requirements.
Yes it is wireless.
No. It requires 1- AAA battery and needs headphones or speakers plugged into the 3.5mm jack in order to operate.
I don't know. I have not tried that. I only drop and drag mp3 files to my player....Have not tried it with anything else.
These are really puffy, I'm pretty sure the medium will be big enough for you. The next size has to be for elephants

This is a great kit. I use it all the time. Don't bother with the ones that are magnetic. Get this set, it's fun to use.
I connected the 510 to my Mac via Bluetooth and it worked fine, don't see why it wouldn't work with PC in the same way
You need to check if the 3rd party app you mention support the RavPower protocol (SMB protocol). There are several apps that you can get, each of them support different type of files. The most completed that I found is called nPlayer (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nplayer/id539397400?mt=8). This one is not free, but it's the best in my opnion. I've tried the free apps, even the one suggested to be used with RAVPower, but they failed to open few formats. nPlayer on the other hand, was open to open all the media files that I have so far
Actually, I dont know.
Yes, as you can see on the picture it includes an adapter that works for Europe (ex: France, Germany). But the adapter does not work for the UK, you would need one of your one. And it can work on 110/220 V Christian
Same or a few longer, they are awesome batteries and the charger is convenient, about an hour to charge, Well worth it!
Unfortunately it does not work properly. The holes provided on the case are on the wrong places and not workable. Practically I can not use this case and in fact I have lost the money which I paid.
No, it is custom designed for the Samsung Ativ SmartPC 11.6-inch 500T Windows 8 Tablet. And sorry we do not have cases for the lenovo miix 2 11.
This bracket is designed to be used with an Arca Swiss style ball head which has two plates connected by a threaded screw that clamp onto this style of bracket. The additional screws seen on this bracket are "safety stops" that will prevent your camera or lens from sliding completely from the ball head when you loosen the tightening screw. They are a nice feature but can be removed if desired with a small allen wrench.
Personally I have always used Dells so I would be biased on this answer. Dells tend to hold their value over other models.
The installed office program is called Open Office and contains word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, graphics, database software and more.
No zipper. And yes but it doesn't fit very well.
I am not certain
It fits my 2013 retina display MacBook Pro
I was not satisfied ! The 13 inch case I ordered did not fit my 13 inch new Mac book.
yes
yes.
Hi Eduardo, as far as I know, it should work with any 30-pin speaker dock.
Any brand of SD card should work. If you mean size, it depends on how much you want to spend. I use a 2 GB card and have never run out of space before I uploaded the pictures on it to my computer.
yes,good
The armband has 2 different slots you can thread the armband through depending on what size your arms are. I'm 5'5'' and my weight fluctuates from 125-135 and it fits fine on my arms.
Should fit.
My upper arms are 15 also and the band fits fine, even over a T shirt and light-weight hoodie. Not a lot of extra room to spare, but doesn't constrict me either. Good luck!
Hi, yes you may be able to connect an external microphone to this Sony camera. This unit has microphone jack (stereo mini plug). -Ely
Only one slot. Has onboard memory.
Hi, if you are talking about the difference between Sony HDR-PJ430V (with projector) and Sony HDR-CX430V (w/o projector), they are identical in all aspects except for projector feature. -Ely
No it isn't possible. When you connect the projector, it shuts off the video recording part of the camera. Sorry. I think you can use the HDMI to connect to a TV and record at the same time though. I will try it as soon as I can.
I'm not sure exactly what your question is, but here is a link to the Sony support page https://us.en.kb.sony.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/37929/p/36919,37505,37553,68918/c/65,66/kw/web%20cam
I replaced the battery that came with the camera, with a heavy duty battery, which works for hours. I used the original once, and I don't remember it lasting very long.
No complaints here. Audio picks up very well...matter of fact in some cases too good.
Yes it has a charger that plugs into the camera I also bought a seep rat charger for extra batteries
Hi Tabish, Once you press the zoom in, its using the optical zoom which is upto 30x. Once you reach 30x zoom, and Digital zoom is activated, it will now use the Digital zoom. You will notice a small horizontal line on the zoom icon which means that once you pass that line, Digital zoom is now in use. You can set your camcorder to use optical zoom only by turning of Digital zoom. -Vincent
Yes it does. Unlike some lower end Sony camcorders, there is no manual lever that opens the lens cover. I have however gotten the cover of mine stuck on occasion (I film in sandy areas and the fine particulate matter had caused problems until I had an opportunity to give it a real good cleaning with compressed air) but under normal circumstances, the camera's lens cover has been flawless.
I would say you can easily get around 50 inch projection in a dark room. In fact it is quite impressive for the size of projector. I do not regret one bit buying this though the price slightly higher than rest of the camcorders without projector. whether I am at home or at friend or relative's house, this thing simply allows me to cast a video footage without any connecters.
is there a second part to this question? :) Adaptor needed for doing what?
4. Requires HDTV and HDMI cable sold sep. 9. For PC: Requires Microsoft Windows XP SP3/ Windows Vista SP2/Windows 7. For Mac: Requires Mac OSX (v10.5-10.7) 13. Requires via VMC-UAM1 cable (sold separately), AC power for camcorder, and hard drive formatted in FAT-32. USB-hub not supported. External HHD/USB media should be less than 2TB(Terabytes).
No internal. Only as cards
Yes, it has a still picture function and the resolution is pretty good.
No...
Play mode and record do not work at the same time.
Hi Tabish, Once you press the zoom in, its using the optical zoom which is upto 30x. Once you reach 30x zoom, and Digital zoom is activated, it will now use the Digital zoom.

You can set your camcorder to use optical zoom only by turning of Digital zoom. -Vincent
Yes but you need Mini Displayport to Displayport cable or Mini DisplayPort to Dual-Link DVI Adapter (not Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter). Thank you.
It should. Almost 110% positive
Sorry i do not know
We didn't have to do any calibrations. Everyone comments how great the picture is. Nothing needed to be fixed.
Yes
Hi Chamara -- I honestly don't know. I don't think it came with them, but not 100% sure, since I was just going to put it on its stand. However, I LOVE this TV!!!! Color is great, picture quality terrific!!! Had it about a year and I still love it. Great TV.
We didn't have to do any calibrations. Everyone comments how great the picture is. Nothing needed to be fixed.
Nope. Not even close
Yes, and supports all the stuff you'd expect. WPA/WPA2, non-broadcast SSIDs, b/g/n, etc.
You need a receiver or sound bar with optical in. Otherwise you can't. Unless you mean physically, in which case you could hang them from the wall mount.
I use this exclusively with multiple Mac's, and it performs beautifully, dependent on the reliability and speed of your router, of course. I'm not sure what you mean by your plans to connect via a time Capsule, which is an independent drive. You'll need to connect through a router, I think, such as the Airport Extreme or any other router with an open ethernet port. Check the Seagate page for the specific configuration you plan, and I think they'll prove responsive to any questions you have. Hope this helps.
It looks like just a mount, the disk tray is on the front
I will be honest. For my system my existing 1TB 7200 rpm drive is all I require right now. I do have a EXTERNAL USB 3.0 7200 rpm drive that I maintain some of my external drive. For complete portability make sure you use the new high speed usb 3.0 port on the Gateway SX system and make sure the external drive is also 7200 rpm, Both the high speed usb 3.0 and 7200 RPM drive will give you some fast performance.
I do not believe it does.
I have only used it wireless. Signal strength will always be stronger using an ether net cord.
Yes, it does at the rear of the unit along with two USB ports on one side and the CD drive is on the other side. Additional USB ports are at the rear as well.
nope
The Dell Outlet Laptops come with free limited 1 year warranty, that's typical for all Dell Outlet products.
yes it does
No.
Yes it does
It should,i use it on a surface and it runs Windows 8. You can upgrade that to Windows 8.1 if you want. Also Windows 10 will be a free upgrade when it comes out for Windows 8 users. Unless it's property off the school of course
there is a shuffle option on this one.
It should work fine as the as30 is the same size as the previous ones. The only SIZE changes have been done to the waterproof clear case as far as I can see. The rest of the changes have been software or internal.
All i see on the back is a 3" x 3" flat area with screws at the corners. This system will not permit pictures, so if you want, contact me: Bobkoch@pacbell.net and i'll send you pix of the back
No it doesn't. That is just on the packaging which is clear plastic and has the colored logo on it.
Yes
No
Yes
I am using an 8 GB usb drive... works fine. Not sure of any limits.
AMD A-Series A8-4500M (1.90GHz)
Normally, about 100-200 hours All led light strips are about the same quality. For me all I had to do was resolder (spell check) The hot and ground connections they were a bit flimsey
Yes, think of it as a smartphone with a keyboard. It does most Android programs.
Hi, it supports SD cards or USB sticks up to 32GB. Regards.
Hi Adam , This gizmo is attach via a metal frame that you have to glue to the screen of your camera. What I did I bought a glass screen protector and I glue the frame on the screen protector.
Sorry, I was not able to use... the holes did not line up on my tv
Andrea, the back plate is about 5 X 2 3/4" I am guessing that the plate to which the tv attaches is 4 X 4. The holes on it accommodate the standard Vesa placements on the back of televisions. Hope this helps.
It is 20V out, 3.25amps. As long as the voltage is the same the current can be higher with no issue.
Yes, it will work with the 2012 nexus 7 and all the buttons function very well.
I am sorry, I purchased it for the 7, so I do not know. The adapter is inexpensive and it didn't last long. My grand daughter had to start using the USB plug.
It meets the requirements, that is, 64 bit windows, over 2gb ram, over 1.4ghz processor, over 160gb had etc. However, this computer is generally slow.
Hello, You can choose Spanish Language in Windows 8, and buy Spanish keyboard separate. Best regards, Amuras
Yes. CD/DVD insert sideways instead of flat. I find it is necessary to keep disc in place when closing door. Also after leaving DVD's in PC they begin to slow down and stop. It might be wise to remove discs when completed. I think it is the heat from PC. I played same DVD in separate DVD and had no problem.
You can change the font size with just about any computer, though it can get tricky. My eyes are bad and I like to sit up real close to the computer myself, so I understand the concern. I have the 20 inch model and it is fine for me.
Thank you for catching the typo for us the sensor manufacturer is Sony.
They work with all LG 3D TVs.
I have a Vizio 3D TV and they work just fine. They should work with any 3D TV. Most TV Co. want you to buy there glasses and pay alot for them. So I would recommend these.
It's has Ethernet port and wireless connection

It is now running on ultimate 7 , but would like to restore it back to windows 8. Do you have original 8 setup for a Toshiba Satellite c855d-s5307. It has a 500 Hard Drive, and 8rams.
I found the card reader usless.It worked only once in 14 trys. I sent it back and use my phone scanner. It works all the time.
It fit perfectly on my Galaxy Tab2 but I returned it. I could not easily type on this keyboard and found an alternate choice that works better for me.
1year. Get the Square Trade warranty to extend. Well worth the great price!
If you're running android on your nook, then yes you can with no issues.
I believe you will need to get the Kindle Reader app for Android installed on your Nook. If you cannot do this directly with the Nook Simple Touch, then the Android for Nook (for your specific Nook model) should permit installation of the Kindle Reader app.
Get a different one
I would expect it to work on the Mac, because it has a USB connection, but I can't say for sure, as I don't own a Mac.
Lenovo comes with a 1 year warranty. It would be wise to register it with Lenovo and I believe you have 90 days to get an extended warranty. I sell a lot if these, and they're good units, but I've had a few that failed after a year.
64, is a good machine
You'll want a better graphics chip for gaming. It could probably run, but not terribly well.
Are you asking if the laptop can burn audio/songs to a CD? Yes, it can. Although I haven't tried anything related with DVDs. Forgive me if this wasn't the answer to the question you asked.
It depends on the model but mine shipped with 8. Not pro.
yeah, sure
Neither. It does not have intrinsic 3G or 4G capabilities. You need to connect it to a Wi-Fi source to get on the internet.
The Yoga runs regular Windows 8 so it's basically like a laptop although it can also be used in tablet mode. You should have no problem playing Flash videos which is usually the problem on Hulu or CBS.
I didnt buy a version with it, but im sure you can. No idea what the mark up would be.
Yes it does
No it has windows 8. But its a hunk of junk, spend a little more for a better computer!
It is not suitable for gaming in my opinion, it can't run battlefield 3 on the lowest settings without lag
It has a HDMI port. Also it has a lenovo display port, but it is useless since there is no adaptor in the market for this.
No. Absolutely silent. There is a function you can activate the fan with to purge the dust, but only when you want it to run the function
No, it does not unfortunately.
No they arent...
Yes--I don't recall any problems. Same with 8.1 Update. I have had a bit of trouble w/the Lenovo thinkpad USB 3.0 docking station post Update--had to download an updated version of the DisplayLink manager software from their site. But if you're not using that docking station I wouldn't anticipate any problems.
I get very minimal fan noise but I have the i5 processor.
I presume so as my kindle has been on the charger all day and night with no adverse affects. Hope this helps
We regret to inform you this camera does not include an SD card. This camera will accept SD, SDHC, SDXC cards and has an internal memory of 90MB.
No, it doesn't. It's a rather small/compact, point-and-shoot camera.
Yes the screen is on when underwater. Sorry I can't answer your comparison to Olympus camera.
Because some colors have more demand than others, orange is the most expensive since it can be easily spotted underwater or in the snow, while blue one is cheaper...
No!
I just returned from the South Pacific - the camera perform flawlessly! We did a snorkle with sharks and in various coral reefs. Both the stills and video are perfect! Highly recommend!
There is a setting in the setup that will get rid of the warning after the first time you power it up and the door is closed.
This camera accepts SD SDHC & SDXC cards. Currently I'm using a Sony 64gb micro SDXC card in a standard SD card adapter. Any card listed as SDXC up to 256gb card will work in this camera. Make sure you buy quality memory cards with good reviews and a fast read write ability. This camera does 1080 60p and will need fast memory.
Yes, it does.
No, it does not include a memory card but is compatible with SD, SDHC, and SDXC cards.
Not sure myself which one is faulty.My battery light was flashing so I put in the spare battery that has been on the charger for a week and it was not charged-So dead battery(purchased new with the camera) or Charger also purchased new with Camera. I am leaning towards Charger/Battery
Yes it does. There's a little trouble finding it at first because it is not easily noticeable but it does all of the functions you described in the question.
No it does not come with MS office..how ever it has a trial version for 60 days.
Yes, but ONLY to the Hotel
Unfortunately, the SSID would have to be visible in order for the Mini Router to connect to the network. However, you may still connect to a password protected network with a Mac Filter list. For further assistance, please email support@satechi.com. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
Ported (vented) offers a deeper bass response and moves air through the port. The bass is boomier and a bit louder but isn't as tight as a sealed box. Sealed offers tight clean bass but its not as loud in the lower frequencies. Basically if you want the neighbors to hear your music go with the ported
It has the male + and - inside of the box on the terminal cup
My box i recieved was not to 12" spec i had to make the whole bigger an tuning all depends on your sub an amp setup brand an wattage varies
Bass boosted type songs or some dubstep.
Yes...we have had our cam for over 6 months now, LOVE it!, and yes, there is night vision on the camera...!!!
Yes. No wireless on this model. The advantage of Power Over Ethernet is that data and power run on the same Ethernet cable... Which comes in handy if you don't have AC power near where you'd like to mount the camera.
Sorry, i have no clue to this one.
yes, You actually plug in the entire camera to recharge the battery so all you have to carry around is the cord not a bunch of other items to charge the battery.
I used the card from my camera. It worked great.
It is a toggle switch next to the front part of the camera directly under the snap. Really there are BETTER much better camera's for zoom in the desert, or jungle, that will come out without moisture damage, or other how to problems.
The battery goes into a charger that plugs into a power outlet. Once it's charged, you put the battery back in the camera.
Once you get above about 30x with the telephoto, you can not keep your hands steady enough you must use a tripod/monopod or at least have camera sitting on a solid surface(i.e. tabletop)
I can't give you a comparison of them. I can tell you the S1000 is an awesom bridge camera. You can have full manual control or just use auto. The zoom is great both optical and digital. I highly recommend the S1000. Other revues I've read say shooting video you can hear the lens motor when zooming and ths is true. However you can remove the sound when editing the project.
I don`t believe it comes with any
Yes
It comes with a cable charger and you don't need to take out the batteries. You just open the safe slot where there is a sdcard and battery and usb ports. Plug the cable and recharge your camera.
There are two different low settings.. One is 320x240 regular mode and that will last about 40 hours. The other is the super long record mode. That will work for aproximatly 30 days on a 32 GB card. -Nick at onlineenterprises888
You can view the videos on the device's screen or using an SD card reader and uploading them to your computer. So, I guess the answer to your question is: without using either of those two methods, you can't. The easy solution, of course, its to buy a $2 SD card reader, or just use the device's screen.
No. DVD player only
Yes, it can play a CD. I am really enjoying my portable player....it is well worth the investment.
Officially I believe the answer is no. However the reason is because there is some plastic in the way that prevents it from fitting correctly. I cut away the plastic to get it to fit and now it works just fine. So it depends on how involved you are willing to be to get it to work.
No it has a 1/4" headphone jack you need to buy a converter seperately
I have never physically tried this but with any devices that uses that type you jack. You have to make sure the size of the jack is correct so that it will match your device.
depends on situation.
Any electronics vendor should have one. Its a USB Standard-A male plug to a USB Mini-B male plug. Try this to search amazon
It's not a camera - just a bag.
I'm not sure about the size of your camera. I have a Nikon D3200. It can fit the camera and the kit lens when the lens is removed from the camera body. Usually, I just use the bag, though to hold an extra lens, my wallet, keys, phone, and camera. If all you plan to carry is the camera body and a spare lens separated, it works out OK, but it's a very tight fit.
I brought this for 1st ipad mini and it fits perfect. My daughter loves it!
Perfectly!!!
Not at all
Yes, it's pretty universal...goes right of the licence plate!!
No
No
Yes they do
Yes... it's a tiny bit of a stretch, but totally doable. I used this case to hold my ipad mini and bluetooth keyboard.
what size is your drive in caddy? that happened to me too.. my drive is 1TB but i tried with another about 750GB and there is no problem, it reads it succesfuly.
Yes it does. ..it announces upcoming turns by their names. ..easy to use (very user friendly)...how it looks? (way above its price range) you won't be disappointed with this purchase
If your vehicle accepts a Double Din size head unit...then YES...this will fit. You will need to contact a company like "Metra" to get the right trim kit.
If your vehicle accepts a Double Din size head unit...then YES...this will fit. You will need to contact a company like "Metra" to get the right trim kit.
You get N America maps, but maps are available to buy from e-bay, or there are other ways to get maps.
I believe is Palmap6 ...to have a better idea go to u tube and type Boss audio BV9969NV
Yes, you can use this 1TB to upgrade your 80GB PS3. I have the old backwards compatible 60GB PS3 system and upgraded it two days ago with this HDD and it has been working great. You can back up your PS3 using an External HD, so you won't lose your saved games, pics, etc. Once you put the new HD in the PS3 it will be formatted. After, restore the PS3 with the external HD and everything will be on your new 1TB HD. Hope this information helps.
The second dimension you have listed is correct, it's 43.7 across the top but its not 11 inches deep, it's about 3 deep.
good
Hi Alyssa, You will not need to re-enter any information in stock mode since the AFN card will not make any changes to the stock operating system. If you boot to stock, everything will be as it was. The first time you boot to Android, you will need to enter the wifi settings and a Google account so you can access the Google Play Store. Detailed instructions are provided with your purchase. Hope this information helps.
I personally haven't tried but I would guess "why not". I love this card and have bought 4 more for gifts and no complaints. I can do EVERYTHING that a samsung can do but take pics. Maybe contact the seller and ask. Good luck and enjoy!
Did you hold the n down as it was rebooting? If that didn't work, try the afn forum website, they should be able to help, good luck.
Nope!
If you hold the nook symbol down when you wake it up, it will boot to Android. Good luck
I'm not sure what is a heavy dslrI have used a 5d and a t3i on my rig and it holds it no problem. As long as you tighten everything you will be fine.
That should work with this rig. I've used it with Panasonic HVX 200, HMC 150 and Cannon 7D camera's. Which all have the standard 1/4" thread I believe and almost all camera's I've ever used from consumer to pro have had that standard size.
Should work. That's what I used mine for.
I used it for the nook hd, not the +, and it didn't work very well.
This only works on the hd+, Ive tried other tablets with this keyboard no other has picked it up so far except my hd+. I hope that helps.
No
The most reliable way software is probably TrueCrypt. It is for free and also open source which is a security plus. Their site has instructions on how to use it for a usb drive.
There is no manual, but each lense is plainly marked. There is nothing complicated about their use.
The extra battery in the kit is not a Nikon product, it is made by a company called Power2000. Please note that only the camera, the case, and the cleaning kit in this bundle are Nikon brand products.
Yes, I have 4, they work fine, I also use them in a 7D and a 60Da.
yes its fit perfectly on MAC BOOK PRO 13 INCH the new version which is retina display
Not entirely. It fits everywhere apart from the 'enter' button which is swapped with the shift.
yes it is but the inter bottom not come like whats is be
Maximum Watts per Channel 50W x 4
I don't believe so. I've gone through all of the audio settings and I didn't see that option. However, the unit does a fantastic job with audio settings from several presets to other separate options on bass and subwoofer settings.
If you get a cord for the "input" on the back. A small cord with the headphones head on each end will do the trick.. Good Luck!
You probably will have to replace what is already installed, since there is usually only 2 slots to plug in the RAM modules.
It does not come with all three of the features you need. But you can always add them later.
It did with mine
I think you might be able to use a car charger with it, as there's a DC input slot. I haven't tried that, though, so I'm not sure.
Yes but I woukd spend the extra money and get an external filter so you can take it off without opening the case. We use it for diving and cant take pictures when on the surface or in shallow water.
I can't be 100% sure since I only own 2 wireless headsets. I would guess the answer is yes. There are 2 headrests that can operate independently or watch the same thing at the same time. Running one headrest does allow my 2 headsets to listen at the same time. You simply put both headsets on the same channel you select from your screen. I doubt wireless technology has that type of bandwidth issue... thinking of multiple users on wireless routers at once. So I'm guessing 3 would work easily.
They do both. You can watch the same thing on both our party individually.
Yes it does that's what I run
Dear Customer, Really sorry for keep you wainting, This card could compact with hp elitebook 2760p. If there are anything else I can do for you pls feel free to contact me. Have a nice day! Grace.
Bezel is 1/2" on 3 sides and 3/4" on remaining side(normally the bottom). We have them mounted Portrait and not the typical landscape
Mine is in so tight, I would have trouble pulling it out. the back panel shouldn't need to "fit" anywhere. It comes installed and is not meant to come out.
Tilt is very slight and no height adjustments.
Dear Morgan M.: A free trial of Microsoft Office is pre-installed on the Acer Aspire S7-191-6447 11.6-Inch Ultrabook, but the permanent program must be purchased separately. Nevertheless, this Acer Aspire S7-191-6447 is one of the best mobile computers that is currently available, and I highly recommend it for business travelers, because of its speed, power, beautiful display, and incredibly thin and light design. Thank you for your question. Kenneth L. Rodino, M.D.
You have to download new wireless firmware from acer's web page
You can use both the touchscreen and the keyboard. The keyboard has a number pad also. It is very easy to switch back and forth between touchscreen and the keyboard.
Hi, sorry Nick, the extended battery wasn't included
Hello, There is no TV Tuner. Best regards, A.Umansky
Nope...
YES, it is! You wouldn't know it from reading the product specs sheet, but it definitely is. In fact, the keyboard backlight is on by default (when you get the computer). If you want to turn it off to save battery power simply hit the Function key (Fn) plus the F9 key.
Yes there is.
Sorry I haven't used this feature.
It stays on pretty good. I do not use it for the gym though. I wear them at work for pretty much 8 hours straight. To help you out though, i did just bend down a couple of and jumped in place, they stayed pretty good. they would stay better if that were bigger. Yes they are listed as over the ear but unless you have tiny ears, they are more like on-ear. But for what i use them for: range 5 stars comfy 5 stars sound 4.5 stars . Lets be real, they are $40 bluetooth headphones. lol
it works good with my tripod manfrotto
This mount is meant for slr's. The follow focus will not work with anything that does not have a focus ring. You are better off to get some sort of steadicam mount for such a product.
My 67mm fits with still alot of spare room, i cant check but im positive your 72 mm will fit easily.
I'd say most DSLR's. I've used a D90, GH2, and 5D II on it. Only thing that might inhibit is size of lens. My 70-200 2.8 was a little tight. It'll more than likely work with your T2i.
No, this is an awesome case, very padded and plenty of room.
No
yes.
When I bought this laptop it was my intention to install Windows 7, but after using Windows 8 extensively I felt the change was unneeded. However, if you are more comfortable with version 7, it will work great this computer.
Hi, Unfortunately I do not have that version of this case. Here is the ASIN: B00IADP4K0 for a similar case, from another seller here on Amazon. Good luck. Sincerely, James from Labrador Creek
No just 8gigs that's what I'm running
I believe it does by the information printed on their page that states: Sony Imagination Studio VAIO Edition software Create music and movies like never before with the Sony Imagination Studio VAIO Edition. With four powerful applications: Movie Studio Platinum, ACID Music Studio, Sound Forge Audio Studio and DVD Architect Studio software pre-installed, it's just what you need to bring your imagination to life. Create your own movies, record or mix your own music, and burn DVDs.

The battery that comes with the camera will last a good hour. I purchased an extra battery, VW-VBK360 Lithium-ion Battery, that last for a good 4 hours. I use the original battery as a backup.
Yes. It really is 1920/1080p. I personally use this mode.
I own this Panasonic model camera. No, doing that would likely break the screen off.
Hi, in the gray and the white don't exist any difference, this cameras are the same. The camera with wifi is the reference WA30, is more espensive, the camera WA03 don't have wifi. WA03 Very good so far.
Only a power cord,a battery, a couple of cables to connect to a P/C, and a Shoe adapter. No SD card was included with mine.
Really don't know, this thing worked for two weeks than became a paperweight.
yes..
Remove card, download card onto your desktop, or some folder of your choosing, then use a program like Windows Live Movie maker to edit. On the card you will find files with the extension of ".mts". Windows live movie maker recognizes these and WLMM can edit them.
8"x5.5" 7/16" thick
The mouse has 5 different levels, you don't need to adjust is in the software. The little button under the scrolling wheel will change the speed. This is an awesome mouse, you can even adjust the volume of your computer with it. I wouldn't think twice before buying it.
It fits just fine. You'll notice the wrap over the edge isn't as pronounced on the Retina, but it's more good than bad.
@barbara Kelly it uses AAA's but I do not recommend because the click life is very short my first one lasted 2 months and less on other ones if you use it for gaming. the click buttons just wear out. Look up Perixx here on amazon they make a perixxmice I believe is what it's called dpi adjustable mouse that lasted me 8 months so far an it clicks great I use it for heavy gaming with ALOT of clicks it's around the same price and comes in white and maybe black. God luck.
This product is not a Kindle.
In all honesty, I have tried a simple plethora of suggested strategies provided by my more tech--savvy or geeky friends and the answer is NO... It involve several links of network strategies that preclude an intermediary on an intermediary device/service working.
No bill for first year.

The speaker grills appear to be made of metal. The body is rubber.
it is 9.7 inch, however mine wasnt working at all. this tablet is slow and it is in chinese and at all is crap.
Most tablets are similar when it comes to the Android operating system. Once you learn one, you can adapt to most any of them. Here is a site that takes you through some basics. http://marquispad.supportsync.com It is not the same tablet, but the settings, etc are the same and you should be able to maneuver from that point on.
Yes.it does. pls note. thanks.
Yes. You can watch prime titles for free, and rent or buy other digital titles. Quality is very good.
No friend, the square it's to small
Under settings has an option to change the TV to 3D if it isn't already detected by a 3D Blu-ray player which would automatically change the input to 3D and would give you an onscreen message, letting you know it's now showing in 3D. As far as I know, most digital downloads don't have 3D movies to rent or purchase. Hope this helped.
120/240 is just marketing buzz. It's a frame doubler, not truly 120hz. If you send 120 frames per second to the TV, it drops frames just like a 60hz set would. There are definitive tests proving this on the official thread on avsforum.com
What would you like to know about a CF set up? I have it set up in CF and my brother has it crossfired with a 7950. Both setups are far beyond optimal graphics with not a single issue yet... coolest crossfired cards I've ever owned.

One. You would need to get a system equipped to handle three (3) monitors. We use ours for a loading dock and works well for our purposes.
I'm sorry but I dont know... I didn't knot they mad a mini
Yes I can!
No, I have it for the Samsung Galaxy S3.
Yes up to 300ft
Hi Kevin, I recommend you try our CABLE-V010: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CA2X5W6. It's a full copper cable. The CCA cable my get hot when running power over it instead of just data. However, a full copper cable handles power with no issue at all. Let me know if you have any more questions! Thank you, Taylor W. VIVO
It is not chargeable but it comes with a wall charger. You can always just plug it in on the plane.
yes it comes with a car charger
yes. I don't know what the charger output rating is, but the dock seems to charge the iphone5 more quickly than the Apple supplied iphone wall charger.
Yep! I use it with an iPhone 6 Plus. I don't even have to take off the apple branded leather case to dock it!
I had the same problem and tried everything to remedy the issue, even shutting off all wireless networks and devices in the house- nothing worked. I sent it back and was sent a new sound bar and had the same issues. I gave up and suckered my I.T. department to come to my house...it worked for 6 hours. It was great for those 6 hours. Wireless subs are very sensitive, my issue may have been the copper pipes (in floor heating).
Hi, Please refer to ASIN B006JVUAMM for the compatible antenna. Thanks, PCrush
Yes, video will work fine to the monitor. You will need speakers either built-in to the monitor or externally plugged in (via monitor audio jacks if available or directly attached to the Bluray player or amplifier).
You can't because the player uses HDMI which doesn't support CC. I know because I am deaf and experienced this problem before.
Although I have not downloaded anything directly from the Canon Powershot to my computer (I use SD cards), the Canon manual indicates that you can download images via a mini-USB cable, and you can also update the software on the camera from the Canon website using a mini-USB cable.
Go to www.canon.com/icpd/ download and save or print the PDF software is there also
No, it is not. You could use an inexpensive EyeFi card to make just about any camera WiFi.
Robert, I said I would get back with you after taking more pictures. I just hit photo number 30 since you asked and no...it is not flashing that I need new batteries. I use regular Energizers. Nothing special. I too think you may have a problem with the camera. Although, I have gone through a couple pair of batteries very quickly, and it occured to me that the store may have just sold me old batteries. Not all have experation dates on the packging. Good luck, I love the pictures I am getting, I hope you do to.
No
I have not heard and rolling sounds inside mine.
No. It will not "stream" directly from the camera to a computer over any network. You have to connect it via USB and transfer the videos that way. It does it much faster than expected if that's any consolation.
no.
The zoom is really excellent. The only issue is image stability without any type of tripod, but that isn't the fault of the camera.
Yes, it comes with the USB cable that enables you to download pictures to your computer. This is a great camera that takes clear pictures at a great price.
Lanyard, battery, battery charger and USB to micro USB cable. No memory card, no case.
You can keep them in the mesh pockets provided.
I do not know, recently purchased. I am learning to use it. Greetings
The quality is EXCELLENT, with one qualification: you CANNOT do high-speed panning, in low-light, AND expect this level of camera to track it. WAY too blurry. That said, for "normal" low-light shots, it is WONDERFUL. And yes I own 2, and yes I have done this.
Hi David, The minimum illumination in NTSC Auto mode is rated at 1.2 lux (with auto slow shutter selected - shutter speed 1/30 sec.) In Low Light mode it is rated at just 0.1 lux (shutter speed 1/2 sec.) This, with an image sensor of 1/3-inch HD CMOS Pro should be enough to make the video very acceptable in low light. Art Speck
I suggested that u , go to Wal-Mart and to the electronic section n buy the converted one at Wal-Mart for about $20. It'll work better than this one.
Greetings~ the charger should work with your laptop. And the length of the tip will not matter.
I dont know. Comtact the mfr.
No it will not, sorry.
Well, there is a charging cable. It is a cable with a micro USB plug on one side and a standard USB on the other. This would plug into any standard charger with a USB or directly into a computer. However, they don't actually provide you with actual plug block. I guess they assume you already have one.
No. It merely supplies the power to the monitor. You would need a charger. We do sell the battery and charger together.
I haven't purchased the battery because the ad indicated that the canon battery For my camera should fit the unit .. But it Does'nt which mean I would need another charger as well, thinking of Getting rid of it... Sorry not much help, Good luck.
Yes. And it works great.i use it for my credit card reader on my phone.
Yes I believe it is standard voltage
Hi David, I don't know the direct (easy) answer to your question about a HD monitor with the Dell OptiPlex 960 with Windows 7 Professional. I went into the System Information and clicked on Display. I have an Intel(R) 4 Series Internal Chipset. Then I did a Google search on that name and it brought up the specific Intel support site... http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/highlights/graphics/4m. I'm quite sure that following this approach will provide you with an answer, as the Intel support for this item was over whelming. Go luck! Ed Hobbs, Houston, TX
The module has 5 slots for drives. Yes you could put bigger drives in the caddies - if you change the drives it will not match the jbod raid set so all the previous data will be pretty much lost. I believe you need to keep all the drive sizes matched.
Yes. Works great. Resolution & brightness is MUCH BETTER than expected. "No more turning off lights in 1,000 seat sanctuary, Hallelujah!
No it doesn't. it take a usb dongle you can get them cheap from Best buy or any other electronics store (amazon). As far as I know that's all that's needed, the rest should be set up for it. I'm not sure if there are any sub groups of this projector that didn't come wireless ready but the one's I got were. (the cost should be around $50.00 and they should be plug and play
yes. You would use disk utility in Mac OS. Thats how set mine up. Using RAID 0 and RAID 1.
We do not provide a longer cord (ours is about 1.5M long), but if you need longer, I believe there is one at Radio Shack that can be purchased. We hope this helps - Kidz Gear Customer Support
Yes perfect!! They are perfect for airplanes! I was really impressed! I am speaking from experience these are the best for travel!
The ears are flexible and flip out. These are still going strong after a year!

No
I'm sorry-no idea as I do not have a samsung galaxy tablet 3. They are however compatible with any device that uses standard headphone jack. And they are great quality-we have had them for over a year and they are still going strong. Hope this info. helps.
are you just looking for noise blockers?

It is hdmi 1.4 I believe .
yes, i have a nikon d 3100
Yes it does.
I think it is thunderbolt 1. It really won't make any difference. It is only a two mechanical drive enclosure, which can't exceed thunderbolt 1 max anyway. If yoou have two ssd's, raided, that might be a different story.
3 year limited warranty.
No, that would be the LaCie 2big Thunderbolt 2. You can read about the differences on LaCie's website.
I have found it to be extremely accurate especially after it's fully locked on and using WAAS. It's receiver is sensitive enough to reliably navigate from the window seat of a passenger aircraft and from the forest floor in tropical rainforest. How accurate depends on how long you leave it on to acquire satellites and whether or not you are in a WAAS area? There is an accuracy estimate on the satellite screen.
Very easy - it's good in pretty much any conditions. Definitely the best screen I have ever used in bright sunlight.
hi Charmila, on our end, No. We accept major credit cards as long as it issued within US and the billing address must be a US address. Thanks, PCrush
I would take it to computer place and see if it can be fix.
Try restarting the tablet. Also too many apps open will stall the tablet try closing all other apps you are not using.
Mine didn't.
It should be. As long as your computer supports USB.
Absolutely! Any type of formatting really...
Yes
It is free built into the cord.
Yes, it does. You can also avoid toll roads, unpaved roads, U-turns, and enter in custom areas/roads to avoid.
I use a portable stand that sits on my dashboard. It's not attached at all to the window or dashboard and I can put it away when I'm not using my Garmin GPS
It can be used but you would have to buy the map sets for Europe.
This comes with the car charger and USB cables so that you can charge it in your car or on you computer.
You can buy maps for just about any country. Garmin supports over 100. The basic one comes with US and Canada but you can specify Brazil when you order. You can also buy maps for other countries as you need it. I bought the unit with NA but later on added EU and Japan. You can decide which map to use by downloading it using the PC or MAC app. Hope this helps
Definitive answer: yes, the 2577LT model comes with Europe maps. I confirmed with Garmin before I bought it on Amazon. This is the "transatlantic model" that has both North America and Europe maps preloaded. The Amazon summary table is wrong in saying it is just North America. I just received the device and confirmed it has the Europe maps.

I was able to pull up streets in quebec. And places to eat.
Yes ,it will! I bought it along with my television and it works great!
Yes, it's there for the DMP-MST60. I gave it a quick test and it connects to Amazon successfully and offers content. I don't have a Prime account and they don't seem to offer any samples, so I couldn't test the streaming performance.
What is the site address? I can try it and tell you for sure. I learn by doing.
Yes, these speakers have an analog 3.5mm input but will sound better when using a USB digital source at maximum bit rate and depth
yes
No, this will not work with 6D, only APSC DSLRs, such as 7D, 70D, and Rebel series.
Yes. But not "least". You can stay off highways.
Yes
I guess is is REALTEK High Definition Audio
Yes.. you need to change all the ribbon system... This is the worst PC ever
It's not a standard 2.5", I tried to replace to a big one and I couldn't. I don't know what kind is it, it's just a small board attached to the mother board. I hope I helped.
Tha laptop have Just one Hd anda it is 128gb ssd maybe refer to 0gb ofrece HDD disk organizacin mechanical disk
I have no idea, I don't work with such tools. You better ask Toshiba directly through its webpage. I can tell you that the mouse of this particular PC is really bad, terrible to use !! I've had to use an external mouse from day one. Good luck.
It is 8.0 I am not aware that Toshiba notebooks come with any other version
So sorry - I have no idea. But I love this laptop.
Yes it is. Good luck. It's not easy to replace.
Yes same part.
No
Hi there...It is 2gb ram and 160gb hard drive...Thx terry 248-757-0334
I was actually looking for windows XP. All of them have different operating systems. Read the product description to be sure your getting the correct OS for your needs.
I bought an extra battery, but the battery is quick to charge (a few hours) and lasts a LONG time. In fact, I have lost the extra battery recently and will not bother buying another one. Even in the cold the battery is good for at least a few weeks, and that is even with my kids using it for the occasional extended photo-taking session.
commonly available SD Card with reasonably high data transfer rate ( Class 6 and above ) will do. I have used SD cards of SanDisk & Amazon of 4GB as well as 32 GB of class 10. They both worked well.
i bought the camera that came with the two lens 10-30 and 30-110, comes with a cd and a neck strap and a usb to transfer to computer
It comes with a battery and lens cap.
You should buy it refurbished, not used.
Yes, if you buy a seperate charger
Yes, although I've not used it
It doesn't have built-in GPS, Amazon's description is mistaken.
There is no alternative to using the rechargeable battery included with the camera: Li-ion En-El19
Its satelite based, internet is not needed to navigate except for software upgrade.
Yes. I've pulled mine and verified that it has all 4 pins, and it does use the older Minolta-style hot-shoe connector that the A77 uses. (I say old-style because the A99 and some of the smaller newer models, such as the a58, and likely all future Sony models, use the more standard canon-style connector)
Yes it should be able to, used it for rca out from sat box to optical to receiver
I guess you could (not positive) don't know why you would want to.
The refresh rate is 60 Hz and the max resolution is 1920 x 1080.
The optical out runs to a receiver with optical input, which has sound control already. The volume control button on this monitor are for the monitor's speakers.
This is a tablet not a phone so it doesn't have the cellular frequencies. It does have WI-FI.
yes , it does
Yes
yes to both questions
Yes. It will play anywhere if you have internet access.
Yes it has a dedicated rear view camera. Will send you detailed information.
no you will not
that seems to still be the case.
I'm not sure but it comes with a mic that plugs in the back of the deck.
The screen is 1600x900 and is indeed 15.6". I use it at 1920x1080 and it looks just fine. It is not a touch screen. I love this monitor BTW. I am extremely happy with this purpose.
Speeds vary with different PC's and hardware I get around the 120mbs. Also what kind of ssd you use, that is a real picture. They do get really hot fast, not good for you'reMsata. I hope that helps.
as an external usb 3.0 hard drive, yes. I bought one for my new mac 2012 as 2nd hard drive. using usb 3.0 its nearly as fast as internal flash ssd that came with it. I just got a 2nd one that connected directly to motherboard of new home server, lightning fast !
?? I don't understand your question is?? this product is MDMS-BP4-USB3.
Not sure what your asking for but mine came with the cable, otherwise it's just a cable like a lot of blue tooth devices use. Usb based
It should were every u can install a 3.5 inch drive???
It lowers way down but probably not that low.
These batteries will work pefectly. they cost less because The Canon brand is way overpriced.
yes, i believe so. i pulled out my charger and a battery. when installed correctly (side) the battery will "clip in". it will fit in place and not come out easily. kinda weird :) . rod
8 gb memory
Yes, but they must be the same hardware version to work with applications. I currently have 2 connected to one computer (slightly older versions). I'm using ThermoHID free software, I'm not sure if UTAC is the same.
Yes it will
In short: No.
Yes it does.
I would think so. Contact Acer; they have a website. Good luck.
Answer from Titantech: Yes, you can do that.
u mean the memorey slots? 2 depends what model ur getting
Hi Nicholas, this unit has a 450Watt Power Supply.
Yes of course; You would need to install the SSD with a SATA cable and cut the wire ties for the bundled wires to connect the SSD. Once connected use the Avatar Recovery Disk and F9 to install the OS. Once installed you can format the other drive.
You shouldn't.... Was able to hook it up to TV with HDMI cable and use it as another monitor without changing the power supply. A webcam wouldn't be much of a power draw.

Hi Frank, The Avatar Gaming FX8366 Uses an NVIDIA Geforce GTX 660 TI 2GB GPU. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions
Hi Mass Effect, You can download the manual directly from Gigabyte at: http://download.gigabyte.us/FileList/Manual/mb_manual_ga-78lmt-usb3_v.5.0_e.pdf . Additionally, the motherboard comes with a software utility (EasyTune 6) that simplifies a lot of the overclocking functions for this model. Hope that helps!
It works on mine.
It's a matter of personal preference, but I used about 48 oz. I bought two 32 oz. bags of poly-pellets at Michael's craft store and used 1-1/2 bags.
It will power the phone, but your phone needs an extra adapter to accept the data from the rj45 connector and convert the Ethernet signal on the rj45 into a USB data compatible with your phone. These are actually more expensive than using a ubiquiti air-gateway device as a mini wifi access point. You can power the air-gateway and your phone with this kit, so extra connectors are needed
Yes it does it is a great case keeps it while protected as well it is a great buy!!!
The YN-300 does for sure, yes. But that is the only one that I have so if you're asking about a different model also on this page, I can't help you there.
Yes
Yes you can directly
This is a very delicate question...the answer is...DEPENDS...on what you pretend to do and your expectations...But for me it is much more than expected for the price. Color rendering is accurate and does't varies with the power. In average you can use it about 10 ft from the subject depending on your setting...for me it work flawless!!!
Yes I do
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moz97g4xTHY&list=PL_Uzh3I5UdTgnsjV2L11ob2wioTbBdFbe
Yes, it supports Microsoft Office, but there is no CD/DVD drive. You would need an external DVD
Don't know, I gave it as a gift
It has a Limited warranty on parts and labor for 1 year, carry-in with Technical support and software application support - 90 days. Thanks, PCrush
Glass
No height adjustment. Just tilt screen.
In a protected box
I really don't think so... there seems to be a tiny bit of development going on for that, but Android really doesn't come with any kind of drivers to support webcams. I tried this myself and could not get anything to work.
Yes, with out issue
Yes
I have experienced the same lines on display when recording however when viewing the recordings on memory card on computer the images are clear. I have stopped trying to see what is being displayed on screen after all I am only interested in having video if something significant happens.
You can manually to turn it on/off or set the machine running by Motion detecting function.But the time of Motion detecting function will not be long.thanks.
Love my G-20X Ball Head! Do not own the cheaper one so how could I compare/respond? Old adage "You get what you pay for" would be my take.
I measured my battery pack using a digital caliper. Here is what I came up with in inches (2.3" x 1.18" x 3.09"). The first dimension represents the height (batteries lengthwise). The battery connections stick up about 0.10" above the 2.3" dimension making that overall dimension 2.4". I hope this helps.
The Sirui T-005 (without the X) is an older model. As such, the center stalk cannot be removed, the hook to add weight is a more complex system and the twist mechanisms to lock / unlock are in plastic instead of aluminium.
certainly. the quick disconnect plate is quite small (3x4mm) and once attached won't block the battery door.
No 110
Not sure about the UDSC15. Sorry.
This laptop came with a power adapter (A/C adapter) when I bought it, yes.
Sorry, but I don't play computer games.
This is what I found... The Craig tower speaker system features a built-In sub-woofer (20W RMS) and 4 high powered speaker (4 x 5W RMS) system, total output power: 40W RMS and built-In Bluetooth system. Digital volume control and digital FM radio with 20 preset stations. Ready light and blue source lights, aux in audio for TV and other devices (left and right audio jack); aux in plays all audio devices through 3.5mm aux in jack. Video out jack , remote control for the iPod/iPhone/iPad function both included. AC Operated.
It's got a auxiliary Jack so basically it will work with anything.
No. There is no storage in the unit. I don't think it is even possible to access the video for remote storage. Something to look into. If the video format is one of several standard formats, say, AVI, it might be possible to tap the video lines and send to an AVI-to-USB converter, then to a computer for recording and storage.
Do not recommend buying the other product
http://www.voti.nl/docs/OV7670.pdf
Yes
The cable from my (10 year old?) Power shot G3 works.
Yes, we do.
Yes it does.
This item is just the case for an ipod nano. The music you download and the memory depends on the ipod you have.
No, this is for the iPod NANO.
Yes. It work
This is just one of the problems when ordering a computer from Amazon. The exact product details are seriously lacking. Computer companies produce a computer with different types of nomenclature,ie: what's really inside. Sorry that I can't answer your question as I'm preplexed like you.
It comes with a power cord but until they upgrade to jellybean 4.1.2 I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The internet is the slowest I've ever used on any device or computer, the battery doesn't last as long as it should (only lasts a couple hours) and other little things that add up. The upgrade has already been used on other devices and has corrected the problems but is not yet available on any of the Archos Element products.
i believe you will need a modem. The Trend-net device is a wireless router and is not a stand alone device. The normal sequence is 1) ISP line into house. 2) A compatible modem for your IPS provider. 3) A wireless or wired router. 4) Your internet device (laptop, ipad, desktop, ect.).
Is it plugged in when this happens? If so, have you checked the power icon in the lower right corner of the taskbar to see whether it is receiving a charge from the power cord?
Yes.
This version does not have a detachable cable. You can have them modified to have detachable cables, but this of course would void the manufacturer's warranty.
Keypad comes with a USB cable to charge from your PC, and it works with my iPad Mini.
Yes iis only for the controller really Doesn't anything to do with the kinect tho
The dimensions of the stand itself are 50.24" wide, 20" tall and 17.5" deep.
Product Dimensions 20.5 x 44.3 x 9.9 inches

Slip in the loop.
They may have. I got one for a galaxy tab 3 7inch . And the key board has four magnets on it and is fully removable from the case. I do not know about the other models. I hope this heps .
Yes in the keyboard magnets are facing away from tablet. Usually store separately. Haven't had any interference as of yet
I detach my keyboard all the time all the keyboard is it is a Bluetooth keyboard in the testicle the only thing that keeps them together is like magnetic yeah
From my experience, the lens barrel has to be flat and not recessed in order to provide a mounting surface for the filter's self-adhesive metal ring. Probably not a good choice for your camera.
I assumed the exact thing - battery didn't seem to fit. The battery is smaller then the inset in the charger. Just match the positive Battery terminal to the positive sign on the charger (extreme right looking at it) and it snaps in medium tight -and does charge.
The first time you charge them should at least be over night, just like a phone battery. Other wise it wont keep a charge.
When the battery is discharged, the LED light will be red. After the battery is charged, the LED will turn green. It can then be taken out of the charger and used in the camera.
You feel the ribbed bumps very slightly. I have to say this is the best mouse I've had and I have purchased many, cheap to expensive. The Anker has been the most reliable.
from my understanding no. each device is paired with its own receiver
It's about that size (of a regular pen). I don't have it with me right now, but it fits directly into the stylus compartment of a Lenovo X220 tablet.
I use a $5.00 7" generic case bought from BigLots. When looking at cases just remember that the speakers are on the side, so you have to make sure the case doesn't block them. :)
Mine broke after a year too much as you say. Thank goodness I had the warranty
YES, the following series supports HDMI 2.0: LG Electronics 79UB9800 79-Inch 4K Ultra HD 240Hz 3D LED TV
You really need to make sure that your inputs are 1080p to take advantage of this set. Anything lower gets blurry because it has to be scaled up in both size and resolution. I ended up swapping my cable box (I had an older one that looked fine on my previous (much) smaller TV, but blurry and horrible on the new set. Once I hooked up the new set to box, the picture looked fantastic. Blueray always looked great, especially 3D content
It is a 110 volt system with twice the speed, 120 hertz. (2014 model)
I get the model 2014 it good . Not 2013 .my tv it clear .Should bet the 2014 it better because they up great .
Yes, it should work fine. As far as I know USB3 is backward compatible just as USB2 was with basic USB. I use my USB3 ports on USB2 devices all the time. Go for it, it's a good hub. I'm still very pleased with mine.
The emitter is built into the projector. I purchased Sain Sonics and the work great with the BenQ.
Do u own one
Thought they're all alike I would check with the manufacturer.. Since you don't say what mode you have, I can only guess Good luck
Wired.
Works great, no problems at all. Very easy to setup.
Estimating. When on stand bottom of screen is three inches of deck. Tilts down 10 degrees. Tilts up 20 degrees. Does not rotate left to right without stand moving on desk - bit is very easy to do. Again, only estimates. The screen is consistent in its image from wider range of angles.
No my screen is perfect.
This unit does come with 3Gb's of dedicated graphics memory which the exact amount is 3,072 megabytes. Unfortunately this desktop does not have a wireless card built in.
There are no empty slots on the motherboard. I do have one additional comment to you..I love this computer.. it's amazing for the price, but please take note to add some additional cooling the video card gets above tolerance often... so I added additional silent fans
Yes SDHD will work in devices that accept SD, the HD=High-Capacity. Sometimes devices have an upper limit on how much storage on a card it can use but at 16 gigs you should have no issue
If it the same size as a Galaxy Tab 2, yes, it would fit.
Yes there are built in magnets that keeps it closed. Very nice case for a low price.
yes it fits perfectly and keeps the case really cool. definitly recommend. keep in mind that the installation difficulty depends on what kind of motherboard you have.
Not certain, but while the sound is better than the Jambox, that bluetooth mating and the on/off functions are not clear and caused me problems. I was not able get it to work as a wired external speaker if that is the question you have.
The stand will, yes. The better question is will your desk that you're attaching it to. We found at our office, and we have a about 50, that there is only a weight problem on cheaper, hollow desks. If the desk is solid wood, you're fine. The pole and bracket will have no problem with the weight.
The box is about 38" long 12" wide and 8" deep. The post with the mount is about 34" tall. If you have monitors of different brands the holes might not be at the same height and the mounts do not adjust up and down. I had to make a couple plate with slots to make the adjustment.
yes it can be moved hope this helps
I have not used this software yet....however, I checked and the software disc is "normal size"
We recently used them for a a 4 day car trip and had no issues.
The Anytone AT-5888AU is manufactured by Qixiang Electron Science & Technology Co., Ltd
No. None that I know of. It does not have a GFCI reset.
Mine worked right out of the box. Give it a try on a different outlet, not in a kitchen or bathroom. If it still doesn't work, return it.
No metal cover or red lights. It looks exactly like the picture.
Yes, the Sound Blaster Z is two years newer than the Recon 3d. Otherwise, they're essentially the same. The only thing I don't know about the Recon is whether or not it also has the 116dB rating that the Z has.
Don't believe so...it came assembled
Yes we do at our church.
yes
Mine worked with power from HDMI port. I don't believe external power is required.
I am using it on an older 30 pin on a couple iHome speakers systems and it works well. I have an older generation JBL and Logitech speakers and I could not get it to work.
Derrick, it could be a damaged hard drive. I've used this device myself, and it works fine on good drives. If the drive is defective for any reason, it won't boot up.
Yes I am running it on my MacBook Pro running either WIndows 8 or OSX
I have not recorded specifically recorded for YouTube but my recordings are great quality.
Standard house voltage 120. The powerline has several adaptors , just pick the one that fits your device.
This unit will accept your iPod Nano if it has the traditional charging port and not the smaller lightning port. Full details on the compatibility can be found in the below link. ftp://ftp.panasonic.com/headphone/schc38/sc-hc38_mul_oi.pdf#page=6
No headphone jack. Output power: RMS Output Power Stereo mode Front Ch (both ch driven) 20 W per channel (6 ), 1 kHz, 10 % THD Total RMS Stereo mode power 40 W FTC Output Power Stereo mode Front Ch (both ch driven) 15 W per channel (6 ), 20 Hz to 20 kHz, 1 % THD Total FTC Stereo mode power 30 W
Yes
They don't and yes wireless it is compact.
It does have a usb port on the top. It also has very nice sound. We are pleased with it.
The motherboard should fit physically (as long as it is a standard ATX case and not a shelf unit) because it is a micro ATX board but the power supply may be proprietary with special motherboard power connectors (that is what it used to be many years ago) for their motherboards so you may have to purchase an ATX power supply as well. Also make sure you have the proper CPU (LGA 1155) and Memory (DDR3) as well as update to the latest BIOS when you get it installed. Hope this detailed answer helps.
I love my sol republics so far the best I have , I`m on the phone alot , and from what people tell me from the other end the voice is awsome. They are light a little tight but I like that , they don`t feel sloppy. I don`t think you will be dissapointed. Besides It`s ok to own more than one pair...
I know right. I looked at the title on the top and it had N4110 but on the bottom it was listed.

Yes--that's exactly the way we have it setup at present. Works great!
Yes it is, works very well.
It doesn't come with one, but it's so small you could literally put it in your pocket
Yeah, it works great. I use it all the time with my Galaxy III.
yes, it's on the outside of the keyboard.
Yes, this switch does need to be plugged in. There is no on/off switch so it is always on unless you unplug it from the wall. It is a high quality switch. I did a review and gave it 5 stars.
Let's put it this way when I hooked it up I hooked up my PS3 my cable box into my surroundsound system it works but if you're hooking up a TiVo a sound bar to the TV that doesn't sound right to me mostly because you're going to have both the TV and the sound bar initiating broadcast of the same audio it be like having a echo in the room thats why I would mute my TV and use a sound bar as the primary speakers
Yes it does. But, I'm not real thrilled with this grip. Charged both batteries, went to an event, and both batteries dead within a hour! Took it off an not used it again.
This router can make a modem or wired router into a wireless one
No - I use it internally only. But honestly, buy a Cisco repeater. This is just too challenging to configure for a novice user.
Yes it has that little eye on the top of it. I havent used it but I believe it is a webcam.
My Ptouch died after using this unit. Not sure if it caused the failure, but I've got one (somewhere) and nothing to use it on.
The correct battery grip for EOS6D can be found on this page http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00OYBLFT6
Yes it does
The SSD is SATA3. One is a piece of hardware, the other is the way it connects to the computer. #lmgtfy
The charger is included. Matches the samsung galaxy chargers. No case but you can buy one. I like the item.
uh no.
It is metal back, Satin Finish.
Yes. You will need an Infrared or Full Spectrum Illuminator.
The Sony speaker does not connect to an FM station directly. The device connected to the speaker via bluetooth is the connection between the FM station and the speaker.
If it had bluetooth then it should
Green means it is charged. Lasts all day but recommends not to leave on dog more than 8 hours. I automatically recharge when I take it off. Usually charges up from red to green quickly.
I installed 8.1 a week ago and haven't had any issues yet.
NO, only a trial.
I have used the tablet with a USB keyboard. Works fine. I haven't used a BT keyboard, but I have used it with a BT headset with absolutely no problems. Just to clarify, the USB keyboard does require an OTG attachment of some sort to convert its USB plug into something that can be plugged into this tablet's micro-USB port. The tablet does not come with a full-size USB port.
Unless you root it, currently it did not show it was upgradeable. That might change and perhaps the manufacturer will let us know.
As long as it has the new port
Hi. It's made in Malaysia.
has the 3/4 inch and requires the adapter. It has a wonderful sound and I'm pleased with it.
Hi. The 30 pin iPod dock is on the top of the unit.
yes using usb cord
The speakers are connected to the base unit via wires (supplied) so really as far as you want to. The cables provided are probably 6 feet - you could use other cables and go longer for sure.
It has an option that when you set up the setting to have it in its own file or with the video file. I do video file just so I don't have to mesh the video with audio file together.
The speakers are connected to the base unit via wires (supplied) so really as far as you want to. The cables provided are probably 6 feet - you could use other cables and go longer for sure.
5ft input pin connector
I would think that would work, the USB handles fat16 and 32 input.
none, just bare wires.
yes using usb cord
Hi. Assuming your TV can output sound through a 3.5 mm mini-plug cable, you can plug that cable into the AUX jack on the rear panel.
I don't recall. This camera was a big disappointment. I sent it back and bought a Canon for $40 less.
Yes, perfectly! Since I received mine I haven't taken it out.
Nope. Just the drive cradle and some screws.
I don't think it will but I am not sure if this manufacturer makes them for other tablets. You might want to search around to see
No not at all
Yes it will fit perfectly
Yes, you can press the buttons on the monitor to change to which port you want the monitor to accept input. For example, you are using HDMI for the desktop and you configure HDMI as the default input. When you need it for the laptop, you will need to select DVI input manually using the monitor front panel buttons so it will switch to DVI. I am not sure about auto detection and auto switch though.
Just plug it into the USB port.
I'm not sure. My Nextbook is the 7. But the cover has a sliding grip so it might fit. Hope this helps.
I have the 722 receiver as well it was a perfect replacement for the one my kids destroyed with there bare hands.
Replace with the same. 20.1 remote
Yes, I believe you can. The headset or head phone allow you to sect from three channels and as long as you use different channels for each unit. They should be ale to work for separate devices at the se time.
You can mount the camera to any helmet, the problem might be the water. Most mounting pads don't hold up to good when exposed to water. This is not an asap specific issue. I always use a little safety leash.
I think it's compatible but it only worked once for me. When I tried to change settings it no longer worked.
Yes, the operating system is Windows 8, 64 bit with the 8GB RAM. My machine uses the AMD 10 Vision processor which the Toshiba people tell me is excellent. Windows 8 is experiencing some growing pains which I'm sure will soon be addressed. Overall, I'm happy with this Toshiba machine!
Considering my friends mod the hell out of it on computers with i3s/integrated graphics, this computer should easily handle it. At this price range, however, you could get something with an intel/nvidia cpu/gpu that would be better.
No
Absolutely not! It will fall apart. In a matter of weeks. Check out the Stinky foot board. Cost a bit more, but it's well built.
Yes, the password to get into the orgy was indeed Fidelio.
Frequency response is 10-40khz. Impedance is 30 Ohm. Hope this helps.
No, panasonic bodies have no IS or VR and Olympus lens depend on built in IBIS from olypmus camera bodies. All technique or get the Panasonic 100-300 with built in IS.
This is the one for the micro 4/3 system. You should not need an adapter.
No it does not, this is for Micro Four Thirds only
No, absolutely not. You log in the first time with your google account info (User name, password). If you don't already have an account, you set one up, for free, just takes a minute or two. This is a fantastic "computer". You can't install programs on it, and you need a printer capable of "e-Print", but this thing is lightning fast, full start up in 10 seconds.
Yes, they are manufactured by Nikon and do come with the Nikon warranty. The tripod and a few of the little gadgets in this bundle are junk, but overall it's a good value. You can always sell the things you don't want. Great camera!
No, it doesn't come sealed.
No, the connection isn't right. Note they don't list any Apple systems in their list of compatible systems.
It only works on new Mac Pro (2013). Check this out to see the difference between Mac Pro (2013) and Mac Pro (2012): http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/apple-mac-pro-2013-vs-mac-pro-2012/
We have no problem with ours. It came with screws. You may wanna contact Amazon directly for a replacement.
I put it in my backpack and no one seemed to care it stuck out about the last 1/4 of the way
not that i am aware of mine blink too
3 INCHS
23" from the pole to the monitor mounting bracken when the arm is fully extended. I just bought this product 3 weeks ago - and for the money, it's very good.
Go to www.cameralabs.com and read the professional review of the ZS30. It will tell you how to set up WIFI simply and in detail. I hope this helps.
The plastic parts are fine. The problem is the small buttons to turn on the camera and to shift to play back.
I don't know. However, since the headset and the Esonic plug into the same port on the iPhone, I doubt it unless somebody makes a "port-multiplier" adapter, or the headsets come with an "extension" port for the Esonic. . .
No u have to remove it in order to take pictures
Just a couple of weeks ago I received four brand new ones, and I'm sorry to say that it's the old mini-USB, not micro-USB.
Yes it does need 110.
No, I had to buy a screen protector.
I have no idea if it will or not...sry
No
Yes, there is a USB port on the device which will supply ample power to usb devices. I am using the 12 volt output to power a small Amateur Radio. (Approximately 2amps through the 12v output) The 5v USB out should handle everything, even tablets.
NO... The reason is that Netgear has no real competition in the 10Gbase-T (Copper RJ45) market at this price point... the competition is the XS712T at $1500 and the Cisco SG500XG-8F8T at $3500 & that
It should. I can interconnect 10G and 1G computers seamlessly.
All ports are 10GB
Hi, yes this is normal. It only polls one fan, the other fan is slaved to that fan. It cannot make them both spin at independent speeds.
2 fans would be seen as 1 unit
The s6800 has a CMOS sensor; and the s4--- models do not. The CMOS sensor is better as far as picture quality (incl. better low light pictures). It took me 1 minute to realize the s4-whatever model was not for me and I immediately started looking for cameras with the CMOS sensor. I do not know all about cameras so I have been doing tons and tons of research (probably overkill) to make sure I pick the right one (for me). If you can, pick a model with the CMOS sensor. And congratulations!
No
The glossy box the camera (and accessories) came in is about 6x6x1.5 inches. I don't remember what size the shipping box was.
this processor celeron 2.6 ghz 1155 buy 8 times to the office but motherboards bios star buy different brands, asrock and optenidos good results but for me the best serious conbinacion one gigabyte GA-H61N-USB3 LGA 1155 Intel H61 is the you had better performance and are stable and reliable as processor
It's borderline for 1080p Youtube videos: Some play smoothly while others exhibit dropped frames every two seconds or so. CPU ultilization is never maxed out though. So it seems as though the Intel Integrated Graphics Processor isn't quite up to the task.
Yes and it works with windows, freebsd, and Linux.
look up your laptop's motherboard CPU socket, if it is an LGA-1155 then it will definitely fit. Good luck.
Is it the card supplied by Blackvue? If not maybe a bad sd card. Either way try using a different card. Try reformatting by pressing down on the wifi button for 5-10 seconds.
You would need a wifi adapter. Nikon has one for about $60. I don't have one but it would be very handy.
First off I did not buy the remote model. I have the Harmony One. I have not found anything I can't program with it. You may have to use learn IR command, but it has always worked for me. You can go to http://www.logitech.com/harmony/components and check for a device there.
It is compatible with all Samsung NX series cameras. {Except Mini}
Yes, it works with my Galaxy Note 10.0 2014. I can read files from USB stick using that connector.
It does not have steering wheel control.
I wasn't sure if it would fit my car either but i just measure the size of what was in my car already and compared it to the dementions of the pile.
if you have a have a 2 din opening it will work. being a toyota it probably does. a standard radio is 1 din if you have a pocket or something of same size below a standard radio then you have 2din opening if you remove the pocket
Yes, it fits!!
There is some flexibility as to how you mount the bracket but I think that the locking mechanism relies on gravity and pressure to keep it set in place. On the side it might not have the weight of the device to lock it into place. I am not jumping up and down with glee as to how this bracket is preforming. It is only OK. You can turn the mounting hardware to the side and try... but I couldn't attest to how well the position would hold.
Sorry but no, because it mounts with screws. If you had a wooden surface or similar material on your treadmill that you could attach it to, than by all means go ahead, but unless you have a place to mount it with screws, you cannot
There are lines that you can impose on the picture and you can set those where u want. It does not give distance in feet though.
I cant be for sure but most vehicles need a harness. so go to a local auto parts store they should have it nothing to expense hopefully. yea i bought it for a ford crown vic and wouldnt fit in my dash
They may. I'm pretty sure there are wires or inputs for the steering wheel controls in the back of the receiver.
Yes it does actually
Yes, it will but you can only take pictures in portrait not landscape.
Based on my setup (used for displaying my Xbox on multiple monitors) It sends both audio and visual information. It grants me the ability to use my computer and Xbox on one screen (obviously have to change the input though in order to go between the two) with no issues. So as for EDID info, it does both audio and visual based on what I use it for.
Sorry I not tested too
Yes your fan should be capable, its just a standard 140mm fan. everything is held in by 4 screws.
I checked the case specs, and it says: Clearance for top 240mm dual radiator for water cooling solutions. It looks a little tight though, and like you may not be able to use the rear fan (not a big deal when you have 2 fans from the radiator drawing out the top). I googled, and found a thread that says minor tweaking is needed (re-drill some holes, and insulate fan controller): http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-1632311/corsair-h110-fit-nzxt-phantom-410-case.html
Yes. If you are at all tech savvy, you can hook this up to your home network and then open the port on your router so that you can access this drive from the internet. I haven't done this yet myself but I do know it is possible. Search the web or some forums for ways to access your home network remotely.
Did you do the update required...
This is what amazon says if state that we ship from Germany. But from our experience, it rather takes 1-2 weeks.
Yes. but beware that this is a 7200RPM drive which may run hotter than a 5400RPM drive which is usually included in most laptops. If you already had heat problems, i wouldn't recommend it. If you usually run cool, go for it. =) I put this in my PS4, and it performs beautifully.
It should. It will fit any 2.5" drive housing that accepts a standard 9.5mm drive.
Mr Nestor Calamayan, Yes, you can use Facebook video call on KATA T2 tablet. Thank you!
Hi, The plug have 3,5mm. The cable is 1 meter.
We use various headphones in this package but all the ones we use are compatible. Most commonly it is the MTGHP1CA but they are on back order so we have been using various brands to fulfill orders but they are compatible.
It is actually a 12 pin rectangular connection
I wish I could help you, I am the fleet manager for a large chain of dealerships, the unit I bought was for a customer......Sorry
It fits my iPad 4th generation
I don't know if it will..... Sorry. I have a 4 th generation
Absolutely. I use them with Mac, PC, and Linux with no problems at all. In fact the first machine I tried them on was one of my Macs. Unfortunately, while they do work I tested 2 extensively over a period of 3 days. These are frauds with a real capacity of only 8GB and the capacity number is faked to make them look bigger.
I can only tell you about my experience - I was in the process of transferring files to the drive. The transfer stopped about an hour in, and my system no longer recognized the drive's existence. Rebooting did not help. I also tried the drive on other computers, and they failed to recognize the drive also. The return process was fairly painless and my refund was processed very quickly.
I have dual monitors on mine.. it has the radeon card in the machine and the other monitor runs on the onboard chip
Works just fine for me.
I have a galaxy tab 2 10.1 with otter box case and it fits no problem.
Yes it is fully compatible with your device while being used with the more rugged otterbox case protecting it
No, completely different connection types. I think you need New AC DC Power Jack Plug Socket Connector for Asus X401 X401A X401U X501 X501A X501U. Can be found on Amazon. Good luck.
Go to company website here http://www.ggs-usa.com/ggs-protectors/ Or YouTube and Google might help
Hello. You can clean the case with disinfectant wipes, but after you do that take a cloth or tissue and wipe off any wet residue from the screen area so that it is dry and responsive to touch. Thank you
I am not happy at all with my lap top. Has all kinds of defects.
you have to have a FTA dish to fact south. Antenna will not work with the box.
yes it works
Yes the charger cable is fused with a 3A 250V fuse in the tip of the 12V car outlet plug
I gave up trying to find a port for it. UV5R doesn't seem to have a port to plug it in to.
Plug the charger into the drop-in charger that came with your UV-5r.
You can use the aux inputs with the zune.
You need the ISGM575. As far as I know its works for 2007 and up. Search I simple for hummer h3 on youtube. Couple of vids on install. Hope this helps.
Place the USB into a wall charger like the one that comes with an iPhone Any USB slotted wall charger will do
It comes with a charge cord that plugs into a wall outlet.
Yes, there is a women's version. It is the white one and the white with purple trim. I have the white one. My husband got the black one and the band is bigger on the black one. I have a small wrist and my white one fits fine.
I believe that mine came with it. If not, it was easy to add-on to my order...along with the 3 year warranty! I love it! :)
Two fingers on the pad at once and move them up/down.
Nope, not internally.
I just opened mine to put 2x4GB SODIMMs into it ... nope. It is NOT user-upgradeable. Memory chips are soldered on. SSD is mSATA so in the future you could presumably upgrade it to 256GB, but the memory is not upgradeable in this at all. Live and learn.
Yes , but I found it dificult to find the right camera to work on the unit. So I gave up on the IP and went to analog. I found analog more reliable.
Please make sure with your IP camera supplier if your IP camera is Onvif camera. This dvr only support Onvif 2.0 or lower than 2.0 version.
Now our device only support below 3G and WIFI modules: Huawei 3G USB module : CDMA2000:EC1261/EC1262 WCDMA: E176G TDS-CDMAFET128 EC1261 EC150 EC156 EM770W E176G E1550 ET128 E173 E177 ZTEF AD3812 U6300 K3806-Z AC582 Ralink WIFI USB module : RT2571 RT3070 For more detail operation manual,please contact customer services. Thanks.
Mine works but it's always slow.
Try using the headphone jack
As long as the A/V system supports either hdmi or the older SPDIF (Digital optical) connection, it will work. If you have a Panasonic A/V system with "Viera Link" support, it will provide automatic set-up and combine to a single remote.
hello i don't know it is working for Panasonic HX-WA30 , but I tried it on nexus 10 and samsung ativ tab smart pc pro 700t ,it is working on these devices correctly . thank you ,,,
No, its't wifi.
1 camera gives an average of 2- 2 1/2hrs so it's abt average of 1 hr
Yes the SSD comes with a bay adapter in case your PC case requires it. Its black and sturdy that attachs to plextors ssd.
it has 5 years warranty. I'm not whether it covers internationally or not, so you could check the official site in your region.
Yes, absolutely. I have the EM-5 and, from what I know, it has the same size body as the EM-10. The 14-42 is a shorter/smaller lens so the fit may not be as snug as with the 12-50 kit lens, but it'll certainly fit. My 17mm f2.8 stays on my camera most of the time with the case on and it's a fine fit.
I think it depends on which case you have. The one I have does have an opening so the charging port is open and you can change without having to take the case off.
4 hour is 1lb 8 hour is 2lbs. :-)
It's 16.50" x 5.75" x 5.75".
Mine didn't. But it uses the same charger as the nexus 7 or any micro USB charger
I haven't tried it but I don't think it would work because the USB in camera is only for data transfer and would be connected to the memory card internally and not the battery.
L P, Don't know for sure because I have not used my ELPH 330 to shoot video of a basketball game, but have been pleased with what the camera can do with people moving around, cars going by and a dog doing doggy things.
Have no idea, have not tried video, sorry
No, just screen.
Once you go to check out toward the final step, it deducts the cost of the memory card, the case, and the shipping (if you choose he free shipping option). Just make sure those items are deducted before you place the final order.
I do not know that it would I have not seen one with an I pad Air in it
It comes with a HDMI cable and USB cable? Yes.
I just purchased this exact bundle. Nikon camera body one yr warranty, Lense has 5 yr warranty Sigma lense has one yr wArranty. You can purchase addition coverage hope this helps. I love this camera and bundle was a good deal I'm completly satisfied.
Yes. Evevrything is brand new with USA warranty
You will need to buy a European adaptor
No and mine has been really good. Still working even now.
I think you can access audio through the unit through the HDMI set up - pretty sure . Once set up it would be the same as accessing movies just use the audio section
There is an AV RCA cable for the backup camera, as well as a +/- to run it, and a transmission switch wire.
Yes of course great feature of the unit very satisfied
None bracket will sit right behind the playbar with no parts showing
The 18650 charge fine with the 1000mah, and will charge two at that rate. I don't think the 26650 batteries will fit in this charger and I don't see them as being supported on the amazon page.
will not work.
sorry I don't know
I try that.It seems I have some problem.It doesn't play sound at all.Even though I try on different models of cellphone.
Not sure about importing but my manual and menu is in English. Amazing cameras these foveons.
no. the screen has a built in slot in the bottom that the stand fits into. the vertical sides are to thin to be supported by any home made stand.
Nope
Yes mine came with the drives already included and ready to use.
Sorry, can't quantify. Seems very slow.
Hey there! If you are asking if this microphone will allow you to narrate video from your helmet with your Ghost S camera... yes it will! It has a clip which you can attach inside your helmet and the mic has a windscreen. If you purchase from 3ME Kite Sports, I will get it out to you right away!
I don't have a Nikon camera but if its got a 1/8" mike input it probably will work.
I think it is wool felt, it's definitely much better quality than regular felt, but nothing too fancy.
Should work. I have a macbook 15" and it has good breathing room. The sleeve is very soft and flexible so I don't think its a problem.
Unfortunately no I use a bery light transparent case cover that gives enough space to connected. Sorry
Judy...I have the premium 7 and this cover fits that one only. the tablet you are ordering is smaller with the height at 4.4" whereas the premium 7 is 6" by the way, Walmart sells the 16 GB cheaper that Amazon.
Dear friend, So sorry ,it can not work with S3.
That will not work with the S5. U bought the wrong one.
The Windows Experience Rating on it shows as a 5.9 Processor: 7.9 Memory (RAM): 7.9 Graphics: 5.9 Gaming Graphics: 6.5 Primary Hard Disk: 5.9
Yes. Among them is the HP ENVY 23-c055
I believe it is compatible for all Garmins, we purchased the 7" Garmin and wanted something strong, it had good ratings since I saw reviews that the suction cup holder didn't work well with the larger 7" size, resulting in failure of the suction and damage to the Garmin unit. There were less expensive ones, but we diced to go with the name brand, and it works wonderful! I do recommend getting the sun shield to go with it, we have a sunroof in our Edge that made it hard to se during daylight! Good luck!
Yes it does
It is better for me to carry only one lens for wide angle and telescope. I love it. Price going down, because D5300 in coming to the market.
Open the lid, with the power cable plugged in to the wall, press the circular button on the top right corner on the keyboard surface area. It is above the "Pgdn" key.
A CPL filter is a Circular polarizer filter. It's used to increase color saturation such as making skies a darker blue and clouds "pop" so to speak. By rotating the ring you can also reduce/eliminate reflections from water & glass but not metal. The FLD filter is used to produce a more natural color when shooting under florescent lighting. Hope this helps you out D.E.
I do not see an option for that. It can FTP snapshots when motion is detected. That said, I have an IPhone app called IP Cam Viewer that will record video from any of my web cams.
No. It's not dimmable.
You talk -- They Listen They talk -- You Listen
Yes I remember so
I measured 90" from the base of the Mic to the end of the jack. Hope this helps!
Yes it does
Hello. Yes, the screen will swivel a few degrees in each direction to optimize the viewing angle.
1024x600 it's very clear like HD.
Hi...it is one piece.
I haven't personally tried them with this case, but it's not thick or bulky. I looked them up on google, and it doesn't look like there would be an issue, but I can't say for sure. I use the regular straight plug earphones. I can send you a picture of it up close or something to your e-mail if you'd like? Just let me know. Sorry I couldn't answer your question better. =-\
the coode is listed on the instructions sheet
It fit Very well, thanks I really enjoyed it.
Not sure. I have a Kindle, 6" E Ink Display, Wi-Fi and it fits fine. If you can compare dimensions of the Paperwhite with the 6" E Ink display you should be able to tell.
Yes, it's on a pivot so when you swing it out it turns itself on, when you swing it back flush it turns off. You can swing the light out further to adjust it to the angle you want. At the furthest out it leaves a little bit of triangle shadow areas in the top corners, but it's not bad. Definitely worth the money.
It works great with my Toshiba 3D Blu-ray player
If the Roku has an HDMI Plug, I don't see any reason not to work. Try it out
Yes. Power switch and plug for charging is accessible.
1920 x 1080p _ 60Hz is the highest of the 6 settings listed ... colin
It has metal zippers
Yes, it has a button that allows you to skip and go back a song. Really great little speaker!
It comes with a USB-to-Micro USB cable. Any wall- or car-USB can be used for charging.
Yes, to both questions. Plus the battery last a long time after charging. One problem. When the battery goes bad, you throw it away. No way to replace it from what others have told us.
Yes, you can. However, it will drain the power from the speaker at a much faster rate.
Yes. It comes with a 120V charger that plugs directly into the camera
It does not come with screen protectors. That reminds me, I have to get some. You can just do a search for those and read peoples' reviews, which is what I'm going to do. As for the Ballistic itself, it's excellent quality. It does not move, get dirty, wrinkled, anything. Top quality fit, like batman's suit! The only little thing I don't like is that it's a bit heavier than I thought, but I got used to that immediately. Get it - you'll be happy.
It has four total. The kickstand has two positions and when you flip the case there is a total of 4. But it is in landscape only wont stand up in portrait.
If there is I am not aware of it.
Heavy gauge steel. The insert is soft silicone. http://www.twelvesouth.com/product/bookarc-for-ipad-ipad-mini
I'm not sure. I had my phone (a Samsung Galaxy Note 4) charging with a USB hub that was plugged into my cigarette lighter and was using Pandora through the bluetooth connection while doing it, and that seemed to work okay. But I haven't tried having the phone plugged into the USB connection on the radio because I haven't needed to - the bluetooth works great. I also use it for answering and talking on my phone. Hope this helps some.
I don't think it would it fits fairly sung without anything on it.
No, It doesn't. Only has the numeric keys in the top of the keyboard
No
Yes. The button can also be used to control playback like the stock headset and the mic will work just fine on calls as well. No volume controls on the remote though.
It comes with protective case. No Drive.
Yes sir. I am currently running 2 x AMD 7870's on it very nicely. The second PCI-E rail is even at 16x so should work fine with any crossfire set up.
I'm not sure.. I did some modifications to the installation kit I had bought from Walmart.. To fit in the 2002 ford explorer.
don't buy this simple as that . mine stopped working shirtly after the 30 day warranty .
It should fit all u really have to do is buy the kit for the radio at like advance auto parts or walmart
Santina, This tablet has a wifi adaptor so you need to have wifi internet - such as a wifi router at home/work. Many coffee shops, airports, hotels have free wifi which you can "connect to"....
Only has standard American plug in.
I do not own an iphone 6 but will attest to the exceptionalism of this camera. Most times the highest recording speeds are not necessary. Lots of great free high speed playback software available via internet. Phenomenal camera, especially at the price point. Be aware, the instructions and camera set-up are written in Japanese. Easily converted to English, Google it!
I took pictures tonight at Wrestlemania. 30. No flash low light. Got some great pix. Great camera.
It's a lithium battery that comes with the camera, so you just recharge it. Seems to last a long time.
Hello, Mr. Bernard. That price was wrong as your indication. We corrected in the right price. I'm sorry. Thank you for pointing out
Yes, I am using it on a Raspberry Pi.
No. I haven't tried any external ones on it yet, but my guess is that it would be lacking the drivers to use even an external drive...but since you really aren't installing any programs as such (since chrome OS only accepts programs that run inside the browser and all of those come from the web store)...the only reason I can think of for CDs is ripping music, and as far as I can tell...that might just be beyond Chrome OS...at least for now
No, you can use Microsoft office via the Skydrive Web Apps or open and edit the documents with the built-in Quickoffice
Yes,it has built-in speakers. And you do not need an adapter for wifi. I have wireless cable for my Internet access at home, and as soon as I got the computer set up and plugged in, it connected instantly to the signal.
I do not use Pandora but try connect via BLUETOOTH audio
So far there is an adapter that u can convert ur 30 pin iPod cable to lightning but it does not support video. U can use an iPhone 4 or iPhone 4S and it will play video as well as iPod touches or classics. It's a 6.95 screen
No you can not
Thanks for your question. It should, however I would consult a professional installer ahead of time so that you are aware of all that the installation will involve. Thanks again.
yes it will fit just fine, all you need is some one who understands how to instal it.
The initial setup is like that, but you can change it to play from all of them.
Yes
It works with anything that has Bluetooth.
Yes it will. It has worked wonders for me since i used it as a back up for re-installing Apple OSX 10.8 (Mountain Lion). As long as you follow instructions on partitioning it. There are plenty instructions and examples on YouTube from different tech guys showing vids on how to back up and install OS (win or mac).
It's in the description. Did you not see it?
Yes, it will work with USB 2.0, just at 2.0 speeds. And I'm currently using one of these as external storage for my 360, can't tell you for sure how the XBone works though.
It has a built in SD card reader, so you would need a SD micro to SD card adapter or a USB card reader
yes, it will.
Yep. It's a really nice responsive touch screen.
Yes, it has a power adapter and a power cord with it.
yes indeed it does
The case appears to be plastic top and bottom covers.
Yes, it's adjustable.
As long as you have something to clamp it to...Absolutely. It is of very high quality and easy to attach to multiple surfaces. I am very happy with mine.
Not fog proof don't know about weather proof
No, these are not waterproof or nitrogen purged. However, I used these in the Amazon and did not have an issue with fog.
These are a mid-size binocular weighing 24.2 ounces (a little more than 1 1/2 pounds). Nikon states that the field of view is 488 feet.
Hi, in the full open position the dimensions are: W:7.25"(185mm)xL:6-5/8"(170mm)xH:2.5"(63mm), this includes the lens covers on both ends. Hope this helps.
There is plenty of room. My daughter has the lenses, three batteries and get charger and there is still room.
My Nikon 1 camera fits in this case, along with my larger 30-10 lens, a spare battery & charger, USB cable and manual.
Sorry, sold out of black.
Sorry, I don't know for sure. I only have a magnetic case on mine. However, I occasional charge my 5S phone with a full wrap around case on it with no problem. I think this stand is the best I've had - - and I've had a few.
Mounting screws for the HD, extra screw for the end cap, FW800 to FW800 cable (12 inches), USB3 cable and instructions.
No thunderbolt. Firewire and USB3 only
do not know and have not tried ataching to Wii....
The enclosure has it's own power supply, so once you turn it on, the drive will stayed powered on regardless of whether the computer is on or off.
dont not see why not?
I honestly do not know. I have only made dough in the machine so far. I read through the instructions and did not see any reference to gluten free but I would call the company or look on their website to see what is available. I hope this helps.
yes charger for battery
What is that?
In my purchase there was NOT a case included. ALSO the memory card only holds 5 pics so you have to also buy a memory card.
Never experienced that kind of jumping or shaking but it will pick up subtle movements as do most HD movie recordings.
There is a wifi setting on the camera that you turn on. It broadcasts out an SSID from the camera. Your smartphone can connect to it via its Wifi settings. Nikon provisions an app for the smartphone for free install. Once connected to the Nikon SSID over the smartphone Wifi, open the installed app. It provides a screen view into the camera's viewfinder and allows you to control the taking of pictures in a remote fashion. In addition, it can download pictures taken on the Nikon onto your smartphone.
Sorry Nancy, it's been a while since I had that camera. I really can't remember. You can probably find an answer on youtube.
Nikon so I'm pretty sur it's japanese
Yes, you plug it into the camera to charge the battery...
This according to Nikon: NIKKOR lens with 30x optical zoom; 4.0-120.0 mm (35mm [135] format equivalent: 22.5-675 mm); f/3.0-5.8
There is a Macro Mode option. How close you can get to your subject depends on the zoom setting. It ranges from 0.4 inches to 2.0 inches from the lens, according to the user manual.
All batteries get affected by cold. But this is the longest-lasting camera battery I've seen. If you avoid using the flash, the fully charged battery could last you days.
Really!? for $100 or so you cannot go wrong---I used this w/o a prb. in the Galapagos, and it was great---- South Pole----cannot comment!
yes it has a month day year like 10 27 2013 and it also has time if you want it like 10:30 or 23:00 - 10 27 2013 10:30
I set mine to night mode & took a picture of the moon in the mist. came out awesome!
yes, it can put the pictures together very easily. it does a really nice job
The lens should work but you will get cropping of the image as this is an FX full frame lens and the D200 is DX sensor. You may wish to consider a DX lens for the D200 as it may be less expensive.
I can let you know in 3 days after my Wife gets it for Christmas but I would say around 2lbs or so. But could be way off
10 photos in each pack...I think that's all the camera holds.
Yes it will!
With the camera's mode dial in P (Program mode), press the MENU button and scroll down to the setting for continuous shooting (bottom option on the first page; the default option will actually say "Continuous" on it). From there, you can press the OK button to see the list of settings for continuous shooting, or you can rotate the horizontal command dial at the top right of the camera to scroll through the settings without actually seeing the full list, too.
No, the E6510 does not have built in USB 3.0 and the E-port is not able to provide USB 3.0 speeds to a laptop with only USB 2.0. Even if you had a USB 3.0 capable laptop it may not matter since the E-port that I received from this seller was misadvertised and I received older version of the port replicator without USB 3.0.
Dell had at the time I bought this 3 different E-port Plus's they all have USB 3.0 and there are 3 USB's on the backside of the docking station. This docking station is small and neat. I like very much.
No
Not too bad! It's worth the trade-off! Love the case
yes it does come with it. It's a great product
The 6D has a battery info display in one of the menu screens. When you install the battery grip and two batteries, the camera recognizes both batteries and displays the remaining charge available in each of the batteries. I don't know if the camera signals an alert for low power, because with two batteries on board, I have never run that low. In my past experience, though most digital cameras give very little warning that the battery is exhausted. I hope this helps.
I dont use XM radio, but if your XM radio component has an auxiliary plug same size as an audio in which is 3.5 mm then it will work. I dont know particularly how your XM component looks like and plugs in. Feel free to ask
It should fit as the mounting holes are universal.
NO, just loosen 1 screw that holds bracket, adjust to desired tilt & retighten.
It corresponds, if it is from 100V to 200V.
Nope, same exact specs just in a different color.
I believe this is iHS. There was no indication on the packaging or on the camera, but I think all xz-2s are iHS. According to Olympus you can use an Olympus Sema-1 Microphone Adapter Set through the accessory port.
My son bought this computer specifically for gaming. The graphics card is excellent. He loves it.
I recommend Bose or Definitive Technology.
Yes, the shutter cable is compatible with the Canon 5DMk3. I have used it with success. It is also long enough to have slack when the tripod pivots.
it should fit standard tripod. just as an additional note: I have found myself not really liking this ball head.
Since I don't own a Nikon D7100 i can't say. Suggest you go to the Vanguard web site and submit an inquiry to their customer service folks http://www.vanguardworld.com/index.php/cs/products/detail-1-4-181-983.html Update: Looked at the site and it seems like you'll need to buy a different cable for the "D7000 family" of cameras, item number TN2. Google is your friend.
Amazon sells "C" size rechargeable batteries. Bob at Sangean dot com
Yes, the IR emitter is built in and it has 3D Vision 2 and support for 3D Lightboost.
I have bought two of these.. One never worked correctly from the first day... The other worked for maybe a week... IMHO, junk!
It provided the network port for you to connect to your NAS server or play the net radio. The player itself has no wifi function.
The Cintiq comes with a bundled software download code on the back of the driver disc. If you go to http://download.wacom.com and register that code with your Cintiq's serial number (located on the back of your Cintiq) you'll get access to Autodesk sketchbook express, anime studio, Corel painter, and NIK software plugins for Photoshop. Pick the ones you want (or all of them ;) because you only get one chance to redeem that bundle.
battery kit for sx610 can be found on this page http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008TX4I6W
Yes, you will need two of them. You are exactly right one for modem and the other wherever you want. I will say it is better than wireless but don't expect blazing speeds.
I believe so. There is space in the case even with the pen on the side. Hope this helps!
Not sure I bought for Samsung galaxy tablet... sorry I can't help it works great with it..
Not directly as there is no amplifier in the package.
Hi. This is only a set of speakers. You'll need a receiver fwith network capability for this.
I am sure it will work on XP, however, I have only used it on Windows8 and vista.
Yes, on the bottom. However, as far as I can tell there is not a space to store the USB when it's not plugged in to your computer. I still love it anyway!
It is wires, and it only comes with 2 but you can buy 2 more on here for cheaper.
Not sure about a hard drive, but it handles large SD cards really well.
I don't but my installer knew everything about this great unit. I can put you in touch with him if you like
I am not sure of the x2 specs but if the x2 has support then that would be the way to go.
I do not recommend it for skype, this tablet is very basic as very slow too, would fit for another applications e.g. emulators like n64 and gba run pretty well
VGA 640x480
that camera and the cable
no. you have to purchase office separately
yes, it did and other tablets
Yes
Noooooo Don't put it in water!!! You can drop it all you want but don't put it in water.
No
Yes it does I have the blue and black case it works
It's my first case
It does not come with clips.
nope
Hi, Sorry for the delay in responding to your request. I cannot find any image of the m800 bottom cover available on internet to view the shape of the pads. Is it possible to inform me about the dimensions (length, width, height or diameter , height in mm) so that to check for any compatibility on our Toshiba product list? Thank you in advance. Hope to hear from you soon. Best regards, Laptop Feet.
I am not sure about "hotspot" connectivity but the system does connect to bluetooth phones so i would assume that if it can "see'the station it will connect. Yes you can install a backup camera but you will have to do all the wiring and purchase a camera. Not an easy task but it is doable. I did not install a camera system. (A waste of time and money). Bob horan
If your dash has room for a double din, there should be no reason why it shouldn't fit and work
This item will work just fine. You can record any sound . And save it on a microsd card.
You can make up to five separate short files. It will play a diferent one each time. We've had a lot of fun with it. So far it has worked well.
If you have used a windshield mount gps this one is a little m difficult but the directions are right on. It is nice to have the clutter of wires. easy to install. I recommend this product
It is the newest one. Go to pioneerelectronics.com for more info
I don't know. Look up the dimensions of the Pioneer from the manuals, and compare to the Mustang dimensions. It should fit a standard 2 DIN Radio slot.
Yes
I found that I had to take my Nook HD+ out of this case to use my HDTV adapter
I just when to the same problem, after a lot of research this web site give me the answer, just type what you are driving and it will match parts and accessories for your car. http://www.crutchfield.com/p_105KWAV61/JVC-KW-AV61.html?tp=20217&awcp=1t1&awcr=28874188163&awdv=m&awkw=%2bjvc+%2bkw+%2bav61&awmt=b&awnw=g
A good place to check to see if a radio will fit your specific car is Crutchfield.com, you can select your year, make, model car and its current audio system to see if this will be a fit. According to their site it will, but I would go there to confirm.
I would not know about the Hummer but I would imagine the size is standard. But don't take my word for it on the size issue. As for the bluetooth streaming it is awesome. At times I have my BlackBerry on the hands free calling system and my daughter is streaming music from her iphone. It does show the library on screen. So the bluetooth system is very sophisticated. I have to recommend !!! Great value
Yes device is super silent. No sound from it. Not sure about 24/7 because I never did. Maximum time I had left it on continously was 14hrs.
L7.5"xH4.5"xW6.25", excluding handle.
Radioshack should have your fuses. Also, if you keep losing fuses, check that the device you're using it for doesn't need more than 500 watts!
205mm x 205mm x 155mm
I'm using it to run a 1000w ninja blender and so far no problems.
Yes you can connect phone via blue tooth to play music. It's a great product for the money. Really happy with this purchase.
Hello Rian, Thank you for your inquiry. The Sound Bar has built in Bluetooth (using the A2DP Bluetooth profile). If you intend to connect your device to the Sound Bar via Bluetooth, you will not need an adapter. Sincerely, Accessory Genie Customer Service
I don't own the T5i, but you can check its specifications at imaging-resource.com site: http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/canon-t5i/canon-t5iDAT.HTM This shows it uses the same LP-E8 battery pack that I know my T3i uses. Same battery should equal the same adapter.
I don't have to re-pair each time. But I do have to pull it off the radio and put it back to wake it up.
Yes , i connected it to 110 volt.
this one is a purple one. thanks
Glossy
My camera is ceiling mounted. Works great. Did have some difficulty with a ceiling mount. Had to modify the one I purchased. Just make sure you check your screen size with distance. Here is a link to help estimate the distance from screen to projector. http://www.projectorcentral.com/Acer-H6510BD-projection-calculator-pro.htm
Here is an article describing 0ms input lag for this projector, so it should be good for gaming on any system. http://www.projectorreviews.com/the-art-of-gaming/review-acer-h6510bd/
Yes it is a single cable that goes to a fan out with two video, one audio and power connection. It does have speakers. If you have a paypal account I have a opened box unit that I will sell for 69.00 plus S/H
No bluetooth. Has its own wireless usb device to connect to.
check on product page look at Product Details Capacity: 500 GB Product Warranty: For warranty information about this product, please click here [PDF]
After Formatting it and the OS takes almost 11% of the formatted Drive... 806GB is Available of the 1TB ,which in my opinion it's still a lot, can't really say on the 500GB though
I have it in my Mid-2012 macbook, and it is working great. Once in a while you can hear a little ticking when it's accessing a bunch at once, but that's pretty much any drive.
I am not familiar with the programs you are running. With that said, I run WrightSoft which uses a lot of memory and was slow to open. The program opens much faster, and I don't have to run a restart between jobs. This "used to be" done to clear the cache so I wouldn't have high memory usage warnings. QuickBooks was another slow to open program. No longer. I believe that the drives "Learns" to assist with the most used programs. I was a doubter before installation, but figured the speed couldn't get any worse.
The non angled cord is very slim. I had no problem fitting it into the aux hole in my case. I can't ensure it'll fit in yours but it is definitely rather slim compared to others I've seen.
if your tv has capability to sign on the internet, you can use google as your browser.
the HDMI response time is about 4-6 seconds ,it is normal for blue screen in a while ,please confirm you select correct input (on the front case with different input buttons ) ,thanks. VIVITEQ INC
It did, it works beautifully with all formats and believe me I have them all, good luck
No idea this is a hub I used with PC
Yes it will
It works with any Android based operating system that is running ice cream sandwich or higher (system version s 3.0-4.4)
No, probably not. The reason for 2 HDMI out is because some AVRs do not pass through 3D, so it is sometimes necessary to split the video and audio streams. If your AVR does not pass through 3D or is not HDMI 1.4 compatible, then you might need to send one HDMI output to your TV or projector and one to your AVR for sound. Otherwise, there is no need to split the video and audio streams.
Its a nice part of the otter box, its built in so there's no need to put on a screen protector
Yes. Phone is kept safe but compromises functionality.
That's definitely not normal. You should have a full charge after a few hours if plugged into 120V wall outlet. Either bad LED's or it's not charging properly.
&gt;2amp
Optics are great. If you mean dawn and dusk then they are good.
I think they are fog proof but may not be waterproof and have never gotten them wet
33.9 ounces
2 7/8 not what you want
Yes Tanks
Yes. I had to buy a replacement because my dog ate the original and the one I purchased works perfectly.
yes, I can be mounted from the ceiling. How far away depends on the screen size 120 inches at 15 feet
Yes
I don't know from the make of your car but the style is a single din. If you know that then it will fit. Hope this helps. Otherwise you can check or call any after market website that will know also.
yeah it will
You have to sideload the settings.apk to get it to sync up.
I would think it would work with anything that has bluetooth.
Just because the keyboard powered down does not mean your actual media should stop. I had this but sent it back, it did not affect my media playback but I did have to press the space key before typing just to start the keyboard up, if I didn't it would skip the first letter because the first letter would be the first keystroke so this would turn on the keyboard not actually type in the letter. Also no I don't think you can turn off the power save feature but I didn't need to so didn't look.
500 watts will do the job, 600w recommended.
Ships from Hong Kong. Check your Amazon order status for tracking (depending on the shipping method you selected).
Not sure about the iphone 6 I use it on my Samsung note 4 and it holds great
Without seeing your dash board, I would assume that at sometime you may have put some type of "protection" on your dash. If so, you would nee to clean the area with alcohol or mineral spirits. If you are trying to stick it on an area that has texture, you might need to use some double sided tape.
Yes you can carry it in your arm but its portability is more of a room to room type and not a "go hiking" with type.
Yes.....the overall sound quality is better. Good bass, excellent mids and highs. Love this thing and would recommend it to everyone.
They must be recharged with a separate battery charger
Yes, after you install the printer drivers it does work.
If you're asking if there's a stock battery which might be substituted for the one sold by them the answer is no. The battery is specially built for the unit, screwing on as the new base. It's theirs or none at all.
No, it is only one device at a time unfortunately. You have to forget the current paired device and then learn the new device. It takes a couple of button presses and about 10 seconds to switch devices so it's not too much trouble but it would be nice if you could pair several devices at the same time.
Yes, actually you can. Until you asked, I hadn't noticed that it has an Aux (Auxiliary) Input on the back. This is like a small headphone jack. So you should be able to run a stereo jack from your Cable Box or TV to the back Aux Input. Their are switches on the Speaker to select Blue Tooth or Aux, and Buttons on the Remote as well. Hope this helps.
I don't think so, it cannot pick up from across the end of a decent size room even. Sound quality is pretty good though.
I would not recommend putting this anywhere near a shower or water for that matter. It's a loud enough on it's own that it could be near the shower and you could hear it
No it does not, only fits smart phones. iPad is to wide for this ipole ext
It is a common ground system. The only issue, I was installing in a used RV I bought and was unfamiliar with the wiring system the connectors did not match. I was also surprised at the quality. It is a poor design that has not improved in the ten years between my old one and the new one. Once I got the wiring figured out the unit functioned so I really can't give it a poor review.
no, but it is a reliable, well built Laptop
If it's IR you should be able to get it to work. Will not work if the controller is RF.
It said windows/ Mac compatible....if ya run it through a pc then use a tv as a monitor yes...its not quite like a travel drive.
As others have said...it can only be used where you have a usb connection. I suppose you could download it to a computer and then transfer it to your kindle but I haven't tried that.
Hi Jeff, just remember, a short throw is meant to give you optimal picture from a shorter distance. I have backed this projector up as far as 20 feet and recieved a phenomenal huge picture with great clarity! Also, as far as the angle, I have had mine on the floor and then just adjuated the keystone to the correct angle to get a straight picture. Hope this helps.
In my experience, this device emulates a keyboard. It's not a IR relay or anything like that. It simply translates a IR signal into a specific keyboard character that a PC could take action on. Not sure it would be appropriate for the applications you are referring to.
Perfect for Plex. Pin PHT to your task bar and launch using window key+1. 1 is the icon closest to the windows start menu. PHT keyboard shortcuts found here: https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201670487-Keyboard-Shortcuts Map any remote button to any key or series of keys Enjoy
VESA Mount Standard: 200 x 100
I have the 32LN5700 32" model and is is updated to the latest firmware (LG calls it 'software') ver. 03.20.32. At this time (6/17/2013) there is no app for Amazon Instant Video/Amazon on Demand in the menu. I am an Amazon Prime customer, so I hope that this option is available soon.
Sure, my husband uses these for a commercial project and mounts them on a wall arm.
Yes
Yes u can, no problem
No it does not. The stand does not swivel.
Yes, it is a LG HDTV
it is NOT a smart TV
It is not a smart TV
I guess that's relative, depending on one's eyesight, and the distance, but the folks in our home are satisfied.
I think it is compact enough for a kitchen depending on the layout.
It's not a Web TV, but I stream Netflix through my Apple TV and it works great.
no it is not a smart tv. But it is a very good tv, to make it a smart tv all you have to do is buy a Blu-ray player that has all of that same stuff on it. Right now smart TV's are expensive, I bought my son a sony Blu-ray and I only paid 39.99 for it and it works the same. This tv though does have the automatic lighting.
No, nothing for just a head phone jack. Only an Optical Digital Audio Out.
Yes it does. Using the remote control go to Picture,under Caption using the Direction Arrow Keys go from Off to On. All Black Background with White Lettering. You'll then see the Closed-Captioned on the tv stations that use it,some do and some don't.
The LG Owner'S Manual Section 15: Making Connections includes connecting to: antenna, cable, HDMI, DVI to HDMI, mobile phone, component connection, composite connection, PC, headphone, and UBS device...I see no reference nor support for a cable card.
Yes, if you have the right equipment
Yes, as long as you have USB port on your computer. The charger head and cord can separate so you can plug it into your computer. Hope this helped
Although there is no counter for lamp hours there IS a counter for total hours on the TV. To access total hours press MENU on remote then enter the #'s 2-4-7-0 . Hit MENU again to exit. You can keep track of lamp hours by writing down the hours when changing. Hope this helps.
Thanks for your message. I'm very sorry that you had this experience. Please contact us directly using your order number (please don't type your order number in here) and we will very gladly take care of you!
Quite a bit. I can hear it with my ear plugs in when my wife forgets to adjust it.
No it is not.
I have not had any issues with this TV. We watch it a lot a night in our bedroom with lights low, as well during the morning with full sunllight in the room. Great TV!
Once you push the 3D button you will see a bunch of pictures from left to right just continue to arrow right on the images until the 3D is clear, because the features adjusts to all the different types. I have found the first one usually works so push 3D then the OK button and put on your glasses on for 3D on a regular TV channel. Once you are done viewing the 3D feature just push the button again and it will return to regular TV again.
Yes there is
Yes
It can email & surf the web. Chrome OS is google's operating system. Really all that thing is is a web browser. The description says it is super secure because it downloads updates every time it boots up but I didn't have it long enough to find out. If all you want is a machine to casually surf the Internet or send a few emails, it isn't bad, just don't expect to be more productive than that & it's also pretty small.
When you switch from one input to another, the TV remembers the setting last used for that particular input. You may have used 40 on TV input, yet 12 on HDMI2. This is a good thing due to difference in signal strength between input devices.
It is 120 and I am 100% sure. This might be one of the most over rated stats though. You may not be a video game player but Xbox one and PS4 both play games at 60 even sometimes 30. This TV does not let you manipulate the rate and some TVs do. You will read about TVs having a soap opera effect and this TV does on some programming. Higher the rate the more likely it is. That being said I love the TV.
While I cannot be positive that a wireless keyboard will work with this TV, there's nothing technically unusual about the design of this or any other LG televisions that would suggest you wouldn't be successful. Go For it!
I have the 42" and have not had any such problems. I do not believe that there is a "60"hz mode. Since the tv is a 120 hz, there are two options. Display the same image twice, which gives a slightly laggy effect, or try to predict the next frame and display it roughly. Which gives the soap feel. 120 hz are kind of off sometimes.
Have not experienced this but did experience darkening of screen in auto mode so I changed to manual brightness. Try changing to manual brightness and increasing your screens brightness. Let me know if this helped.
I was using a surround system but the tv it self had pretty decent sound butdont buy this t.v its junk my is only a few months old and it went out on me last night and anazon wont stand behind it. Nether will l.g do not buy this t.v your just waisting money they are junk
Use the remote. It has 3d format button. I don't know much about torrentz. I guess if your download is not an official 3d (only in title of torrentz and not the movie itself) your not going to get the real 3d effect. Even with the TV converting it. The pic will still look nice and give some 3d depth. Hope this helps.
out of the box it is 26 lbs.,In the box it was about 40 lbs., it was vary well wrapped, and it came to us by ups ground. and the driver waited for me to come to the door so that it would not be left for someone to steel.
Can you elaborate on the question more? Am thinking you need to know if this is compatible with Androids? My answer Is Yes.
It's a great little speaker. A little bass-heavy at times. I use it primarily to play music from my iphone, but you may be able to connect to a TV if the TV is Bluetooth enabled. If not, it does have an auxiliary input.
Yes red led on is normal. You can also disabled it, On your remote in between VOL & CH buttons is Settings, takes you to option move down to standby light on off.
You can use your iphone or andriod phone app. To control tv , as well as keyboard
The browsing is smooth. All in all it is a very good TV
2013
There is only one component/composite input, one RF coaxial cable input, and two hdmi inputs(side/rear). I run all my devices through a A/V receiver with the hdmi. There is an optical audio out as well.
No ive had mine since early may and I love it its the best tv ive had and I would highly recommend this especially for the price!
Yes...its just like any other tv except it also has google tv integrated with a web browser. U simply connect ur tv to ur cable box via an hdmi cable...if u have a surroind sound receiver u can then connect the reciever to the tv w an optical cable (like $5 on amazon) to get surround sound for anything that is playing on the tv.
Sorry, I don't have an LG smartphone. You can try to check the specifications to see if that will work.
No not yet. Jelly bean upgrade is expected by this qtr end. That may open the door to xbmc.
It's streaming only.
The base is silver. The bezel is silver. Bezel on top and sides is almost invisible. Bottom bezel is wider. Back is black.
Hello,Yes it does come with the Magic remote With voice recognition. It does work Fairly well....Just make sure you annunciate clearly.
Sorry, I don't know - never tried. The 3D menu has 3 options - horizontal split, vertical split, and 2D to 3D - I don't how to use the first two options, but 2D-to-3D is my favorite - I just love that.
id guess probably not most of these units wont interface without some kind of adaptor.. id check with kenwood direct..
Yes
Yes, but you have to change the screen orientation manually every time (for portrait and landscape and vice versa). keep in mind warranty is not honored by the maker unless you get is from them.
Most TV's will only include the basic cables (power only), there is component in (one set of connectors) on the back of the LED. You would have to buy HDMI cables and anything else you need. You can find out more about the TV on the Philips website (user manuals) at http://www.usa.philips.com/c-p/29PFL4508_F7/4000-series-led-lcd-tv/support/. Also more pictures on the Philips site and on this site http://www.mohamedbhimji.com/philips-29pfl4508f7-29-inch-60hz-led-hdtv-black
I'm not sure 720P . Thanks.....
Yes. It was used in XUbuntu machine.
Sorry for the delay. Yes I am able to view negative strips.
I do not know WHERE you can find an AC adapter but the viewer doesn't NEED it as it works great with batteries which is how I use mine.
I'm 69 and I am satisfied with the size of the screen. When I use this, I am not looking for great detail. I am using it as a sorting tool in preparation for digitizing the slides. Works great for that. If you are wanting to view details, this is probably not the viewer for you. Of note, I just sorted over 1000 slides and never had to change the batteries. Overall, I am very satisfied with this viewer.
No, you need to buy the SD card separately. But it is possible to take four pictures in 5MP using the internal memory. What's in the Box: WB800F Smart Camera, Li-Ion battery (SLB-10A), USB charging cable, wrist strap, start-up guide, and warranty card.
You need to plug the camera in.
It had a factory looking wrap around it wih a authentic looking label. But as for being a boxed and sealed from factory I'm not sure. But I've been using it for over 2 months and the picture is very good and I have had no problems so far. I hope this helps.
The bulb housing could be recycled, but the bulb should have a philips sticker on it.
Yes
No
It should fit since your vehicle has a double din stock radio but what kind of a adapter are you talking about
I have a first generation and it works wonderful! You will be very pleased with the ease of using it.
I'm not 100% sure. I have the Galaxy tablet and the only thing that doesnt work out for it is the holes for like the power button and home keys and stuff dont line up with the cover. I know this probably didnt help to much.
Are you using the cable that came with the monitor? I had some issues getting mine setup, but it was related to the cable I was using. You may want to try using a different cable rated for the high resolution that the monitor offers.
I haven't worked withi this monitor on a new iMac 5k. I have worked with it on a 15" 2010 MacBook Pro, a 15" 2012 MacBook Pro, and a 2014 Mac Pro. No issues with macs whatsoever.
I am not sure...sorry
Yes, they still charge a service fee
No, all must be connected to 1 satellite dish
You have to suffer scribe to the DISH network. You could call it blacklisted but like a cell phone you have a contract. Hope that helps
No, it's a special order only, 4-6 weeks, as per Lenovo, possibly longer, and no guarantee it will ship at all due to the upcoming Gobi 5000 card plans (see my other reply in regards to 36984TU).
No, it has a standard laptop keyboard, not a Chiclet like in a tablet.
Amazon, and sellers on Amazon.
This camera provides manual optical zoom; you will need to manually adjust the camera's lens at the time you install it. Underneath the camera you'll find 2 adjustment knobs, one for focus, one for zoom; you will need to twist both knobs to adjust the camera's lens from 2.8mm-12mm; by doing this, you can set up the camera's viewing angle from 40-115degrees and the viewing distance from 40-130feet
It's a fold out 2-prong plug, but it should be compatible with any international adapters, which are easy enough to find at most department stores.
Hi there...I think its hard to go windows7...of course we can do it but...I suggest to stick to the windows 8 better. but before you install...try to download factory recovery DVD first in case.... If it is external..of course you can...anyway...good luck with your customization of your system.
Yes, I have used them with my Samsung Galaxy S4. They are great, just make sure you setup your music applications with high priority. I used them for a call and was told I sounded clear.
Don't know. I returned them. Didn't like the way they rested on my ear. Ended up getting headphones that rested over my ear, not on.
The Urchin will act as a speaker-phone, and will hear and speak Siri Commands and Responses BUT Siri still must be invoked with the iPhone "Home" button.
Good morning Julio and thank you for writing us. The Sound Cylindar does not have a microphone but does have a 3.5mm auxiliary input and Bluetooth connectivity. If you'd like to tell me a little more about your application and intended uses, I'd be happy to see if there are some work arounds we could consider! Thanks again! Scott G and the rest of the ListenUp.com sales team. 1.877.744.1179
I'm not familiar with that brand but I am disappointed with the quality of this speaker compared to other def tech products... Very Week bass response.
No
I love this radio it has everything I need I bout it last year and it been great the blue tooth work good and it play all types of cds
Yes it does.
No it's made for big brother :-)
This item is made in China.
It should since it's bluetooth enabled. Just make sure its charged.
Single speed.
The size of a elph 320
The 3D glasses we have for our TC-L55DT60 are passive glasses. One other reviewer who purchased the TC-L60DT60 mentioned the 3D glasses were also passive ( no battery).
Yeah my cat scratched all over it and its fine. Very solid like a tablet. Its would be almost impossible to scratch it
It has a Microsoft virus protection program but does not have office you have to subscribe.
I use the TV daily. It is properly calibrated and has no issues with IR and burn in. This is probably the best plasma you can buy today. Sad that they will no longer be making plasma TVs.
I have had my TV for 1 month now and have not noticed any of this. I would ask a Panasonic expert, but I can tell you that this is the BEST Plasma on the plant today and the colors are much better than any LED TV you could have purchased.
hi, yes it is 4G, it is AT&T. Thanks, PCrush
The carton dimensions are 75.8" Wide, 40.5" High, and 14.1" Deep.
Skype app is installed as standard and last time I checked it still worked. Check if update is available?
As far as I know the camera is incapable of being tilted, we adjusted the TV into a angle that allows it to be centered to the correct position.
Yes, they are new, at least 11 months warranty of manufacturer, thanks
Mine is about 3 to 4 hours if I work continuously (with programs like word or IE)
As long as the weight is supported, you should be just fine.
it fits great with my galaxy note 10.1 and ipad2 but you might need the silicon cover to make it fit tight, if not it's kind of loose because these tablet aren't thick enough, you might put some grease in the headball to make it move easy.
It is very deceiving, but if you add it to your cart, it will show as 86 centimeters. My husband loves it
Manual arm. But there is auto on and off switch, which switches off the player automatically once the playing is complete. But still you will have to manually move the arm back to the arm rest.
Regular LP records are, by definition, 33 1/3. They are sometimes referred to as "33's" for brevity but are actually 33 1/3. So don't sweat it.
Yes it comes with battery and charger. But you might want to get an extra battery for longer shooting periods.
No
No
It's direct lit LED backlight.
Jonathan, Yes, the camera is built-in, and can be used with Skype (though you may need to download the App to the TV first, which is pretty easy). Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
The power cord has a 90 angle and sticks out about a 1/2 inch from the TV.This TV will go flush flat against the wall. The power cord will not be a problem as there is no wall mount that is less then .5 inch .
It is a 2013 model.
27 inches wide x 12 inches deep
Yes.
We have absolutely no problem looking at the TV from either side. Great color. Honestly cable provider makes a difference. Initially had Comcast & I thought there was something wrong with the TV. Switched to Verizon FIOS....OMG....everyone thinks most channels look like 3D.....great TV....true value for money!!!!!
It's a wifi tv set. However, if you have your modem near tv it would be better to hook it with a lan wire in order to maintain signal strength. That's what I did with mine. &#128522;
Yes.No problem
Nope, browser is limited to pop up blocker. No flash and sometimes it collapse. keyboard. Is stacked letters sometimes is hard thats y I bought wireless keyboard..
SUZANNNA E., This television supports most game consoles (Including PlayStation) and Blu-Ray, DVD players and Home Theater systems. The picture quality for all of them should be great. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. Samsung
Electricity in the US is 60 hz. You may be thinking of the 120 hz refresh rate for the screen. 120 hz refresh rate gives a much more detailed picture than the standard tv with a 60 hz refresh rate. If you check further, some tv's now have refresh rate of 240 hz.
Yes, 75 X 75. Very nice TV. Good luck, Jonathan Clark
Chel J., No, there is not a built-in DVD player on this model. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Yes. I have satellite receiver connected to TV via HDMI and TV to stereo via Optical Cable. It works fine.
(Width x Height x Depth): 53 X 1.6 X 12 Inches
Samsung UN40F5500 doesn't have any native wireless audio capabilities. However, most wireless headsets come with adapters that have an 3.5mm connector that would work with this TV. Bluetooth headsets usually don't come with such a headset and a 3rd party adapter with an input compatible with an optical or 3.5mm audio output from the TV in connection would be required.
No. However you must ensure that Game Mode is turned on.
The Korean-made Gariz cases look very appealing if you don't mind having the vertical size of your Fuji increased. However, I have seen a few reviews that say the stitching on the bottom quickly comes apart. They Gariz products seem too expensive for this kind of quality problem. I am going to order the Fuji case for my X-E2.
If you're looking at the back of the TV, it is just left of middle. The rest of the inputs are there too (e.g., HDMI ports). I'm using the optical input in the TV currently, and it works well.
Sanus XF228 is excellent choice, that is what I used for it. App possible adjustments including side/tilt/angle as well as pull away from the wall and pivot.
It runs on 110- 120
This has its own firmware (not Android or iOS). It's a very straight forward interface and I don't have any issues with it.
No, but you can buy a converter that will allow you to connect to the TV through the component connections. This is from mu husband who is more tech savvy than I. The Samsung cust. service line is 1-888-899-7604 or at Samsung.com/support. Hope this helps.
Yes. It has a standard coax connector and an hdmi connector.
It's wired for us power 120v, if your using a power inverter it will work.
I bought the samsung one and it works great ,takes some getting used to but I like the convienance. Oh the samsung one is 89 bucks.. A little high but now I think its great,I bought both my daughters this TV and keyboard and they use the hell outta it.
I am using a Roku to watch Amazon Prime and Netflix with this television. I do not believe that this television can directly connect to these streaming services. You will probably need a separate device, but it doesn't need to be as complicated as a PC. I highly recommend the Roku for what you are asking.
The outer bezel has a little black and then a 3/4 inch clear with a small a curved angle.
Dennis H Snowman, The UN40F6400 has the following inputs: - 4 HDMI Connections - 3 USB Connections - Wi-Fi Built-in - 1 Component in - 1 Shared Composite in (AV) Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Im not sure what that is specifically. But it does have usb ports, hdmi port, Ethernet, and head phone.
I have my TV set up to automatically connect to my soundbar when I turn on the soundbar. Maybe like 2 steps to initially connect the external speaker to the tv.
I'm not sure what ultra thin is but the bezel on my 42 inch screen is 3/4 of an inch. Hope this helps.
110V
Yes, mine does. And it works very well.
Input/ output is on the left rear when looking at the back of the tv.
Yes you can mount the tv on the walk
Yes the one I got came with 4 pair of 3D glasses, which are still sitting in the packing as I have not used them except for trying one out on first day
WINDOWS 8, NO THE MEMORY IS NOT UPGRADED
You will need to install an amplifier to power the sub woofer. Once you install the amplifier you will need to run an RCA from the sub woofer output to the amplifier.
No. Blue is the only color.
We have the 64 inch and it came with the magic remote.
No, you have to remove the case to use the dock but I love it anyway. It has really protected my tablet.
It has built-in Wi-Fi that picked up my signal quickly and maintains it very well.
Plasm tv's have amazing color. But this tv has glare problems. So be fowarned. Great colors, but keep it in a dark room.
Yes, it does.
Chyna, Yes, the Toslink (digital optical cable) port is present on the PN51F5300. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
16 GB Flash, 1 GB RAM....bought a 64gig expansion card for personal files and such.....had this tablet for about 10 months and its on all the time and I have never had a problem with it.
in the back there is a button that allow you to turn the tv on and off and make several other adjustments without the remote control. The button when pushed will activate a menu on screen. When facing the TV the button is in the lower left back panel
From the 8500 e-Manual: "This TV does not support the HDMI Ethernet Channel." It does say you can use a High Speed HDMI cable with Ethernet (or a High Speed HDMI cable) to connect your "video device" (e.g. a AV receiver or DVR) to the 8500's HDMI input connector, but apparently it will just treat it as a HDMI cable - and internet data will be ignored by the set.
I also have the Samsung 64" F8500 and on the back by the serial number it states: "Typical power: 218W". I also concur with Mr. Harlow regarding the new technology used in this plasma tv which I remember had the yellow energy star sticker on it. I will say that watts aside, this plasma has some of the clearest picture I've seen.
Check to see if any particles is embedded between the keyboard. You can turn it upside down and flat hand pat the back if the keyboard while holding it up in the air. Might be a particle of a key is stuck. Lastly ...take out the usb chip and give Iit 5mins and reconnect.
The supplied base is 33"x15", also keep in mind this TV is heavy, so make sure you have a solid base.
I think so, is made by Samsung
Yes
I think it's just for the iPad 2, not mini.
You can get Netflix and a bunch of subscription sites, no full web though, great picture and the 3 D is perfect...
We could never figure that out. My girls hated this clock. We wound up buying another one. The directions for that thing were horrible.
the tv itself no it does not.
They sound amazing. They have amazing volume and loudness for the size of the devices.
These are battery-powered speakers charged by a 5-V power supply. They will not blast you out of the park, but are great on the patio for background music connected to my phone via Bluetooth. If there is a wattage, it would be low, since they will work for about 8 hours on a charge.
when Purchased, i recieved all three pieces. the sub and the two speakers. they look great in my office . . .
I am having no issues using Windows 8.1 Pro's default Bluetooth driver. I pair with speakers and headphones that do not use a code. Works well. Never bothered with any other drivers. This info may not help you in any other version of Windows. I can't attest.
yes, you can see images on this link http://www.pcper.com/reviews/Cases-and-Cooling/Cooler-Master-HAF-XB-LAN-Box-Case-Review/System-Construction
I have a Cooler Master 200 mm fan in the top of the case. The COOLER MASTER Hyper 212 EVO is 6.25 inches tall the Fan is about an inch deep. Its about 6.75 inches from motherboard to case roof. It might work and its worth a try as the fan really cools everything.
Yes, it does. This headset is EXACTLY the same the XP-Seven one, just without all the extra cables and adapters to use with consoles.
I went with the red build and it looks very nice. the white interior reflex all colors very well. I think blue purple and green would also look good too.
Yes it does
Supports standard length ATX power supply. Standard dimension for this form factor is: 150mm (W) x 86mm (H) x 140mm (5.5 inches)(D). ATX PSU's only vary by length. In short, yes, it should fit.
My mobo has the same form factor and there is plenty of room to spare.
yes
The only thing you need is a memory card which stores the pictures you take.
I have used both batteries for over a year now. No damage to the camera, long battery life for both. I have not had to use the power pack as most of the shooting I do is during my hikes.
Thank you for your interest in our bundle! In regards to your inquiry, this camera has the following language options: English, German, French, Dutch, Danish, Portuguese, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian, Swedish, Spanish, Greek, Russian, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Romanian, Ukraine, Turkish, Arabic, Thai, Simplified/Traditional Chinese, Korean, Japanese If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact our sales department at 800-991-3350 EST. We thank you for your time and consideration!
For your music lover yes. As for texting ...not to my knowledge. Good for pics and videos as well.
Yes... It is very snug but that is what I use it for.
No its smaller than the ipad mini.
Yes they are black in color.
I took a 70lb hog at 25 yards. It is more than sufficient for a ground hog as long as you can get close enough.
Yes, there is a picatinny rail in front of the molded grip. You would have to remove the quiver mount, but it can be done. I am planning to do this with mine by using the Bohning top quiver mount instead. Then you can use the front rail just for a foregrip.
I would only shoot video stabilized on the ipad or any tablet. Hand held is not an option for quality videography.
We use Netflix with our LG system everyday, and have been superpleased with the quality. The system itself shuts off spontaneously for us sometimes, no matter what we're watching, and that has yet to be resolved, but otherwise, we've been pretty pleased with it.
mpeg-1/mpeg2 ps/ts smpte vc1 (vc-9) mkv avc rec avchd m4v wmv 3gp mp4 mov flv yes vob dat ts
We own two and use one on a Surface Pro 2 and another on a Surface Pro 3.
Not sure. I would suggest you to use a flash drive to install linux stuff instead.
No. The VariDrive does not supply power to the laptop. However, for certain functions the VariDrive can receive power from the laptop through a USB 3.0.
The sound bar has TWO optical inputs, so just hook up the optical cable from your blu-ray player to the second input. And BTW, your blu-ray player will be connected to your HDTV via an 'HDMI' cable, NOT RCA cables. If you use RCA cables, you will only get standard definition video and audio!!
Umm... I don't know about these other comments, but to get the seperation of Left and Right Audio, the length of the SoundBar does matter. If you're using it just to upgrade the original TV Speakers, then no. If you want the surround effect which these SoundBars are meant for, yes. The more space between the SoundBar Speakers, the more Stereo Seperation (Sound from Left and/or Right) you get. Hope this helps!
Hi Joseph. I used the HDMI out from my Lg HD TV and an Optical out wire from my Blu Ray/DVD player to the LG 47-inch Sound Bar. All works very well.
Yes
I am not sure...but I think so.....call LG support to make sure
It has the ability to connect wirelessly to the internet, if available.
Hello R Chung, We don't recommend using this screen protector for another device. The measurements could be the same however, the cutout could be very different. Please purchase the correct product here : http://www.amazon.com/ArmorSuit-MilitaryShield-Microsoft-Protector-Replacements/dp/B00FQ9IDTK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1385768701&sr=8-1&keywords=armorsuit+surface+pro+2
18 hours. I put it on at 6pm and waited until noon the next day.
It is available as clear or carbon fiber print if memory serves, you'll want to visit their website to be certain. Hope this helps!
If you can get the driver to work with your PC then it will improve your connection. The key words are "If you can get the driver to work". I could only get the supplied driver to work on one out of three of my computers. Forget getting any technical support as Mediatek has no technical support. They did try and contact technical support for me (located in Taiwan) but they will not respond to our emails.
You just plug it in on the back of the TiVo then make sure it is open
No, there is a place to rest your iPod, but no docking station. It does come with a USB cord to plug in and my daughter is almost certain you can charge it that way. She's going to try it out tomorrow and I'll get back to you. She absolutely loves this! I will tell you we had to replace the first one, the left speaker did not work, but the replacement works great!
Yes
You can save on a SD card
No
I don't have the foggiest !
Absolutely not! Search 'Bluetooth speaker waterproof' for options, wide variety at different price levels
You get two speakers. One has the Bluetooth stuff, a cable connects the two speakers to each other but they have independent charging cables. Excellent sound quality I might add.
Yes, this speaker works with aux cable
No you can not. It is a usb plug.
Hi there, Good news! I just went in and checked. It will play your music via doc or USB. We love ours! They are awesome. Compact, good sound, good design. I can charge my iPad and iPhone: genius.
One year
No it does not swivel. Once attached you have to turn it with the TV or as I do leave it one place in the entertainment cabinet.
Yes, I replaced my desktop and laptop computer with the MS Surface Pro. I run MS Office, MS Project Professional and many other desktop applications, as well as the enterprise systems at my office via the Surface Pro. I'm also excited about the Surface 2 Pro -- more memory, larger SSD and better battery life management. PLUS, they have a true docking station coming in early 2014.
no, only wifi.
Sure that ! Linsay tablet cosmos 10 is wonderful
Hello! It just comes with the camera (charging cord included). I had to buy my own micro memory card.
No
Yes it did (connects the camera to the charger)
Comes with battery and charger. You will need to get a memory card.
no
No. There is no hot shoe for an external flash.
The battery is rechargeable. I took this to Europe with me last fall and never had a problem with battery life. It ran down once but that was because I had forgotten to recharge it the previous evening. I was pleased with the battery life.
yes, it has a USB host interface. Complies with USB 1.1 (Full speed) 2.0 Mass storage class Support Bulk and CBI protocol.
Yes. A 2, 5 and 10 sec timer.
Hello, yes, these are new, Canon USA refurbished units with all accessories as new. Thanks, and please let us know if you have any other questions.
I don't know....it kept freezing up that I never even got to take pictures.....it was a waste of $85.00....I'm so disappointed in this product....and for amazon representing this company....my little guy has never been able to even enjoy it....what a waste and when I tried to return it I got nothing but excuses why I can't return it...and on top of that it would have cost almost as much as I paid for it to return it to Hong Kong...it's a waste of your money...I hope this helps
The screen resolution is just ok. And hulu plus IS NOT supported on this device. I JUST downloaded it and it said....sorry... Hulu Plus IS NOT supported.... but you can look at what you would like to download.
as long as u have an open usb port to plug it into, it should work, yes. This item comes w/a disc for installation---modern operating systems such as windows 7 or 8 will install it without using the disc....if you're on windows xp still, you'll have to use the disc included to get the system to recognize it.
16 inches.
It comes with it
I had the same problem. It turned out that some of the files were not MP3s but MP4s. Once the conversion was made to MP3s, I had no problems loading them on to an SD card.
i really can not answer that question since I do not do any type of video chatting at all sorry.
Yes. The cable is 25 feet long including connectors on each end.
If you're asking for length in meters it's 7.62 meters long.
Yes
Unfortunatly it doesnt
Roberta, Over a really long wire you might (like 1000 feet) but the difference between a 6 ft and 15 ft cable is negligible. There is no real difference in quality.
Without cutting it open, I can only guess. It is my opinion that they are 26 gauge for each data line.
I use one of these fans as the 120mm exhaust fan in my own rig and it exhausts the heat pretty well.
Based on my experience, I've gotten about 1-2*c cooler easily and extremely quiet.
Since you mention PC: using Google Chrome browser, after logging into your Simple TV account, there should be a list of channels your tuner has found under the heading "What's on right now" on left side of home page. Once you click on any one of those channels it will show you a screen where you click the play button to start watching the channel. This is assuming you did a channel scan and have the tuner set up properly on your network. Good luck.
This unit does not have a remote as you cannot watch content directly from the device. This device takes over the air broadcast and streams/records them. Then you have to view through a computer or media streaming device like a roku. I had multiple issues with the device and finally gave up. If it loses the signal just for a moment it stops the whole recording. None of my other devices have trouble picking up signals but the simple.tv just would not work as advertised.
In my case it did.
Hey G. Ricks it has one DVI and 2 HDMI ports. Hope that helps.
To pair the iFit-3BT speaker to your iPad via Bluetooth, please first turn Bluetooth on, on your iPad. As soon as you turn on the iFit-3BT, it will go into pairing mode. Scan for devices on your iPad and you should see the iFit-3BT show up on the list of available Bluetooth devices. Tap on the iFit-3BT name on the list and it should connect. For further assistance, please email support@satechi.com. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
Yes!!!!!! It sits safely in the notch.
I charge mine with the USB port on my laptop or with a USB universal outlet charger. Either way once charged it stays charged for a nice amount of time. I hope that helps you out.
4ohms
Yes
Because they are separate channels im sure you could do this with no problem. Although doing that will cause a big in-balance of music in your car because your pushing a lot more power to the rear speakers causing them to be louder than the front, if you want more bass think about dropping the sub down to 2ohm
Yes It can run a sub and a pair of speakers. Just be careful not to pump your sub full blast all the time as there is no built in cooling fan or fuse.
I used 8 gauge and bought a kit from Amazon that contained all the wires and fuse block needed for the install.
Yes. I wouldn't worry about the amp as much as I'd worry about the sub blowing up.
i have mine on a 10" sub it does pretty good, i really dont push it all the way but it seems to be a quality amp.
According to their website, this would be a good choice of power for the speakers. 75wrms @ 2Ohm for each speaker and 300wrms @ 2 ohm for the sub. Make sure that the sub is 2Ohm, though. When you receive the amp it will come with a QC sheet explaining each power rating. Just make sure you tune it properly and it will work well. http://www.rockfordfosgate.com/products/details/r600x5
Do you like to thump? These provide ample high and mids for my vehicle, a very small amount of bass since it's running off my 12 watts per channel head unit. It's enough for my car, if you want more of a robust system, I would definitely do so with a sub and a couple of amps to power it fully.
That is a typo, these are normal 6x9's like any other. No battery or anything else special required.
Honestly, I have no idea. Your best bet is going old school: opening up, seeing/measuring for yourself. Everyone says they know a bit of everything, but you can never be too sure than knowing what you've experienced yourself. I personally opened up my door panels on my 2005 Nissan Titan and measured them before I even looked for replacements. Maybe looking online or on the owners manual, you'll find better answers.
I would say so, they come with a cover for open mount. I didnt use them on my bike because it installs behing my shroud.
Yes they are 4 ohms
No
Yes, get the right size and I beliewe they would work great. Enjoy.
it fits my k702, so 701should be fine
I have used an 8G card with it and it worked fine.
Pics too, but not good quality ones. Good video though for the price :)
You'd have to go by the manufacturer's instruction's, I wouldn't know, it was a gift for my son.
I have used an 8G card with it and it worked fine.
According to the specs: Battery Life: Still, 260 shots; Video, approximately 80 minutes @ 1080p/30fps
Yes it does. Very powerful desktop with windows 8. I would recommend downloading chrome and then also pokki because windows 8 doesnt have a start menu. You also need to buy a separate monitor. Love this beast of a machine 12/10.
It will run for a low settings. But you can always upgrade to a higher graphic card in the future.
Yes
As per my research: According to Vizio site (http://www.vizio.com/e-series), E series LED is Direct LED(contains LED(s) throughout the screen), and according to Vizio page (http://www.vizio.com/m-series/features) M Series Razor LED is Edge Lit (contains LED's at the edges of the screen).Since this is E series this TV would be Direct LED.
Yes it will
Well if i was you i would send it back to amazon. I bought mine a few months ago and it still doesnt work. So send it back and get your money back its junk.
Hello Beth. I own the same camera and absolutely love it. However, additional lenses are expensive for Sony cameras. The one I've settled on is the Sony zoom (55-210mm F4.5-6.3 Lens (sel55210), which sells for about $350.00 on Amazon and other places. Have fun! - Ray Hoy, Publisher, The Fiction Works. http://www.fictionworks.com
Yes.
Yes. I read this tablet every day.
It can hold my canon 5d with 70-200, but not real stable
Fingerprint scanner yes. Color calibration no. Built in bluetooth yes. Backlit keyboard no.
yes it does but no hdmi!
Depends on what programs you are running. But I usually get 4 hrs out of mine as a college student.
NO, it does not.
No
1 year
RAM cannot be added on the model I bought. That's the one reason I returned mine. It was a very nice machine otherwise.
Excellent
I think 64, I am not sure
do not believe it can shuffle
If you can watch tv with out a cable box, you can use this converter box to record with your DVD/VCR.
They should both be active, but I am not really sure...sorry.
I am not an expert, sorry . . check this link http://www.amazon.com/Satechi-Bluetooth-Trigger-Wireless-Control/dp/B00BNFZL1Y
No, the OS is windows 8, but you can simulate windows 7 on the desktop. That is why I decided to keep it as is.
You will not have the same data transfer rates you experience from a system connected drive. But if you are using the additional storage option to handle backups, document storage or as a media drive (which is what I put mine to use as) then you will not suffer any apparent data transfer reduction. I travel a lot and haven't found cloud streaming the best option for playing my media on my MacBook Air. The MiniDrive has solved this for me wonderfully without sacrificing the Air's OS and Data limitations.
I ordered the 2TB model, and it came without a drive. I imagine that there is something incorrectly listed in the 2TB model listing.
I have synced. I keep several personal databases on my Transporter and use them in class to grade students. The new grades sync up very nicely. When I look at the file on another device it tells me that the file has been updated. I don't know about off line.
It is a storage device. It will store any type of file. It will not stream music but it will download it to the player.
Unlikely. I tried to buy several different non-JVC 3D glasses for my JVC projector, but none of them worked. JVC uses a different polarity than everyone else so only their glasses (which are much more expensive) work. I finally just had to buy theirs. Sorry. My projector was the RS50.
Hello Paul, if work with PK RF emiter,yes, its work. I buyed for JVC DILA and its ok.
As soon as you plug in the 3.5mm jack into the headphones, it intelligently shuts down all powered functionality and converts them to normal headphones. Unplug them, if the switch is still in the powered position, it will flip right back to Bluetooth mode.
Yes it does
hi, yes it will.
I have the 32" version. It has speakers, but I added the sound bar. Amazon does not differentiate between TV sizes in their reviews.
Yes. It is a smart TV with bunch of pre-loaded apps including Amazon and Netfilx, and you can add more apps to it. Connection either by Ethernet cable or WiFi
You can hook it up thru your home theater receiver. It is a phemomenal blu-ray player. Highyl recommend it!
No, as it is, it must use AC.
No, it does not have a HDMI port. It accepts RCA, TOSLINK digital optical, and 3.5mm (headphone) inputs.
yes
I assume yes but I can't say for sure. I have only used it on a Dell Venue Pro 8. The pin out for USB connectors should be standard.
I would assume not. I had one a tried to use it with my glidecam. The post was too narrow, and my glidecam ended up tilting downward. Also, the arm isn't very strong, which leads to very jerky motion with any camera setup that weighs over 4lbs. Hope this helps....
it's a pretty snug fit . I doubt you could get the iPad in with a case normally I use cases but with this case keyboard I've grown accustomed to not using any.
Yes
Battery life is about as good as the kind of batteries you use (Duracell, Energizer, etc.). They use three (3) double-A batteries, each, so you'll need a total of six (6). Buy and use good batteries, and you should have great life as these units don't consume much power when in use. They DO NOT work 16 miles, as advertised...more like a few blocks, and that's it.
Yes, the flexible gooseneck will bend to allow the screen of the iPad mini and other tablets to face straight down so they can be viewed while lying flat on your back looking up. Thanks, Standzout
Hi Thomas, YES, I loaded 45' long, 12' high, etc into our RV5365T-LMB. I wondered why it routed us one exit past our desired camp location. After arriving at KOA camp we headed into town and took the shorter route. Ahhhhh... there was the problem... R/R bridge with only 11' 6" clearance. So it works...
be sure it is not in silent mode. That is on first menu page at bottom left. Then the light menu should show up in the record settings menu
I'm not positively sure but I think it will play the movie, but it won't be in 3d because the tv isn't capable of displaying 3d.
Its good for a replacement screen&#128540;&#128076;&#128181;
Do you mean one of the all-in-one water cooling units offered by Corsair? If so, I have no doubt that you can fit any of them, even if it has the double length radiator. On the top of the case there is room to place two 120mm fans (the now standard size for water cooling radiators) and there is definitely enough room between the top of the case and the motherboard. But don't take my word for it, take a look at the manufacturer's site: http://www.apevia.com/ProductsInfo.asp?KEY=X-Dreamer4-PK Hope this helps.
You can change the display from Celsius to Fahrenheit (and back again) by flipping a small switch on the back of the display. You would have to first remove the front panel (it's screwless so just pull it off) and then you should be able to see the switch.
It does not.
I'm not familiar with the .TAB but if it has a micro USB female port, then it will. I have a Samsung tablet which doesn't have a micro USB port so I bought and adapter and it works fine.
It will fix any 7" tablet but keyboard my not work I had to send mine back for that reason
I'm not sure. I know very little about computers. It was fine with my tablet and I dont have a popular brand (HKC), and I haven't had any issues with the tablet or this case. Only concern as stated earlier was the top hook latch issue that holds the tablet in place was not working properly so did eventually order another one in a different color I liked and that one function perfectly. No complaints.I'm sorry I couldn't be of further assistance.
Yes, sure.
It's literally plug in and play, no harness is necessary, all the steering wheel controls still work, and after initial connection with ur phone it auto connects EVERYtime you get in your vehicle
Yes, it will still work
Any port can be used as a WAN port as long as it is configured to do so. The default configuration that ships with the router sets ETH1 and the SFP port (optical) as 'WAN' ports while the rest belong to the LAN. Note that the default configuration only sets the port when you power on the router the very first time and follow the prompts on the LCD. Otherwise, the user is expected to provide all the configuration for the device.
1. Yes, any kind - PPTP, L2TP, IPSec. And servers and clients for all of them. 2. Yes, and it is really advanced. Any kind of port forwarding, mark packets or connections for specific routing, Layer-7 filter for blocking or prioritizing traffic like skype or bittorrent and many many more. It don't have 5Ghz and that is only one disadvantage from my side.
Yes

WORSE PHONE I'VE HAD. GET THE CAPTEL MODEL 840
there is a headphone jack is labeled headphone on the bottom side of the phone
I think as long as it will convert down to the correct input voltage- I wouldnt see that being a problem at all. It comes with a 110 AC adapter only however-
No it will not
They list wattage online somewhere. I used it for a portable printer. It never lost more than one of 4 bars. It retained power well. But a tv might overpower it. You might just have to buy and try it to know.
Jerry, I seriously can't remember because I sent this product back to Amazon I am not using it. Sorry I could not be of more help.
Not sure. I am using it for external speakers, printer, mouse, two back up hard drives, thumb drive as a power booster and external fans to cool lap top. Seems to work with no loss of speed even backing up data. No issues where 3.0 is required.
Almost - it has 48 rj45 ports, all have PoE - the first 8 are high powered, but higher-power is probably not what you want this for unless you only have a couple devices, the total power for all ports is 380Watts. The "uplink" ports are SFP slots, not usable unless you get SFP Gbics (fiber) (or copper modules if you really want that) - they are NOT SFP+. so limited to 1Gbps per SFP.
Yes, you can also configure whether to allow 802.3at or 802.3af on a per port basis.
You are correct. These do not have a WiFi card.
Yes it does
Yes a cd/dvd burner
Hi John, No it does not have an HDMI port. Thanks, PCrush
Beverly - Yessiree!
Sorr,it is undetachable.
No. It has a line output only that needs to feed an external amplifier. You can plug it into powered computer speakers and it will work fine.
The Camera comes with a rechargeable Li-ion Battery with battery charger.
Its is upgradable to 8.1. That's what Im using right now as I type. It will take up to 16GB of Ram at 1600Mhz. Ive never looked at the battery upgrade. Mine will run hard for a couple of hours on the stock battery or will get to the 6 hour mark surfing the net etc. You'll get about 3 -5 hours of Netflix or movie watching. You cannot upgrade the motherboard without MAJOR modifications.
As long as your on 64 bit you'll get up to 16GB of memory. It will max at 1600Mhz.
Playstore,Explorer,pogoplug,Chrome,,Youtube,Google,sub catagory of movies,music,books,maps are also listed on the home page.
I had to buy 3 different chargers
Dont buy this. Its crap. Mine is in the trash already
Supports up to 1080p HD Video, but its very very very slow tablet spend a little more money and get you a good one as this one hangs up I should have waited before I did the review on it ,its only a 1.1 GHz ARMv7 single core ,and has 500mb ram you will need dual core or a quad core and 1gb ram to do video's or watch ,its a cheap tablet hangs up don't waste your money on this one I would return this one if I could
I believe 32GB according to their website. However I only used an 8GB card.
I sent mine back ??
For the TomTom Rider the one known as just "TomTom Rider" is the latest version. Once you purchase it you will need to connect it to your home computer to download and install the most recent versions of software and maps.
Yes you can plug it into your 12 volt outlet
pushing the button on the front for b speakers, on most if not all surround sound systems, will output all sound to the second lead only. If run to another room or outside, will output to the input on whatever speakers you use at that area.
Yes. And also yes. I use my TV (routed through the receiver) as my PC screen all the time.
I got this backpack for a while now and while it's not really big, I learned that I can fit a MacBook Air, phone/kindle charger, my kindle, a few snack containers and an umbrella and a spare T-Shirt. And there's still room. It does feel quite full with those things already, but I could easily put 1-2 notebooks. I think it really depends on how thick the binders are.
Snugger*
Hi, We don't send out samples. However, you can pay the shipping then we will send mat+back+bag Please email us. Thank you
You could get it in the bag but not in the laptop flap, it really is only meant for the small chromebook or a tablet.
If your standard speakers are 6x8 they will fit..
These work with a head unit. They just produce a much clearer sound.
No you will not need an adapter. They will fit as is perfectly. They are amazing speakers for the price and I will buy them again.
Samsung BP70A
SanDisk Ultra 16 GB MicroSDHC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card with Adapter (SDSDQU-016G-AFFP-A) (This is what I purchased from Amazon for my camera)
Yes it does. It may not work as well as a higher priced camera but I did get some good close-ups of flowers.
Wifi only.
No, headphones aren't required, there is a volume dial on the side of the player.
Yes
I'm no installer, but based on specs, this amp is stable at 1 ohm and should run the sub.
The 1505M doesn't come with maps for the Bahamas or Caribbean islands. It does include coverage of Puerto Rico, but that's all. You can buy an additional 'Caribbean' package but in fact right now that only covers the French Antilles - Guadeloupe, Martinique, Saint Barthlemy, Saint Martin. Perhaps not what you'd expect from a "World Traveller" edition, but that's branding for you. I should add that I'm really quite happy with the way this device works in the US and Europe.
Not sure. But the BRX1600D is a beast for the money. Just be sure to have your LEVEL set properly, making sure the Volts match your head unit's output. Having it too high will destroy your speakers like its nothing. This amp isn't the cleanest sounding amp but if you dial it in correctly its all you need for your sub's.
there is no best sub, but there are plenty good subs. this is a true 1600 watt amp, you can go with one sub if you want, preferably a sub that can be re-coned if blown. if your on a budget, kicker CVR is the way to go. 2 15s on this amp and a large sealed box and your good to go.
Hooked up at 2 ohms this amp would definitely run them, at 4 it powers my 2 15" pioneers no problem at 700 each
It has one button that acts as a pickup/drop button. They also claim on many mobile devices it can also work as a play/pause/fast forward/rewind button. Howevver, on my iPod Nano, the button only works as a pause/play button.
I'm looking at the "Emergency User Guide" for the product (instructions) and it shows their 25 Year Warranty seal.
Mine came in a plastic clamp shell with a holster and company propaganda as well as some directions thst were all pictures--no words! Hope this helped!
I am right handed but i have used then left handed in some situations where my right hand was unavailable .... they are the best pair of shears i have ever owned..... I imagine that ease of deployment from the holster can be a factor but the holster allows you to configure to your preference of left hip or right hip placement. As a rightie I perfer the left hip with foward deployment allowing me to use my right hand. As a leftie I would recommend the opposite.
Not Rooted.
Connected
is a switch to select the speed of the cursor movement or DPI, but does not work very well ..!
Yes, it is. A driver update is available on Genius' website.
Based on the picture, it looks like it is VESA 100x100 or 75x75. Most small tv mounts should work if you plan on mounting this to a wall.
The length is about four inches. I use a usb extension cable.
Yes
yes it can record it on the thumb drive, the teac can record your cd to a thumb drive for use in your car and your teac player which will play what is on that thumb drive but don't expect an audiofile high quality recording this feature is a for convenience. Best cd recordings are on an ipod. but for a car the thumb drive is ok. You should read my review to see why.
Mounts to a wall or a TV stand or stands free. Doesn't mount to a TV cabinet. Also I am aware of "known issues" and have not had any problems. System sounds great.
they should work on a pc..plug the adapter in for power and connect to the audio output for the sound....I have not tried it as I no longer use a PC....on tablets...
This stereo will work but will require installation pieces specific to your vehicle.
Like I said previously With it under a grill it has a clear view of the sky and it is invisible.
Yes. 3.5mm stereo input on the side.
Works with my 2012 MacBook Air because it's just a standard USB hub. I'm sure it'll work with your 2013.
Yes, it goes about 30 degrees from straight in either direction.
YES it comes with a web cam built in
all i can say is it sends audio to a tv so i can't see why not.
Peak... This is no way a great sound system. It just plays music. The sound quality is mediocre.
It comes with it's own adapter which is the basic. If you want a direct fit to your vehicle without having to cut wires , then I might suggest buying the adapter to your vehicle.
no-only for right hand.
It's not 2 big I guess like ultra book it's not ur normal power adapter
Mine still says April 3rd for delivery. I asked Razer on their facebook page regarding the status of amazon orders and they said shipments are en route to amazon and they should be shipping them shortly.
Hi Daedrich. As I understand, you live in Hungary. I do not know the voltage you use over there, but I don't think that will be a problem because the Edge comes with its own brick. I would say you just have to buy the plug converter, but you should chek if the voltage, in case it is not the same, won't damage your tablet. Greetings!
No there is no optical drive on any model of the Edge.
Reviews are in, the extra battery (and that's $69 more btw) only offers one more hour of gameplay, for a grand total of two hours of game play when adding $320 to the MSRP, what a joke... Way to nickel and dime your costumers Razer, the battery should've at least been included with the gamepad controller for $250... Don't get me wrong, I definitely was looking forward to this product, but I'll hold off until gen 2 with Haswell, at least battery life should be a *little* more palatable for what you're paying...
If you look up the A58 on the Sony Store and click on the Accessories tab you'll see all of the available accessories that are compatible with your camera. The RM-VPR1 remote is listed for the A58. People with other model Sony cameras can see if the RM-VPR1 will work with their models the same way. They can also look up the RM-VPR1 on Sony's website (Home/Digital Cameras/Accessories/Alpha DSLR Accessories) and click the Compatibility tab.
Yes
I bought this for the IPad Air and it fits perfectly.
Answer from Titantech: Yes, the item fits your car. It fits original Bose system and comes with steering wheel control function.
Hello, this is the prefect unit for you because it does not have onstar function so you wont need it anyways. It is direct plug and play installation.
I don't believe so but Mitsu may have licensed the spec. Must be made after 2012 and use Bluetooth for active shutter glasses. There is a consortium for manufacturers to get a license from Sony, Samsung, Panasonic and one other company. Google: `FULL HD 3D GLASSES INITIATIVE' or try this URL: http://3dglassesunlimited.com/shop/g5-universal-3d-glasses-by-quantum-3d-ir-bluetooth-compatible/ for a manufacturer that DOES list Mitsu. Good Luck!
Yes you can edit videos you just need to download the programe for doing such a work. The computer is really fast and solid to work with gtaphics and videos. We are really happy with this laptop.
I'm not sure what that is. There are eight places where things can be pluged into it. I use one for a wireless mouse. The one draw back is that there isn't an operators book with this.
Does this camera come with data cable?
Yes, it does.
Yes it can
i received the case black. the camera is pink.
I don't know, might be something to call and ask Sony about! I have never tried!
Taking the picture is quick, but I have noticed that it does take a minute for the picture to process after you take the picture. I personally like taking single pictures however there is a function to take continuous pictures so you don't miss the shot! :)
This is a wonderful camera. Takes beautiful pictures with a lot of clarity, the pictures stay clear even when zoomed all the way out. The only problem I have found is that if you have it on auto focus when recording video it will adjust and blur sometimes. Otherwise it is awesome!
No, it just has the LCD display. Great little point and shoot, though. The wifi is fantastic, downloads are quick and simple.
I believe you need the pro version for that.
What do u mean on a global level??
No
If your phone saves texts messages, then you can review the location texts from previous times.
Yes, you will need a simcard (with a subscription or prepay). The GPS itself needs to be able to send you SMSes from this simcard.
Pressing the CPI button changes the "count per inch" setting, which alters how fast the mouse cursor moves across your screen.
I have larger hands as well and there will be some "slack" over the mouse but I wouldn't see it a concern. Unless you have hands like large-handed basketball player, you should be fine.
they come from manufacturer so as many as you need 2 -4 weeks delivery

http://www.pocketfinder.com/how-it-works/plans/
It worked for mine. Just need batteries.
Yes.
Yes. All you have to do it format the card once it's inserted.
I did have an issue with the card reader. Lexar refered me back to the vendor.
No
Only works on Samsung models listed
It really doesn't matter what number is on the label as far as I can figure. What matters is that it does not have a number actually printed on the ribbon. Please refer to the tabs on this page http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BJ5O9MA?ref_=pe_527950_33920250 that show the other options. See the number actually printed on the label? As long as there is only a white label and no number on the label as shown in the other tabs, then that is all you need to worry about. I hope this helps.
5158N Version is more expensive than other model http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GTFDUVG welcome order
Unfortunately, we are not able to provide more pictures of this item.
There is no "iPad" choice on the menu. I have no problems uploading to either my gmail or Facebook, tho.
The radio itself does not play CD's. However you can easily add a CD player to the radio by using the input plug on the rear of the radio. Also it can play CD's that you have stored on your computer's hard drive. I do not believe it will play CD's from your computer that you are playing however. Your computer would have to be able to send B.T. signal to the radio.
lol
I have two titans and neither came with a backplate, but amazon sells them http://www.amazon.com/EVGA-TITAN-Graphics-Backplate-M021-00-000023/dp/B00GS9S4HI
Yes it has an HDMI port I hook mine to the tv a lot.
No. You have to replace the drive with a tray that holds the second hard drive.
it does recognize but you have to adjust resolution on your TV. ok?
I think the question you're trying to ask is, does it have a dual voice coil allowing you to use a 2 Channel Amp or a 2 Channel Amp in stereo mode to drive it. The answer to that question is no. That said, most 2 Channel Amps these days are switchable to Single Channel Mode. That's how I run mine.. http://www.dualav.com/mobileaudio/sbx100.php
NO
You can get em' from radio shack
80 watts
I haven't tried it with G-Box but I'm not very happy with it's overall performance. Using it with my laptop it freezes all the time. Some times IJust need to attach it to the USB cable and it works again. Sometimes have have to reboot. I have quit using it.
Yes mac and android compatible just not iOS
Do not know. Am using version that works with MacBook Pro.
I just took a look at the manual and there is no cable card slot...
yes, it worked fine for me. I liked the bounce feature too. It isn't the most powerful but for many applications it will work just fine.
Yes it should work
That is correct. The NEX-7 has the old style hot shoe. This version has the new MultiInterface Hot Shoe (MI). They sell this same product with the old style auto-lock fitting... But, Sony is moving all their cameras to the new style MI shoe. You might be better off with an adapter. Your next camera from Sony (maybe NEX-8 or something) will have the MI shoe. That is the direction everything is moving.
yes the one I got is pictured
Mine worked out of the box for basic TV controls. It will possibly need to be programed to work with optional devices, not sure.
The clip is like a jean holster for the phone. I never use it, but it is sturdy.
Look at where the holes are in regards to your phone IE flash, and speaker hole. If your phone is exactly the same at the HTC One, then it will fit. If the Camera, and speaker port are in different locations then it will not fit.
Yes
No, it's as if you are pressing the buttons.
Yes, it includes a screen protector.
Up to 32gb sd card
The product was returned for whatever reason it then goes through factory testing to verify it still works and/or repair if necessary. It may or may not have been repaired, maybe the customer returned it because they decided they just didn't want it or some other personal reason. You could get lucky and find it lasts a long time - or not.
Yes there is....and works pretty good. The setup can be a little confusing. But then I am not a very good techie...so that may have the problem. Fm.
The plain Surface has Windows 8 RT operating system and that is what my Dell branded tablet has, so yes it does.
I use this particular network adapter on a Windows Home Server with Windows XP and it works great. I would give it a try with Windows 98 and Windows 7 personally. You could possibly email or call Sabrent to get a more formal answer.
Yeah it is
Yes, they are both included.
No You have to order separately
Sorry to hear that, but I don't see a question being posed here.
Sorry to hear that, but I don't see a question being posed here.
Not really. It is held by magnets - given the weight of the keyboard, they don't hold it like they hold the soft Apple cover.
U should contact Logitech for tech support, but you have to turn on BlueTooth on your device. The directions with the keyboard are pretty complete.
Yes it does. I bought mine from vivetechnet. Fast shipping
Do not know if it works with that particular model. I am using it with the tc-p65zt60. It has a sleep button on the remote that is not on the original remote that came with the television. So I used it to program a button on the Tivo remote so that we do not have to go into the menu system every night to access sleep mode. Sony did the same thing. Do not know why manufacturers do this.
Yes
Obviously like any other electric device it needs power, the easy way is just to disable the switch power so that it will always provide power regardless of its position.
Surprisingly, no. I would expect the white color would show everything (fingerprints and the such), but it doesn't. That being said, I always carry it inside a backpack, but I don't baby it. I'd buy it again. Happy
I have a 15 in. MacBook and it fits perfectly with a little bit of space to spare. You should be fine.
HID ballasts are universal. As long as you have the HID bulb they will work on any vehicle. The only thing that you need to pay attention to is the style HID bulb (I.e. 9005,9006,9007,h10,h11,etc)
I don't understand the question "can they be link?". I'll take a guess as to your meaning. If you're wondering if the Bluetooth speaker can link wirelessly...it can connect via Bluetooth technology. I connect it to my ASUS Transformer book T100 windows tablet perfectly fine. If you're asking if it can connect to a device with a wired connection, yes, it does have a "line in" that is a standard 3.5mm stereo jack connection. I hope that helps.
No
The RAM isn't replaceable it is soldered on the laptop. The Hard drive is replaceable. Just remember that Windows 8 is not on a cd but on the hard drive memory so you will have to use software to clone the files to your new hard drive.
yes
It did not come with one, but the screen is very scratch resistant.
It is like a regular tablet in function, for example, photos and video but with content for tweens.
yes. It is good. i recommend it.
Yes, it can be connected as long as the T.V. has RCA jacks or HDMI port.
It should easily fit the CPU cooler and it has a section of the drive bay that is removable to accommodate a large GPU.
I really dont know ..it should give you the option to check and see if it fits your vehicle
Yes, but it will require a kit, look at an additional 40.00 in cost from your installer.
Very easy. To get to the actual fans themselves, just pull the front cover (takes about 5 seconds). The right side cover (looking at the front of the machine) comes off easy enough; remove two thumb screws and slide it off. The wiring for the fans goes into a structural channel that routes it around the internal drive bays and out near the power supply.
Hello. This model may not fit in your vehicle. I would recommend visiting a local car audio shop to inquire about which radio might suit you best.
Yes, it will fit your 2002 Civic. You will require a dash kit, wiring harness, and antenna adapter to complete installation.
Yes it works on 110v or 220v
Yes, this box comes with an external power supply. It's a brick-type, similar to what would come with a laptop.
Hi John Mckeown, Yes, it does. -AnkerDirect 1-800-988-7973 support@ianker.com Mon-Fri 9am to 5pm(pst)
No need at all to change the fans. The cooling is more than enough. I play heavy games with a cross fire config and it does ir perfectly
2 on the Front panel, one at the back. All 120mm (IRC)
I'm.useing existing speakers from.another system that I had, but I.don't think you would have a problem if you use non surround speakers
No, the input names cannot be changed on this receiver.
I don't have this issue. However before you think something is wrong with your receiver be sure you go into the Receiver's Home Menu&gt;System Setup&gt;Other Setup&gt;Auto Power Down. Check and be sure that Zone 2 doesn't have it powering down after 30 min. If this feature is off or is set to power down after an hour or more then you might have an issue. Good Luck.
There are two cords that come with this unit. One that plugs into the sound out jack and one that plugs into a USB jack for power. The instructions are good that come with the unit.
Nope, it has a USB cord and a male audio jack.
This will not fit the newer low-profile cases. This will only fit the larger hero 3 version case, the ones with the lens screws on the front
Not certain, as I have found that most laptops have the same issue, myself I attach a wireless mouse and keyboard to mine and therefore the problem is avoidable
No, it does not.
Yes, it does have a web cam
We can assure you that this is new item and we get it directly from the manufacturer themselves.
HONESTLY I DON'T KNOW
Yes. Also, it definitely works with the "Yale YRD220-ZW-619 Real Living Electronic Touch Screen Deadbolt, Fully Motorized with Z-Wave Technology, Satin Nickel" as I have a few of these working with it...
It does not fit the first. My sons have a 1st generation and a second generation. It only fits the second generation ipad. It should fit a 3rd generation, as it is 0.6mm smaller I believe
It is 901 g. Or. 1.15 lb... This weight with iPad 2 .. It is very very good for kids to carry it around.. I'm love it so much .. When he bring iPad with this case every body have a little kids ask me all the time they want for them child ..
I don't know what a meep is.
i don't know the dimensions of the first gen i pad. I am not sure.
The magnet is 3 3/4 inches wide.
I don't have a tape on me, but I would guess it to be 3" or 3 1/2"
No remote. However, just like any other Bluetooth device you can be across the room control everything through iPhone, android, iPad, or any device that will connect to it via Bluetooth.
Mine didn't charge either. Probably this is just a toy-like stuff and should never expect it to work.
Maybe TV speaker is better than this... Maybe TV sound bar is fit for u
Make sure you press the "pairing" button on the speaker (the light should start flashing) then you scan for it with your iphone.
No, these earbuds do have any button to pause/resume or skip songs, volume control.
no it does not later system have it
Yes, there are ex's hook ups in back just run a piggy back Eva from the DVD to your bags,gl
Yes, you can do it via bluetooth or cable
Hello Steven; this receiver only supports 4k upscaling- not 4k Utlra HD passthrough. Please check soon for our new 2014 product lines for this feature.
You would have to get a Bluetooth plugin for the front headphone jack. Search Amazon for the Miccus Mini-Jack. It works great. And you could use it for other devices.
I believe with this receiver, the sub gets connected with a coaxial cable. Even though there are two coax outputs for sub, my sub only has one input so I use the right output. I don't believe there is a way to use positive and negative connection wires (speaker wire) to the sub unless you get some kind of low-high level converter converting the wires from the sub to the required input on the amp
The cable was permanently attached, for US outlets. I would assume that appropriate cables/adapters are provided overseas. But it's certainly worth checking.
I find the glasses PERFECT for doing just that. I wear them over my reading glasses. I wear them sitting on the sofa too, while I'm crocheting. When sitting up the are a little heavy on the bridge of the nose, so I put a cotton ball under them and they sit great. They aren't adjustable/customizable for an individual face, so they do take a little getting use to. I love them!!
actually the drives are about as hot as when they're in the ext enclosures. I found that out when i opened the enclosure on a ext drive that had just been shut down and checked the temp inside the case.
That button is for backing up with the included software. I love it for quick backup of my save games. The cloning (which I've never used) requires a different procedure not easily done accidentally. I really love this little device.
I have used it exclusively with Windows 8. The Drives appear as regular removable disks and works just great.
No it doesn't, that would be nice though!
Not sure if it works with cricket. I have t mobile and it works great.
Yea any camera can fit in this, just think is better for take some shot below your waist not over your shoulders.
yes, you do have to have card to make pictures.
I have not tried night time pictures yet, the pictures I have taken are very good though, I would imagine night time would not make too much difference. 16 MP and a very compact design are the highlights as well as the lithium rechargeable battery. Very economical, and a very good overall camera.
In an open field, you can expect approximate range of 15-25 miles. If you do not understand the concept of amateur radio, chances are, you should not be buying this equipment.
5 watts on high, 1 on low
About 3 miles at 1-Watt Tx power and 7 Miles at 5-Watt Tx power.
If you set your channel it won't switch to freq.
These are for passive TV and most samsung TV are active.. So they will not work..
I think it was a freak event. I received mine in perfect condition and love the camera. I take it everywhere I go because it's compact and takes great shots.
i have a toshiba laptop and it worked fine as 2nd monitor
http://www3.pny.com/NVIDIA-Quadro-K4000-font-colordc0431Newfont-P3275C365.aspx It contains an auxiliary power cable: 2 x 4-pin peripheral to 6-pin PCIe. The card takes 6-pin PCIe, and these days your power supply should come with this type of cable.
Adobe only works with Nvidia Quadro as an openGL so I would go with this card.
in my experience. I now have a K4000 (3GB) which is far far better - unfortunately at significantly greater cost.
Completely depends on your use. If you're using ANY Autodesk, Adobe or Bentley software you need to look at the K620. Graphics are everything now days. I have this card, the K4000 and K610. They work 3D magic!
I used it in China but the hotel had like all the different ports so I didn't even really need it. Going to Asia? just make sure your power supply switches voltage and take this thing adapter and I feel pretty sure your good.
Yes, it will Win 7/8 both 32 and 64 bit. Windows 7/8 will automatically installed software drivers once plugged in.
that is a good question_call the company you bought it from and ask them. I just now did get window 7 myself and fortunately I did all the diskette converting before that. I believe you can just try_it will show you if window 7 allows it to read on your computer.
It is supposed to work with a MacBook. I have not personally tested it though.
6.2 " by 3.7"
the U.S. version is AF100A
The phones and main base all have push buttons to dial with.
It has google play but this tablet runs slow and loads the internet slowly. Also the touch screen is not very responsive.
Doesn't work at all,think son broke it
Goldengulf is the original seller of this list, I provide a free leather keyboard case like the advertise.
Yes, we think it fits 2014 Kia Sportage R. May you send us a picture of your dashboard?
I purchased my sky caddie with a special offer for free fee for the life of the device but since then I understand they have an annual fee which you can check out on the website www.skygolf.com. As I remember the fee is not a large amount. Some where in the range of $25 to $30 a year. A may even be less than that. You can get the information on the website. As I remember it is not a large amount.
It is connected via an ethernet cable (no wireless). Personally I bought a cheap wireless bridge ( http://www.amazon.com/Edimax-EW-7228APn-150Mbps-Wireless-Extender/dp/B005KN1YV6 ) and plugged the receiver and all my other internet-saavy A/V equipment into that. I figure I will never need to stream more than 1 of those devices at once so why not plug them into a single point.
Sorry, it does not auto on with digital input signal ...
The NR1504 uses A/C current. Units available through Kraft Street Audio are intended for use within the United States and are equipped with a 120V~60Hz power supply. Please let us know if you have any other questions!
I haven't noticed any fan noise at all.
I haven't personally used that feature, but it claims to have it.
I'm getting about 5-10 ft accuracy when a manually input a coordinates using Log and Lat.
As far as I know, it fits any of the dv7 Pavilion laptops...not sure what series mine is, but it works great & has longer battery life without recharging than the original.
My TV is a 32 inch Panasonic (don't know the model #). However, the tv is at least 5 years old and the sound bar works like a charm.
Yes it works extremely well with my sharp flat screen
A does not come with any wires u need a HDMI or optical cable
I installed Ubuntu on my machine. It is not working properly for two reasons, It is not possible to connect to any network with the network adaptor, and the functions keys does not work.
It's got Windows 8. So, do you mean DOWNgraded? Or are you being facetious?
It should work with any standard USB mouse. I'm not sure about the screen. The 2013 Pixel has DisplayLink, which can be converted to HDMI.
I know I've purchased a number of Chromebooks, but I don't know a thing about them. I've never used one. They were purchased for multiple users and I've never heard anyone complain about the image being upside down. Sorry, I can't help you.
Everything is metal
No, it won't. It's a bit shy. Wish it would.
No...mine is a normal SD card (that won't fit in the camera!), but it's a Sony. Also, the camera pouch is so big that you could fit about 4 cameras in there! But the rest is worth it! And I'm really happy with the camera too! :)
so far it is working
I bought it as a gift.Sorry can't help
phone is nice and thin and sippery, put the case on and it well protected but rubbery, not a slippery smooth case. Easy in more formal clothes but sort of harder to get out of jeans,... never thought of this as a problem tho,... good case with stand and much cheaper than anything in store
Was Not Sure So Tried It. Couldn't Get It To Work On My netbook
I don't know it didn't work for me it's to old for my laptop
The GPS unit, a cable for the car and a suction stand for the windshield was what I received.
Yes, the camera comes with one battery supplied to Nikon and than we supply a spare battery in the kit.
The shipping weight for this kit is approximately 7 pounds.
Yes it does
Yes it can
Yes it comes with a wall charger.
I had a lot of problems with the device. The mouse was terrible and the resolution did not sync properly. Better go with Chromecast or Roku
Beto, This model would be compatible with the UN55HU9000. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Henry, Yes, these would be compatible. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
No it is not. You need to use the charger that comes with the unit.
It plugs into any of the USB ports in the back of the TV.
No, thats a function of the Skype application and there is no auto answer setting on the Skype app. A stand alone web cam can be configured to do what you want without using Skype.
Yes, the microphone pickups are on the left and right of the camera lens.
unable to say. I use it with a UN60F8000. Works OK but not impressed. Some features don't work with various APS but overall it is handy to have. Biggest drawback with any Samsung high end product is its lack of compatibility with APPLE products... for this kind of money the two should work together well.
I donk know,i thought that it will work for d3100,but ,it does not :/
Yes it does. You set it up and it goes to the HD then to the PC. I like it!
The Macally enclosure does not comes with any storage. You will have to purchase separate HDD/SSD to install into the enclosure
yes this amp would be perfect... 500 rms amp pushing 2x250rms should be good... you want the amp rms equal to the total sub rms
It comes with the mic and wire You will need to buy a wiring harness specific to your car for the unit to work
Valen verga
Hi Suzanne, Thank you for the email and interest. Yes, this TV cover is designed to fit with or without the Mount. Please do not hesitate from contacting us any time. The AramediA Support Team
I use it on my Olympus OMD EM5 if that helps. I can't find a good source for what type of connector but Olympus calls the port on the camera USB 2.0.
Yes, if you look closely on the Foscam website, you'll see that the dome attaches to the arm with three screws much like a bathroom light fixture, there's a recess in the arm that locks/retains the screws. You'd need to make your own water tight seal to use a rod/pipe mounting, but I would simply drill the pipe with a large enough hole to allow the screws to bite and then chalk around the joint well. http://foscam.us/products/dome-enclosure.html (roll over to zoom in)
Hello Steve, Thank you for your inquiry. The GOgroove FlexSMART X3 Bluetooth FM Transmitter only comes in white. However, there is a compact version of the FlexSMART X3, the GOgroove FlexSMART X3 COMpact that comes in black. The transmitter head is the same, but the neck is much shorter. A link to the product can be found below: http://www.amazon.com/FlexSMART-Bluetooth-Transmitter-Technology-Handsfree/dp/B00EPQ0U2S/ref=sr_1_2?m=A2QHBM8MEN9W65&s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1377789729&sr=1-2&keywords=x3 Sincerely, Accessory Genie Customer Service
Yes
hi travis, my computer has the amd radeon he7570 card bru
no
GOOD FOR WHAT THEY SOLD FOR...
Yes, it came with 4 different sizes to fit your ear
So far so good. I've got a pretty large head, so I have them stretched out pretty far and haven't had any issues.
Hi Vineet, this headphones is compatible on your Apple device. -Vincent
Hi, this Sony earbuds came along with black and white set. Currently there are no pink pairs for these. Ely
Yes
Any would be good, it's just your preference on different types of sound
Yes. If your child is small enough, it might fit nicely around their waist.
Hi, my 9" Nook hd+ fits this case well, I also had one for my 7" Kindle fire Hd and they were a high quality case. I hope this helps.
Hi, Yes it is bundled with a 3-Years Advanced Exchange Service and Premium Panel Guarantee. Thanks, PCrush
I haven't experienced this problem as I don't use DVI. Sorry I can't help.
It is not a feature on the TV's remote for a basic cable line. However, I use to have a DVR which did have a picture-in-picture feature on the remote and it worked fine on this TV.
No. HDMI cables are usually included with your components, not the tv.
Not sure what charger the kindle uses but if it's mini hdmi you could use mini hdmi to Hdmi adaptor. This tv does not have Smart tv capabilities but you can connect an external box like Roku, chromcast, or Apple TV.
i have a different model but similar issue- the color was only black and white. the green is a shared port so use it as yellow and go in to the settings - go to options then down to input options. then go to AV input and change the setting to VIDEO. I bought a tv and the online trouble shooter said bad tv so I ordered another and it did the same. this time I called support and they helped
the wall-plug-in-charger came in the box with the golf buddy voice + gps. at the end of the round there seems to be enough charge for about another 14 holes, or so. hope this helps. jc
No difference. In fact I found the band too sweaty and bulky so I wear mine on my visor. Sometimes it tilts the visor because it's a little heavy. My friend put a safety pin thru the clip and pins it onto his cap. On belt is good and can even be changed to read facing up.
Have the buddy off then while holding the round button down, turn on the buddy. Use the + - buttons to choose the language
yes it does!
It is uncorrelated with roku. Roku is streaming from the internet. Winegard is using antenna signals from the from the network stations
I extended mine with a 12 foot cable...no problems here.
Yes
No
Yes
As long as the kite has 2 strings close to one another it will. You tangle the 2 strings into the green peaces on the picture, with the camera looking down at you.
Yes, this mount will work with the GoPro Hero4.
If you purchase the diskless version, you will need to purchase and install storage for this device in the form of a standard 3.5 in. SATA internal PC hard drive. You can add up to two drives. You can attach your USB drive to this device for redundant back up of the device in case the disk(s) or system should ever fail.
Yes-set up the NAS as raid drives. Mirroring is automatic. If a drive goes bad, you replace it & it will be rebuilt automatically. Note-drives are not independent. They are part of an array.
The ReadyNAS 104 supports the following bonds: - 802.3ad - Active Backup - Transmit Load Balancing - Adaptive Load Balancing - Round-Robin - XOR - Broadcast Some of these, such as 802.3ad require a special switch, while others, such as Round-Robin (i think), do not.
No sure sorry
My Galaxy Android and iPad connect without issues. If you are sure your Bluetooth is on you might have to have it replaced.
Just buy a 3.5mm Male To Male Stereo Audio Cable....plug in the back of the JBL and into your headphone jack on your computer....works like a charm.
Yes
I'm not sure what you mean by keyboard cover. This is a full-size keyboard that opens us with storage underneath and holds a iPad in slot.
I don't know, but I do know it works with the Samsung Galaxy Note 2.
Yes, but I wouldn't, the vivotab note 8 uses wireless video so the HDMI cord is useless and you'd be better off getting an extremely useful "powered OTG cable", not included in this. Try this:
Plug and Play. you dont have to do anything but plug it in. i use the micro usb male to USB2.0 and just plug the thumb drive in and your set.
Not sure if this is true or not? I contacted stmbags.com in San Diego and they said the case should fit the newest Mac... but that it may cover a mic area? She said it should not impact the operation of the mic. I just bought a new MacBook Pro 13 Retina MGX82LL/A and I ordered this case. I hope the person at stmbags.com is correct and that it fits... and that the mic works fine. More to come.
No, just has sleep timer.
In my experience no. I haven't used it for awhile but when I had it on I never had a problem with dust.
It fits my macbook pro 13"; however I am not sure what model I have. It covers almost all of the screen. Some of the black areas on the side and bottom are exposed though.
Hi, It will take 7-12 day from HK to Colombia. The sedan version is ok, we have sold many this kind of units before. Thank you.
This unit has lifetime maps only, not lifetime traffic. Thanks.
I own this case & I love it. I really don't know how u can repair that. Mine is in top shape
yes, item is for HTC ONE M7
There are 4 bearings on this slider
A knob can be screwed in and out to either hold it in place or slide smoothly. That is all.
Answer from Titantech: It is Grey.
Adapter to what? This comes with a USB connection witch you should be able to connect straigt to you xbox and i really have no clue what you mean by the internet part.
Did you know your windows computer updtaes at least once a week? creepy? no. updates are required for software to work properly you dashboard 2.0 is outdates mine is at 3.2. If you want to remove it just go to control panel and go to uninstall programs. In a mac just drag into the bin.
Yes I have a Mac
Yes
no.
It comes with a boomerang shaped foot which can make it stand, however, I mounted it to the wall.
Sorry I wish I could help but never tried that
No at this time up to 32GB
English is not my first language, so I don't know how the part is named. Either way, it's a small piece that connects thru the usb port of the computer. Hope it helps :)
3hdmi,av, comp, cable
It does not have a mic but it does come thru the speakers just need your phone n talking distance
This is all-in-one. Has dvd player attached.
It it is a simple camera system with no built in ability to handle GPS. I do not recommend this camera due to the exposed wires on the dashboard.. I would look into a wireless system.
Yes.
I had this happen and had to use the hard reset button and reconfigure the camera...
it depends from that type of use is applied... if as AP is used you can use two omni directional antenna of 12 dbi, model HG-5812 U-Pro of the L-COM company... if as link is used you can use two grid antenna of 27 dbi, model HG-4958-27G always of the L-COM bye alex
There are two plugs at the base of the unit-one is for POE... :)
The 5 Ghz frequency is used as the transmitter signal between the bridge points. Assuming you are connecting the router to the bridge with a Cat 5 or 6 cable you will not have a problem.
The second port is non powered and can work that way at for you
not sure what you mean or what you need this camera for.
I have been using this one to provide the internet service for my relative two houses away from mine and it has been working great so far. I am not familiar with N-EAP350 Kit.
Yes, I think you can. Its a external AP but works as a client too. You just have to configure it as Client.
No, it's plastic. If you buy this, always store the filter in the supplied cloth bag and place the plastic cover sheet on it as well. I have done this and the filter has been in good condition since purchase.
Yes the Nuance Dragon Software will actually transcribe for you. It works both live and off recordings. The program has difficulty with scientific or specialized words, and constantly messes up punctuation, but if the choice is between manual transcription and using Dragon you will come out WAY ahead using the software.
If it has a usb slot you can buy an external cd/dvd drive and load it that way. You can buy one on ebay for about $20.
s/b OK in a smaller closed environment w/o additional speaker.
YES it CAN BE voice operated - it's sort of a hidden feature - If you go into the MENU function, you'll see an option called VOR which is Voice Operated Recording. I just found this in the online manual - instructions are found at http://esupport.sony.com/US/p/model-home.pl?mdl=ICDPX333&template_id=1&region_id=1&tab=manuals#/manualsTab
Yes.
Nikon says it will work fine with the D5200. The D5200 is a crop frame sensor so the lens will be a 100mm to 600mm.
Yes. In the setup or settings menu.
don't know exactly how much but to me it's very light.
The specification info says that the screen is 2.70 inches. Someone errored when they said 5 inches. The view screen is large enough and very viewable.
I hooked this up for a friend who had a display table for his flat screen. So the left and right laid on the table, and the center was placed right in front. Then for the rear, we bought two simple stands and ran the wires up the center pole of the stands. Keep in mind, use Velcro on the base of the rear speakers and the stands, in case someone "bumps" into them. If you are wall mounting, then this is the site for the speaker mounts....http://www.amazon.com/VideoSecu-Deluxe-Speaker-Brackets-Ceilings/dp/B001QNBUA4/ref=pd_bxgy_e_text_y
no has a cord to plug it in the battery is a narrow pc. We only had trouble one time that the cord was home and we ran out of battery most times it takes a long time to run out of the needed juice
I got a 32Gb SD card that works just fine. As for brand, there's not a ton of difference between them, these days. I believe a 64Gb will also work in the camera, but two 32's were cheaper than one 64, when I got mine. As for cases, I suggest a hard case over a soft case. There are a couple of "leather" cases that are sturdy enough. Remember, especially when turned on, the camera doesn't handle drops very well. Be sure to use the wrist strap!
Here is what is found in the original box of the COOLPIX P330: Camera Camera strap Battery EN-EL12 (with terminal cover) Charging AC Adapter EH-69P (The battery has to remain in the camera to use this charger, like a cellphone) USB cable UC-E6 (used together with Charging AC Adapter or alone to transfer data to a computer, like a smartphone) Audio Video Cable EG-CP16 ViewNX 2 CD Reference Manual CD
No viewfinder but with the screen easy to view. Great pic with choices if you want. Great camera to have in your pocket. iIcarry it everywhere.
Yes, it's rechargable & I love this little camera.
The camera comes with a rechargeable battery. It has a great battery life.
As for me I've only used it on a PC and a Raspberry PI. Absolutely no problems there.
No. This cover is made to fit exclusively the ASUS.
I got this wall mount and it works great! Low Profile Tilt Wall Mount for 36" - 63" LCD/Plasma/LED https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0049LBGCW/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_4VkFub18VB74B
Yes sir. I have my 17" g750jx tucked right in. Fits the laptop plus charger, mouse, a binder, etc. one corner is kind of tight for the zipper, but the smaller 16" should fit no problem.
The screws that came with my set are "self tapping" meaning I had to turn hard to thread the plastic as I attached the base to the TV unit.
No, I don't believe any TV comes with HDMI cable but you can buy one for $5-$12 on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-High-Speed-HDMI-Cable-Meters/dp/B003L1ZYYM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1387034480&sr=8-1&keywords=hdmi+cable
It's a 40" 1080p set with 2 hdmi slots. so, yes.
No. There are 3 ways you can hook up a DVD player, the HDMI being the best. RCA cable is one of the options.
Perfect.
Yes it is mountable. I have mine mounted on a wall
yes it does. you will have to have a long headset cord, it's in the back.
Yes, I have mine wall mounted. BTW this tv has an really amazing picture, I use it for video games and movies.
I have the same issue - 60 and not 120 hz, but I do not do video games or watch sports much, so 60suffices me. However if you find out how to get 120, please let me know. --Rabbi Ed
Using optical from cable box, sounds like tv has a stereo signal cable box i have has no sound at all via HDMI i think the tv would pass it thru if it were available. oh optical is into philips 5.1 blu ray system always on to opti in or fm radio tuner.
No it doesnt, i have problems with the inputs on my tablet
In the description does it say "digiland tablet 10.1"? No, it says "Galaxy Tab 4 10.1" so that would mean that it ONLY fits a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1.
My tablet is 8.4. Amazon puts all versions together. But it is designed for a specific model, just buy the one for your model.
It could, but need to install omni directional antenna inside. And the performance might be worse than the original design.
Sorry for previous answer...wrong product... Same idea, but can connect to any wifi signal it can reach, provided you have credentials to connect. Device connects directly to what you want to bring the signal to via USB
ESTIMATED 2.5 HRS CONTINUOUS USE
Never got it to work and I'm sending it back. No response yet from Amazon. I gave it a bad review. Tried to sync with 5 different phones and computers and got zero
There is no specific way since the stereo does all the amplifing itself. Outside of the eq presets thats it.
No
yes
the horn goes off when triggered by your alarm system. The horn alone is useless if you do not have a wireless alarm system to trigger it.. hope that makes sense?
No
One PW will be on your camera's hotshoe - the other attached to your flash. Your flash needs to be able to accept a 1/8" input OR X (sync port) input OR put a hotshoe adapter on your flash that has one of those connection ports.
You can use these with just about any flash, but you may need to use an adapter. You can use either of these adapters to allow use of your Metz 50 AF-1 with the PocketWizards: (1) http://flashzebra.com/products/0126/index.shtml or (2) http://flashzebra.com/products/0115/index.shtml
You can use regular AA batteries. I love the Pocket Wizard X, however they don't have an auto shut off feature so I recommend getting a lot of batteries.
Me either. Thinking of sending mine back. I got two. I can't use Google Play Store because wifi not strong enough. Strangly, every other device in our house is worki fine with our current wifi set up, so it MUST be this device.
Yes... I bought it for my 8yr old daughter...
i dont remember but the backpack is the best
Hi, No it is not. Thanks, PCrush
You can.
There is an internal battery that allows the alarm to operate for some time. The siren in the base unit will sound, but not sirens plugged into wall sockets. I have mine plugged into a UPS, and know it will operate at least 24 hours. It worked fine for me during the last power outage.
Yes
The tablet itself Is securely attached by a plastic shell and the cover has magnets that attach to more magnets on the case. It's an awesome case, I love it. It's secure under normal circumstances.
This cover has hole for any important point(volume up/down, headset,...), and it have a hole for a tablet's camera. So you don't need to remove the cover before take a picture.
It says 18 to 20 volts @ 2 to 3 amps on the sticker
Hi friend, my better advise is: go to the crucial page and use the wizard to select the right choice offer by crucial.
No, you need to search for a SSD with a ZIF 40 Pin connection. Your machine has a PATA interface to the disk drive. Check http://www.amazon.com/1-8-ZIF-40Pin-KingSpec-128GB/dp/B00HIDAWRI/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1420975590&sr=8-5&keywords=Hp+2710p+ssd
Yes
Honesty I did not try that. I immediately put it back into the box when I aw that it would not operate without taking off y phone case
Yep - I use it with my mini.
Yes, it works fine. The only problem would be that if you use a case that is too thick so as to prevent good contact. Mine works but some may not.
Yes. My sisters fits and charges
Download D-Saplli from App Store, it works as an clock ( 7 style )with some customization: sound EQ,alarm,music player timer, sleep timer, volume, fast forward,brightness,etc. It's a simple application,easy to use and good looking, just give a try, nothing to lose
Hello, power requirement for this Sony Clock radio is 120V AC. It means that it cannot be connected to 220 V. -Ely
I'd head to ebay. You can find plenty of used 580 ex for 200 usd. Good luck.
Yes it is.
There is not a grid for the softbox
No
I have three receivers, BD-player, Apple TV, CD, two cable box, one projector, one TV, 4 Lutron light controls all working with this remote. 14 items controlled by one thing. also I can sit on my patio use my phone to turn on music in 4 different location or turn or dim lights. to me that's worth 300.00. All equipment is in a closet except the projector, tv and light controls. Makes life much better with multiple equipment operation.
We have ours set up on both my phone and my husband's phone, and have had no issues.
You need battery operated glasses
Yes
I'm not familiar with that Dell laptop. It would need an available mSATA slot to install the Crucial SSD. If you install an operating system on it, you just need a boot loader that allows you to choose which drive you want to boot. I have the SSD installed on an Intel NUC mini computer with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. It has a boot loader, so I can choose to load Win7 instead, if I need it, from my old hard drive that I put into an external USB case.
Duc, I don't have an X230 so I'm not positive it works. According to the Lenovo doc, there is an mSATA port under the palmrest. Like the T420, it uses SATA II (3gbps) so you will be limited to ~300MB/sec sequential access. The cool thing about Amazon is that if it doesn't work, you can easily return it.
Not sure why they have three sizes in the picture. The correct size is shown in the second and third photos.
Yes is a msata, check in crucial site to compatibility
yes
No. This drive has no casing enclosure, which is needed. The MacBook "Air" takes a bare drive like this but the other macbook models require a case that makes them the same size as any other 2.5" drive.
Unfortunately, only the newest line of thinkpads can handle msata drives. No it will not be compatible with this drive, however you can get a standard ssd drive which will perform much faster than a typical HDD. Something like this should work http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/ssd/ct120m500ssd1
I actually had this in a Drobo 5N - that is what it was originally purchased for. https://myproducts.drobo.com/article/AA-01428 - this says that the M500 is compatible.
Go to the Crucial web site, they have a program that you down load from the site that will scan your system to see if it will work for your PC.
Just the drive. No cradle. No software to clone. Some adapter that was useless.
Depends. http://anandtech.com/show/6884/crucial-micron-m500-review-960gb-480gb-240gb-120gb/9 Looks to be 1 W to 3.68 W
It is a replacement, and yes you need to back up your data
While I've never installed one in an older MacBook, I see no reason it shouldn't work. No promises though. And that said, it won't fully take advantage of the speed of the SSD because it will be limited by the 1500mbps SATA bus in the MacBook (this SSD can perform sequential reads of 4000mbps).
I believe so, we have been lucky.
The bag has a designated space to allow storage of a long lens attached to the camera.
Not a Ipad, I don't think so
I think yes. I used Monster Turbine Copper Pro and AKG 3003I now. But It can improve sound from old Apple devices only - Ipod Classic and Iphone 4. Sound from 5s is not worse than V-Moda. So I stop using V-Moda. I recommend spend money for 5s or 6 with 1k$ headphones like AKG 3003 i. Its better to buy DAC a new generation later.
I have not auditioned the Andes, but it actually has much more power than Verza, although Verza should sound better because it has a built-in DAC whereas Andes is just an amp. Also, Verza can hook up to your laptop or PC to function as a DAC, where Andes/E12 is just a portable amp. Last but not least, Verza is 4X the price, but I really like mine and use all the time.
Be sure that the headphone really is plugged in all the way. Athough I purchased the Ubuntu version, the hardware is identical. I noticed that it requires a bit more force to plug in the headphone than I expected, so the first couple of times, I got no audio, because I wan't really plugged in. If you still get no audio, that may be a product defect. In that case, contact Amazon or ASUS for exchange or warranty.
yes, you can play any game on it.
What I did is buy a USB SD card reader, then an adapter USB to micro-USB. Remove camera SD card, put in reader and Note8 will pop up asking what to do with files. Copy or move and you are done. Maybe $15 in parts.
YES indeed.
Yes it those
I didint het da package
If it is window 7 premium, no, I can't tell if the laptop is turned off. I am not good in Laptop O learned by myself but I know only window 8 usually has touch screen hope it helps
This unit includes a DVD-RAM/R/RW optical drive.
This is a PC.
No. One of the TB ports is the one that connects the dock to your computer.
This item does not have this capability.
This is not supplied from toshiba. You would have to purchase one
It does not, I'm afraid. It does, however, lock up and forget settings very often.
I think not, but I may just be too inept to see the option. Hopefully someone else knows for sure.
50 watts 4 channel max, 17 watts 4 channel RMS.
I use the AUX cord feature everyday in the car. Never have any problems. Great product.
The 600 Watt one has a USB mobule not on the amplifier but as a separate module that connects to the amplifier The 400 Watt does not.
You can do it by holding down the fast forward button for volume up & hold down the rewind button to volume down. The volume on mine seems to hesitate then it is maxed out, or it skips to the next song. So what I do is go ahead & max out the volume & I make all my adjustments using my phone. I like it better that way any way. My wife & I love it. We don't ride a Harley we are on a VTX 13OOR Sounds great.
No. You would control the music from your iPod. I don't think you can plug this in to the USB port as it requires the 30 pin connector unless you have an adaptor of some kind.
I returned my unit today. The hum was getting on my last nerve.
It has blue tooth but not gps.
The volume buttons are next to the home button on the lower half of the screen.
yes this tablet will connect to a wifi network. It does not connect to a 3g network however.
No that's just for one speaker
Yes
Micro usb can be purchased at almost every gas station/walgreens/best buy etc.etc.
Light does not Turn green. Usually a couple of hours for ours!
I don't think it is loud enough for that. We just returned it because at loud volumes it gets distorted.
I haven't had any problems. I use it around the house and travel from room to room with it and leave my IPod in one spot.
Regardless of the COLOR, if you are speaking of a microphone, the shielded wire will connect to the tip. The shield and other wire to ground. This is for an UNbalanced microphone connection.
No it doesn't. I installed the LC7i line out converter and it works great!
It works when it wants to even when setup properly. Running Win 8.1 you have to manually select the audio configuration of each device, and set this one as the default for audio input and output when you want to use it. However, it still doesn't always work or doesn't switch back to my amp when I want to use my surround sound afterwards.
No mouse wheel
Dear Valued Customer, Thank you for contacting us with your inquiry. This item is a generic compatible replacement and not the original bulb and housing. The warranty for this item is for 150 days for replacement and 30 days for refund. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact us. Sincerely, Customer Service (1502)
I generally keep it dark but I have a two bulb 100 Watt equivalent lamp that I can leave on with good clarity just as long as I'm not watching deep blacks. (dark night) light washes out black. Nature of the beast.
Yes, if your arm is long enough or just use the timer and put on a tripod.
No it does not, but for the price the image sharpness and low light capability is great. I certainly do not regret my purchase.
No Bluetooth (Antenna Only)
Motherboard/Parts, power supply, rails if you need them for a rack, 6 SAS cables (SFF-8087 to whatever you are connecting to on your board/raid card), and probably molex splitter/adapters depending on how many the PSU you bought has to power the backplanes.
Yes it does come with drive trays and all mounting screws for the drives.
Yep, sure can. I shoot it pretty wide open much of the time, and it delivers a nice bokeh effect.
Yes, that is what it is design for , I have the Galaxy S4 by SAMSUNG for Verizon and it fits great
Yes, it will fold up against the wall.
If you don't know, then you don't need it. Google is your friend, my friend. :O) I use mine to drive NOC screens for work. With another one, I built a thermometer with a USB thermistor to monitor our baby room temperature. Sends a text message, and a notification popup on our openelec/xbmc HTPC box if the crib temp swings beyond a set threshold. Nifty.
I use the Qnap NAs that has the software for it. It also serves as my Media Center NAS so I can watch the camera video on my smart TVs as well.
Here are two website that offers different RJ45 connectors for harsh environments: http://www.l-com.com and http://www.connectzone.com/watertight-rj45.html
Everything that is shown in the pic. Charging stand, power block and cable, charging case. It's great to have so many ways to recharge the ear piece.
I finally talk my sister/coworker to buy this kit and she loves it. She is nothing but apple and she hasn't said anything but I don't know that she uses it with her apple computer or not. You should Google that question first but as long as u have blue tooth it should work.
everything is included, the case, and a handy desktop stand/ charger I really like this headset but range is only about 30 feet
No it does not.
Thank you for your question. I am sorry but this will not work on a 2004 Sienna. The first model year it works on is 2011. Greg
We really like the projector and it did in fact come with a 1 year warranty. I think you would ike it.
It is designed to be used with a tripod. I prefer to remove the strap, but at times leave it on as well.
I don't know. I don't have a folio case yet.
It shorted out my Ipod. Had to go and get another Ipod and ending up going to the infiniti dealer to get an OEM one.
The output frequency rate is about 50Hz/60Hz.
No idea - but one thing I do know - the screws they sent you will burn your prop motors up. I lost all 4 and crashed my DJI. Sorry I didn't answer your string question. Maybe use it to tie around your finger to remind yourself to not use their screws.
What is the "black box" that you have been provided by the Satellite internet company? I need to know this to help you so that I can determine the proper type of connection you should make from the Satellite internet providers hardware. If you have the make, model and even serial number, I would be happy to research for you further. Please get back to me and I will help as best I can. Don't give up, yet!
Depends. It is not a 3G unit (which would require an account with a wireless provider anyway). This device will create a wifi connection as long as you have a wired internet connection available to plug into. You may also be able to use as a repeater for an existing weak wifi signal.
A standard 2.4 Ghz RF device has a range of 10 meters or about 33ft. This range can be affected by electrical interference or line of site loss, but those are issues you can account for during setup. To be comfortable I'd suggest being no more than 25' from the USB receiver.
The cord that comes with the external power bank has a USB end and the other end attaches to your device. The external power bank is charged by plugging the USB end into a USB outlet and the other end into the external power bank. Once charged, you have power on the go. No batteries needed.
Visit: www.tclusa.com/remotecodes for a list of codes to program your universal remote to operate this TV.
The device in the HDMI out port would send the same signal to two devices so it should work with it!
No, this is the oposite. One input to have two tv's connected. You need two inputs one output.
go to utube and do a search entering this model and it brings up several videos.
I have a few obstacles, but I usually receive fair reception at a distance of 50 miles. My TV is in St. Joseph, MO. My favorite stations are in Kansas City.
My kids are 8 and 11 and these headphones are on the bigger side so I would recommend looking for something smaller. They are great quality though. :)
Yes. You can go online to the Ray Marine site and bring up the maps to see the detail. I would suggest doing that so you can see the exact area that you are needing.
You can go online to the Raymarine website and they give you a list. If you are looking for freshwater then you won't be happy. I was able to upgrade with Navionics for $100. I expected to have to buy a chip anyways so this was less than a new chip and you can update for a year.
Viewable screen is 5 and 3/4". Yes the chart covers SE coastal waters.
Hi Todd, this Sony LCSU11 will fit on your Sony a3000. However, you may check on this Sony bag: model # LCS-U21. This one will fit in. -Ely
110V regular plug. I don't believe any (most) TVs require 220V.
Thanks for the interest in Orb. C. Horan! The Mini T amp drives 15 watts RMS and will work fine with any speaker in the 4 - 8 ohm range. Hope this helps - let us know if you have any more questions.
yes it does.
I have not used a subsoofer with the Orb Mini-T -- only a FL + FR stereo setup ... but thinking of how odd it would be to have a sub remain at constant level regardless of how you adjusted the stereo speaker outputs I would presume so.
Yes it can run server 2012 with hyper-v. I assume a standard sata ssd would be fine too though I can't say from experience.
No, It doesnt have a Blu-Ray Player, Only: CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD-RW, DVD-R DL
Hello, Yes it is. Its core i7. Touch screen.
Yes, that's how mine is set up and it works great
Sony seems not to say. 4K downloads are just fine on N standard. That being said our download speed averages 40-50+Mbps
Thanks for your question. This is a 110V TV with a USA serial number and a USA warranty. This is a fantastic TV. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Sony dealer.
call sony
Yes, it has all the items mentioned in the list. Only thing is external flash is not that great. It worked for couple of times then stopped working. I bought Nikon flash for $350.
Yes the camera comes with charger and battery in its own pack, both are Nikon, the other battery it's generic "Power 2000"
Thank you for your interest in our bundle! In regards to your inquiry, the warranty is valid in the US and goes through Nikon USA.
Hi Ricardo, it was a big box and I don't remember the weight.
Yes, it is
No it does not come with case but you can buy case from Amazon for just 6 bucks.
All earphones can hurt your hearing if turned up too high for a long period of time, but these aren't invasive if that's what you're asking.
They are advertised in the listing as follows: Outer Dimension: 4 1/4 inch (110 mm) long and 3 3/4 inch (95mm) wide Opening Dimension: 3 1/8 inch (80 mm) long and 2 7/16 inch (60mm) wide And that is pretty accurate
I have a 7D and it slides perfect with my 18-135. For the price it is a good slider. If your willing to invest more money I'm sure you could find better one, but for me i thought this was great.
The switch on the left side goes in the up position.
you can just turn it on and listen the speaker on the radio is very good
I have never listened to the Crane CC pocket Radio in a vehicle without headphones but with headphones my radio picks up strong signal stations clearly and the NOAA radio part is clear and strong.
Hello - we currently have stock both in Amazon warehouses as well as in our own warehouse. We can only hope we will have them available next week as supplies are getting low due to Holiday shopping. Please keep in touch with us. Regards.
Yes!!!
It will work on any brand TV, including Element. Just make sure the mounting holes on the back for your TV are no more than 25" apart horizontally and 16" vertically.
I used it on a 60 inch Panasonic plasma. It should work just fine. Just be sure to anchor the mount to two studs or make sure there is wood blocking in the wall.
No it doesn't.
The camera is absolutely fantastic. I bought the other lenses and do NOT use them. Tripod is flimsy, camera bag is nice as well as the extra battery. I would say the extra package is not worth it but the camera is the best ever!!
Yes. The package did come with an additional battery and it is rechargeable. Just so you know, I've been very happy with the camera and have used many of the extras that came with it. It's a really good package. Hope that helps.
No it does not
Mine didn't fit.
Play back very smooth
I do not believe it will. The tracking (distance) is determined via GPS. Plus, the GPS does not work indoors.
I do not know. I know it does not work with my Polar T31 coded heart monitor.
Yes, it works fine as a small monocular.
No. It fits only the monocular that comes with it.
The ocular is 28.5 mm where it plugs into a rubber like receptacle in the Iphone adapter. It is not threaded. Just a press fit.
the display the manufacturer is CHUNGHWA if you purchase in our store.
Yes, I have a note 3 and have tried other adapters but none worked, but this one does. Just make sure you have an HDMI cable and power supply with micro USB cable for power.
Yes, I think so. But I wouldn't get this one if you use a battery pack extension. You cant mount it on, and it actually creates a kinda unstable mount on your tripod. If I could do it over I would get either a magnetic one and hope they dont fall out or actually i am buying one that seals a mount to the LCD screen and can pop the view finder on and off, but it looks a lot more secure
On my unit, you mount the hood to the camera and the screw is threaded in the bottom for the tripod.
Once the screen is open, turn it upside down and close "the door" so that the screen is visible (facing you). That's when you can attach the Xit.
Use Bluetooth headphones.
No adapter needed. This is a plug and play device!
Windows 8 64bit Home Edition
Yes. This micro SD card is a perfect match for the Galaxy S4 Mini LTE 9195. This card is the maximum memory size (64GB) that is compatible with the S4 Mini. Also this is the fastest micro SD card Samsung offers. It works perfectly in my Galaxy S4-SGH-i337 & should work the same for you. I use mine for photos, videos, & games.
Yes, the 10" tablet can use a micro sd up to 64gb
Yes. I would position it to project towards a window but you don't want it in direct view if someone were to look through your windows. We have mini binds; we have them open slightly at the top and it can easily be see from the road.
Not sure, I don't have an alarm, they are overrated. The fake TV is small led lights of different colors that go on and off in random combinations and random brightness. If light would interfer with your alarm, it would. There is no real motion that would set it off.
If I'm doing the math right it's 1.8 watts Raw numbers: 9 volts, .2 amps.
Find a small paperclip, straighten out one of the segments. Push the small loop of the strap into one of the two strap receiver holes. Use the end of the paperclip to "fish" the end of the loop out of the other hole. Take the large loop and place it through the small loop and pull it tight.
rechargeable battery great camara works good
fairly quick.
Yes, Skullcandy Aviators ship in the original package. It's beautiful, by the way - The Aviators come in their leather pouch, in a box that unfolds like a flower, inside a decorated cardboard 'sleeve.'
Yes, to the IPod. Compatibility wise, they seem to have a bias towards Apple product. In regards to the Nook, it is limited in its compatibility.
hi yes it does. its a great, tablet. and the price is incredible.i love mine and would give everyone an a plus. enjoy. janey
Yes there is a keyboard attached.
Worked great with my 60" lg smart tv. It's pretty heavy. Just make sure the lags are in center stud.
Yes
Yes.
Yes, it fit mine perfectly.....watch the Video and follow the instructions.....it took all my patience but was worth it. Still Love it a year later.
Yes
After 6 months internet stopped working. No access to internet apps.
I have only had mine for about a month and so far everything including the tabs has held up well. I use the tab at the top most and I was a little worried about this one breaking over time. It seems at this point to be very durable and works well so I will have to see. I have carpal tunnel and had a hard time holding just the kindle device. This product allows me to hold the kindle better and has served that purpose very well. I hope this helps.
Actually, it is protective, as that whole gray back part is a "suede". I've been using it for several months and like it alot.
It does have two aux input ports, if your xm has USB or standard headphone connectors to plug into the radio, it should work
NO
No It's not Bluetooth compatible.
it does not have ssd
Just to be sure, I have the Dell Venue Pro 8. If you are asking about this device, yes, the Periboarf works. As a matter of fact, I am typing this message with the Periboard.ff fIn my opinion, the addition of a tethered mouse with the Periboard makes for quite a usable travel computer. All you have to have is a good OTG cable.
Yes. It comes with a cord from camera to usb port on computer to download photos
no.
Sorry, I don't have cable so I would not know.
It5 should work fine ... I think. But I've not tried it.
I have 2 of these and each operates as it should. If I was you, I'd try one more time, ensuring you following each step as outlined in the manual. If it still does not work - I would contact the seller.
Not particularly
Yed
Yes it plays MP4s.
I don't think so. I haven't even been using the cord. So much easier to just pop the card into the computer and use from the file manager. You can delete photos even copy photos onto it and view as long as you pay attention to the naming constraints.
Yes, it looks like the same one I purchased
Mine is an older model and doesn't have function keys per se--there may be command pairs that get you there with control , alt or the command keys I'm not sure. The bigger problem with the iPad formatting with corporate sites is that the screen is small that I can't always use corporate technology interfaces.
what keyboard do you have? I assume you mean iPAD? the one i have is a very short cable (too short) USB one end, the other end is so tiny you can't count the pins. I suggest you go to the company's website and write or call them. My guess is they have spare parts to sell. let me know if you are successful, I'd like to get on e with wire longer than 12"!!
Dive.
No it does not
Sometimes they run out of the case. They should receive a shipment, and then they will become available.
Yeah, that should be fine. The issue is the connection; the monitor requires dual link DVI, which that card has.
Yes it does... Perfectly! We leave ours near a window all the time, so it is always ready. We LOVE ours and bought 2 more at Christmas, as gifts to your adult kids!
No, but for what you need the camera for, and given there's some light from your reversing lights, it's good enough.
I don't know the answer to your question, but I purchased the transmitter & it works great! I have no complaints about it.
Not directly (at least as far as I know). However, you can get an aftermarket 2 amp, 12 volt AC adapter. I got one at radio shack with a 5.5 mm O.D. and 2.8 mm I.D. that can run it, so check the rest of Amazon for something that works for you with those dimensions
The built in speakers are 'OK' but not real loud (I wanted more volume). I plugged in headphones and found the max volume to be way too low (two pairs). I ran a cord from the headphone jack to the stereo input and used the car speakers.
no
Yes,it have
Yes
The case and batteries were not Fuji film, however; everything else was
Yes, the case will still glue to the glass... However since you're already buying this you have to be a little handy... grab needle nose pliers and bend it as strait as possible... then you got yourself a working ipad
Just an EF-S adapter.
I'm sorry but the answer is "no". I assume you mean the Canon SX520 fixed-lens zoom camera. The Opteka 85mm is exclusively for DLSRs and film SLRs.
Have not had long enough to determine durability, but it's easy to switch out of my Gh4.
No it's not compatible on older tv
If your Sony is a Smart TV with a USB port and Skype App
Should work, but any monitor you would need it for is very outdated.
Depends on where you purchased and plan to use the product. Power supply of this product in the U.S. is 110. In Europe the power supply is 220
There are no mounting points anywhere, unless you want to count the lanyard loop.
Sorry I got the camera but it never worked, sent it back and still have not had refund or a replacement.
This earbud is compatible with any smartphone that supports Bluetooth 4.0.
Yes, I'm pretty sure you can use up to four, but I only use two.
I believe so since it is connected to PayPal. The Pay Here has the same information as the PayPal account.
You cannot watch 3d videos with this monitor by itself, you need to buy Nvidias adapter seperatly for around $100
Yes
As long as your device has a usb drive
Yes. It's a complete substitute for the original one. And much better than the original, at that.
Yes it does. It charges a little slower but it does charge while you use it.
No...I had an Invisible Shield protector put on in the store I bought my surface from.
Hadn't really tried that... I would say that it would stand but any pressure when tapping on it would knock it down
Yes they fit quite well
Answer from Titantech: Yes, it fits.
That's a garbage unit I'm very disappointed with the same unit and the seller my a/c didn't work and my steering wheel control didn't work either so return the stereo to the seller I'm still trying to get my money back from the seller
These are cheap Chinese junk....look how they ripped off their name...making it look like Pioneer.
This should work just fine with Vista os
depth is not like theaters, but is good for effects. The images don't come at you with clarity. But for the money, work ok !
It's just for one pair of glasses. It used to be 70$ something -- they actually brought the price down.
It only works with the Optoma projector.
I have an Acer h5370bd, which supports 120hz, as well as the 144hz which these glasses are rated to handle. These all work fine, so you should have no problem using these with your Acer projector.
Marshmallow balloon string
Tried it out, and it did not seem to work.
As my fellows described before me, the flexible cable goes around your neck and each earphone sticks to both ears with changeable ear plugs (included) for better fit. Right and Left earphones are noted with an "R" and "L" respectively so you can not mistaken them.
Does it use DLP link? If so yes. Read the other reviews on this poor product !
They have a cloth case. They are good for dlp projectors. 144hz. I own a bend w1080st.
Sorry, but I don't know.
This stylus only works with the Microsoft Surface Pro because it is built with a Wacom digitizer the Surface RT does not. There is no way to make this stylus work with the RT. Sorry
I do not know, sorry. I used it with Microsoft surface pro 2 it was very smooth.
You can view the visitor but they can not see you. You can announce or greet them or you can see them without their knowing you are looking. Yes you can have a two way conversation if you like. Also there is a button that will unlock your door or in my case I use it to open an electric gate about 200 feet away. I hope this helps.
I did. It works great. Mac Pro 3,1 is Mac Pro (early 2008), mine is a dual 2.8GHz quad core with 32GB of RAM.

We have a smaller leveno (13.5 in) and it has about an inch leeway. The interior of the case measures at 15 in. I like the case but not sure it would work.
Not sure of the question, but I own this case. I store my MacBook as well as my iPad, and associated cords. You can fit a much larger laptop in the space. Awsome protection...Awsome value.
my macbook pro 15" fit prefectly.
yes, if it has a component input it will convert any HDMI signal to component. The device does not matter, it is the format that matters as long as your projector TV is high definition (720I,P or 1080I,P, whether TV or projector. I use it for my Sharp high definition big screen projector.
Yes it will work just fine. I work for an av company and we use these all the time. Do note plug the unit in first then power up the Apple TV
No
no, you can't
I don't I use.
No its just the bare case
No, only the EOS Rebel T3i
No
im not for certain. it seems to be made for the rebel t series. the case is very soft and not for max protection. i ended up returning the item
Hi Bonnie, we cannot confirm your camera's model number but the battery NP BN1 is compatible for both the DSCWX80 and DSCW800. Thanks_Mitch
I think it is definitely worth it: you will have 18 megapixels in contrast to 12, a better range of high ISO settings with less noise, and my perhaps favorite thing: a swivel screen which enables you to see what you are shooting when the camera is held down low or above your head...without sitting on the ground or climbing on something. I love my t5i!
My T5i is made in Japan. Both of my USM lenses are made in Japan. I do not own the 18-200, however.
No, the SX260 can, but the SX280 dropped it to add WiFi. You can still take multiple shots and stitch them together with a stitching program. That's what I do.
Silent stepper motor drive.
Yes. In response to your question, I just now attached it to a Canon 30D body and all lens functions (auto-focus and image stabilization) are functional. And, of course, it mounts perfectly.
No,this is a standard lens for a more simple camera. You have a great camera,your better off with a longer lens,like a 18-135mm
yes you can view from iPhone. The app is called Keye4 and its free
As long as they are analog cameras, any camera will work with the dvr.
Good dvr
Yes, I use an unnamed brand with sony ccd Lense inside. But generally any ccd camera will work
This unit states it will pick up hot spots up to 1/2 mile away.
I don't know about the 7500 BT, but I didn't need the cable for my iPhone to work with Apple Car Play. I don't watch videos on it, so it was a waste of money for me. I'm not sure if this is the right cable for your system, but it enables video on the iPhone 6 for mine if I am in park with the parking break on and I want to use the pioneer app radio mode, which is not done well and the graphics are really bad.
you'll need an extra apple lightning 8 pins cable. in addition you'll need a apple lightning to VGA adapter sold by Apple. look for the correct instructions manual to know how to plug the wires.
It means that the system comes with Windows 7 Professional installed instead of Windows 8 Pro. We also received the Windows 8 disk with the system.
no
Yes it is has DVD-RW drive and it can burn both CD and DVD cds. Thanks, PCrush
No it is not. You will need to get an adapter. I use one that just plugs in to a USB port. It is a very good computer, I am very happy with it.
Paul B., Yes, the WMN-450 will be compatible wtih the UN65HU7200. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Yes. I bought the 7100 but the wall mount instructions show applications for the 8000 as well.
It works on 2009-2013 B,C,D,E,F series. 32-65". It looks like you have an F series. It should work.
yes it will work.
Yes it will work fine. I used it on my c8000 which is a year newer. If u are interested in buying a used one let me know. I sold my TV and would sell this mount to you as I no longer need it
When I purchased this PC in July, 2014, it was Windows 7 Pro. I would check very carefully now because Windows 7 may not be available from manufacturers now. Windows 8 isn't too bad, and with the right start menu software that can be found online for free, it actually works better than I thought. Besides,a free upgrade to Windows 10 will be available very soon.
The height is not adjustable. Unfortunately I can't tell you the height as I have mine on a mount and without the base attached.
You can try changing resolution of your PC. The native resolution for this monitor is 1680x1050.
As long as your tv has an hdmi input I don't know why it wouldn't work.
The light indicator will be on some standby devices (i.e. Roku, Xbox one) and some will be off (i.e. Directv DVR). On some occasions you will have to manually switch. Best thing to do is keep in mind the lower the number on the box will have a priority.
I just tried out both methods, and neither of them were able to charge any of my usb devices. This is mainly to create more usb ports for your computer
Had my son try it to answer this question, yes, it works. Now he uses this device to charge multiple controllers at once & can do so while playing, plugged into the PS3 or computer. We are quite impressed with this device actually.
The flip stand is not removable. It also functions as a handle for the case (sort of like a briefcase handle) and cannot be removed.
Yes, this works and fits quite well with an iPad 2.
Right now ASUS only released the i5-3350P model P1801-B037K. Once we carry the i7-3770, we will post it for sales.
You should be able to add any mouse or keyboard via one of the several USB ports. Not in tablet mode though..unless you buy a micro usb adapter.
I would say it's a total of about an inch and a half with the keyboard folio. It definitely adds significant thickness compared to the iPad mini by itself but it's well worth it! The fact that it's magnetized so it holds the iPad up us great!
No, it doesn't. I have the case for my iPad 3 and I love it. I also have the iPad Air and I just tried it in the case and it doesn't fit. I wish they made this exact case for the ipad air but I have not been able to find it. If anyone knows where I can get one, please let me know. It's the best keyboard/case I've tried and I have tried a lot of them!
The new iPad mini 3 that recently came out? For the mini 3, I wouldn't think, as it the case is quite large and fits my iPad 2 snuggly.
Well the iPads 2,3, and 4 have tapered ends and the iPad 1 does not. So I'm not sure about the fit of the case. But the Bluetooth keyboard will definitely work for the original iPad. It's just a matter of size and fit.
It just snaps in (it's pretty snug and a little tricky the first time to get in). Definitely not a magnet hold...
I just measured and from "Q-P" on the screen compared to the keyboard the keyboard is longer. So I guess that means the keys are bigger on the keyboard! The keyboard is SO useful! I am typing on it now! The case is protective, and magnets closed when in transit. I've never dropped it but seems protective! Best money i've ever spent!
no, you have to have the bluetooth on! but I just used it on a plane, just put bluetooth on once you can use approved electronics
Take it to Radio Shake or Beat Buy or Frys Electronic you can get one yes have them helps you
No
I bought this for tmax 9 inch tablet it worked for the first week and then quit working.
I do not know anything about your tablet. If the specs match up ... it should work.
nope it didnt work with us
yes
Internet Explorer...it worked for me. I'm so happy to have it.
Yes. It will work fine. That is what I am using
I dont know
Yes, I bought the exact model you had mentioned, and it fits fine.
The shipping weight with or without the window is the same... Its just listed wrong here..
Not really, it's pretty well sealed. You'll only see t in be from if the room is completely dark.
They are about the same, but you barely going to see it full on like the power unless you hd is really busy.
I tried to use it on my Samsung Galaxy S3 Tab for this purpose and sadly it did not work. Unfortunately, I haven't yet been able to find anything that does work.
I'm using mine on a USB 2.0 port and it works fine.
The Linksys AE6000 wireless adapter is designed for computers (PCs and laptops) only. It is not guaranteed to work with game consoles.
Unfortunately, no. It only works with AT&T, T-Mobile and several smaller wireless companies.
no this does not support hd cameras . only analog cameras .
Two. channel 1 and channel 2 only.
My 60d with a 55-250 fits just fine. I do have to take the lens hood off, otherwise it will not.
I don't think it would pull off a screen protector. I don't know if you've seen those lint removers that have instead of sticky paper, a rubber like substance. It is as sticky as those.
No the Keys are more like what you find on a macbook but are not backlit. They are very easy to type on and are full size. This was the easiest keyboard to type on of the ones I tested. If you are looking for backlit the Zag Profolio Plus are backlit.
Unfortunately no, we only have this one in white and silver. Like new and perhaps the best cover / keypad ever made for an iPad 2 (second generation)
I had another keyboard and it worked great. This does not exactly help but it is the same concept.
Hi Sarah, I must say I am vary disappointed in this product after using it for some time. I wish I could have edited my review. The battery has a short life span and now the off/on switch no longer works. o late fore me to send back could not link with my lenovo ideal pad a2107a-f no longer using it at all. 0 stars. Eric.
I have a Mac book, but from what I know about the air. There shouldn't be a problem using it on the air.
well the border is to protect the glass screen but the border protector is handed when dirty it;s easy to whip with cloth but people could see your screen.
Just talked to Uniden. The G766 has a 8GB standard size SD card and the G755 has a 4 GB micro SD card. Otherwise they are the same system. I noted that the 755 was about $90 more with a lower capacity card so I'm going with the 766. The 766 can handle up to a 32GB card. I don't see any advantage to going with a smaller card for more money.
Yes, they have to be plugged into AC.
No, it stands up very well. I bought it for my granddaughter who's in college and she loves it. She got it for Christmas and uses it daily. I asked her how she liked it and she said it has been great.
No it does not
This is simply a hub, so there really isn't a reason why it shouldn't. But, I don't have a wacom though, so I can only be 99% sure instead of 100%.
It would work in manual mode, the Yongnuo YN-565 EX would work with Canon's E-TTL.
This unit is New as we have listed, we already responded to your question, the unit does have network card.
mine is the glow but I think they are the same. the cover from nook has a tab to hold it shut, I wish I had gotten that one. The price is about the same
Yes nice spy camera

I've never heard of that tablet. But if it's a Samsung product and it has a micro sd card slot; it will work. Hope this helps you.
In my Galaxy S4 and it works perfectly.
No
No
No, you must still use separate power supplies/chargers for the laptop and the docking station. This was surprising to me as well (my Dell docking station at work charges my work laptop), but if you read the description for the SuperSpeed docking station, it does not indicate that it charges your laptop.
The unit has different modes...in the lowest mode, I think an hour is about 10 megs...that's at something like 64bitrate...I use it to put about an hour church services online...the recorder holds a lot, and it has a small memory card slot...you won't run out of space.
Yes you can!
I do not believe that you can. Although I'm only 95% sure.
Thank you for contacting us. The tripod is full-size, it has a maximum height of 50".
Will not fit
Yes
I use this to control a 2000W hot water heater element. Have had no problems in cold weather. The heating element is for brewing and the controller will take it from around 100W up to 2000W. Have been very satisfied with this unit, other controllers well up into the hundreds of $'s essentially performed the same task. This little unit is a huge amount of value for the buck.
No
i can help you if you can send me user manual... i lost it and i can't do anything at all !!! Send me a scanned version and i'll help you to set up the thing :) thanks !!! fraggletek(at)hotmail.com
Yes it is compatible, it is on the list of compatible cards. You should be ready to go when your 7950 arrives.
Yes it can communicate in the same frequency band (156-157MHZ). HOWEVER, be advised it contains no circuitry to provide of automatic switching to emergency channels and is NOT water proof, (non-submersible) nor even weather resistant. Also it does not have any type of geolocate ID/ALI sending feature. In a pinch when a vessel is in distress I certainly wouldn't want a splash of water taking out my only means of survival safety.
This shouldn't be a problem! As long as there is a receiver that can be plugged into the MIC INPUT.
I guess - you'd need to buy a mic, and have to look at the words on another device. My kids do sing along to the songs that they play from youtube via their ipod. You can hear the music and their voices through this speaker at the same time.
We have only used it inside, so have not tested the battery life.
Yes, it does!
Yes to all.
These are designed to only cover aps-c cameras, most likely Will vignette
Not sure about Kenko but the Meike are all plastic. They function with all automatic features and seem to perform very well for me.
Genuine Nagoya have white lettering. If its cheap then chances are it is not.
I too tested mine too late to get any money back. The best we can do now is let others know this product is poor quality.
I installed inline to the cigarette lighter using a .5 amp barrel fuse. I don't think it even draws that much power, but can't remember since it has been such a long time.
yes i do!! would be perfact
Aaron, unstretched the cord is about 2 ft. Stretched it's almost 4 ft. If you need one a little more heavy duty, check the hand mike for the Wouxun at Powerwerx. Iv got one and it works great on the BaoFeng. Hope this helps.
I have two different models and the mic wont work in both models.
It should work on all the Baofeng's as long as they have the two prong plug. I think the microphone will work with Kenwood's HT's too.
I do not know, since I use a dedicated cable for my extended monitor, however, I doubt it. This device is a "dumb" device....it does not recognize MAC addresses, nor does it communicate any meaningful information which would allow your computer to differentiate between screens. All of your extended monitors will show the same content. If you want 4 different monitors with independent content you'll need to add additional ports to your box or find a different device to do it.
The red light near the battery icon will turn off when fully charged.
Yes, you will need to recharge every few hours.
About one feet long. Mines stopped working... Keep reading reviews
Yes. It pairs with mine and I have the iPhone 6 plus.
nope it only comes with a 3" usb A to micro usb cable (really short)
Yes they do! Skype, Magic Jack etc.
They lasted about 9 months before they stopped working for me, but I can be pretty hard on my headphones
I wear these everyday at work and never feel uncomfortable with them in. The bud covers are very soft and extremely flexy.
They require a USD port for power. My wife's Ipad mini does not have a USB port I don't know about full size tablets but it would also drain you battery. Better suited for Lap tops that are used while plugged in and for PCs.
It's much better than the internal speakers on a laptop or on an iMac. These are great for the price, but if you want much better sound, then I would go with some Bose add on computer speakers.
Oh yea they are loud enough i listen to movies and music fills my living room plus the sound is crystal clear.
Neither, the card runs fairly cool and actually, I hear far less noise than I used to. At first I did not think the card was booting it was so quiet :p note: I have not attempted overclocking or editing the fan speeds at all. Just out of the box usage.
Not sure about your processor. I'm running an Intel i5 3570k over clocked to 4.3, 8 gigs of ram, and this graphics card. I can run any game I've attempted thus far on highest settings with my current setup. As I said I know nothing of amd but I hope this helps
I returned this card as i thought i can just upgrade my graphics adapter without upgrading my system. I wanted to play bf4 , i guess i would have to wait till tax return.
Really hard to predict. Not recommended and if something unexpected occurs, expect your manufacturers not to support the issue.
It does not fiT our X5 or Gran Tourismo either. It is a complete waste of $.
Yes it is... General Information Manufacturer: Zyxel Communications Corp. Manufacturer Part Number: IPC1165N Manufacturer Website Address: www.us.zyxel.com Brand Name: Zyxel Product Model: IPC1165N Product Name: Wireless Day/Night Cloud Camera Marketing Information: ZyXEL's IPC1165N allows for PC-free setup and use. All you need is your Apple IOSTM or AndroidTM powered smartphone or tablet to and Internet access to enjoy reliable, 24/7 surveillance. Product Type: Network Camera Display & Graphics Color Supported: Color Video Video Formats: Motion JPEG Maximum Video Resolution: 640 x 480 Maximum Frame Rate: 30 fps
We purchased two of these units and they were not worth free support to answer this question. Do not buy these. Try another brand.
At least three months of heavy use. No warning of the batteries dying yet either. You don't have to turn it off and on. It will turn itself off after roughly 10-15 minutes of being still and takes about a second to turn back on by moving it around. It's quite good, and probably even better with rechargeable batteries.
No monitor. Expect a delay if you order.
Yes
yes
Yes
Yes
it has nothing to do with MAC or PC it connects to your router. you use any web browser type in the IP address given on the supplied cheat sheat and go from there!
Yes
There is no provision for a second camera. It has video out for a monitor, a power/usb connector, and a jack for hooking the optional GPS module.
have been on vacation , could not get system to work , wires are plugged into a real tight spot on video back panel kept coming loose and could not find video imput cable , they should have put one in the box ,don't know why they don't . was missing game dics. also . could not get it to work so sent it back . sorry i could'nt help you
It does both. One side is a ball point pen for writing in paper and the other side is a stylus for use on the tablet. Its really cool.
Supposed to be used to hold more securely when case is open and you are using your pad.
You would have to crank up the volume to hear in the tractor. They aren't 100% noise cancelling although it decreases the noise you will still hear it. On the plus, the volume is booming so it'd probably be fine for what you are asking to use them for.
It's 1 soundbar e 1 subwoofer. :-)
Actual dimensions measure 6"(w) x 11" (l)x 6" (h). It does have plenty of flexibility as I used in in my Domke F2 bag. Hope this helps!
It says in the description: Arco Flexible Insert Medium Brown (32cm x 18cm x 15cm) Took me a min. to find it too :) hope that helps!
Not really noticeable when it is on. Have not had the issue with it falling off like the other response, but my wife has been extremely pleased with it.
It needs a 3-pronged outlet.
Yes. The clock only is displayed while plugged in. Yet it keeps the current.
It has video, co axial, lan, hdmi out. On the back of unit.
STB370 supports Miracast to mirror the images on your Android cell phone to your TV, but Samsung Android cell phones do not work because Samsung's cell phone's Miracast function is blocked by HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection). Samsung needs to settle the HDCP. You can try HTC cell phone, it should work. STB370 is worked on Android platform, as you know, Apple is not compatible with Android (Google) and any other system.
Yes, you can go to Play Store, search "LAN", then, you will find the apps for LAN utilization. There are many LAN apps, you may need time to select a one.
No
Yes
yes, it working
Yes
There are 2 ways to charge it. If the plug in is damaged in any way, you might have a problem. ( you need to plug and Un plug straight and don't wiggle. ). You can also charge with the USB port
The mount is not for the ceiling but rather under the kitchen cabinet
Should turn on regardless of input hookup. It's it plugged in to good power outlet? If plugged in ready to go, you should have red LED on power button. It turns green when starting up. If you have neither, you have no power to the projector. If you get green LED but no projection, you have a setup issue (refer to manual) or a defective projector.
No.
Yes, mini 3.5 mm plug
This unit is 700 Lumens. I am blown away by the quality for the price I paid for this unit. The features and included accessories are amazing!
Don't have HDMI Port, just one VGA and one DVI port.
Unfortunately. it does NOT have the VESA Mount access in the back of the monitor. THAT is the ONLY drawback to these super monitors.
The Samsung website says "Parts: 36 months, Labor: 36 months".
No it does not. Even though the arm is removable a VESA bracket is not provided.
I use mine next to a Macbook Pro with Retina. The quality isn't bad but obviously not as clear as retina. The resolution isn't as high. I have to strain a bit with smaller fonts but everything else is fine.
It doesn't seem to be glass-like screen therefore not much glare.
IMO yes. It looks very good. Clean, defined, and easy on the eyes. Print is clear. Color is excellent.
Yes, it will. However, depending on the year of your MBP, you will probably need an adapter. If you have a Macbook Pro that is from 2009-2013, you will need a Mini Display Port to HDMI adapter to connect your MBP to this monitor using an HDMI cable.
Yes, I would recommend these headphones because it has a lot of sound reduction in static on the outside and a great sound bass. You will love them.
This screen is dull - I have big windows in my office and never have a problem... even during the brightest time of day, the picture is so bright and clear it's never been an issue.
I don't totally recall, but I don't believe it does. I returned mine in exchange for the ViewSonic VA2251M-LED. It has a much sharper image, and a sturdier base. The Samsung looked washed out and wobbled with the slightest jarring of the desk. I'd recommend you spend the extra $20 and go for the ViewSonic. I think you'd be much happier, and it does have both VGA and DVI.
If you're right handed, put your left hand on the top center of the bezel , your right hand holding the bottom center of the bezel . Gently push the top backwards while gently pulling the bottom toward you. I think it tilts back only 15 degrees and forward only four degrees. It doesn't sound like very much, but it's actually quite sufficient
No speakers.... But it DOES come with fantastic screen colors....
Yes
It depends if your Asus keyboard is windows 8, because I have a windows 8 Asus 15.6 inch laptop and it fits fine.
Yes, but it's in the form of an RCA output that is hidden by the shroud once installed. You would need to run an RCA to 3.5 adapter and be able to run it under the interior of the vehicle to the desired spot.
Windows 8 works best with a touch screen which this laptop does not have. That being said, the touchpad works fine with windows 8. I have had this computer for about four months and have nothing but good things to report.
That's a good question!! It's kind of new and I moved to my new mac in a month or so. I didn't had chance to play a lot with it. But to be honest for the time I have used it I have never felt any concerns with battery . In worst case 5-6 hours at least and more depending on the settings you use.
Yes, the camera has a on/off switch.
I gave it to my computer guy. But I remember him saying I needed a new power supply to run it. Sorry I wasn't more help.
My box came with the Camera, a 60' cable for both Power and Video as well as a Power Adapter!
Not directly to the device.
Sorry have not tried that.
As always, that depends. If you're outside in the open, 100 meters would be possible. In a house or other building with walls and furniture, etc. maybe 30 or 40 feet max. If you have to many walls between, you lose range quickly. Some people with big houses might need range extenders that repeat the signal. Mine is in a back bedroom and I can sit in the front hall with a lap top and get the same reception (30 feet). ZOOM is a really good product, especially this modem, if it's the kind you're looking for.
Honestly, I'm not sure about with a hood, I have a Canon 75-300mm and it fits great in the 3rd one (next to the largest), They aren't "skin tight". Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
No. It does not stretch. The pouch itself does a bit, but the sewn collar material does not.
No. But easy enough to hit button. Love the case worth the money
Not this one, but they make identical ones for iPad Air. The Air is thinner and a bit narrower so an iPad 4 case won't fit.
This is not compatible with your device.
Awesome. I love this camera and anything samsung makes. The up close pictures are great, I'm not a photographer and bought it to take pictures of my constantly moving kids. It works great.
No not at all, it is very easy to maintain.
I've never experienced it. Failures happen - RMA it. My main desktop has 8 of these fans in it with zero failures (on 24/7, for several months). Good luck with the replacement!
No, these are flat-top non-protected batteries.
Thanks for your question. The manufacturer's warranty is 12 months on this system. This is a fantastic sounding system. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Sony dealer.
Yes it comes with everything you need except screws but your aftermarket radio comes with them
Should work, based on the Amazon page for the Kindle Keyboard as it includes a micro-usb connector. So, this cable should work for you, as far as I can tell.
This one is great I have been using this as only a power charging cord
No built in AM or FM radio in the speakers. Will only get that with some sort of secondary device.
Hello Jeffery, Thank you for your inquiry. The GOgroove BlueSYNC TYM Bluetooth Wireless Stereo Speaker does not have an AM/FM radio. Currently we do not carry a version of the BlueSYNC TYM that comes with this feature. Sincerely, Accessory Genie Customer Service
Yes it completely covers the Note8. I really love it.
Yes it is! Exactly what I bought it for, my new laptop doesn't have a drive. This is a good drive.
It needs only one usb port
Yes that is what I am using windows 7 Pro
It has one (1) Thunderbolt port. I love this device.
Hello Steven, the 2.0 PRO does support two external monitors. You would connect one monitor to the Mini DisplayPort/Thunderbolt port, and a second to one of the four USB 3.0 ports with an adapter. Feel free to contact us at support@landingzone.net if you have any other questions!
Hi Leonardo, the system comes with 2 case fans and does not include a fan controller.
Hi Leonardo, the video card will not handle the most demanding games at the highest settings. It is great for most online & basic games but not at the highest resolution or settings.
Magnets are located at the bottom of the keyboard and those attach to four magnets at bottom of the case. You can remove the keyboard from the case for easy typing. Those 4 magnets do not affect in any way the use of your tablet.
Hi Mary, Yes, item is available in: - Purple ( type B00C2C97MG inside search bar). - White/Red ( type B00C2C9NIY inside search bar).
Purple is out of stock as of January 17/2014
Not sure... we use it on an Ipad 2nd generation, and it does just fine. Definitely preferable to the ad-hoc methods we have used in the past!
In theory I think you could wrapped the two straps around one seat and it would work.
From Georgia
Yes. It does come packaged with the holster.
Yes it can but I would use it it offers a lot of protection
Yes
If you're talking about the Nook Plus HD, than yes it fits. Hope that helps.
It has 10 gig of RAM. None of that is used for video. It does not have a backlit key board.
Closing the cover when not in use.
you could use the supplied transmitter from one kit to feed 4 speakers...but the question is: can you buy just 2 extra speakers ?....you will need to contact Sabrent Support for the answer to this: try this site: http://sabrent.com/support/
2 1/2 inches
Yes, it uses a toroidal transformer.
Dont buy this..
It's aluminum. Fairly decent product, I have had it since March and use it everyday for work and school. The little rubber feet have fallen off but the keyboard is easy to use and responds well while typing.
Hi! I have InSinkErator Evolution Excel 1.0 HP Household Garbage Disposer (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7UH3M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and InSinkErator HC-WaveC-SS Involve Series Wave Hot and Cold Water Dispenser (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000X17A9U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) both attached to LiteFuze convertingbox 3000 Watt Auto Voltage Converter Transformer. They work 24/7 and I didn't have any problem! Time to time we attach phone charging :)
you can select from your tv as to what you want to listen to. You can select these speakers, tv sound or both. That is if you have them driving from your receiver.
no battery, 110 power
No
The receiver defaults to using the 3.5mm input. If there's something playing on that input, that's what the receiver will play. If there's nothing playing on the 3.5mm input then the receiver will use the RCA input.
Yes
No it is not a thunderbolt display. You are simply using the displayport2 protocol to send display info to the monitor. You will need to use another wire to send USB, and in my experience so far that does not work. It's a great display once you tell OSX how to display colors, out of the box it's going to look fuzzy and distorted - don't worry, it's just a command prompt configuration setting to fix.
probably not, the sense probably extends too far.
I looked at your model online and I have an AspireM 15.6. The keyboards look identical, minus your button(if that's what I saw) on the left above your Esc key. I could be wrong but I think it will fit yours :) good luck
Yes
They were still going strong (6+months) before the garden shear mis-hap that cut the cord.
Standard auxiliary cable
I believe so because you can take out the cord.
It will only tilt slightly. The tilt is limited by the "ball joint" connection.
is there a setting on the woofer for what herts to start at. also it has to be powered
Hi, yes I have. You will need to download and install the driver from Lenovo.
Hmm...that seems right... But that's not heavy at all....that weight is spread throughout the whole keyboard...the keyboard is pretty darn light actually.... VERY LIGHT AND THIN...
NO
No, it cannot. The tuner can only be used down to 30 MHz. The AM band ranges from 530 kHz to 1710 kHz. This device also cannot receive shortwave radio.
i dont see why not
Absolutely not. I bought this for my Canon SX50 and there is simply no way to fit the camera in the case.
from base to base is 50mm or almost 2 inches.
Total 5 USB (USB 2.0 - 3, USB 3.0 - 2)
Hi, Yes it comes with a built-in DVD-writer. Thanks, PCrush
It's a matter of spinning the two knobs independently until it frees up the square that slides into your hotshoe slot. Then turn the knobs again to tighten it
Yes. These are the compatible models listed in the description. Compatible models: U46, U46E, U46J, U46JC, U46S, U46SD, U46SM, U46SV, U56, U56E, U56J, U56JC, U56S, U56SV
I've been using SanDisk Class 10 cards at 16 and 32GB, and they both work fine. I recently filmed a 45 minute nonstop lecture with the 32GB in the A slot and it worked fine with lots of space to spare. Never had to rollover to the 16GB in the B slot. Hope that helps.
If your PC has either analog or HDI inputs you can send a live picture to your computer. Some PCs do not hear the audio using an HDI cable. My computer has neither, so I record video to the SD card and then play back the video using a car reader.
There is a on/off button on the left frame, long press it to turn on, then short press to take picture, long press again to record. after finishing, long press it again to turn off, then connect with PC, you will see the video in storage . if all not working, there is a hole for RESET, this is very important when you can not operate the device. find a needle press button in it, it will work again.
Yes, you can change to 32Gb, but you need to buy a 32gb micro card
After you connect the glasses to a computer via usb, right-click on the photo or video. Click on "properties" and edit desired details (including time stamp and name). Hope this information was helpful
hi Leroy, The power cord on these Bluetooth Rock Speakers is 8 feet long. They come with 20 feet of moisture proof speaker wire to go from one speaker to the other. Contact AV-Express for more information.
It is black.
Hi Dennis, these speakers have 60 watts peak power per speaker. 30 watts RMS or consistent power per speaker. Hope this helps.
I would imagine they can as long as you have Bluetooth on ur laptop. Runs easily through my iPad and phone
No. Only I pair at a time.
I use with a iPhone, which is good for about 10'
No directions, but I just watched alot of YouTube videos and searched Google for proper sticker placement. I would also buy the wifi, and power switch cable, because they are easy to hit with when pulling of the screen
I had to purchase a new case when I added the Humble Pi Kit to my Raspberry Pi. There are a couple of good makers out there I got mine for adafruit. They have a clear case that you can just remove the top piece to support the humble pi add on board.
Yes, you can hard wire to your fuse box. However, your are risking of drain out the battery. You could try with a high capacity portable battery, something like Poweradd Pilot Pro 32000mAh.
Yes, of course there is. Any good installation shop would automatically do that for you anyway, otherwise you would kill the car battery.
Well, I went on the site and took a look...you can do this for yourself at http://lukashd.com/eng/product_info/blackbox_14_1.html plainly says "Recommended specs for PC". So I guess you could go to the site and ask a question, or to the seller here DGTLSYSTEMS and they may be able to direct you to some kind of clarification. I have had better results with DGLT myself.
The memory card you can replace up to 128GB. Thank you,
Yes.
The card re-loops continuously. I am using a 128gb and in 600 miles did not get to even half of it at the highest quality setting.
My s3 doesnt work on it either. However, u can put a flash drive in and it will read that.
No mine desn t
This is a previous answer we have published: The offset from the horizontal line is 18 Degrees. therefore the distance/height=tan(72 deg). ie. that if you want to view an object which is 2' high, at a distance of 30' your height=2'+30'/tan(72deg) or 12' high or more. For further questions, please contact our technical support toll free number (855)464-7226 ext 100. If the distance is not sufficient for your needs, please consider using the IPCC-7210W, which will be able to tilt up to the horizontal line, and there will be no dependency on the height of the installation.
The glasses I purchased do not work at all I have tried to contact the sellers and never received any answer as to why the glasses didn't work.
Hi, It is an adjustable mount! The machine fits for below brand projectors (all model): INFOCUS,NEC,OPTPMA,3M,IBM,BENQ,TOSHIBA,SONY,MITSUBISHI,Dell Epson, HP, Panasonic, Proxima, SAMSUNG, SHARP, VIEWSONIC. Please see those holes drilled on the bar. You may adjust the span between screws by fastening them to different hole. Thanks.
yup,i do that all the time
I love my Amker speaker..blue light adds a little class. If you don't like, cover with black tape or darken with black marker.
Had mine for years, and have never seen an update feature in it. It doesn't auto update either. Its a fun little gadget, but kinda cheap. You get what you pay for.
I think you mean. Output 30amps not input you could connect a power plant at the input as long as its below 30volts. I would not exceed 9amps continued output for rhese. They work fine at 12 but for longevity sake 9 would be better
The cover is not designed to use as a vertical stand. It does hold up the tablet vertically but with no ability to tilt it at an angle.

I do not know the answer to this specific problem, however I had an issue where the mitros was sometimes not firing. power cycling the flash, removing the batteries, etc did not fix the problem, however updating the flash firmware did fix it. you can go to phottix's site to get the update and instructions. I don't remember the details, but that is because it was simple enough to not leave a traumatic imprint.
The standard one is provided. I personally put the velcro adhesive backing on all my flashes so I can attach soft boxes with velcro such as the honu.

No question. I have an 18 inch skar and is not even turned up nearly half way and I broke the metal bar that holds my rear view mirror in half
I would suggest going to crucial.com and let them do a memory configuration with the computer that you are hoping to install the memory modules. The configurator will tell you what modules are accepted for your computer without agreeing to buy from them. If the memory modules are not acceptable for your computer, you can always buy what they might have to offer.
If you can access the Internet with your device, I would suggest going to crucial.com to see what memory modules they would say work on this device. This might also work if you go to kingston.com, or any other memory maker/dealer.
If it is the same pair that I bought, then no. You have to be really careful finding the right ram for the older imacs. Try looking on ifixit.com to figure out exactly which ram will work with your year of imac.
With regard to the "S" designation, it just means SODIMM (Small Outline Dual Inline Memory Module) which means it's for laptops. Just do a search "what is difference between pc2-5300 and pc2-5300s" and you will see this.
Sorry, not sure what you're asking. My two sticks seem to be working just fine.
Honestly, didn't check. Been building computer since 1989. It was for a Dell running DDR 2700. Memory is built in classification of memory chip speeds. All are backwards compatible in the same class. As for 2.5 or 2.6 volts. I've never seen memory that couldn't take a variance of 4.5% in voltage. My friend loves his upgrade as his Dell's bio's would except a higher memory clock speed. If your computer says it takes DDR memory, it'll take this if the bios will allow you to run up to 2 gigs on memory.
The specks are correct - I have been pleased with this brand using it lately in several desktop upgrades. Shut it down, pull the battery and then swap out the memory - Dell with then give you instructions on F1 key for accepting the upgrade or change in the installed memory. Not meaning to sound like a know it all but I would rather keep you safe.
No you will need DDR2 RAM
Yes it will. I was able to get my camera with a lens attached to it and an extra lens in there. Hope that helps.
Yes, it should.
No it doesn't have preset buttons.
Using the Network Connection Menu Your TV is internet-ready, featuring both an Ethernet port and built-in high-speed Wireless-N.
No, I had to purchase separately.
Yes, it works for tablets, including iPad.
Yes! There is! You'll need a few things though; A Sony Walkman or similar cd player, and a male to male 3.5mm audio cord/cable. Then just plug in the cd player into the boom boxs' aux in port with the audio cable, then plug in your headphones/ear buds into the headphone/ear bud 3.5mm audio output port on the back of the machine. Put the machine on Aux in mode, and there you go...
It has been really good actually at receiving signal. I have another radio indoors at home with an external antenna, and i would say they get about the same signal indoors. For me it has had better signal pick up than a lot of the slightly older radios ive used in the past with external antennas.
The RDPXF300IPN has the OLED display in the front of the unit (the RDPX200IPN does not). The RDPXF300IPN has a retractable dock, (the RDPX200IPN does not). The RDPXF300IPN has a built-in battery (the RDPX200IPN doesn't appear to have that). I'm not sure if there's anything else that I'm missing, I'm just going off of Sony's website. I believe it's a $20 difference between the two. I would recommend the 300 just for the fact that it has a built-in battery.
Yes, that is what it's designed for. If you want to use any earlier model, you will need an adapter.
No, I can't since I already did the replacement. It was simple, only took me 10 to 15 minutes, with simple tool (no special tool needed). It works great, as good as new.
VPro is there and is configurable via the bios.
no
yes
yes it includes battery and AC adapter. Thanks
Yes there is a built in speaker
Not as long as I expected it to be. I'm very tight on $$$ and my tablet crashed and needed something cheap and needed it quick. It does what I need it to do for now. If investing in a tablet for long term use I suggest Asus or Galaxy for Android OS or ipad if prefer Apple products.
Yes .range not so good thou
It is listed as dual camera which means Yes, it has a back camera. I ordered this item but never received it.
Yes. With Movistar and Movilnet.
Excelent
1st gen is with low resolution one
Yes it did
I can see why this would be confusing- the Amazon page for this product shows you not only the grey felt sleeve, but the brown and black leather sleeves this company sells as well. I bought the grey felt one BECAUSE it doesn't have magnets- for this reason I can't speak to whether or not the ones with magnets cause an issue. I believe the brown/black leather ones do have magnets. Hope this helps!
no it will not:(
My old Dell XPS 1330 is NOT USB 3.0. The cable that comes with it is a USB 3.0 and plugs into the USB 2.0 on the laptop. Works perfectly!
Yes, and it can screw on to other tripods by manfrotto and benro.
Measured full extension was 65 3/4 with quick release plate it's 66.5 inches. Shot a wedding with it and the swivel head with the extension arm it was fantastic and the extending legs made for great stability. Shot with a canon 5D mark 3 and a 24-70 at 2.8 the whole time
Hi! Yes, it is a fluid and interchangeable head... It works very well.
When the bins are fully closed the centre-to-centre distance of the eyepieces is 2.25 inches which should be sufficient.
Yes
not exactly, but you can hit the back up arrow twice if the next song is playing or once if it hasn't started playing. Hope that helps!
Yes
waterproof. It can stay underwater for extended periods of time, up to 30 feet.
Not very well as it slips from the angle position pretty easily.
Yes, one of the main reasons I bought this unit.
Yes it is. I have the iPhone 6 and it plugs in on top. However, I rarely use this speaker that way. Instead, I connected the speaker wirelessly to my wifi network (you use their app to program it, which is easy), and I stream music to it from my iPhone and iPad via AirPlay.
Oh no, it is big... But I LOVE it. I haven't traveled with it, but it does seem like if it would fit in the overhead. .. def not under the seat. I have been teased that I look like q flight attendant with it, but it is tough, great wheels... and it fits a huge laptop &#10084;&#65039;
From the Samsonite website, I believe the one there is the same as I purchased, so it says 8 lbs. empty.
Yes
32 bit
The tablet is garbage...it last 3 weeks before it burn, the seller was a gost, and it was removed from amazon list items.
No, the scroll should be smooth and accurate just like any other mouse. My 2nd one is still working properly but the first the scroll failed and was returned. If yours is acting up, it likely will get progressively worse. There is a know defect in this batch.
There were/are no drivers/software that comes with the mouse. BUT what I do is use x-mouse button control utility (http://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/XMouseButtonControl.htm). This allows you to change ANY button assignment plus much more. Like MS Intellimouse but way better. HTH...
No, the USB only does video, photo, music and text
It's just over 2' in length. There is a small, unobtrusive cincher that's adjustable to loop some of the extra slack, if you like. I have a large head and I had the cable cinched with about an inch or so in a loop. It feels very comfortable.
im not sure. but if you have the old lamp, theres a seriel number on it. type it in on amazon and youll find the part youre looking for. hope that helps
It does have a built in microphone but I'm telling ya this is not what you wanna buy. It is NOT worth 150$ at all. I would've wished I bought something else
no need there to contact beats all included by amazon and warranty pappres are all included no need to worry
No
I don't have NEX 3. I have NEX 6 and it work well.
Unfortunately no because I had to send it back. I needed a radio that played AM stations. Husband listens to WHAS chanel but it only plays FM.
I do not know, I look at as a feature to let you know the cameras on. I don't think that I would not want it to, since when I turn it on I want to take a picture in most cases.
The iPhone five I know takes great pictures, I have one but I have to say this camera has it beat. Very crisp and clear photos.
Not really. I used the 720 in my trainer's truck. If you have large hands or fingers, it might get frustrating tapping on the 5's screen. But quality wise it's just about the same.
Yes. I got it with the case, however it will not be able to fit additional items like a tripod head. Etc.
You'll need a little tripod head, doesn't need to be a big expensive one.
Yes!
Just slightly larger than the cable. If you have FOSCAM camera already, the ends of the power cable are the same. Approx 1/4" in diameter. M
it cames with a litter bit of battery, but you have to charged it
No binocular will create light where there is none, but they will magnify what you see, even in low light. Bear in mind that European cathedrals have filtered light, and a lot of play between light and dark, especially if you're looking up. I am very familiar with them, having grown up within 5 minutes' walk of one. These binoculars are really small and light and can be carried in any bag or pocket. They will be great for looking at sculpture details inside and out.
I think they work great and light as a feather
The Olympus website says it has VGA video.
We were at Disneyland for 15 hrs and it lasted the whole time. I think it's pretty good.
It will work with any computer that has a wireless interface. All laptops do. It should work with the printer also.
Yes, it can. It's really a fantastic camera for the price.
My BRF71 works with sierra 250u modem, most 3g/4g usb network adapters do not work with sprint or clear usb modems the Sapido BFR71n does.
My SX280 HS was made in Japan.
yes, it works well with a touchscreen laptop. asus vivobook
Don't really know, as the camera position may vary from the Q200E. It is the same screen size, though.
Ones i have are for adults
I wouldn't buy it if I were you, no low speed and it's quite loud. I purchased a couple of others, one the plug didn't fit and the other, which had 2 speeds only lasted a couple of days. Good luck
Not unless you watch TV with a flat surface nearby. A keyboard with a roll ball or touch pad would be a better choice.
Thanks for the interest here. I do attempt to show the correct picture with the right case color offering and my offering is for the Silver Finish on this one and you can see this and validate in my comment notes. I also have the black finish as well so no issue to request either case color from The Earth City Sound Co.
The keyboard is built into the case, you simply slide the iPad into the case and pair with the keyboard.
Sir Just 2 Speakers.

The Belkin QODE Slim Style keyboard case has an undetachable keyboard. When you're done typing, you can fold the keyboard behind your iPad. Learn more about the keyboard here: http://www.belkin.com/au/iPad-Air-Keyboard-Cases
All I can do is point out that there is an input button on top of the projector. When i pushed it, the choices were in chinese, but I just scrolled through the options until I got the picture on my computer. You may have to set your computer for an external monitor if the computer does not automatically find it. I love this little projector and use it frequently.
I could, but I didn't ship it yet to my country, I am sorry.
It just slides out. Mine is mounted on the wall.
The one I got was built for the 7 in tablet. Any tablet larger would not fit.
This (keyboard) can work with any device with BT. However, the top portion is meant for 10.1" Lenovo tablet. I would not recommend you to buy this for 8" tablets.
The one I got was built for the 7 in tablet. Any tablet larger would not fit.
You can scroll through the songs, but there is no shuffle feature. What I sometimes do is create a folder with various songs I like and load it onto the player. That's as close to a shuffle as you can get with this unit.
Yes you would use a double sided head phone jack
About 3 hours
Yes
I could not install the radio since the model does not support sent suzuki grand vitara 2011 not know that car model accordingly. I can send pictures of the original radio and device sent ..
You can add Maps from brazil, map is on a small storage chip. Comes with a Camea
36 x 22.5 x 14
Most likely. It fits in the back of a 2 door s10 blazer
Yes. These headphones have control for volume adjustment, quick track adjustments, and Play/Pause/Answer/End Call without interruptions.
Yes, the IR LEDs will be visible during night time or in dark areas once the Nightvision is Enabled.
You can pull them up in a list but need to select one at a time to view. You cannot view 2 cameras at the same time on the same device
This should be compatible with it. Any 2.5 HDDs I have used have been compatible with it.
Yes 100% Mac friendly, but you need a software to clone your HDD. I used this item to clone my HDD into an SSD and it worked perfectly without any problem.
No
8.5mm wide, 2mm high, and 4.5mm deep. It was hard to find a keychain that would fit through the 2mm x 4.5mm dimensions.
I use it for my 13" macbook pro w/ retina and it does have a little wiggle room. There is about 1" of wiggle room from top to bottom and 3/4" of wiggle rooms on the side. If you are looking for it to be perfectly snug then it may feel a little big but It has been great for me.
A properly tuned CB has much greater range. But for short range these FM radios are superior over a CB.
Battery has extremaly short life. it's very weak
The small one... :)
Yes
No it does not but I'm happy with my speaker it's durable and it bumps great
Yes
Yes indeed. I have it paired to my MacBook Pro and love it!
I am not an expert. My guess is anything bluetooth equipped. I use mine with my iphone & iPad. I hope this helps.
These are earbuds with three sets of silicone ear pieces of different sizes to better match different ear sizes.
Yes you have standard 3years carry by lenovo.
I am not sure , what you mean - this is not a smart TV- if you need a TV for watching TV only, then, you may want to buy a "smart TV"
I'm using it on an X550L with no problem.
yes it does
No, there is not a remote release in this accessory kit. I did purchase one locally and didn't cost an arm and a leg.
The most important part is the adapter ring. After turning the camera on (lens comes forward) the adapter fits over the raised ridges and turns about 90 degrees. Then the 58 mm filters screw onto the adapter. I would post pictures if I could. Look at the ridges around the end do the lens. Hope this helps
Nothing noticeable. It's on a plastic glide, so there isn't much there to make noise. You should keep them clean because if they get a build up of dirt or dust on the slider it could make noise from the grit, but that's not really a concern for most people.
No
I'm not 100% sure. I went with the Samsung product because I have a Samsung player.
I own an ipad 4, and this seems to be made to specifically fit the ipad. We just bought my parents samsung galaxy 3 10.1" tablets, and from what I recall, I don't think they would work with this keyboard. You would be better off to search for bluetooth keyboards that are made specifically for the samsung galaxy 10 tablet.
No
The iPad Mini is compatible !!! I am typing from it right now. This the best buy for the money. The rotation of the screen is really what did it for me. The keyboard does have a slight delay, but works well in all aspects. I feel you will love this product as I do. I am a very particular buyer for these kinds of things... Good Luck !
There is a little click, to keep it closed. When you open it you will see there is piece that pushes in and out and that is what holds it closed. Kind of hard to explain. If it is not connecting to it then there is a problem with it. I had a friend who got one of these and had to return in because the charge was not working, and she said they were great. They did not ask any question, just sent her a new one.
I get about 5 MB/s average on the 16GB version.
Dear friend &#65292;about 12-17 business day &#65292;
Each drive will always be a bit different, as no two drives will have the exactly the same free space. Mine is 931GB
Yes
Yes it will, as far as you MacBook needs a SATA
It comes covered and in the factory sealed plastic
Yes it is. Sata 2.5 inch hdd
Most of the keys are standard sized. For example, the distance between Q and ] is the same. But the tab and \ keys are smaller compared to a full sized keyboard
It does sent video via RTSP or H.264/MJPEG. It wouldn't say analog but the substream can be a D1 digital resolution which is similar to analog. Please google the manual we are not allowed to give links here. Thanks!
you can do that from the web interface on board.
Please contact us and we will give you support as well as firmware updates. Thank you!
It does not. Great TV but no 3D.
Sorry but I won't give any information that might lead to someone making the mistake of buying a Sharp TV. The quality and customer service is absolutely horrible.

Yes, it does. Also FYI, you should note that, despite what the sharp-us website says, the USB port cannot be used to play video - only photos and audio.
Yes. I wouldn't worry about interference unless it is very high power or very near fluorescent lighting, or if you are attempting 10 gig connection. Gigabit ethernet will be fine.
Roughly 9x7. Great screen
Hi Carlos, I just received my Musemee (gray) and I have a touch-screen Windows 8 laptop, so I checked this out. It does work on the Windows 8. I have an older ArtRage app, so the app and the pen work fine. I hope this helps!
I bought mine from amazon, I found them here:http://www.amazon.com/Replacement-tips-Musemee-Notier-V2/dp/B00CAFSUM8/ref=pd_sim_cps_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=0Q8PGPN9QNRPM6AXQ1YQ .... but I believe they're out of stock. The pen usually comes with one replacement tip. So if you can't find them anywhere, I would be careful with the ones you have until they're more in stock
yes. its pretty precise
Hello Natasha, There are only 2 cut-outs for the camera and flash. Thank you for your inquiry. -iTechAccessory
It depends on which pair you get. Some headphones have a 3 button remote, while others only have a one button. The three buttons do have volume controls on them, at the top and bottom of the remote. I think amazon has a way to select between the 3 and 1 button, but if it doesn't I'm pretty sure the two color headphones (black and blue, etc) are equipped with 3 button, whereas the single color pairs have the one button remote. Hope this helps!
90
It worked fine with my Droid Maxx
Hi amazonian, You may try using the TV SideView Application. Download it in apple store or google play store. Thanks. &gt;Joffrey
As long as your car alarm uses a standard normally closed circuit the yes, not a problem.
This is a Seco-Larm SM-226LQ, normally closed loop with magnet near, for use in alarm systems.
90 Days... full return or reemplecment
There are little spring clamp speaker jacks on the back of the unit so you might double up additional speaker leads, but the unit may not have the power to drive them. When you set the sound stating to 3, the systems sounds pretty damn good for the size. I also run a tv audio into the aux and it is great.
You sure can. It's a very clear picture. There's really no glare from lights in the room either. I bought 2 for my 9 year old twin boys for their birthday and they love them. They use them constantly!
Yes.
Yes it does!
The speaker connection on my system is connected using a small plug in that is attached to the wire coming out of the speaker boxes.
Yes, they come with a usb power cord for recharging, an standard audio 1/8 phone plug so you can use them like regular headphones (no power required for that), or you can pair them up over Bluetooth and use them wirelessly. I easily get 25ft out of the wireless, I can walk around the house and listen to my audio book and leave the phone on the base. I actually bought two pairs.
I don't know. I did not receive any tools with mine.
The material is very similar to an Apple cover. Soft on the inside, rubbery on the outside. It is magnetic, however, and works to activate the Smart Cover features.
Appear
Yes
yes, my zone 2 plays digital with this denon, I use it with an apple tv. my prior denon I owned did not as it only was analog for zone 2.
Yes fits perfect
It will charge an ipad but very, very slowly. We don't use it anymore for ipads because it takes too long. We use it for iphone 5 and Samsung Galaxy 4 phones and it works great for the phones!
I ran it through two cycles and got 17K and almost 20K out of it. I charged a smart phone and Ipod and Gopro repeatedly over maybe a week each cycle. Considering some expected loss in transfer, that's pretty dang good.
i did not have any problems taking on flights with me. I cannot tell you with 100% confidence that it is 22400mAH, but i can tell you that it charged my GS3 every night for 5 nights. Its a brick but take it everywhere with me. Where feasible and sensible.
None
I don't think so, It gets confused when my car tries to log onto my phone and the phone ttys this. It works well by it self, though, kind if a cheap way to avoid upgrading everything to an iPhone 5 interface.
The only powers I've seen to experience with these glasses is the ability to peer into the darkest relms of the galaxy and watched prolonged kitty videos without eye fatigue.
You mean nearsighted? if yes, you can custom made a prescription Lens in Gunnar official website or you can try other brands like Allure Eyewear , which is rimless lens clip.
Thank you for contacting us. A package of this value would typically require a signature upon delivery. If you know you will not be home during normal delivery times we can make arrangements to have the package held for pickup at a local FedEx office but we cannot put this request in until the package is in transit.
Yup...it has a battery and charger. The charger charges the battery fast. In short it has everything you need for a biginner of a DSLR camera.
Yes
yes they need to be on the same channel. Got them for kids to keep track when they are on bikes, work great
We do not open any of the refurbished Nikon products that we sell therefore we do not know what the shutter count on the camera will be.
Since this is a touch screen, it is glossy.
Yes, zoom is available during recording a video.
Yes you can
No, the ipod touch is too thin to fit this case.
A trial version of Nero essentials. you still have to pay for the complete Nero software
It does not have built in wifi, but you can purchase a wifi card.
Both the camera and the bag have straps. All the accessories most likely won't for in the bag but some of them you wouldn't carry around normally.
No, unfortunately it won't work for QC3 because this product is much too big for it. I'm sure there must be a market for buyers who need a headband cushion for QC3, but we don't get many requests for it. I'll pass this information on to the owner of HeadphoneMate to see if he wants to consider creating this new product. Feel free to keep in touch with us in the meantime. Ron Harding - Ron's Electronic Sales - ronselectronicsales.com
I have both DSLR and this ZWO camera DSLR is better for more wide field long exposure targets and usually has larger chips ZWO is more commonly used for planets, sun, moon with many short "stack" images using avi sequence ZWO can do long exposures and it does come with a fish eye camera lens also ZWO is lighter than most dslr I have both and use both in different ways
It does not have IR night vision built in, but we do offer an external IR lamp ($149) that you can use indirectly - e.g. place it behind a piece of furniture and point it up the wall toward the ceiling. Since the camera does have an IR cut filter, it will, in the camera's perspective, "light up" the room so the camera can see in the dark.
It is not. You will still need to power it via the included power supply (AC adapter).
No
The iPad fits into a plastic tray. I have dropped my iPad several times, once on the corner. The cover cracked but the iPad was protected.
My purple case has 4 segments on the cover flap.
yes, It fit perfect in my ipad 2
I don't have that problem. Mine lays flat.
Doesn't fit iPad Air because it is not as wide as iPad 1-4.
I think the fish piece is for winding cords (power or earphone)
Doubtful. I used the apple version of this product on my iPad and it worked fine, this cheap one did nothing.
I struggled with this at first as well but it's actually simple. The back, solid portion just snaps on the back of your iPad and the soft, bendy cover with the metal bar/ magnet pops onto the left side first. If you notice there is a small 'hooked' part on the left side of the plastic back. Slide that between the magnet bar & flexible cover then pop your iPad in. It all stays together really well. Hope this helps
Did you ever get an answer to this? I'm similarly confused. What's the fish-looking thing?
It was for ipad air not ipad 4 and yes it fit but the material peeled. I glued it. It may be ok for a while.
I believe it depends on how you want to set up your shot for the jewelry and if you have additional lighting you will be using. I find that the panel is very bright, and about as big as an ipad. And yes, the color temperature is 5500K.
I'm not sure about duties, but we can try and declare this as a commercial sample. Delivery charges will be the same from us, but not sure what amazon rules are with deliveries to Canada.
Yes. It will run off the charger (any mini USB charger or PC) while left on. Don't leave it off with the charger attached.
No
This is a FM radio. Thou can copy music to micro SD card and play through this. You can also connect USB and play music. You can connect normal 3.5 jack and play music from you mobile. The quality is best for the price.
Press first button on left and it will change from line to read
6mm across, with LM393
No it won't work, wrong socket. You would have to get the I5-3570k processor to go with that motherboard. Or you can get a diff processor, itjust has to be a 1155 socket. The original cpu u posted is a 1150 socket. So iI hope this info helps.
yes
yes
We offer a 2 year total DVR warranty when you purchase through us. Plus lifetime tech support. U-Spy Store
I do not know but you need to check reviews on that camera
24inControl: This is something your current provider can easily do. 24inControl would love be your ADC provider: $14.99/month ; No long-term contract and we provide expert technical support and customer service. Contact 24inControl for additional information.
I didn't connect direct to either of my computers. I have several memory cards. I would remove the used card, install a new one, and that only took 15 seconds. I would then read the used card on either my Mac or PC. The cards read on both with no difference.
It depends on how many GB your micro SD card has which doesn't come with this. It supports up to 32GB, I got a 2GB I was able to record 10 minutes in medium quality video, which will be 320 minutes/5 hrs and 20 minutes if recording in medium quality.
The dock allows you to do software updates for the lens . It also allows you to do micro adjustments to focus . Some cameras allow this fine tuning adjustment, but only one adjustment per lens. The dock allows you to adjust at different focal lengths, not just one. If you have no focus issues with the lens and camera , then you probably don't need the lens dock.
Yes. The apps are very easy to use.
I'm not sure if it does, but what I can tell you is that my component board that accepts all connections fried. I had this TV for about 14 months, which was about 30 days past my original warranty and Vizio customer service told me I was out of luck and they would do nothing for me. Cost me $360 to repair. Even though all of my TV's were Vizio, they basically told me too bad. I just bought myself a LG TV since then. Hope this helps with your decision.
Yes it does. When you open the screen, the port can be found underneath another flip door on the main body of the camera. There is also a port there for a headset.
Yes, you will receive 10 different colors.
You would have to place the order with FedEx next day air shipping before 1pm (EST) today. However, we only ship to the Home Confirmed address on file with Paypal.
Yes. They work really well. I have taken several shots with them and they are working great. Here is a website of some of my pictures. The ones with the fall colors are the ones where I used both lenses. You can check it out and let me know if you have any more questions. The people are really good to work with. http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/profile/151439/ Thanks Ken
I do not believe it has WiFi
After correctly installing it all, the tuners show up when you run "Tv Signal Setup" in Media Center.
No, all you need is for your PC to be running a version of Windows that supports Windows Media Center and for the PC and the infinitiTV 6 ETH to be on the same subnet. It would act as if the tuner is directly connected to the tuner device... And multiple Windows PC can share the tuner. Externeders would continue to work as they are today.. They are simply clients to your media center PC that hosts the tuners themselves (or the network tuners).
An event will trigger the camera(s) to take a snapshot and send it up to the cloud. A 30-second recording will also occur per camera. As the camera has some memory in it, the 30-second recording will consist of 5 seconds before the event and continue for another 25 seconds. Event recordings get stored on the 16GB USB flash drive that gets plugged into an OPU USB port. Manual recordings are saved to the photo album of the device being used, be it smartphone or tablet. The recording is a 30 second video clip.
if there is a power outage or internet connection loss, you will be notified. However, the system will be rendered more or less useless unless you connect it to a UPS.
I returned the tablet for a refund after 3 weeks. It was supposed to be "new" and it wasn't. After 3 weeks it would not turn on or charge. My advice...don't trust it
This will work just fine...
Yes it does
I have a number of Surface 2 Pro tablets in the field and none have exhibited this issue with the Wedge mouse.
a Baofeng radio is a Boafeng radio, no matter where you get it from. so as long as it is as pictured, yes it will work.
No it will not work. Other radios have the same diameter socket as the end of that antenna socket, and this antenna have a male the same size as the socket on the Yaesu radio.
Yes, more flexible.
From the picture this charger looks like the UV-5R, but I cannot certify. The seller should be able to replace the original one for free if. Good luck
this is a common cord it's usually used in blackberries so if you go looking for a black berry cord even go to a goodwill and take your radio with you and match it you might find a charger that way as well it's easy not a big deal
Yes it does but first you must go to setup, (general setting), Recording, and then select dubbing mode, then select VCR to DVD . This is in your manual pg 39-40.
Yes. It worked great with mine.
Yes. Whatever you can do on your phone can be viewed from your television. You'll still receive the same crappy connection whatever your viewing using the HTC media link.
It does only sit in one position technically, however it doesn't have to be connected to the iPad to work. It's more versatile than it appears.
The main thing you want to do is to study the picture and description to be sure that your TV port matches the gender of the DVI portion of the adapter, and that the HDMI port on the adapter matches the gender of the device you're plugging into it. Other than that, it should work.
It can be plugged in via USB as a webcam, for file transfer, or printing, but there's no way to use it in "normal" camera mode without the battery. USB is the only external power source - and works without the battery - but only as an external webcam connected to a computer.
No. The flex cable is soldered to the LCD screen.
I have a mac book air and its perfect-
Yes
I bought six of them and connected them to a single PC. The screens are not glossy and I get absolutely not light reflection. It's more of a satin finish on the outer part of the screen. I hope this answers your question.
No. The 12 x 21"" is the height and widthe of the screen/viewing area. The entire monitor from base to top is 17"; I hope that this was helpful.
I don't see much difference, to be perfectly honest. I can say that the Phillips monitor has been an absolute glorious experience with a picture that is better than most televisions that I've seen. It works perfectly for large computer projects and for watching shows/movies even from a good ten feet away.
I'm not sure, as I don't use it with a windows computer, I only have a Mac Pro
Yes
I've never tried that application
I don't think so, unfortunately.... since you'd have to cut it and that might damage the glass... which is what makes it what it is :-( They don't have one for the S3?
Sorry, I have a Vizio 32". However I had a sound issue and almost returned the TV. What I found out is that in the menu section (Audio) for sound adjustments I had to switch the "surround sound" to "off", because it was not connected to an auxiliary surround sound system. Prior to this, the sound was canceling out the dialog of the actors. I am not sure if a "Sound Bar" would act as a "Surround Sound System", or not! Hope this helps.
This is a single unit piece. To be able to use it, you will need at least two; one that will connect directly from your router and the other one will act as a remote relay.
Yes
Yes. Is a creamy tough aluminum.
The Companion 2 Series III does not have a separate bass module. The bass response from the speakers themselves is very impressive for such a small package.
It depends on the format and resolution you want to record at. It also depends on whether you set it at motion detection or continuous record. If its on motion detection record then it depends on how busy the area to record is. A camera set on high resolution to record continuously might last a day or two, but on motion detection it should last a week or more depending on how busy the area is.
Jeff, there are many different reasons. The manufacturers info should be included in box.
I do not believe that Samsung makes a remote for this camcorder.
I hit the reset button with a paper clip and all was good. I have done it a couple times when it locks up. otherwise its been good.
It should... Plus a laptop
for more expansion use a USB HUB if you like wireless keyboard you can connect also as long as receiver connects with usb
Go with what amazon recomends. I never bought anything extra for it
Yes, with no problem.
Fits like a tight glove & no zipper compartments. I wouldn't recommend it.
I don't know for sure, but I can't imagine why it wouldn't work. The switch detects an HDMI signal and passes that through. The output should "look" the same to the Bose unit as if it were not run thru a switch.
Never had a problem with the Defender for the Q. But I did receive one for the Z10 that didn't work very well. Contact Otterbox and they will take care of it.
Yes, it does! I'm Happy with the camera!
It has batteries.
It is a fixed lens and there are no rings on the front of the lens. As far as I know, no lens modifications are possible.
Yes
It connects wirelessly to Bluetooth enabled devices. We use it with iPhone & iPad but we don't have a kindle fire. If it's Bluetooth enabled I imagine it would work. You could call an electronics store & ask.
I bought this as a gift for a friend and asked her if it could be and she said it cannot be charged with 220 AC power cord....
Yes. Not only can you use the zoom you can also take pictires while you are recording a movie. You can also capture individual frames from the movie afterward.
A Bluetooth dongle is just a piece to plug in to a computer that allows the keyboard device to connect when the computer doesn't have Bluetooth capability. You won't have to pay for one of these, especially not with your iPad. This keyboard should just connect once you turn it on, find it on your iPad, and type the code it asks you to type on the keyboard. It's a great device, I use it all the time! &#1571;&#1606;&#1575; &#1571;&#1587;&#1578;&#1582;&#1583;&#1605;&#1607; &#1575;&#1604;&#1570;&#1606;
Thank you for your inquiry, the keyboard is bluetooth standard, it can work within 10m away from the bluetooth receiver (from your device, the keyboard not come with)
It will come with instruction to let it connect, but your device MUST have bluetooth ready.
hold camera only friend.thanks
No there is not.
Both of them are removable.
No this price is just the camera.
It didn't work. Opened the box and it never worked never was used returned for refund
It does not come with a power source. yes their is two spots for disc drive
Yes, I believe amazon ships items to Greece
No.
Nothing on the plugs that would indicate amperage, so I can't tell you for sure. Having said that, the wire looks to be 14-2 which would mean 15 amps.
Yes
Hummm... i gave it to my brother as a gift and don't really know what model it is off hand. I'm sorry.
13
It's the same thing! Only sometimes there is a difference between countries on TV model ..
Based on http://www.lg.com/us/tv-accessories/lg-AN-MR400, I think No.
Yes.
This drive uses sata interface, so if your board has sata it will work
The lighted keys on mine are not very bright, but I can see them clearly when the room is dark.
Sorry, I don't know. It works great with the Xidax gaming system!
Membrane, also I'd recommend getting the warranty on it. The keys occasionally stick and the keyboard can break easily. The power cord for my keyboard was stretched, making the wire very temperamental, the keyboard randomly loses power because of this. Otherwise I have not had any problems and keyboard/mouse are great for the price..

No its just a case and fans
Mine came with green LEDs, not sure about that specific liquid cooler but there are rubber grommet fixtures in the back for liquid cooling lines.
NO. That model is a 40pin screen
Yes. 1/4 and 1/2.
I think it is very smooth, but I guess something like that is a matter of personal opinion.
Yes is great Tripod, for the price..big deal
Hey Joseph, if you purchase the proper cooling block to go with your AMD FX-9590,which is the same processor I just purchased, yes it shouldn't be a problem at all.
Yes, it does come with the power adapter.
Not sure what you mean by reformed
exactly like a regular pen...looks like a Mont Blanc
Possibly other 'spy' stores or surveillance stores on the net (especially the ones who sell this or similar pens) or in your own neighborhood. I live in Vegas and there is a store I am sure they could at least guide you more.
It's a 4th Generation w/voice over menu button that let's you pick playlists and identify song info and battery life. I have enjoyed it tremendously! Easy, light, small - perfect attached to goggles.
it does work underwater, but it's easier to listen to music than say books or podcast. I haven't had a problem with it working in the water, if it didn't work, i would have returned it, it is a little pricey but i would still recommend it.
The end on these is soft like silicone and have several different sizes in the package. Although I did not measure them, my impression is that these are smaller.
i would just contact them with the problem you are having. They were very responsive and helpful when I contacted them.
I would think so as my PC is Win 7. To make absolutely certaIn, I'd contact Underwateraudio in Corvales, OR
Call underwater audio.

Yes, it will, according to the Amazon product page.
yes it is. i use a windows 8 lenovo flex 15
I had difficulty hearing anything but static. The volume was terrible. A waste of time and money.
The extension cord is for every day use of the iPod. The short cord allows you to clip it to the back of your goggles without getting it tangled in your arms or anything.
Only to the front, middle and back of the greems.
In a very basic sense yes, it will work as a mouse. But the software is Windows only so you will lose a lot of functionality and programmability.
The smart port detects USB pin signals to identify your device and charge it at full speed. Universal charges as well just not as "smart."
Input volt/current 5V/1.2A I am using my Note 3 AC adapter to charge the external battery and it works fine. One can use the computer to charge the external battery, but it is a slower process. If you require definitive information, go here and ask a question. They provide excellent support in timely fashion: http://www.ianker.com/support/
Juan, are you using the supplied cable to charge the battery? What are you plugging the other end into? A computer or wall charger? If it's a computer, make sure it doesn't go into sleep mode or it may stop supplying power to the USB ports. If it is a wall charger, is it one compatible with the power requirements of the device?
I don't know if works on NEX cameras , but is very bright works great on th canon camera .sorry I can help U but with th price you need to get one and see if works for you!
The one I got the looks just like the picture no hoods
Yes

Net 10 and Straight Talk are run together Like Kmart and Sears if you call the Straight Talk customer Service they ask if it pertains to Straight Talk or Net 10.
Hello Femi, It has 4 USB 2.0 ports. Thank you, Your EPower
4GB DDR2 and 160 GB HD.
For ever thing I need it for it works fine I can get on the net with it work on office documents using Microsoft Office and it has outlook which i use for mail and calendar. You are right about it not running any application that are not in the store. If it had Access Database that would even be better.
Yes to both questions. I have only used the magnetic key board once, I have never needed it. It does provide protection to the tablet, but so does a padded pouch. I am so impressed with this tablet that I also bought the Nokia Lumina 928 smartphone that is the compatible phone. I can't say anything bad about this tablet and after using a friends IPad I knew I made the right choice.
I'm not for sure, but for what the system costs you can add another $75 and get a new one.
Yes, but you have used and DVI video Card, we put for free
It's 7" ...I bought a 7 " case n it fits
it should it works well
As long as you have the threads on your camera so you can screw something into it... that is all you need
Yes, the Nikon D3100 can take short videos.
I am a photographer of initiation, I am learning and I think that if it's easy.
It comes with the locking cage but you will need a dash kit for your specific car.
No, it doesn't.
10.5" x 5" x 6"H
I have gifted to my family in India and it is working fine there.
depends what kind of disk you put in there....
You can, however I would not use it in a production environment. It is extremely slow unless you configure the vm swap file to local storage on the host.
Turn the camera on with the card already inserted, press "Menu/Set", select "Setup", tab to its screen 8 of 8, and you will see "Format" as one of the options on that page.
Not a pop-up flash!
This is nice well made lens, but it is not weather sealed.
I don't know. I only own a GX7. but but it's a very well engineered highly functional lens
I may miss a couple of things, but camera obviously, battery, USB walll charger and cable (yes, cable is proprietary....), manual and a couple of software CDs. I'm pretty sure that's it.
NO, there are no output jacks
Please notice the female connector on the "Apple" connection end of this cable. It's intended to plug in to an iPod/iPhone docking connector. What are you connecting to your car?
No this plug has a female connector.
No, home edition. Don't but this machine. It is junk.
adding ram
Multiple tips are provided with the battery, and more tips can be purchased from Energizer. So, I would say that you will get that size or can order it. I use that output for my Acer Netbook and there was a tip for that.
The answer to your question depends on the output voltage...however from the back of the device it says 70WH (watt hours) max so you can calculate MAH from that.
I am sorry, I do not know about the link for the driver. Mine came with a cd. I still could not get mine to work. It is probably just me and the hook up. My eithernet port went bad so I thought I would try it this way. So far--no luck----good luck
The press makes patties that are just shy of 4-1/2 inches in diameter.
Yes it does and it's a great tv
Yes but don't buy it For me worked for 1 week after that just died Also you have to make a hole in your console My recommendation Buy something else but not this
Probably not - it may work for a while, but this product is junk and will stop working after a few months.
I have a 2004 lexus es 330 with nav and works great. if you have the 6 disc cd changer it will work if you havent already bought!
I cannot answer definitively, but it worked perfectly in my 2006 Highlander JBL system.
I use it for my laptop to connect to my speakers it work really well.
Yes indeed this will definitely work. My Samsung TV is 60" and it works beautifully. Just make sure you drill into studs or beams in the wall otherwise the TV will not be secure.
Standard wireless
It should work Great for that~!!
Hi Crosby, The S200 mSATA drive is compatible and recommended for the Dell XPS 13 L321X laptop. Thank you for choosing Kingston as your upgrade partner! -Jewel, Kingston US Technical Support
Yes it comes with a USB Mouse and USB Keyboard.

I imagine dust would be kept out no matter what. Will not accommodate a 300mm lens with camera, but will an 85 and maybe some accessories.
Nope. I'll bet it could be hacked, but it would still need an interface, keyboard, touchscreen etc. I think it works quite well for what it is though.
To be perfectly honest with you, if you aren't sure about wiring, maybe this isn't the right product for you. It will mean using trim tools and splicing to a found 12v wire. If you want to press forward, the red goes to a switched +12vdc source, and the black goes to a chassis ground point. Good luck.
Yes it will work fine
If you mean Windows Vista, yes, it is compatible with any version of Windows, as far as I know. If you want to save Publisher files on the hard drive and then open them in another PC, yes, you can use the Toshiba Canvio for this as well.
The Canvio works on USB 2 ports, you just won't get USB 3 speeds.
Yes, you can back up as many as you can fit in 1tb. A typical computer would not have much more than 0.3 to 0.4 tb to back up. However, it always depends. You could have more info to back up, I'm just stating approx averages.
This is a regular 2. 5" hard drive with moving parts. If you want a drive without moving parts you want a external ssd or smaller usb flash drive
If you have a 3.0 USB port on your computer you may be able to play some PC games, it all depends on the nature of the game and its requirements. If the game requires lots of disk seeking and video requests you may have a limited game experience. This a great drive for back ups, photos, files, and programs. It is not meant to replace a standard hard drive. It has simple back up software program and includes a cloud storage option. It is very fast compared to a 2.0 USB drive ( 40 times faster).
Hello, The : Toshiba Canvio Connect 2TB Portable Hard Drive, Blue (HDTC720XL3C1) includes a USB Cable.
Yes you can
I have had no problems sending large file since I've own mine.
My daughter has a Mac and is using the hard drive normally, with no complaints. I don't think any fine names were changed, since the new mac OS lets me exchange files over a thumbrave with no problems. I hope this helps!
Regardless - Go with WD or even Seagate. I have 5 portable drives (2 WD, 2 Seagate, 1 Toshiba) the Toshiba is the newest. I treat them all the same but the Toshiba is the only one crapping out on me in less than a year. Their laptops are KILLER though. It's possible that I just got a dud, but that's my current experience.
You plug the little box into a device (phone, ipod, mp3, etc.) and play music off of the device. The box sends out a constant radio wave at a frequency that you set it to; this allows you to change your radio to an unused channel of your choosing. You must have a radio in order to use this product.
You actually need to look for the diameter of the lens. There is a symbol for diameter which is a circle with a slash through it and then it should say 52 or 77 or some number. That is the diameter so you look for that size mm lens cap. My camera is a 67mm diameter. I know this company has different sizes available.
if you blue-tooth link 2 cellular/mobile phones, that would be a phone "like it had multiple lines", which is a single phone with multiple lines, when actually it is a phone with 2 lines connected, that come from multiple mobile phones.
One end of the cord is a standard USB plug, the other fits my Nokia Windows phone as well as my Google Nexus tablet. Then you can reverse the ends to charge the charger from the electrical adaptor plugged into a standard outlet, or straight into a computer USB port. Hope that helps.
Yes
Yes
If there is a android app for Amazon prime you can use a android media box. The zeki is under powered. I wouldn't recommend it.

There appears to be a connection on the bottom of the 9212T-LM marked "AV In" but there is nothing in the user manual or any of the setup screens that would indicate that it is usable. The 9261T-LM AV In connection is active and usable for connection to external devices such as back-up cameras, DVD players, and iPods. The 9261T-LM also has Bluetooth while the 9212T-LM does not. The 9212T-LM is my fifth Magellan and I am very happy with it although I do not have a need for the AV input or Bluetooth. I hope this helps.
Yes you can! Simply leave the unit in JBOD mode and install any drives to access them. The drives will not be reformatted or overwritten. Please let us know if you have further questions. Oyen Digital Support
I was able to tweak the colors to get them just right by adjusting the color on my Mac...Go to System properties -&gt;Display-&gt;color

Actually I havnt had HD20 but I'm so happy for Hd25's image quality... go ahead and don't hesitate ...
It comes with a double ended mini USB charger so you can charge both from same outlet. Or you can use standard mini USB cable.
The DVD player is very light. I don't have the specs but I'm guessing as little as 1.5 lbs. In fact, its so light that it feels cheap. I had a panasonice 9 inch that was heavier. Most of the weight is in a battery. So longer laster can mean heavier. But the DVD player has worked well now for over 6 months.
I'm recording videos on my galaxy note 3 in 4k@30fps 1080p@60fps and slow motion videos in 720p@240fps
I don't think so, I don't believe the mount will screw into the lens. Do any other common filters screw onto the SX50 ??
As long as you're Sony Nex 7 has filter threads on the lens, these ND filters should screw on to your camera's lens with no problem. Hope this helps.
Yes. I cracked mine open a few months after I purchased it to make a modification and found a Zoran chipset and genuine 207 nvram.
End to end is 54". I don't use the strap though. I mainly use it as a half case. Hope this helps!
Unfortunately no! But when I am out to take pictures I only use the other part of the case. And when the camera is at home it doesn't need the adapter, so it can be entirely protected. No big deal for me.
My laptop is 11.6 and the pouch is 11 to 11.6, it fits perfectly but no room for my finger.
It comes on automatically when you plug the keyboard into the tablet. If it does not, something is wrong.

A 110v surge protector is not going to take 220v well. You need a 220v surge protector and if you use an adapter, you need to make sure you get one that connects the ground.
It lights in green on each side of the strip, mostly where it shows "protected" each side on the same end. Answer: Yes, you could totally cover the lighting with black tape if you wanted to.
To be honest I really love my patriot case. It's got great air flow and plenty of room. Rosewill is very good costumer service wise so if you have an issue they will help you with it. Of course it's up to you, but out of those 3, I would pick the Patriot
Probably 85mm but I doubt 300. What is total length of retracted lens?
Yes you can.
Amazon doesn't give you the option. It's a huge hassle to upgrade an all-in-one yourself unless you're getting something like the HP Z series (which starts at about $1000 more). You can search online and see videos on how to do it. You could try buying it from Acer and call them and see if they would upgrade it, it doesn't look like you can do it from their website.
If you mean to wireless?? not sure. I think you need to check with your cable. With my last project I needed the wireless codes to hook up. Just check first is your best option.
Go to beagleboard.org they have a version that works with your beagle board. Little tweeted for a beaglebone.
Any camara it comes with adaptor rings
YES! For sure...
The T It has 1000GB
I got this 80" Vizio over the weekend and very pleased thus far.
I don't think it would be, even if it is, I would not recommend using a higher wattage than 45. You'd run the risk of destroying the battery or worse causing an electrical fire or blackout. Hope this was helpful
I have the 50 M501 and It's great for gaming. I've used the PS3 and PS4 on it and have not had any issues whatsoever.
it will not sleep but does not need to be plugged except when in use.
yes as long as the drive is not encrypted. I cloned by 500 Hard drive to the SSD 500 GB drive with no issues. once cloned took out the hard drive and plugged in the SSD, booted right up.
KX-TGA405
as long as it has a 3.5mm headphone jack, it will :-)
It works on my sharp aquos. Only issue is, the white and yellow plugs on the cable may be miss colored. I had to plug the video in (yellow) to the white plug on the cable and the right audio (white) into the yellow plug. Works great now.
The cable is about 7" long. Note it has female RCA connectors, so you will also need a male to male RCA patch cord to hook this up to any device like a television. If you are only using this to take audio from your phone or laptop, you're good to go. The video for those devices need other cables.
It should work fine even though I do not use one with mine. I love it and it is thick and durable.
Yes, there is 1-100th of an inch difference in the thickness between the two iPad Mini's. This means that the difference in thickness is less than half the thickness of a human hair. Don't worry - it'll fit just fine. Thank you for asking. Sincerely, Jose @ LapWorks, Inc.
I have not heard the Agard2 but from reviews its more like a C class to E class Mbenz comparison. That is the Magni is good but the Asgard2 is an upgrade, with slightly more power as well as detail separation. It also has RCA line outs, is it worth the premium? Well if you will be using a wide variety of headphones the Asgard2 will be better (gain control, more power) as well as futureproofing. That said the Magni is a great little performer.
It's a 6.3 plug and volume knob in the front. Only 1 set of RCA jacks power switch and plug in for the power supply in the back. Hope this helps
The attachments will work with any digital camera. The battery charger is for the Lithium Ion NP-BX1 battery, which is the battery in the DSC-HX50/V cameras.
they are provide android apk file only. we should install those, then only it's appear. once insert that into the android device, device automatically creates folder for saving snaps. that folder name "DICM"- under this folder your snap will be save. while music is concern we can add by our-self under the any name of the folder created by us. also music is concern android device automatically finds whatever music in SD-card to the music player.
A trial version.
It will come with Windows 7. All downgrade rights means is that Microsoft has authorized HP (in this case) to pre-load Windows 7 on this machine from the factory. Also, it will come with a copy of Windows 8 that will enable you to upgrade without having to purchase a new license.
Hi it comes with 3rd Gen Intel Core i7-3537U processor.

Yes, To charge and operate
Yes, the Onkyo NR-828 comes with all the standard items, remote, batteries, AM antenna, FM string antenna and setup microphone. Setup is very easy and it can work WiFi or LAN. Bluetooth for other audio devices to play thru receiver. I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
I can't even get my sub woofer to work with it
I don't know for sure, but mine does not work on ours...it is an LG but I don't know which model. It only works for the Seiki TV that we have. Sorry.
Probably, but I wouldn't buy this mouse the USB hub fell apart in my computer during the first use.
It should, specs say it is compatible with Mac OS, someone has already used on MacBook Pro so I would assume it would work just as well with MAC desktop. You can call their support at 1-800-988-7973 Mon-Fri 9:00-5:00 (PST).
The snap battery charges first then the phone.
No it's not compatible with the iPad. At least I have not seen wireless charging case for the iPad. The case for my iPhone stays on the phone all the time like any other case. There is an extended battery you can buy and either leave it on the case or handle it separately. It drops on the charging base just like the phone does.
Lifetime limited. Check their website for specifics.
No, the screen protector is built in. I've read online that some people cut them out and just use another screen protector film.
Not sure, all it know is I'm happy
No this case is just like an otter box case. Doesn't have a cover flap at all. This is a great case for protection!
Hello, No. It didn't seem to work with my iPhone or iPads at all.
I attach an Apple Digital AV Adapter (MC953ZM/A) to the iPad, which is also available from Amazon, then attached ethernet cable and attached the other end of the ethernet cable to the HDMI port of the projector. Once you turn the projector on (silver button on top above lens; also don't forget to remove the lens cover), you should be able to project items displayed on a wall or a projector screen.
Not sure, but this projector didn't have clear characters on the screen. Not recomended!
We had that issue and you do a 1 year warranty to get it fix No charge or if you damage it yourself you can get a replacement eve and do it yourself. I did it both ways as I have 3 chromebks
No
This device did not work for me after trying all I could to make it work. I ended up keeping it because by the time I gave up trying, the return window had closed. So, I cannot say anything about monthly charges.
Not sure about amps, but I have found that it will charge my iPhone, but not my iPad. Also, will run two 2.5" external drives (not ssd, which should run on less power) with no problem. Another user claims 7 external drives. I have a WD Scorpio Black drive and a Seagate FreeAgentGo drive attached and running flawlessly while the Satechi is plugged in.
It has a very light anti glare coating that you do not notice. The frame is matte as well which is great.
No. Length is 22.1 inches, height is 14.75 inches, and diagonal is 26.5 inches. These are outside dimensions. Thickness is less than an inch (0.8 inch) on the sides and top. Bottom thickness is 1 inch.
Not at all that I have noticed.
I'm pretty sure it is. I've used this in a Canon ELPH 300HS as well as a SX280. Presently using it in a Lumix ZS30. Very reliable media. Hope this helps.
I have no idea!
To all cameras
Yes, it works well
Yes. This would work.
it should work with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 , which is the (GT-P5113).
No, it will not.
Yes, that is the unit I bought this adapter for. It works great.
yes, it will works
N cheese
yes like many strobes it beeps to let you know its ready but you can turn it off if it bothers you.
1/8" sync cable... Not sure of the different models
No, it usually records 3-5 hours after it's fully charged.
The 2.8 inches phone is measured for diagonal.It is not 2.8 inches wide or 2.8 inches long.
Yes it does.
No. You would need to buy the Samsung HML box. The unit doesn't not charge the phone if you use the pioneer version. All you really need are: Samsung MNL, 5 pin usb, DVI cable
Upgrade to 8.1 provided some helpful additions and would advise to apply it to your unit.
must be pci express 16, most cards are best check for that spec. to get the best performance from the card you may need to upgrade the ram and power supply. the provided 300 watt power supply should power the card but for full performance its always best to upgrade to at least a 500 watt power supply, especially for heavy gaming.
Both plugs are the same, male to female adapter. (On one side you plug your HDMI cable, the other side you plug it to the TV or whatever)
My rig did not have counter weights but they would be easy to add. The flaps are plastic and can fall off. But really, it seems like a good product for the price. I'm pleased.
Works well with my Tab Pro 10.1 should sync the same
Thank you for contacting us. The SL1 is an 18 megapixel camera.
Hi, You may select the AmazonGlobal Eligible option to filter if an item is elegible for International Shipping. Items that qualify for international shipping will feature a note on the product detail page under Shipping that says : This item is also available for shipping to select countries outside the U.S. Hope you find this helpful, thank you!
I purchased this to use with my MacBook Air. However, it also works with my ipad 2 and my iPhone 5s.
Yes it is. There's a switch that you can toggle from mac to windows.
Don't know, gave it as a gift.
Gave it as a gift for his office. I don't know.
My 4 year old nephew used them just fine.
I use it for my iPad mini. I've tried it on my '09 MB Pro but couldn't get it to connect.
It depends on which HP model you have. ( That would be helpful information to know.) I would advise you to check out the ipearl website and contact them if you encounter any issues. When my case arrived cracked, they were super nice and friendly. And they sent a replace case immediately afterwards.
Yes
Please understand, 15.6" refers to the screen size only. You must be sure of your laptop MODEL before ordering. This case was designed to ONLY fit laptop series listed in the description. Some examples of the models this case will fit are listed in the product description above. It will NOT fit ANY other model HP laptop. It will NOT fit any other 15.6" laptops from other manufacturers, like Dell or Toshiba.
Yes it comes with the standard life proof warranty
The caption picture is too small to compare to my adapter. Enlarge the picture to me and I'll compare it to mine.
The sensor has 2 tabs with holes. One in each. You can use a spare rod or hand line to cast out the sensor and retrieve it by the same means,or the upper hole goes to the reel amd the lower hole goes to the hook n thus retrieved along with the hook
I think the same mount works for either AirPort Extreme or Time Capsule. The manufacturer website should have the details though.
Yes any platform, my friend used it on his playstation as well as xbox so they both work. Not sure about the blue light tho.
Drag your music to the desktop. Copy the music files that you want on your desktop to the folder of the MP3 player. This mp3 player is not compatible with itunes. I returned mine because it didnt work well.
It is a terrible mp3 for anything except swimming. And still not even good for that. There are a lot better mp3 players for the money if you will only be using it for running. Get a cheap waist pedometer and a sanza mp3 player. I could never get the pedometer to work right. Controls are terrible. I sent mine back it was so bad. And I am a technology nerd.
I guess changing between equilizer presets..
Yes. I have done this sing my android cell phone. So the Android stick shouldn't have a problem doing this. You'll need an app like IP Cam Pro to display the security camera live image on your screen. Also your Wifi should be adequate (of course)...
I tested the quality of the microphone on three different DAWs(digital audio workstations, which are used to create professional audio, mostly music-related), and I can't say that I'm impressed. The quality of my voice was good, but there was an annoying buzz heard in the background(and whenever my voice isn't heard).
No idea, quite honestly but I get high praise on the quality of sound when on Skype.
Not at east...
&lt;=10.7 mm thickness; 197mm x 115.8mm http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&lc=en&docname=c03726652
I think so. I believe the charger killed mine. I returned the HP & got an Asus instead!
Yes three feet
Either one. The 2 Amp port will charge faster.
Idk, I have not put it to task yet but I'll let you know when I do. It says 6 hrs on other reviews. I'm confident it'll do quite well.
Yes, it will.
This grip does NOT fit the D750. The only battery grip that exists for the D750 camera is the Nikon MB-D16.
I hope the below links help? http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/checkpoint-friendly-laptop-bags http://traveltips.usatoday.com/tsa-carry-rules-laptop-computers-62914.html
Yes it will. I have an HP 15.6" laptop and it fits comfortably
No ... The 13" fits just perfect so I don't think is good for any bigger than that
Hey Allan, no you can't. Its fixed only for Go Pro
The remote is water proof. The housing for the remote is not waterproof. It just puts the basic waterproof GoPro remote on the pole in a snap in housing case for single handed operation. Very convenient.
Works with all gopro models including the hero 2.
Perfectly:-)
It works on my PC, but as far as androids, there is no usb, unless you get the adapter. It plugs into your android's mini port, then the usb from the baby keyboard plugs in. That- I haven't tried this yet. Overall, I'm not really impressed. My Best Buy bluetooth kb works 100 times better; it's just larger though.
Hello, I have the case and a macbook air 13". It fits pretty snuggly. since i am not familiar with the rubberized hard case you have i couldn't give an opinion. As long as the case isn't too thick it should be ok but the case does fit pretty snuggly.
XBMC is a media center / operation system . So this basically saying that when you buy your SD card it will have already pre- installed an media center on the SD card
Yes it will it had a usb port for your thumb drive
I bought this screen for my Acer Aspire V5-131-2629 11.6" Laptop. It fits 100% Link to amazon http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CU2K6MS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Yes... and yes
I would call the company to be sure. The info on the box doesn't specify all the companies that are compatible. Technical support: 1-855-IT-UPVEL (488-7835) M-F 10AM-7PM excluding public holiday
Obviously it depends on the cover, but I have a snap on cover that covers the face (not the back) and it does __not__ fit with the Logitech. I just choose which I want for a particular excursion. Hope that helps.
Yes, I have this and it works with IPad 4 ( IPad with retina display)
yes
No, if the phone is on there are more features available, but it works just fine without the phone.
yes but they dont share data
Absolutely
I believe it is only dc plug.
Yes. But you will need to use the display to adjust settings.
You have to add it as a bluetooth device under your iPhone's settings. After it's paired it should auto-connect when you turn it on.
Typically most phones can only link to one Bluetooth device at a time. You would only be able to use one or the other. The airwave also stops streaming when you receive a call. Unit only streams media.
64 bit......LIKE NEW
According to their documentation yes.
It completely depends on your motherboard. If you have a motherboard with onboard graphics, then yes, you can boot bios, just plug your monitor to the onboard graphics port. if you have a motherboard without an onboard graphics chip, you will be able to boot the bios (providing you have CPU and RAM installed), but you won't be able to see anything, so it will be no use booting the bios to check if parts are working correctly, or to alter settings without a graphics card hope that helps
I don't know
It definitely is removable, though I would imagine that constant moving of it back and forth between vehicles would result in some decreased sticking of the base. It relies mostly on the sticky outer ring to hold it in place so I would assume after repeated movement it would lose some of that.
You need another flat piece, that it doesn't come with, to stick to.
You should try other chargers like a phone charger or Kindle fire charger...they may fit!
I'm not sure if the battery can be replaced, most likely no. What I do know is that I played mines for about 8 hours at full volume before the battery died so I'd say that's decent. The type of battery it is you would probably get a couple hundred recharges. You may want to alternate between using it till the battery is completely drained and using it while charging. It will help to extend the battery life. Hope this helps.
The camera is brand new from Panasonic and it comes with a full one year warranty from Panasonic USA. We are a real store and have a store location in Amityville New York.
How heavy is the combination? Camera, lens and monitor together.
Hi- Thank you for your inquiry. Yes, these glasses are compatible with the LC-70TQ15U. Sharp's web page indicates that the model supports "3D Active", which our glasses are compatible with. Marty
I am buying this for use in Colombia. Pandora will not work in Turkey either. Only in America.
You have the ability to hook up the equalizer, however you probably do not need to. The speaker calibration and following setup adjustments on board the receiver really do a nice job. I think you would find that you would be satisfied to go without the equalizer.
Yes of course you can. I bought this for my soy milk mechine from China which is 220V/1700W, and it runs all good.
We recommend you to let the machine take a 30 minutes break every 8 to 10 hours.
This computer is way to sensitive and will do a lot of things you don't want while typing. It will move the cursor so you are typing in the middle of a sentence three lines above, it will erase paragraphs you have typed, etc. The main problem is in the mouse pad and the only way is to turn it off but a lot of functions are lost while it is off.
yes...use the hdmi cable
This unit includes Microsoft Office Starter, with reduced-functionality Word and Excel only, and no PowerPoint or Outlook.
It is nice and bright and can be seen well in the sun. At night is is not to bright, arty all (but I keep my dash board lights on high in the car)
Unfortunately it's not that long, I wanted to this set up as well the cord is like 2ft long.
Here's a link that will help u on YouTube https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FxuJBbnyotI. Hope it's helpful to u
Only takes 1-2 hrs, longer for the initial charge . 2 ways to chk batt: press the + and - buttons at same time and a voice wil tell you "90%!charged". It get the app that this spkr so you can check from phone.
I believe its 75-80Hz. More info on manufactures website: http://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-27EA33V-led-monitor
The cable plug fits into the bottom of the speaker so the speaker is on its side. The front of the speaker has a sorta design w/ a plus and a minus sign which is made of rubber so that the speaker does not roll when on its side.Seems to me, d/t the plug being on the bottom helps keep it from dust. BTW, pushing the plus and minus signs together will tell you how much charge is left in the speaker.
Yes
I only use the bluetooth connection and I would say my battery has never ran out while I have used it. My speaker is amazing. If I was guessing I would say something is wrong with yours.
Apparently so, but I'm not really not sure. I couldn't find any product like this that has replaceable, rechargeable batteries. If someone knows of some, let me know. (I know there are a few that use regular batteries.)
I believe the stereo feature is only available through the app, through bluetooth, not wired. That means iOS and Android only.
ASAP remove all the provided software bloat and the Macafee security as it SLOWS the Acer down to a crawl. Once gone it runs great!
Yes it does have a fan, nice thing with this laptop is it won't over heat and it does have bluetooth. Because it's windows 8, you go to the charms menu and to the magnifying glass the type bluetooth, and boom you can turn it on :)
Yes it has a backlit keyboard & touch screen, Backlit keyboard really makes a difference at nigth. Love the touch screen and windows 8 was not that hard to get use to. Highly recommend this labtop.
No it does not have a disc drive.
The speakers are nothing to write home about. You want to get an external set of speakers to get any kind of sound quality but the soundcard is okay!
Practically any power inverter will power this laptop. http://www.amazon.com/Kinivo-CCA150-Power-Inverter-Charging/dp/B008YMUQI2/ref=sr_1_28?ie=UTF8&qid=1389488568&sr=8-28&keywords=power+inverter
You would have to out it on it manually, but yes it should. I don't know for sure, since I haven't reset it with Fedora, but Ubuntu runs fine on my very similliar laptop. There is always a few bugs, like mine, currently, there is something wrong with the RAM, but it still works on Windows 8.1. So, since Linux has it's glitches, Dual-Boot it, so that you have a back up OS
Hi Ralph, it doesn't come with Microsoft Office.
It has one Micro USB port. You can use a Micro USB to regular USB to connect a flash drive.
I had 11GB left on the 32GB model, but after updating to Windows 8.1 Preview I had nearly 14.4GB remaining.
sorry, don't know the answer it's the Vaio Pro 13 with windows 8
Hi Glenn B., this Sony SVP13215PXB has an approximate weight of 2.34 lbs. (with Internal Battery). -Ely
Sorry I do not use this Sony VAIO SVL24147CXB for wall mount, I am not sure that you could mount it to the wall unless you have any bracket adaptor instead off original stand, there are 5 or 6 screws to remove the original stand. I have own two of this kind and they are work great I regrets that SONY don't make them anymore.
Yes they will work with HTC EVO 4
No, these are hard keys.
The tuner will not automatically power up when power is restored. You must must press power button. The unit does remember what channel was watched before power loss.
The item uses 8 D size batteries
It should considering all Garmin items are ANT+ compatible
Example?
Yes, they are listed on Synology's website as being compatible. https://www.synology.com/en-us/support/hd/model/DS1513+
you can email me after you place the order, so I know what color do you like.
Yes it does! I have 2014 carbon x1. it works!
Router via Ethernet. CAT5 is plenty.
Yes. You download it to your iPad or other device through GenieGo and you will be able to watch it for 30 days or until you delete it from your DIRECTV receiver (whichever comes sooner).
Seriously? Do you not realize how many people make or lose more in an hour than what this TV costs? If you had purchased 100 shares of Amazon in May, 1997 (for about $1785) then you'd have the money for this TV now. So what did you spend the $1785 on that was so important? Would it really have been so hard to save that much up? If not, then why are you even shopping for this? Sheesh! Why do so many people refuse to be rich these days?
The Q10 requires a MICRO Simcard. If you have a regular size SIM card, you need to get a new one. Some people manage to cut them off, but you need to know what you are doing..
Yes charger is included
Nikita which seller did you bought it from? The satellite receiver is different from the cable receiver. You bought it for use in the caribbean? If so u need The cable receiver
For your older computer, you may need 2 open USB Ports to provide enough power. Fortunately the monitor comes with a cable with 2 USB connectors - and USB 2.0 Ports work just fine.
My 64GB Sandisk Ultra cards work great in this unit.
Yes it will. It's a great addition to the system. I use it way more than the tele.
You can, but you lose the wide angle effect.
No, there is a headphone jack in the back that you can plug small speakers into if they have the right plug-in.
hello i am from Venezuela and i have one , it runs good this tablet, it's ok, this mark and company they are very good and great
I don't have kindle fire, works fine with nexius 7.
I'm guessing it would (italicize guessing). However, I wouldn't get this one. It wasn't put together very well from the onset and falls apart (separates and batteries fall out) periodically. I did, however, get this one....and like it. http://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F33YALY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Yes
Hi Sue, It has 5 Watts x 2 total of 10 Watts. Thanks. &gt;Joffrey
Yes
Yes, supports 4th generation Intel processors. See http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/motherboards/desktop-motherboards/desktop-board-dh87mc.html
Yes
Yes.
110 v
Has to be flat
Hello, thank you for your interest in our products. Yes, this style tripod stand also doubles as a light stand. Best, iShot Products Inc.
It says 5-10" tablet with or without case
The Oly 45mm 1.8 is a great lens, great for portraits. As far as the 60mm being too long for portraits, I hear a lot of people use the Oly 75mm for portaits as well. In any event, the Sigma 60mm is really a great lens for the money; Sigma's website lists it as a portrait lens (for what it's worth).
Hi Jose, yes, the camera will fit perfectly inside this case. Thanks_Mitch
MicroSD
I'm sorry I didn't have mine long enough to even feel a need for a security code. Just call Amazon. The guys and girls that work in there will have it figured out before you would even have the time to read the manual. My advise sorry, Amazon put it back in the box and send it to where it came from. lol. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year...
I am by no means a proffesional photographer and I have not had a chance to use this kit much. But the little amount of usage that I have got out of it , I would have to say it has served my purpose and I am satisfied with this purchase.
Yes, it is standart
Yes. First attach the adapter tube to the camera using this hex tool. The Mac wide angle lens screws into the tube.
yes, can be used. I also buy this item for macro. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JOG3AC/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Kit Does NOT Include Lenses
It's all there. Not sure how any of it will help with the moon, however. All of it attaches around the lens on the camera with a set screw. Get her a small tripod.
No, it is not a lens. It is a mount for adding filters, etc. to the camera, a sun shade and a few filters.
is around 2 lb , and it came in a UPS bag, but if you put them all together is approximately 7" x 7" x 4.5".
No, it does not, but for an inexpensive starter kit, it is fairly well inclusive and should meet your needs.
I can not answer exact length as it is plugged into the side of tv and goes around behind cabinet. Not sure how helpful this will be, but I spread my fingers, middle to thumb (10 inches) and counted up to 10 before it was not accessible, had maybe another 3-4 lengths to go. So would say at least 6 feet. Sorry this is girl way of measuring since I cant reach the entire length.
yes
no you cannot
Don't know but I would check with Samsung technical support because it may not be the battery. If you registered your purchase they are likely to help you out.
Yes. Has both Works well too.
This unit does include a built-in webcam.
I did not get one with mines ... I had to install one on it.
NO
Yes it does
Yes, it is. The S200e, X202e, and Q200e are all the same computer, with slight processor or bluetooth differences.
No
Weighs between 1/2lb and 1lb, I would guess.. it isn't really noticeable
It can. If you go to memory manufacturer Crucial's website, and use the memory advisor tool, select dell 17R 7720, and it says you can upgrade to 16GB. Remember you only have two slots, so it would have to be 2 x 8GB memory sticks.
They sold two models of the 17R SE. One 3d, one without 3d. When I purchased it, I had the option of either one, but chose the non-3d version.
hi friend, it is a front panel touch screen for Acer iconia tab A200,not for a camera.thanks
If the receiver has terminals that accept flying/free leads from the speaker wire, it will work
No But it has a free slot for inserting an SSD. The other slot comes with a great hdd from western digital..
All works well, although the charging is finicky. Sometimes it won't charge and we don't know why. Otherwise this is a great tablet
You can using the search tool to find the ip camera ip address and view live by a web Browser or others software,
Dahua NVR works good with these camera
They don't seem to be on the list.
It's lower......1066Mhz. It's a great laptop that I'd recommend anyone to buy! I bought mine refurb'd and totally enjoy it everyday. I downloaded the Windows 7 GUI because the Windows 8 GUI drives me nuts, but the OS is still Windows 8. Hope this helps
It might be a little tight for all of that. Fine for camera and lens for sure. Depends on the size of the wallet. I think I would go one size bigger to be sure.
yes, two independent distance & volume setups.
Once you used the bi-amp feature, the total available channels will be 2 less. Yes, it will be limited to 7.1 only.
First, The drives are sata. Second, The drives do not have to be the same size if you are not mirroring them (RAID 1). The drives can be setup as individual drives or as combined drives ( Drive 1 = 500 GB, Drive 2 = 1000 GB. Combined drive 1500 GB).
Should work on any Bluetooth device. But you would still have to answer your cellphone first.
This unit includes a 500W power supply. Standard cooling system for Intel Quad-core i7-4770.
No. Only up to gen 4 retina.
Yes
I dont know. Mine is a macbook air from 2013.
I would not delete the drive. I would remove it and date that it was used for backing up until a certain date. I would then set up the new drive with time machine. FYI, I keep one external drive for my photos etc. and a different drive for time machine. My time machine drive backs up my computer and the external drive of my photos. Hope that helps.
Simply format the drive after you connect it to your PC. Right click on computer and select manage. Then click disk management. Right click on drive partition and delete partition, then right click again and make new primary partition. Takes less than 30 second
Yes, I'm not sure why it isn't shown in the pictures but in the back of the tablet is a little insert to hold the stylus pen. Hope this helps!
Yes. I installed this under my 12" kitchen cabinets, but my tv is 19". It looks great and swivels great. Mine however will not fold up because my tv is too big, yours should work great.
Yes, it will work in that configuration
Unfortunately not
Yes (3.5mm Stereo minijack)
yes
Yes this is a Haswell chip. And the 'K' means it's unlocked.
Not all seller offer international shipping. so you have to see which seller offer international shipping. choose that. thanks.
No, it is a pc processor, you need a notebook processor that fit on tour laptop
not when you cant spell POWERFUL
K can be overclocked.
No.
No it will not It will cover the Speaker section and some of the plugs. (Like power receptacle)
Yes it does.
I am sorry it's to long ago since I paired it. But I just followed the instruction. Can you se that Bluetooth is enabled on the PC?
Needs a 12V power adapter, standard security camera stuff I believe....
I plugged mine into a bigger screen!
honestly i have no idea, probably any generic kind though because it is low quality. i bought this item then had to return it
As long as the radio has the two prong plug
Johnnie, I believe this should work for your BPR40. The connector chart here (http://www.planetheadset.com/radio-connector-chart.php) seems to indicate the BPR40 uses a Motorola M1 connector like my DTR radios and it worked with my DTRs. Tracy
Yes
It's compatible with MacBook Pro and MacBook Air series.
Generally, all my system problems seem to originate from my internet provider. Hard to find any faults with the Extreme II; except I thought a solid state drive would be a faster on the boot up. Speed has increased but not to my expectations. At least the reliability of a solid state drive is an important gain.
It would work but it would need to be formatted to Mac OS X Extended (Journaled) in order for it to work properly. Also, make sure to watch a video showing how to replace the hard drive before doing it. The last thing you need is to mess up your macbook in the process. Hope I helped you!
why would it not... as long as dimensions are there
No. The drives that go into Mac minis, the recent ones anyway, are 9mm. These drives are almost twice that, at 15mm. I think they may have been designed for custom enclosures or something, because they are much too thick for standard 2.5" drive applications.
The caddy itself is pretty shallow and designed to fit normal sized hard drives. Normal being around 10mm. The 2 TB version of this drive is 15mm is significantly taller. I do not think just as is it will fit however depending on if you feel like modifying the caddy You could make it fit. GL
This mount works perfect with my Benq 1070
Yes you can there is a Mode button.
Mine has square pixels but sharpness is good but I play mine out side on side of barn at full 300 picture is great and monitor use pic is gteat to
No you can't, but you can plug a roku into the HDMI and plug the USB drive into it and watch it that way
No
do not use, it uses only batteries of type NFP 970.950 and etc..
2 Hours
No. Bose does not work with any other system
It says it can and I don't see why it wouldn't. I've used a flash card before and that worked. The wifi is the tricky part.
I don't know the decibel ratings but I did recognize the fan got more quiet in eco mode. In normal mode, you can barely hear it 14 feet away and eco mode I'm standing about 9 feet away before I start to even slightly hear it. Keep in mind the brightness dims in eco-mode too. Either way, its pretty quiet compared to most other projectors I've used.
Initially it worked for me, but now it won't. I would plug my phone in to charge while also using the aux input from my phone to listen to streaming radio through the speakers. Now it stopped registering that i have plugged in the USB to get power to the phone. I tried a different USB cable and it worked at first, but the next morning when I tried again that cable wouldnt work either!! what the.. Luckily the cables still work with other outlets so the iHome did not kill the cable.
No, I play the radio without the iPod or iPhone connected.
Hey there. Yes, the information will be sent back and forth flawlessly. Some cameras state the f-stop in odd numbers, but it is actually the proper f-stop. Be Aware! I got this and ended up getting the Mark III instead of the Mark IV and neither Amazon or Adorama will respond to me to rectify this. The adapter is fantastic, but get it from another source.
It should work fine, the A6000 is still an e mount lens, correct?
Of course. It's a standard power supply, and it's only a few MM bigger then an 850 watt unit. It has 4 native gpu hook ups.
Yes
Can't say for certain without looking at the power requirements but it's working great on my SOLO (SB260-100). A search of Slingbox.com reveals that the replacement SOLO PSU is NOT compatible with the TUNER. http://www.slingbox.com/go/buy-replacement-parts I think you should be looking for a 6V 2-2.4A PSU. Try: http://www.amazon.com/HQRP-Hon-Kwang-HK-A112-A06-SB100-100-SB200-100/dp/B00CX00IVG
It's 5'
not sure what you mean; I am not aware of any software update for Zeiss lenses. This works fine on my Sony a6000.
No, it works on 2.4Ghz , your phones are Ok
Hi there, This video camera recorder takes micro SD cards. And yes, it supports up to 32GB - in best quality its about 5-6 hours of recording. Here is a link to one of them: http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Digital-microSDHC-SDC4-32GB/dp/B0046XAROG/ref=sr_1_8?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1382826776&sr=1-8&keywords=tf+card Regards, Tom
It is made in Italy.
Yes it comes with the charger
There are multiple versions of screens on this Product Line. There is a matte version which is Full HD IPS but is not a touch screen. My model has a gloss screen, but not overly so. It too is Full HD IPS but supports touch which was key for me in making the move to Windows 8. AFAIK, Amazon is selling the Glossy/Touch version.
I've had no complaints about that. Maybe update the drivers.
Nvidia G740 Graphics. It says in description. It is meant for gaming.
Yes. It comes with Windows 8. One of the first things you will want to do is to update it 8.1 which is done in the Windows store after an initial update.
the keyboard is.. a keyboard. so, not really sure what you mean by functioning easy touch. the F and J keys have little nobs on them like any other. Yes their is an HDMI port.
Yes it is!
Yes, it has an SSD card slot. I am sure that it will support an mSata SSD card.
No.
Nope
No - so you cannot take advantage of the Windows 8 touch-screen functionalities on this laptop
1.8 GHz
No, keyboard is not backlit, but when you open it the screen gives off enough light to see the keyboard.
Not that I know of and as an owner, I can tell you that there is absolutely nothing in the specs for this computer about "WiDi".
I'm an Engineering Student at GVSU and use this laptop for many programs including Microsoft office. So far, the only downside to this laptop is the touch-pad. As far as everything else, I couldnt be happier with the ASUS G750. The graphics and gaming speed are exceptional. Hopefully this helps you out.
As far as I can remember, it does NOT come with a mouse or laptop bag. It does come with its power supply, and I think that's it.
There are Internal speakers and although I haven't really used them to their full potential--I really just watch YouTube videos--they sound great to me! I really love this laptop so much! Really nothing negative to say.
There is no optical drive
I always have my computer on top of a book so that the fans can keep the computer cool. So, I don't notice any muffling. The sound is pretty good.
In order to install Windows 7, the HD would need to be reformatted. Then you would need to purchase a copy of Windows 7. Installing an SSD drive and RAM is relatively simple.
My G750JX-DB71 has an 8x Super-Multi DVD. The only specs I've seen on the ASUS website weren't actually model specific specs, but a listing of the various hardware options across the G750 product line. Take a look at the ASUS specs again and you'll see that the Optical Drive section lists 3 different drive types (Blu-Ray DVD Combo, Super-Multi DVD, Blu-Ray Writer). The folks at ASUS really need to do something with their website and support info - it just plain sucks.
It's 15.6 inches.
I like the product it's everything I need works great nice
It is genuine leather.
I'm sure it is possible. I just put windows 8.1 on mine a few days ago. Keep in mind you will need to buy windows 7.
For pictures it will only show already taken photo's in other words you cannot frame your shot on the tv screen and then take the picture. Video, on the other hand, will display live on the TV screen.
Color in daylight. Black and white in night mode
I think it means the lid for the turntable case. It's attached to the turntable by hinges like a suitcase. You open it to play the record, but you don't remove it.
No, it will play any vinyl. Old or new. Vinyl is vinyl. The player can't tell the difference.
It comes with a 32gb micro sd card, the sony memory stick pro duo adapter, usb adapter and a full sized sd adapter only
Yes. But I do seem to have issues with the memory card not reading sometimes.
No you have to push record each time
I want to hear the voice recordings and I can only see.video
Yes you can connect to internet with your any smartphone, yes Q-see has an App, shipping will come from manufacture , yes we have 1 day shipping available see shipping calculations .Thank you
Sorry I don't know about Africa. Try the company itself. Call q-see
Not that I have seen. The memory cards that you can use are nothing more than storage space. They will not affect the performance of the tablet that I have seen thus far.
Yes. Comes in the box.
Yep just like any other one but cheaper and it comes with a keyboard too
I can easily login to Wifi with my Kocasco tablet. I've used it at hotels, restaurants, libraries, and other places. Its very easy to use.
There is an right arrow key on the keyboard.
I've answered this before. Yes, two of them make adjustments, the third selects source.
You can hook 2 cameras but I don't think there is an easy way to switch. No buttons easily accessible. I only use one camera but am sure 1 probably has priority over the other.
Yes
It works on my 3100. I assume it would work on the 3000, but I do not know.
You don't need a charger as it comes with an attached usb thingy that you can insert into your computer and charge it from there. The usb thingy is slotted into the cameera strap. You just pull it out gently. Hope this helps.
Yes, this kit comes with several goodies.
I feel the volume is just fine on its own. But bass will lack by itself. Paired with another and it will sound great.
I DON'T REALY KNOW.
Full size
Think so--yes. Was supposed to be able to work in China, though not actually tried.
Yes, but you may have to configure the POE switch for always on operation for that port since your non-POE access points can't perform 802.3af negotiation.
about three feet
It's an antenna, not a radio. Meaning you have to attach it to an 802.11bgn radio WITH the proper connectors to make it work.
Yes you can
preguntas si compre 1 o 2 monitores?
To be honest I didn't have a great gaming experience on it try a benq
You need one of these to use a macbook with this monitor http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Mini-DisplayPort-Adapter-MB572Z/dp/B009K916ZK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1415068448&sr=8-1&keywords=macbook+air+monitor+adapter
As long as the monitor connection works. There are a couple of different ones. Not all work
This doesnt include sound so what i did is bought an av audio cable plugged the the audio jack to my pc, the red and white on the back of the tv, but in your case you should plug them in your home theater.
Yes
No you can not add an extra gigabit nic.
4 th
it is not installed.
yes
No, had to install it
I believe so as I do not have a retina display ipad mini and it works fine.
It is made for an iPad so it really depends in the type of tablet.
NO.
No it does not. Wacom products work exclusively with wacom products of the same make (intuos3 pen works for the 3 tablet, 4 for 4, etc)
Yes, you can. If your Windows 8 has been activated, just go to Windows Store on the Front Page. Uploading the 3,2 Gb file will take about 30 minutes plus another 30 minutes spent on ''installation'' while rebooting several times...But it's Free...!!!
Ill be honest with you, the processor is great but i still cant find the way to put it into the new Dual Graphics System (Graphics Card +Gpu from APU) but i got 2 r9 270x in crossfire so i dont need it very much. But answering your question about if getting or not an A10 APU ill tell you, go for a FX instead, because if you got a graphics card dedicated you wont need the Apu GPU at all...
Go to the manufacturer website for a list of compatible MB's. I got an MSI MB. Gigabyte makes a good one too.
In reality, it's variable according to whatever load it's under. If you buy this, you'll need a matching motherboard and ram. Good news though, It uses less energy than most previously produced CPUs. If you already have the particular Motherboard this needs, your power supply will work.
It could run relatively new games in 720p, with medium graphics. I've played the last Tomb Raider and Batman: Arkham City, and it keeps FPS between 20-40, rarely dropping from 20. For me is more than OK for causal gaming. In light-graphics games (like FIFA14 or GTAIV) it goes smooth all the time.
I've had great success with adobe Photoshop with this cpu at its standard 3.5 ghz. Can pushed to 4.1ghz if you need it to
Any FM2 board will do but I suggest a hight end board, I've been using the Gigabyte GA-F2A85X-UP4 since last year and it's great, however, any high end board will work. As to the graphics that's your choice, you may want to read a profesional review from Anandtech.com or Tom's Hardware to understand the differences and make an informed choice depending on the use. Have fun!
No it can't, the A6-4400M has socket FS1r2, and it is a mobile processor (likely inside a laptop), and the A10-6800k is desktop, socket FM2.
Im not sure about payday 2 but i am able to run any game i have played so far with this processor. Games include Skyrim, League, Dark Souls 2, Natural Selection, StarCraft ll and others like that.
You have to find out the socket. this one is a FM2 socket. so i can't tell you yes or no.
No. I tried doing that and found the bed or couch is not solid enough to hold everything steady while using the tablet.
Hi, We don't carry that size, but we can definitely cut it for you! Please go on our website, and go to contact us, and email us through there the size you'd like so I can get you a quote. Thank you, Leslie
the one i received have no slanted edges
It has a small dial for adjustments; the volume range is terrific. I watch TV shows on-line and can turn it up to hear in the kitchen when I cook. Am so happy with the performance and small size. Have used it for presentations. Great, I didn't ex[ect much for the price, am very happy with it! Hope this helps!
no
It will project from a laptop through the VGA input. I will say, non-HDMI inputs aren't crystal clear on this projector, sometimes can be fuzzy. If you have a computer that can output via HDMI (maybe you'd need an adapter of some kind), it would be a lot clearer. That said, I think it's a good projector for the money. But I do see the resolution suffer on non-HDMI 1080p sources.
It uses an LED lamp, so it should last upwards of 50,000 hours. You probably won't ever have to replace it; at 4 hours of use every day it will last you over 30 years.
I don't think so and here's why. The point of this adapter is to take Full Frame lenses and compress the image down to a cropped sensor camera. For example, I am using this on my Sony FS700 (cropped sensor) with a Canon 24 - 105 F4 (full frame) lens. The lens is not cropped because of the metabones adapter reducing the image. You could use a different adapter to go from Canon to Sony. I would guess a much cheaper one also.
I've not had that problem! Stands up like it should for me!
Yes it does and it works quite well.
yes, it has two hot swapping hard drives (you don't have to power down the pc to have them recognized after plugging them in) and yes to the reader.
The HDMI port on this system is for input, such as connecting a game console and using the computer as a monitor. This system does not have a video out port to connect a second monitor.
For the Acer Aspire specifically, as Floyd said, there are no mounting holes on the back. There is an indention in the middle for a hand grip to move the machine. The kickstand is attached and I would assume would be bulky to place against the wall. Also, some of the ports are located in the back making access difficult if it is wall mounted. There may be some AIO's that support wall mounting, this one does not.
At least two. Could be four depending on the chip you purchased. If you will check the original shipping list that came with your machine, unless it says quad core. you only have two.
Yes it does
Mine had some issues right out of the box, so I returned it. I can't honestly answer your question.
Yes, most external optical drives are USB driven, it's as simple as plugging it in and downloading any needed software.
We have had ours for about a month, and so far it stays cool to the touch even being used on the lap for hours.
CAN I GET WINDOWS 7. I don't want windows 8 I want 7
120/240 VAC,but default it IS 120VAC,
32GB
the same mount you put your tv on you can put your computer on it go to best buy and they will help you with the type of mount you will need.
That is what I would like to know.
The Lenovo H520 has the following slots: 1.0 (total) / 0.0 (free) x DIMM 240-pin - Half-length, low-profile, 1.0 (total) / 0.0 (free) x CPU - Half-length, low-profile, 2.0 (total) / 1.0 (free) x PCIe 2.0 x1, 1.0 (total) / 0.0 (free) x PCIe 2.0 x16
No they are not
It's a glossy finish. Very nice
I measured my stand and the height without the wheels is 1-1/4" (from bottom of standoff where the wheels screw in to the top of the legs). With the wheels installed, the height is 4-5/8". The wheels can easily be removed with a simple wrench. They are screwed into the bottom of the stand.
You should be able to, but it will have to be bolted vertically--won't pivot horizontal/vertical.
When the car is moving, it is hard to read the license plate clearly. If the car stops at a traffic light, the license plate is clear as crystal in the recorded video.
It really depends on the focal length of your lens. What type of lens do you have?
it should, but it will be down-clocked to from 1600mhz to 1333mhz, you might be able to save money hunting from ram at the lower clock speed though, for example: http://www.amazon.com/HP-DDR3-SDRAM-Memory-Module/dp/B0030L3B8E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1426476552&sr=8-1&keywords=4gb+ddr3l+laptop+ram+1333+mhz
Yes, 4 GB 1600 MHz DDR3L SDRAM is right type of memory to fit into this system.
SORRY,NO...
I am not computer technically literate enough to know if my answer is what you need, but I believe that it does. I plugged it in, turned it on, and it found my wireless network at home, and after confirming the network name and password I was able to be online wirelessly within minutes. Hope that helps.
I haven't noticed noise coming from the processor, though the keyboard is a bit noisy. Randomly, I will say that the battery life is not great, but I don't mind too much since it does charge quickly. Maybe 3 hours battery life, longer if you're just using loaded applications instead of Internet.
I bought a wireless mouse to control it. Its like a mini computer.
Yep that's what I'm using it on
I dont know. Its a really great product, works precisely as it advertises, is very useful and certainly deserves more buzz.
Your Alpine unit should plug in direct to the amp. I did not need any additional wiring.
I would seriously doubt it. The unit gets it's power from the same wire as the head unit. The factory radio power wire in most any vehicle would not be able to handle that load. As far as if it would hurt the amps to be ran inline, I would call alpine support and ask, but I would think it not to be a good idea.
The max is a 32 gig SD card.
In theory it should, but all I can say is that so far it works in our apartment with out wireless connection very good
Yes
Yes. I have a wall coupler and several 90deg adapters in use with this.
I wouldn't rec plugging anything in. I returned immediately. Didn't work
it does not.
Sorry that you feel that way. The picture is of a new item, not used. We don't aim to deceive or misrepresent .
YES. PERFECT
The Quartz 4 Manual [Download from Dyconn website] is pretty clear that if a RAID setup drive becomes damaged, the drive bay needs to be shut off before replacing the damaged drive with a new one.
yes I think so
No, there weren't any instructions, but there are a whole multitude of you tube videos out there detailing the job. Make sure you find one for the specific model of IPad that you have because they are all a little different.
My guess would be vinyl. It is not fabric and it is light weight, which I'm pleased with.
This model has 1366x768 resolution.
Yes
I'm sorry but I really don't know.
Can't say if it will or not....mine is a Satellite L505-S5990....had it since 2007. If you can't find answer online, the guys at Staples or Best Buy will look it up for you.
Yes. We ship anywhere in the world. Shipping charges are determined when you place your order through Amazon.
Yes, it fits the Mini Retina. However, with my Mini Retina, I've had an issue with it not putting the mini to sleep. I have to power down the mini, otherwise the battery runs down.
No. The cover attaches like the smart cover from Apple but you have to detach the iPad from the hinge and put it in a slot in the cover (thats where it is in the item photo) for it to sit vertically. There is no angle adjustment
No
Definite yes. It is that type of applications the thing was built for. It's when you want it to start doing multiple things across multiple devices is when things start getting tricky, as I am figuring out. If it's a TV with HDMI, it will work.
yes. used it for over a year with very little wear.
Yes
Yes
This is an awful device and does not work. Has not worked ever since i ordered it. Thank G-d for $30 price tag. Buy an original, its worth it.
yes, for some software, there is Spanish version.
With a little know how and Linux, YES. http://www.anandtech.com/show/8399/recovering-data-from-a-failed-synology-nas
According to the EyeFi website (which doesn't make it super obvious how to get the information), it works great on that camera: http://support.eye.fi/cameras/canon/powershot_a2500
Check the Eye- fi site fir compatibility list.
Yes
Yes.
Yes, it does has built-in stereo speakers.
I bought a brand-new one So it came with The Dell warranty and was in pristine condition.
Yes, it comes with a built in camera.
Dear Customer, Yes. You may purchase extended warranty from Dell Thank you Customer Service
Mine came with 64 bit and I increased it to 8GB. Made it very fast
This tablet was a piece of junk and I took it back and got my money back.
I bought it and i dont care about warranty
i5
Hello, You would need to remove 4GB Module and install 2 Modules 8GB each. Best regards, Amuras
Yes, the legacy ps/2 connection is the only one of its sort for peripherals, all others are usb.
Yes, the drivers are built-in and it deploys with ease. Great camera and a modest upgrade from the 920
yes
Then buy Sata III cables.......
Yes you may, however, you will have low fps especially under graphically intensive content
This product is ONLY useful for making panoramas with the camera in the vertical or "portrait" orientation. It will work with any camera that has a standard tripod receptacle which I believe your camera has. It is good for its intended purpose. However, it has very limited utility and a standard ball head will be more practical for most photographers.
Yes it works with 10.7.5 but you have to use the CD to install it.
Yes. I have had this system for almost a year now and I still love it. Amazing sound and the gigs bass is awesome
I got four games. Tomb raider. Far cry blood dragon. Crysis 3. BioShock infinite.
Hi Barb, I never had a Tom Tom but the dementions should be on the product descriptions. We can keep our Garmin plugged into the charger while using it. Hope this helps you a bit. We are quite happy with our Hippo
yes i will, it didnt fit mine because my computer is 13 inches n i didnt see . Do u know if they have 13 inch covers like this one?
It should, I think all ASUS' that are x2** models are considered ultrabooks and this case is designed for ASUS ultrabooks
The case or somewhat ridged so it wouldn't offer a lot of protection from a fall
Angel, I currently do not know about if the Stock flash will run it, I currently am running a Finnless rom on it and can say that it does support it.
Yes, or if you plug it into your televisions usb it will power on and off with the television
yes, you can use a Micro sd card for more memory.Happy Shopping!
Yes,Olympus E-PM1 is micro 4/3, I use the Len on Olympus OME EM5 It's working good. You can use this Len on all Lumix G and Olympus micro 4/3, I have Lumix G2,GF2,GX1 working fine with this Len.
Sorry, I don't know.
Yes,it is, this Len is a newer version and it should be working very well with new GH3
Dear Robert. This does not have POE constructed, it only has the necessary lines to adapt a POE module. Basically this is a regular Ethernet shield like the rest you've seen only cheaper.
A small screwdriver will be fine.
2 slots, 8GB X 2 max memory. 4GBX 2 installed.
Yes this model is the one that has the QHD screen. I can confirm my max resolution is 2560x1440.
is not as fast but has good performance if not overload programs.
Hello, The screen resolution for this model is 1920 X 1080. There wa typo in our listing and we are correcting it now. You will receive the Full HD model. Thank you, Jesse
Simple answer is no. Also importantly does not have a back camera
yes
If it has hdmi cable then yes, if your second is using dvi or vga input then you need the adapter for the hdmi.
Just got a second one at that price, you have to stay on Amazon looking for vendors.
yes, two cards one bluray burner
Not sure I understand the question. The screen looks like any other I have used. The material around the screen is shiny but the screen itself is matte.....
Voltage 110 to 240v
Yes. It has a wireless keyboard and mouse.
No there isnt. If you are on a coffee table your Skype partner can hardly see your face. It was a good idea then, I wouldnt buy today. Nice ultrabook with unresolved wifi problem.
Windows 8
Mine did.
Metal what? It's a laptop everything is plastic.
no nothing is included
Excellent ... My son uses this computer for games (as well as school:) and the graphics are fabulous!!
Agree with peter p
Yes there are windows 8 drivers for this card.
I don't see why not! I don't use the operating system, but my understanding of Ubuntu is that it is less demanding on system resources. If your are a Amazon prime member, I would suggest you give it a try. If it doesn't perform the only money you will be out is the return shipping cost.
No it does not.
the warrantee is 1 year parts and labor
It looks glossy when it's off but I haven't had any reflective issues. I still love this machine and haven't found any cons about it!
I assume you mean Windows 32-bit or 64-bit. It's 64-bit.
There is no card slot
This unit uses Windows 8. It is on the current version of Direct X. Direct X software updates are backwards compatible with version X9.
5ms. It's standard.
All outputs are 1/8" (3.5mm) (camera,line & headphone) but you could use an adapter or use a 1/4" to 1/8" cable (might need to be custom).
This has only VGA, no DVI or HDMI. I did not keep the computer as my needs required DVI in addition to VGA. While the picture plainly shows this, the unit does not have it. Extensive discussions with the company about adding on the option were fruitless.
Yes, there is a micro hdmi port for watching video. You will need micro hdmi to hdmi cable. There are 2 separate ports on a tablet: micro usb for charging and connecting to computer and micro hdmi for connecting to TV.
I have never done so but I think so; especially for music once you have internet access or you can play it from a USB flash drive or sd card
I never really thought about it so I just browsed to si.com and looked at a page with lots of graphics. It's hard to measure, maybe a tenth of a second or two. I would say it's pretty quick but not instantaneous. It is definitely faster than the first gen iPad I replaced.
Yes Larry, i bought mine about 3 mnths ago, has a dvd/cd writer/player drive. Definitely a good bang for the buck in my opinion.
no the kindle would not accept the series type connecter
It works on my iPhone 5 with iOS 7. It should work with no problem on a 5s.
Yes
Yes, it retailed for over $2100 a month ago. The price dropped because the manufacturer discontinued this model.
I honestly don't know. I had a problem with the receiver and returned it. Got a Denon.
No, it is not. Not unless it has been custom fitted with an touch screen overlay.
that is not true.. the ME089 has this spec. That is the standard Apple Part #
Underneath, at the outer far edge.
If you have a standard USB port, then the answer is yes they will fit a Mac.
Yes.
Ended up in the garbage.
Hi Tony E., this Sony LBTGPX77 supports connection via Bluetooth. It uses Bluetooth ver 3.0 and has a frequency band of 2.4 GHz. Compatible profiles are A2DP and AVRCP. You may check the specification of your iphone 5s or macbook if it supports this kind of specs. -Ely
Don't have an iPhone but speaker works well except for the charging port. You must be careful or it will tweak it and it won't charge. In a boat the speaker works well with no problems. Phone can be in the glove box or buy a waterproof case for it if you're concerned about moisture in your phone
I had it running fairly constantly with my portable Passport for about 4 hrs and it used about 3/4 of the charge...so between 5-6 hrs would be my guess.
it does not
An educated guess would be 8"3".5"
Hello Kim, yes that will work but you need to use the original Nintendo cable. And please make sure you dont need the 12V output of our battery or your Nintendo will be damaged.
Yes, it charges ASUS TF700.
I looked up the specs on the ASUS Memo 10.1, it has micro usb with Android at the ASUS website. It should work. I have Nexus 7 android and worked without installing any additional software. I liked that the USB didn't stick out like other cables do. I first bought the OTG cable, but then bought this too; like this one better, more convenient. Hope this helps.
I believe it will, so long as it is otg capable as I have connected a wireless mouse to both my Galaxy Note 3 and my Dell Venue Pro 8. I have also used it to connect a wired keyboard to both.
No, it comes fully build, but it is easy into in case you wish to "adjust" it. Just have small hands if you do.
don't buy this desktop. there's your answer
Yes, it's a desktop made with components you could buy individually on sites such as amazon, so it should be just as upgrade-able as any other.
The power supply I was provided is a standard NEMA 1-15R (Standard two pin U.S. polarized).
The Phillips Bluetooth adapter outputs a "line level" signal meant to act as the input to an amplifier. The Phillips unit will NOT drive speakers directly without the aid of an amplifier. I connect the output of the Phillips unit to the "Aux" input of my surround sound system. Works great! Good luck. John Kerwin
I have not noticed any lag with mine it works really well. No issues so far.
It requires a power supply
No
Yes, they are.
3
3 side mounted hdmi ports on the 5710.
dont get it. especially from amazon.
Have two of them both work fine
Don't know, worked for my 7 inch Rocketfish tablet
No keyboard
It fits with the regular back that came on it.
No It will not fit
You sure can! I'm really pleased with it.
It looks like this armband is available for several different devices, the iPod 5th being one of them. I bought mine for the Samsung S3.
With the AirStash+ app you can stream music on the AirStash to your iPhone. (available for Android as well) It will play the songs in 1 folder on the device (not playlists). Other apps can work with the AirStash, too. You need to check to see if they have WebDAV, which is supported by the AirStash.
CR 2025 3V
At the bottom of ipearl site it has a list of computers, check your model number located on your battery pack, there is also an image on ipearl to show you where to look. You can also try a skin sticker if ipearl is not compatible.
yes it would probably work as long as it has a USB in it but it will take you at least 3000 or 5000 cranks. it's really a piece of crap just buy extra batteries
Im sure there are other apps out there but I play my files from my NAS using XBMC. The only ones I have problem with are 1080p 3D movies and I think thats more of the A100 itself and not so much XBMC.
Not with kdlinks a100. There seems to be an issue with the DRM. I tried and it will give an error. Have you tried/looked into Google Chromecast. That will stream Playstore, Netflix, Youtube, and Hulu.
No , you need to buy a box with kodi already have been installed on it or a box that is more upgrade.
Currently... My laptop is in the shop being repaired. Once I get it back and try out the case. I'll let you know
1080p Matt screen.
The trackpad works similarly, but there's no side scroll wheel function I can find. It does have the neat feature of press-down 'button' area at the lower (closest to you) edge of the pad. It clicks and gives feedback. Otherwise it seems to function as any other trackpad.
Yes. I installed one. There's a slot to add a second HDD but it would just put SSD in it.
Hello, Probably, you can't mount it on an arm. Please check Samsung' product page: http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/pcs/DP700A7D-X01US-features Best regards, A.Umansky
I wouldn't trust an unidentified .exe file from some country in China.
I think these would be characterized as "On The Ear". While they are very good headphones (and the only Bluetooth 4) they do have a fairly strong "spring" effect on the head. Some people have complained about that. It makes for a firm fit on the head and that makes them almost as sound proofed as Over-The-Ear models. Hope this helps.
This actually charges my iPod. I keep an iPod touch in the glove box at all times. It charges and plays music and videos. I would have to say, I 'think' that it will charge your phone, but not 100%. It DOES charge my iPod, so I assume that it will but not 100%.

I am using a PC but The User Manual has instructions for Web viewing on PC and Macs, so it should work. Viewing the DVR recording directly does not require a computer, only a monitor. I found the User Manual by Googling online.
No, it only had the front-facing camera.
yes it does
The adapter is 19V DC
Yes. I use Pandora on my android phone.
It has a 110v only. They may sell 240v separately though
Have no clue about what you are talking.
I bought an extra extension of 60ft, yes you can get as many as you'd like!
This cable is a tad bit thicker than most charges,( nothing too big. And no it does not coil, the cable itself is straight. I really like it for my galaxy s4.
It sits at rest at 5 9/16" and streatches to 8 1/4"
Yes I do
No. It's a suction cup and needs hardened material to get the seal needed to stick
Yes. I have a 5s and it works fine.
Sounds like it could be a defect. Please call AudioSource for further support at (503) 914 4688.
It should work ok, but mine started to give some static popping noise even when right next to device. Died after 3 months.
Yes
It has multiple outputs (4) but depending on what you are using this card for (gaming, work, ect) you can expect performance decrease especially on newer games using multiple monitors. Running this card in SLI will be ideal for the hardcore gamer, but you could probably do ok using 2 monitors with one card.
Yes. Just be sure your motherboard supports at least a single PCI-E 3 x16 lane.
Yes, but both card must be same memory and a GTX 780. Can be different makers but it 's better to use same graphic cards.
Yes. Both headphones will receive stereo signals (left and right) if the source is in stereo. Make sure all the plugs are seated properly.
Yes it does... So you have the option of connecting to your router either wireless or hard wired.
Yes, the OS is stored on the SSD for instant on capability. Without this capability, it cannot be referred to as an ultrabook.
Hi Finlay M. I received this laptop and it is the 1.10GHZ, I do hope that you will receive the one that you are expecting.
Hello, Yes, it has HDMI port. Best regards, Amuras
Yes it is.
Have been really impressed! Had to use my laptop over the holidays with Netflix and it was more than I expected! Hope this helps with your decision....
Audio Realtek ALC892 codec High Definition Audio 2/4/5.1/7.1-channel Support for S/PDIF In/Out Works and sounds good to me.
Hard Drive is rated 128gb SSD, but in reality you'll see 104gb. And with windows 8.1 installed free memory is about 50gb.
The touch screen monitor/computer combination comes with a wireless battery operated mouse and keyboard.
Has only two HDMI Slots
Thanks for contacting us. Yes, you can listen to music without a headphone.
I am sorry, I don't know. It never stayed charged so I never even was able to see how it worked. It was returned very quickly.
Yes it does.
Yes, that is the model of the GoPro we bought and it works perfectly.
The straps are required to keep the gopro positioned right. You don't want to film your feet.
It will run anything at the highest setting with no flaws. I keep mine hooked up to my 42" LCD and I find no lag at all with this laptop.
We can ship this refurbished unit right away.
Yes there is one..left hand side above the 3.0 USB
Extremely quiet. And if you're going to use it for gaming like I am then you should get a cooling pad for it.
Micro-star international is Taiwanese motherboard maker from way back.
you should buy msata ssd, there's no sata slot inside. but l removed the CD driver to put my sata ssd inside. hope it will be helpful. :)
Yes, it has 2 mSATA SSD slots.
It lasts less than 3 hours when unplugged and doing just some browsing and watching videos online. Gaming will probably give you like 2 hours of battery life. It's important to know that the Nvidia graphics card is only used when the laptop is plugged in. While on battery, it only uses the integrated Intel graphics chip, so gaming probably won't be the same.
I do believe the warranty is one year. However, ensure you buy a laptop with the proper amount of memory you wish to get. I bought the laptop and extra memory to be added to the laptop by myself. However to access the memory slots you must remove a few screws and the back cover which renders your warranty useless. I have added a 3 years coverage as optional coverage with protection against water spills and accidental drop, I think it is worth the cost for sure. Best regards Clement
It's a non-glare screen.
It looks like it would fit, no problem. However, I can't find any information on the powersupply on the PC. It could be too weak to support this card, recommended PSU should be ~600W. If you open the case you can read it on the powersuply you have. Also, doublecheck if the size looks to fit, I don't know the size in inches, but you can simple google that or visit Gigabyte's website. (http://www.gigabyte.se/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4629#sp)
First year is international. Second year is U.S. only. Besides, first year includes accidental drop and spills. MSI has got an awesome warranty policy. The downpart is that you need to register the computer within 30 days of purchase, if not international and accidental parts of the agreement does not count. All this info is available in the warranty hand book.
I run LoL on this laptop with everything max settings and have 60fps with vertical sync easily.
No, this is the stock speeds for this CPU.
The dimensions stated by Dell correspond to the device. Those stated by Amazon correspond to the box.
Yes, I use it to transfer pictures from sd cards to my iPad 2 running on iOS 7. As soon as you plug in the adapter with the sd card, the iPad recognizes it and opens a new category opens up in the default photo app.
Yes
It is an LED light ring. It can be disabled in the BIOS, as I do because I don't like my closet glowing at night. I have another version of the ZBOX, but I assume that this one works the same way as it looks identical.
Yes you can mount in on the wall. That's how I have mine setup. You can turn the mounting brackets 90 degrees and screws it in the wall. It's not going to look pretty but gets the job done
i will fit to any board as long as it support PCI express x16
both, you can install the upgrade kit, or BMU and work fine :)
Technically, there is no difference. There are two different vendors with different pricing on the same product. I would recommend that you do some investigating to make an informed decision. As I type this, mining difficulty is about 89M. It's about to go to 100-110M. 2 weeks after that, mining difficulty may rise by another 20-30%, and this may continue into the forseeable future. Make sure you know what you buy into before jumping in.
I run a rig with 7 of these and haven't noticed any slow down. I'm using a three year old lap top with only 2 GB of RAM. Hope this helps!
I currently use dolphin and it works very well. Most games with a high compatibility run flawlessly even with high resolution 1080p. Dolphin does also depend on your CPU heavily so depending on how many threads you have also matter. What kind of CPU do you have?
Sure will, I happen to have a 750D case and this exact card, works fine. Just make sure your motherboard has the capability to receive it and you're good to go!
There is no way this is 18 AWG or 14 AWG wire. I measured it with a micrometer and it is around 0.52mm (24 AWG). It should not be used with more than 0.57 amps.
We do not recommend linking these with different models. Use the same model in pairs.
If you open the App Zone you can search for "Watch Disney Jr" and you will find the Watch Disney apps that allow you to stream videos once you sign in with your TV provider. (AT&T U- Verse, DEK TV, Comcast XFINITY, Charter, Cox, Google Fiber, Midcontinent Communications, Optimum and Verizon FiOS)
Yes, you can download the Amazon appstore from the browser if you go to mommy or daddy mode. Then you can install Netflix from the appstore.
Hi I'm sorry but I don't know what Disney Anywhere is, but you can search the web on it like any other tablet. My son is only 2 but he loves this device and is learning a lot with all of the learning apps that I loaded to the tablet. And it keeps him off of my iPad
Hello Ray, Thank you for your inquiry. The GOgroove BlueSYNC MCX Wireless Bluetooth Home Speaker System has a range of 100 - 240V. Sincerely, Accessory Genie Customer Service
You are pairing with the Bluetooth and the Bluetooth is in the Fusion module, not your stereo.
No switch. Once there is power to the red and black leads it is on and discoverable.
Yes
You need to look at the card you have. If it literally has BCM94321MC printed on it. Its the same card for sale. Thanks, Chris Betamacs
Should work great. Mine came with screws.
From what I can tell, pretty good
50-80
Mine is connected to a ps3 and have had no problem watching Blu Rays or Netflix sine I've been using it.
Depot or Courier Service means: Parts and labor repair coverage where shipping (including packaging) or delivery to the repair center is paid for by the original company or representing agent. Hope this helps...
Not much help here. I don't know.
Mine did, but being an Amazon Prime member may be why.
Not yet.
Yes
I just called Smart Guard and asked the same question. You have to buy the product from Amazon to buy the protection.
I have not read this but I do believe that it covers it, sorry.
No, you aren't obliged to buy it.
I do not know I never had to use it as of yet.
I would NOT buy this plan. try to find a good camera repair shop and just BE CAREFUL with your equipment .
they charge in the cradle. no problem. downside, if you are hearing impaired like me, they don't volume up very high. I have to use them at peak volume but I am a hearing aid wearer so they may be fine for others. also, unlike my Sony's they must be turned on for every use....very small button for this and volume control.
I have never had my batteries give me a problem nor have they ever ran a charge down. I do however believe you can replace them but if you have another problem like you didn't do a full charge before you ever used them, then I believe that would cause the charger to max out with less of a charge and never do a full one.
We use these for TV only, we don't have PS4. I'm sorry I don't know how they would work. I can say the are amazing for TV, very comfortable to wear and drowns out the sounds around you. Sorry couldn't answer your exact question.
i am not sure but i certainly doubt it.
Sorry, no reseller in Italy yet, we do sell on Amazon UK / FR
yes , we only have new version in stock now
The FK1 is a bit larger than the FK. The FK1 also has much more standard DPI settings (400/800/1600/3200) than the FK (450/1150/2300). The FK1 has a completely different sensor which also handles tracking much better (does not lose tracking at as low of a speed as the FK). It's not a HUGE deal that you bought this one over the FK1, but if you're used to playing at 400 DPI with really low in-game sensitivity, you might want to get the FK1. Otherwise, the FK is just fine.
Works just fine. Nice fit for projector, pocket for cable etc.
Yes there is an audio in jack on the bottom left front - by the USB port .
Yes, there is a docking station on the top.
how long are the standard speaker wires?
Yes, but the speaker wire is very short. Additional wire can be purchased from All Electronics Corp., 818-904-0524, part #WRB-24, $1.30 for 10 ft.
Yes
Hi, Shipping from NY takes 5 business days.
This product has an on/off switch so its standby current should be very low. The internal lithium-ion battery has a long shelf life (over 1 year) when stored at room temperature. When stored in a car during summer time, the high temperature during day time will cause the battery to self-discharge faster. I recommend you should recharge it once every 3 months just for the peace-of-mind.
Thats stranger it suppose to come with it if not u can use a Samsung charger ,black berry or most of these phones use the charger in their phone these days to charge it up plz check again sometimes the plug is hard to go in if not plugged in right.
Yes they do come with a trial version of Office.
No, the one I recieved was only the graphics card. Luckily my motherboard came with several SLI connectors, and my PSU had enough cables to power it sufficiently.
if you are a heavy gamer then stick to the 240 hz. the 120 hz is good but not enough for a heavy gamer.
In what way? not at all? mine works perfectly even though I use the cable remote more often.
It's elastic, so it does stretch to fit, but: Un-stretched with the straps fully let out it measures for a 42" chest. Stretched to the max with the straps let out all the way (which I would imagine would be quite uncomfortable) it could get up to 74" chest. The problem you may run into is that the should straps do not adjust super far, so it may ride slightly higher on your chest. Hope that helps!
I am not familiar with your camera, but I am guessing that it is too thick to allow the angle you want. So you need some extension links to get the camera above the mounting plate. There are probably several choices on Amazon, including the "Ball Joint Mount for GoPro Hero and Compatible Action Camera."
The easiest way is to store it in an old microwave (unplugged, of course). They are radiation proof.
No. Starting a car requires 400-500 amps. The maximum output of the Yeti is 14 amps.
I would car charge while driving only. That way you will not waste gas. Ues the solar panel when not driving and alternate when needed. Remember the point is to have backup power. Always try to keep it charged and plugged in. Just be resourceful about it. If you have to use your car then make sure it is running. You will drain your car battery quickly if not running.
No, it only has a standard headphone jack for input.
Yes, both. I LOVE this camera!!
I am wondering the same thing??
Dear Customer, Yes unit comes with a remote control
You do not have to play 3D movies but it is capable of playing them. This player will also play standard Blu Ray as well as dvd's. It also plays dvd+ and dvd- recorded discs as well as many other discs such as picture, music and mp3 encoded discs.
Yes
Yes. It is still grip but tha cam dose not fit the origenal case
I really dont know. I bought the item but it doesn't fit well to the camera body. But looks well
Yes it is.....made 2000 dollars off it already....I dj too....Bluetooth with iPad....or iPhone that's it!....get it...you won't regret it...just remember when you cut it on sounds like no bass but boy when you hit that gigabeat button on on.....the bass will take you away.....wow!!
it does have a user eq setting you can customize.
I own thus set. It's great for home/office use. For an event, depends what you are looking for. Not as good as a real dj equip. Regardless to your question. Stand.
Nothing, they play with us,don't buy it,I lost 2 memo bad in that 6 months, I sent to warranty people they didn't do nothing
Only on the screen side.
you would connect the ethernet cable to this device, plug it into power, and then connect to this unit's wifi using the ssid and password printed on the device.
Yes for me it works playing music over Bluetooth.
Yes it does.
The laptop can write dvd's and cd's. anyone who says different doesn't know what the terminology means.I bought it and have no problems burning discs so far.
A standard HDMI cable is what you need. Best to get one from amazon basics. Anything else is just a waste of money. They are all made to the same standards.
The ASUS X202E-DB21T is listed as being touch screen.
I really never tested! I can try this weekend on a Xbox 360. Please wait me to the next week. Regards
I returned it.
I'm not sure about the noise reduction. They do have a nice loud sound to them. The calls are very clear over the headset. I don't really use mine a lot for calls cause I have to use my phone to speak, I have my own ear piece for that. Normally I use mine when exercising and I use my Note 2 to play music or a self help video or audio. For the price I think they are a good deal. I would recommend them.
Yes it has a cd player and 2 aux line and it is also Bluetooth if u Love football u can connect it to your tv and it has 2 different football setting. Or use it for surround sound
You must install Lightscribe Core Software to enable the Lightscribe option.
If the old drive worked I can see no reason why the new one wouldn't do the same. Make sure all your drivers are up to date. GK
I bought one of these a few weeks ago. I like it a lot. The Lite-on site is : http://us.liteonit.com/us/dvd-internal/item/internal/ihas224 It looks like ALERATEC handles the sales/shipping for Amazon, here is the shipping information: Shipment Details Lite-On iHAS 224 LightScribe 24x SATA DVD +/-RW (+/-R DL) Dual / Double Layer Internal Drive Sold by Aleratec $104.99 Item Subtotal: $104.99 Shipping & Handling: $9.29 Free shipping: -$9.29 Total Before Tax: $104.99 Shipment Total: $104.99 Paid by Visa: $104.99 Charlie
It comes with an AC adapter which can be used for charging the camera.
No lens
It will work with the device you want. The device will only draw the necessary amps it needs therefore as long as the adapter has a greater amp rating you are fine. This is NOT true of voltage. Voltage must be exact to work under will not power the device (and perhaps ruin it) and over will defintely damage the device.
Be very careful with using this unit, it does not keep a constant voltage. Mine is about half of what the toggle says. ie I have to put mine at 12 volts to charge my 6 volt radio. At 6 volts it is putting out 2.5 to 3 volts. I would not recommend this one.
Sorry.... I do not know.
I don't have a cord to the earphones . Don't think it was included.
No
Yes
Yes but does not come with strap or case to hang it there but they are available
No
Since I don't have an I phone I can't really answer your question. I definitely hooked it up to the big TV and was able to watch a movie.
Yes it does
Not the one I bought
Not great, around 3.5-4 hrs
Yes, that is correct Intel Centrino N 6235 is the wifi on that model.
I don't know as I don't use those.
I've tried a few different video file formats, including some MP4, and it's played them fine from a USB thumb drive. Since the screen itself isn't HD, I haven't tried any HD files in there, but I can verify that up to DVD quality resolution it plays media files just fine.
No
sorry no
Because Touchfire rests entirely on the surface of the iPad, it will work with the majority of all available iPad cases. It may not roll up into the cover as it does with the Apple designed Smart cover and with any like designed case. However, when placed on the surface of the iPad, it will lock into place magnetically and function as described every time. It is a considerable enhancement to the typing experience on the ipad.
Yes but I gave up using mine
No, but Touchfire has one (or will shortly) for the mini.
Hi Smith, Thank you for contacting Timetec. Yes, if you leave the power plugged into the cigarette charger, when you start the car, the camera will start recording automatically. Feel free to let us know if you have any additional questions. thank you, Andy support@timetecinc.com
Yes it will. I bought both this one and their other model (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0033QCGO6). This headset feels a little more heavy duty. However we ended up using the one I linked to without the voice tube because we found the mic audio quality to be better.
No Microsoft applications will run on a chromebook. This laptop has a Chrome browser based operating system. If you need Microsoft applications stay away from chromebooks you'll be VERY disappointed.
Yes. There is one. On the lefthand side.
Dual core. Read the following: http://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-A-Series-A6-5350M-Notebook-Processor.89642.0.html Amazon should revise its listing.
1 slot is available Memory 4GB DDR3 SDRAM (1 DIMM) Memory Max Maximum supported = 8GB Memory Slots 2 user accessible Thank you, Fatech International
It is AMD A6-5350M quad cpu.
China
No, take look at your CPU power connection. The armor would cover it up
Hi, Mine is a C2... I preferred the HERO over the Gene, The cooling, etc. seems better on the bigger board since the Hero is a full ATX format MOBO. I'd only go with the Gene if my case was very small and couldn't accommodate the ATX (ASUS Gene is a MICROATX format). They are both GREAT MOBO's and both are ROG tough. Have had this ASUS MAXIMUS VI HERO for 6 months now, - kicks it... - great MOBO. Hope this helps.
I've heard that the only thing that wouldn't work is Sonic Radar which tells you where sound is coming from inside a game (I really don't use it)
It fits perfectly.
This case is specifically made for the 3 and fits snugly. If the dimensions of the two cameras are different, then I would not suggest purchasing this case.
Yes there is a silicon piece that covers it but you just adjust it to take a photo. It comes out and spins but stays attached. It protects the lens when not in use. Kind of like a phone charger port you have to pull down the piece. This is an amazing cover.
I believe 1 yr
We never got to use it, it wouldn't stay on for more than 5 minutes without shuting down. We returned it for a refund.
yes, this has a backlit keybaord that can be turned on and off.
It has a DVD RW which, of course, also works as a CD player and recorder; it is a really nice machine for the price; I have had mine for several months now and am very happy with it. With its large screen and keyboard, it makes it very easy for me to work (writing) anywhere around my home or in a coffee shop or wherever I feel like working. Also great for watching movies and 'tubes and other fun stuff.
Whoa... too technical of a question for me, sorry. I'm a high-end user, but not a techie... wish I could help you!
Yes
As far as I know, only if the other person is using the 622n lighting system, is it guaranteed to set of their lights as given, if on the same channel. The reason, to my knowledge is that the two systems are operating on the same frequency. However other radio triggers may be on other frequencies. Its not hard to believe that some trigger system somewhere operates on the same as the 622n but chances of you encountering that are slim to none? My laymans understanding. I leave room to be corrected.
I'd say yes but it would be overkill. These are TTL triggers and would trigger just fine but the cheaper RF-603s will do the same job and are cheaper. You would not be able to control the Bowens Gemini's with the YN-622N's just trigger them. I bought my YN-622N's with the intent to control flash power remotely and they are doing a great job of that particular after buying the YN-622N-TX
On your camera increase the flash exposure compensation to what you think is correct
I connect mine to my iPad. Works flawlessly every time. Not sure with your laptop on windows. I'd email Killer concepts and ask them. They always reply real quick when I've had to email them. Sorry I couldn't help.
I know that music or other audio from the computer comes out of the speaker, but I have never used it with a microphone, and I never will, because the speaker is already broken.
Yes indeed! We use this feature all the time.
Yes it can work as a stand alone DVD player
The Motherboard supports two CPU Fans and three System Fans. This motherboard runs very well.
No, it's a switch. You will need the EdgeRouter: http://www.amazon.com/EdgeRouter-ERLite-3-512MB-Ethernet-Router/dp/B00CPRVF5K/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1390780102&sr=8-2&keywords=edgerouter or http://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-Networks-ERPOE-5-EdgeRouter-Adapter/dp/B00E77N3WE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1390780102&sr=8-1&keywords=edgerouter
No, they are not that tough. Plus I had trouble with the 5 port switches overheating. Bathe 8 ports work much better.
Yes, you can connect it inside your car (actually thats what i did) and yes you can connect it on the cigarrette lighter, just recommmend you that if you ate going to do it like that go to an specialized person because you'll need some welding
I believe the power supply is internal to the device, so it is very possible that it is 48v or higher.. I do know that you can set different ports to different voltages, I use it that way to power different kinds of devices. I have Access points and IP video cameras running off of this switch.
I have not used a ton of the advanced features this unit is capable of but I do have two different voltage POE devices on this and they work great. That was good enough for me. Plus this thing is built like a tank and is fanless.
It didn't work with my Acer a 100. Money wasted.
It should plug into your tablet and that will allow you to use the keyboard HOWEVER it did not work with my Acer tablet, even though they said it was compatible.
No it won't work we have another model SLH202W which is wireless for tv and other devices
I used them in my car with DVD player and when I shut off car/ DVD they turned off
Yes, you do. The signal is analog, so we did need extra cables.
Uh... No film here. All digital. I don't have the means to weigh it but some google research should get you what you need.
210.8 x 135.9 x 7.95 mm more or less. It is the same dimensions of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 About the same width as the tablet yet it not bulky or anything.
The keyboard should be off and the red light should stay on until charged completely.
China
Im pretty sure it will. Ive used it on a Samsung tab 2 and Note 2 with no problems.
VERY hard to set up, still can't get it working
I'm using this projector in South Africa and we're using 120 volt here - works fine. You can use an input of 100 - 240 V (50-60 Hz).
I don't know the specifics between the two but this is the information directly from thar manual 120Hz frame sequential 3D for resolutions up to XGA, 60Hz field sequential 3D for resolutions up to 480i. Not compatible with 3DXL.
It has a micro-usb port and you can get an adapter to hook up to your flash drive.
Shipping Weight 6 pounds
Yes it does. I have that camera. Works just like the Panasonic battery.
I've had no problems with my batteries. Granted I've only had it for two months, but with one year old twins, we shot video and pics a lot. The camera treats all three (two from this company and one OEM) the same.
absolutely this camera comes with everything you need even a device that makes it float if it's dropped in water only thing you will need is a memory card I just recently took the camera with me on vacation we went on a cruise it takes absolutely beautiful photos under water and above water it was very durable and I love it
Yes, all the controls can be adjusted underwater. Its not like a case solution where you cannot switch
I haven't found any magnets. It uses a band to keep closed, and a snap to keep together. There is velcro to keep the tablet in the slot. That's all of the fasteners.
Has a separate app would not buy this one again.
Hi friend, it can support the 220-230V AC input. This power adapter can support 100-240V AC input, thank you!
it does almost anything any other tab does. I bought one and immediately returned it. very slow and foulty.
Its a faux leather. Very soft but not real leather.
I'm sure they will be comfortable, but these are one the loose side anyway. So being active with these might not work well for you. I will say even when bending over they have a tendency to fall off. But I have no doubt you will find them comfortable.
Hard Drive Capacity: 16GB NAND Fast Flash Yes&#65292;it supports flash. Enjoy your shopping.
It isn't designed for that. I'm sure there are better products if you want something portable.
They are oblong.
The auto focus and aperture worked very well with my Canon mount third party (Sigma 50mm 1.4) lens attached to my EOS 7D body, I'm happy!!!
My wife and I live in south Korea, the tablet works on the Internet here. It will work on Skype too, main problem with Tablet is short battery life. If using for and extended period, just plug the short charger into an extension cord.
I bought mine back in September still working flawlessly to this day.
The description states the total size is 109.2" wide x 63.6" tall x 1.2" deep. It also states the viewing surface is 58.875" tall x 104.5" wide.
Tv isn't the issue as all you need to do is hook up bd player to any tv around the world with hdmi. This player can play dvds and be discs from any region. I've tried discs from Japan, Europe, and U.S.
The manual does not list that format.
Hi, It does not come with a Power supply. Thanks, PCrush
There are 4 fans total. On rear, top and sides.
It does not come with anything extra. Just the speakers that are Bluetooth ready.
No fit
I use Manfrotto 701HDV with it.
I purchased them as a gift, and they never worked. They were returned.
Yes, it has the PC-in RGB input.
I had the same problem but it want break just pullit a part at the open slot on the sides it will take a few saconds but will come apart
The answer is yes it will. Haven't used that socket yet but here is a link. http://m.newegg.com/Product/index?itemnumber=N82E16835203017&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-Mobile&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-Mobile-_-pla-_-Water+%2f+Liquid+Cooling-_-N82E16835203017&gclid=CKm9ufi6rMECFQooaQod4YAADw
A month trial edition.Microsoft wants you to buy Windows 365, which means you have to buy a new license EVERY YEAR!!!
No, the device is locked for AT&T.
Yes very good tablet
No Bluetooth. It is wireless via USB port connection
All USB keyboards and Mice can be used with a laptop.
The one I received has an oval opening that leaves the camera lens and the light sensor clear. Looking at the picture here it looks like it might be showing in the lower right corner of the black image on the left.
I have the same problem. Will appreciate if anyone can answer.
Did you try calling the 678-815-6637 number?
It does not detach completely, no.
We do. ASIN is B00D5Y2XO4. We have merged the two listings to make searching between the two more convenient.
No it cannot. It can broadcast things from an existing hard drive but it will not store data itself. Also the range on this thing is terrible. 15 ft if you're very lucky. I returned mine and I even needed it, that's how let down by it I was.
If you can connect with Bluetooth it is.or you can use the cable jack
You have to connect them throu the other device you want them to connect. Most desktops dont support bluetooth you will have to buy a bt adapter but if its a laptot ur good.
My best guess some people want to cut down on weight so they power everything from the on board battery. Me I use the battery in the camera and us it for video only I want the quad to fly as long as possible.
It's one-piece, a plastic back with the smart cover attached.
Sorry don't know on either of them, I got the purple one. But they are all the same thing(?) so I'm thinking that either one of them will fit...and if it doesn't you can send it back!;)
Yes
I have Comcast and this works great. I have a single adapter off a coax splitter. 1 coax to cable modem/router and the other to the adapter. Then cat 5 from the adapter to one of the lan ports on the router. I then used the multiport actiontech where my TV is so it can handle multiple connections. Again splitter from coax. 1 to TV and the other to the adapter. Then cat 5 from TV, SONOS, Karaoke to multiport actiontech.
Yes, you can plugin this into HDMI port on monitor and have it run like a normal computer. However the user interface might not be a PC friendly as the fonts and mouse pointer (its huge) are optimized for home theater PC. XBMC is pre-installed and you can install apps from Google App store as well.
An "Android-native" Gamepad should work, either plugged to USB or connected by Bluetooth -- but not all games support Gamepad input. I rooted my UG007B & use "Six-Axis" app to connect a PS3 controller via Bluetooth -- works well with most emulators (if they support hardware controllers)
Mine came with a "wall-wart" type USB power supply right in the box. Any 5v DC power supply that puts out 1.8 to 2.0 amps should work fine
It's ARM processor running Android OS - so yes, it will run XBMC. Official install guide http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_XBMC_for_Android How well it will run is question - if you have issues, probably not processor. RK 3188 should handle it easy - but poor internal WiFi may make it boggy & laggy
It will charge my Galaxy 4 phone and my tablet pretty much completely. Have been very happy with this function.
No only for vidz and pics
No
You have to be really close to what you're taking a picture of. Like 1cm away if not less.
yes!!! Because it's just a clip on it'll fit anything tbh
Yes it does actually. The flash is what kills it. Kinda. But you gotta understand that it's a fish eye so it's pretty big. When you use flash it flashes only half the photo. Gives it a cool effect! What I do is have someone else flash their phone and take the pic! Haha but this thing works great!!!!
The Razer Blade warranty is only covered in the USA at this time. However, if you purchase from us we can be your point of contact should you need warranty related service or support. We also have a HIDevolution global warranty available as an option, which would cover 2 ways international shipping should you need to send the product back for warranty repair.
Yes. In Razer Synapse, there's a brightness setting in the lighting tab.
Yes
Probably so. It will fit pretty much anything with a telescoping FM antenna. SONY likely used the same antenna on all of their boom box-type radios to keep the cost down and avoid having to have a bunch of different antennae in inventory.
Yes it should fit they are easy to install
It has 3 LED lights. I took it into a dark bedroom at night and had no trouble finding my way and seeing details, but it certainly is not as bright as a 100 watt ceiling light.
Yes any PCI-Express slot will work with this card.
Yes, I currently have 3 monitors.
Lenovo's web site indicates support for the following: RAID 0, 1; JBOD also available
http://www.lenovo.com/shop/emea/content/pdf/Storage/Product%20Release%20Information%20(PRI)/PRI_Lenovo_Iomega_ix2_2bay_EN.pdf
Yes according to the Lenovo web site it can be an iscsi target
Yes. I have a keyboard and a printer connected to mine.
yes it does and it seems to pair very easily with every bluetooth device I own. Hope this helps.
Once you register your device you can download apps from the play store and google apps. A lot are free including GPS. You might have a promotion code like I did that gives you credit towards some apps as well. Visit the stores online and see what they have to offer.
According to this list, posted on Samsung's web site, the Galaxy Tab 3 will get a KitKat upgrade. http://www.samsung.com/us/support/SupportOwnersFAQPopup.do?faq_id=FAQ00059206&fm_seq=82024 You can indeed update it now, but to do so will require hackery. You could read about how to do that on www.xda-developers.com. If you're willing to wait for the official upgrade from Samsung, it should be a much easier process.
Yes. These are some great tripod legs, too! It even has a tripod tray as pictured in the product image.
unfortunately it doesn't but what you can do is run a live wallpaper so the screen doesn't stay in the same state for an extended period of time. Or do what I do run XBMX all the time and that has screensaver mode built in.
the tripod that the mount is sitting on (tripod was included in my purchase) is adjustable ... I think as low as 3 feet and as high as 5 feet? Sorry for the vagueness. With the position of the eyepiece in conjunction with the tripod and the actual mount, the height has not been a problem for me as an adult, but I do have to either pick my kids up or put them on a chair when its time to see the rings of Saturn - which you can see with this scope.
All new Samsung TV have HDMI input. You can connect VGA from your computer to this unit (Etekcity) Then from output of this unit (HDMI) to your Samsung TV (HDMI) Remember to order the HDMI cable and VGA cable. Click here for the VGA cable with audio : http://www.amazon.com/Cables-Unlimited-PCM-2240-06-Cable-3-5mm/dp/B000V6WASS/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1393290345&sr=8-3&keywords=vga+cable+with+audio
I work professionally with this drive as a video editor using extremely high definition files and it streams the video perfectly! I can't imagine any audio files being larger to stream than my video files (which have audio embedded in them) so my intuition is you should be fine.
you have to hook up the DVD player to and AV receiver which will be connected to your 5.1 speaker system; the DVD does not have any amplifier
Not sure of the warranty period, but for the price of the unit I wouldn't bother (and I didn't) with any warranty extension.
Piece of junk doesn't work and no service from Callaway went with garmin watch and gps such poor service from Callaway I won't buy their clubs next time
No fee - just call them and have them walk you thru the steps as you do it. Don't just down load one or two course, as many courses are remodeled all the time. I had them guide me through downloading ALL the courses in my state (Florida) which has many and took less than 5 minutes. Good luck.
I am not sure it will fit (you can conceivably do it with some adjustments) but I don't know many peeps that shoot a shoulder rig with a battery grip. If you have a descent battery in the camera you should be good for hours and as previously mentioned the battery is readily accessible. This rig is amazing, and the envy of most of my video friends
It did not fit my X100T.
Yes. But not with a lend hood.
According to the manufacturer, yes it will hold a Samsung note. "Fits most Tablets, including iPad, Mini iPad, Samsung Galaxy Note, Kindle Fire and many more!"
15x11.2x1.8 inches
I have a Kindle Fire 7 inch and it is really great for it. Don't know about you brand.
Yes , it does.. not great pic quality. It is just 5mp so dont expect much. But I like the fact that it is handy and stylish .made pretty good videos.
I have a late '12 GLK 350 4M & mine is located in the center console. I unplugged the OEM from there & this works great but (of course) does not charge. I showed a pic of it to my local MB Partsman & he said it was the best option he'd seen to date, especially since my GLK does not have any OEM Lightening adapter for my iph 6.
From CNet review "What is a little different is the USB housing on the bottom of the phone. Like the Galaxy Note 3, the S5 now features the elongated USB 3.0 port, which is backward-compatible with standard micro-USB cables. In other words, you can still charge the phone with legacy USB cables, but it'll really juice up quickly with the compound USB 3.0 cable Samsung supplies."
As long as it has a VGA port
it does not
Also, the 750's are not SLI compatible. So regardless of which motherboard is being used you will be unable to SLI any of the 750 style GPU's
yes
Read the comments here: http://www.amazon.com/Intel-i3-4150-Processor-Cache-BX80646I34150/dp/B00J2LIF2S
2 sata 3 ports are facing up, the other 4 sata 3 ports are right next to those two they are just facing towards the front. That is becoming more common.
This was my sister's first telescope, and it was a piece of cake for her to use. May be the best beginner's telescope ever. Better yet, it will still serve you after you move up to bigger, more powerful telescopes (bigger telescopes are a bigger pain to carry and set up. The StarBlast 4.5 can sit on a shelf, then be set up in seconds.) It also has a heck of a good price.
Probably not unless it is the exact same dimensions as the first generation Nexus7 (2012). That is what it was designed for. If the MeMo is 7 5/8" wide or less and the same depth as the Nexus it might fit. The Nexus looks to be 3/8" deep.
Yes it does
It didn't work on mine, so I sent it back. The camera wouldn't focus.
This card is not good for anything, donate that money to your favorite charity, Thanks!
Doesn't work
I have no idea, I used it my Samsung Galaxy tablet. Check with the manufacturer
It didn't even work.
I've had no problem using these (or any SATA 6Gb/s) drives with SATA 3Gb/s.
I don't really know. What I do can tell you is that this one works perfectly with my D7000. Just be aware that the back printed letters of the AE-L/AF-L button will wear off pretty quick. Other than that, works smoothly with the camera. Texture and color are almost 100 % identical with the body camera
Cody snyder, Yes, the system ships with both wired and wireless networking capabilities. The WiFi protocols the unit is compatible with by default are: 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n.
Uninstall current operating system from your hard drive. Then get official windows 7 and install it.
blackhawkms, Most likely, the card you would upgrade with would be PCI-e X16. This system does have a free slot of that type.
Every thing on the PC is great except the graphics card. You will most likely never have to improve the processor just invest a few hundred dollars on a better graphics card and you'll be set for a good 5 years.
Shawm Brown, This system ships with 1 HDMI port.
No quick clip. camera mounts directly with screw
It will only scan very specific cards, so if you have a card like that to put in the wallet then yes. If you want to test credit cards then no.
Yes
Of course this depends on the thickness of the text books. However, as I look at the texts in my book shelf I would say it will hold 2 of my thickest books (about 2" each) and a notebook, or 3-5 thinner text books. There is a lot of storage for everything else like calculators, pens, Ipod, phone, etc.
Well...I have never had the bag in the rain,it has a great zipper in the middle the bag seems like it would be fine in rain,also there is a spray water repellent that you can use...
I went on line and printed a bigger ne in English that is perfect. You need the book. I can't remember if the orig was in English on not. Go on line and get one. EASY.
no
Don't know about Kindle Fire HDX, but it fits my Samsung tablet, and the keyboard works great!
No
Old guy here too. The "A/B" thing is pretty much replaced with Zone 1, Zone 2, etc. It's like a B set of speakers, but Zone 1 (your main room where the 5.1 is) can play one thing, and Zone 2 (your patio) can play something completely different, because there are multiple amps in the AVR. So, you can play a CD in Zone 1 (main room), and listen to Pandora in Zone 2 (patio). Of course, you can play the same thing in both zones if you like. It's more versatile than simple A/B.
This receiver can play up to 7+2 (7 satellite and 2 subs) by itself. If you want to go to the full 11+2 (11 satellites and 2 subs), then you will need a supporting amplifier to drive the additional speakers, but the Yamaha will deliver the content (e.g. movie, music, etc.).
Hi. the rx-a3040 has atmos not this model. thanks
Space is pretty tight and due to the hard case there isn't much flex. I can fit an extra 4 foot usb cable in their and that's about it...
Yes I bought an Apple Airport Express and I set it up as a bridge. It works great!
Nope. Its not hard at all. Just plug its mini usb cable to the computer and Voila! Also you can copy your music to a microsd card and then insert it to the Clip+.
800x600
Mine is 10 feet away and I also have a 150 inch screen. In settings there are adjustments you can make.
Don't really know, but they don't last. Had mine a little over a year and not working any longer.
All of the above. The adapters are included.
It is loud and it sounds good with movies that's my opinion
Just get it online like amazon.
Maria - the charger and cable that I received did not work at ALL. Luckily I got a refund, but I would stay away from this kit based on my experience.
No but it can with an aux cable. Or you can buy the adapter and then a 5 will fit
Do you mean you buy the black top part and the green botton part? The answer is no! But if your question means "Can I buy the whole case of black, green, orage, yellow, white collor?" The answer is yes. You can choose to buy any color you want. The choice is on Amazon site! :) Good luck!
Maybe, if plus or minus 2 diopters is enough to allow you to see your menu clearly. It's usable for me but i could really use a little more than +/- 2 diopters.
Yes it does and it works great
Yes
Yes it fit perfectly!
Best thing to do is contact Corsair and ask them about their warranty and if it's global or not. For the first 30 days amazon can do a replacement or refund but after that's it's up to Corsair.
Yes, I use it in my dual channel build, just be sure to put them in the correct slots (if you're only using 2 sticks)
Thanks for your question, As on September 21, 2013 this item can be shipped only within the U.S. I hope this helps!
There are much better options out there for the same money. I just got a samsung level box and find it to be far superior to this. I am also going to take a Kicker model for a spin that can be had for around $50.
Each roll comes with a laptop type adapter that plugs into a regular outlet or extension cord
No, that cable is included with the nomad7 unit
This product specifically has to use NiMH batteries!
Errr... no. It's a Thunderbolt drive. The Thunderbolt adaptor is to connect a FW device to a TB connector on the computer.
No. This is strictly a central power port to connect fans.
depending how thick the case is, but safest to be less than 1" thick.
It holds my Nexus7 with no problems very sturdy
mine is a iconia taba510 10.2 inches x 7.1 inches and fits great , could be helpfully!!!! Regards
Depends on how hard the two year old yanks. This is a pretty sturdy mount but if children are yanking on it, it might not last long. I don't know if they make child proof mounts.
I couldn't get it to work right as it came with no directions, And ultimately didn't work properly so it had to be sent back.
Hello from Ecomade Arena. Yes, It does. 10cm x 10cm VESA mount hole is on back side. VESA hole depth is shallow, so proper bolts are required to mount. Thank you.
yes it does
If those are anything like World of Warcraft, they should run fine. No lag and the graphics are good.
Two to three business days
yes
No it does not, according to the interwebs.
It is a Pentium core i3
Yes
This unit does not include a touchscreen.
no, but it does have 8g memory and intel core i5
No it does not.
Hello, We have probably 10 or more of these in our office. They are not upgradable. Some of them have been very good, but we had three that died in less than 90 days. I actually like HP or Dell better.
No, it doesn't.
you can down load it on the internet, I did, it works perfectly, used on amazon and hsn
I'm not sure. If it's the same size as the Samsung galaxy tab3. But the buttons on your tablet may not be accessible through the notches cut out on this. I would advise you to get one made exactly for your tablet or a universal case.
it does not come with XBMC... but you can download it form App Store. MX installed
sorry,it can not
Try REVERSING the cable. The SHORT plug should be inserted in one of the headphones, left or right, and the LONG plug into the music source. Just a thought.
You have to contact qc.
My daughter been using it, she says it's great. Gal.
Go to your Apple menu, select "About This Mac," then select "More Info..." Take note of the Model (i.e., "MacBook Air, 11-inch, Mid 2003"). Visit ifixit.com and you can check battery compatibility.
I would check the number off the battery to be sure.
It's about 6" wide, 3.75" deep, and 1.25" tall
In my experience, you'll pay DT, and they'll own the equipment you buy.
(2) 6.5 in. speakers (2) tweeters (2) crossovers
Red is + black is -....on the tweeter red is + and red/black is -
Yes it does.
Not that I have been able to locate - been in situations that would have changed the route
Yes. Thank you
Same as the iPad. Very thin.
IS-01 can be used with any image processing software and whiteboards. Any mouse-based software should work fine. Please note that IS-01 also comes with an interactive whiteboard software called Annotator which features virtual whiteboards, drawing tools such as shapes and colors, and integration with IPEVO doc cams and Presenter software. Annotator can also be used in combination with any other application.
The one I ordered did not have a keyboard.
The one I ordered did not have a keyboard.
The one I ordered did not have a keyboard.
por lo generar es vidrio no he visto una que venga con plastico
Yes
I have the exact same problem, I thought I received a broken camera but now seeing that you have the same problem there has to be something else
Yes
yes it is blue tooth enabled.
What you expect from Blue RayI don't know. I was so imbecile to think that the speakers would be connected by Blue Tooth - so wireless - . That appeared not to be the case. I use the home theatre not for a TV but hope (still) to use it for a projector. The cables for that way of using it are far too short. That is all my experience so far.
That would be a question for the manufacturer of your car. Bose does not have specific information on car specifications on the switching of the cigarette lighter outlet. The Bose charger will function whenever current is sent to it.
Nope, mine just came in a box with the power adapters in a cheap plastic bag.
If by 4a you mean 4 amp current draw then this 12 amp hour battery could run in for a max of 3 hours. About half that would be more realistic unless the power draw was less with lowered sound levels giving reduced amp needs. I run a ham radio transceiver with mine which pulls about 1.5 amps on listen and 10-12 on transmit. I have used it for over 2 hours of mixed use and it was still going.
No
Reply with _____________________ Basic Answer - 50 - 60 Frames per Second. On the specific settings listed below, it works best. Minecraft 1.8 ------------------------------------------------------ Video Settings Graphics - Fancy Smooth Lighting - Maximum Render Distance - 12 Chunks Max Framerate - 120 Frames Average FPS = 59 - 60 Also, Yes it does work right out of the box, This computer was up and running on the first day.
It works well for minecraft :)
Only the Microsoft store has this option.
Max RAM that can be used is a 32GB upgrade
Yes it has. Just stay away from Windows 8.1 though.
Yes it does.
Yes,it can read external usb hard disk, we have tested with the 1TB seagate hard disk, and also can play videos on disk directly. also it support RMVB, you can use "MX PLAYER" to play the RMVB video.
Probably not. It fits the Samsung.
I have a Samsung Series 5 550 Chromebook (Wi-Fi) with a 12.1-Inch Screen with item Dimensions: L x W x H 11.50 x 8.50 x 0.83 inches and this item was too big for my computer.
No, the. Acer has different specs and slits for different things than the Samsung Chromebook and the thickness of the laptops are both different. Hope this helps!
Only in direct light and you have to really want to see it. Not really readily visible.
I believe this version is form fitted to the Samsung. Its a pretty exact fit so I doubt it would work on any other model.
It is 64 bit
It is for the iPad air, most definitely not the mini. I have the original iPad air (not the second-generation), and it fits perfectly
Fits perfectly!
yes. But we don't suggest you to open motion detection, Because it is power consumption. Without motion detection on, it can still snap photo while visitors press the doorbell.
The connector was not tightly touched. When you install it, it may become loose. We heard from other customers that they used a sticking tape to stablize the connectors.
I've had it for sometime and haven't needed to replace the battery yet. It's not motion activated so your only using when manually engaged.
I'm using it on an iMac that has Yosemite no problems
The system has over 5,000 variety games similar to play station 2. Sega Genesis, pac man and game boy. The games are child friendly.
No you cannot.
Yes
No it won't work if it's smart tv....I got this because mine is a 3D tv and not smart tv :-)
This camera performs great in bright light, I love this camera! Go to your settings with your flash
Two
No. It wan't. Thank you, Bersan
I didn't really got a chance to use this. I returned the keyboard because the charge light indicator was defective.
It should fit fine--it snugly grips the phone or ipod with the pressure provided by the loop, and has an adjustable placement because it's not stuck to the device.
I haven't tested that specific tablet, but it has worked with a Note 2 & 3, Note 10.1, and S4. If I'd bet yes it will work. Good luck.
Works fine on my 10.1
This is actually from the person who uses the camera. It comes with the body, 18-55PM lens, 55-200 mm lens, a macro lens attachment, a telephoto attachment, a filter kit with 3 filters, a flash attachment, a charger, case for the filters, bags for lenses, a card reader (that broke quickly), a 6 card holder, one 16 gig SD card, case, full tripod and tabletop tripod. The full-size tripod is fragile but works if you are careful.
buenas tardes, la camara es nueva?
No the case fits well and offers good protection if it is dropped.
This tablet does include a GPS.
No, it has not. Only rear camera.
Yes, it can tilt.
I use it on 1600 ram, but that usually goes along with 1333/1066/800, so I believe it will.
Yes I own that exact combo.
XIT
Price here includes shipping.... On Roku's website, it's actually $31.85 once shipping is calculated in.
This happened to me once. I had to reboot the ROKU by unplugging power cable for one minute, connecting again, removing the battery cover from the remote and pressing the sync bottom until it connects.
Yes it does.

Hi Jenna, the case is designed for the iPad only, not an outer case as well. The headrest holder is designed so that the iPad fits snugly inside the holder and ensures that the iPad does not move around with the motion of the car. I hope this has helped you. Anne, Founder of Inndise
I am sorry to say that this iPad headrest Mount is designed specifically for the iPad1,2,3,4 so the Nexus 10 would not work with this.The Nexus 10 is bigger than the iPad and places for ports and connections would not work. Hopefully we can get this design finalized before the end of the year. Thank you for your enquiry. Anne
Hi Jessica, my apologies for not answering your question earlier. This product does not work for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S. It has been designed specifically for the apple iPads 1,2,3,4, and Air. We hope to have a new product out soon that will fit the Samsung. Regards
The buttons don't seem to 'click' any more or less than other mouses I have laying around. They do seem to have a deeper pitch, though. So, I guess that could be perceived as less loud.
yes we use as tv probably six hours per day we love it great picture
Yes. Ethernet is a networking standard so this will work with any DSL/Cable modem. If your modem has a wireless router built in you may want your ISP to replace it with a standard modem. I am using this with an Arris TG862g. Should work fine with any SB6120, 6121, 6140, 6180 etc. If you have an SBG6580, you'll want to have it swapped for a non-wireless modem. Source: I worked for a cable company.
The router is about 6-7" tall, but the router cradle can be used to place it lying flat on it side, in which case it'd be about 2" tall.
It has 4 Ethernet ports and allows and 1 wan port where the internet plugs in. It doesn't say how many max wireless connections you can have but I have one setup now in my job and it works flawlessly with more then 20 people connected to it. Understand that the more people connected causes more traffic and speeds might be lower. This is a speed test I just conducted on the wireless connection: http://www.speedtest.net/result/4365102053.png
yes and very good
It means it will work on either the older USB 2.0 ports or the USB 3.0 ports that are on newer computers in the last few years. Either way, this hard drive should work just fine. I have the USB 2.0 ports and it works great.
Yes, it comes with the needed connection cables
It should work with the Samsung Note 10.1. I even used one with an iPad Air. The iPad won't recognize the Android specific keys like the Home button and the recent apps list button, but I would expect the Note 10.1 too.
It has bluetooth connectivity so i don't think you'll have any problem connecting it. What I would be worried about is the stand. I don't know how thick the A7600 is. It might not fit the stand.
Yes, just buy a blue tooth mouse
Yes Working very Well and I enjoy it Watching Dvd Movies all the time and I love it so much and thank you Very so much caught my eye on it.
As long as nothing blocks it, this will swivel 360. Very handy in the kitchen, recommended.
I have the ASUS 7". Maks sure if you arder you include a C&E CNE16187 Micro USB OTG to USB 2.0 Adapter at the same time, if you have a micro port for input. I can't say about compatability with a Nook but there shouldnt be a problem. You may want to check the mfr website. The one thing to note is that your tablet is not secure at the ends and slips easily. I solve the problem buy using velcro tape strips on the back and the unit. Keep it in nice and tight.
If the table has any of the following, plug it in: standard USB port, mini USB port or micro USB port.
Do you have more than four slots to put them in? I haven't seen a MB with 6 slots yet.
Should be. I'm running a 4690k with the ram at 2133. No problems
Yes both will fit without issue :) i would recommend with that cooler putting 3 120s in front for intake and 3 120s on top as exhaust the rear fan that is included is sufficient imo
Yes
I haven't had a problem with disks falling out or getting stuck. I don't use the dvd much. There are players that address this issue specifically and hold the disks in place. hope this helps.
Currently windows 7 ultimate is loaded. If you want I can avail windows 8 or 8.1 pro for you.
That's the standard warranty 1 year unless you buy a extended
Internet is the only option for liveview through smartphone and computer. Hence, it will definitely work without internet if you just want to record on your DVR.
No you do not.
Mine works beautifully. I am no wizard, but check your connections. That would be my guess. Good Luck
Absolutely! Up to 32GB
It comes with a standard size bracket for mounting in a desktop case.
I have multiple of each model and as far as I can tell the only real difference is cosmetic. Though the antenna on the uv5ra+ Recieves much clearer and is also more discreet and durable than previous models. The programming and what not is identical on both
NO
Yes they can.
Unfortunately no it does not have a CD/DVD drive!
YAAAAAAS!!!!.... Actually I brought it specifically for my GoPro. And can tell you it tally worth it. And the difences between plus and extreme, I guess it's just the speed, if you're not worried about that it'll work just fine. :)
No, I am thinking about returning this because it does not work with my phone as well as I expected
Irmina, Sorry, I can't help. I bought this as a gift for someone and, have had no reports on it. The recipient lives in another town and is a senior citizen. I set it up in his voice recorder and have not talked with him in over a month.
I received Sandisk Extreme Plus 32gb U3 speed cards from Amazon. SKU: SDSDXS-032G-AFFP.
Data transfer rate.
Yes if you start the music first the only way the mhl will take over is if you click on the Pandora app on the radio. Otherwise the music will be sent via Bluetooth
I have 3 kindle's... 2nd..3rd...and latest paperwhite... It works great on all !!!! And the price is so great that you can't go wrong... Hope that helps My husband also has the larger kindle fire.... so thats 4 kindles.. all work.
Does not work
The sound output is not that great by itself. I connect mine to a JAM portable speaker which allows me to adjust the volume sound to what I want. If you want the sound output tol be heard by a large group, you will need to find an external speaker to your liking.
There is a thunderbolt connector that Apple sells that has a port for power to the phone and another port for hdmi that works. It's about $40 but it works to connect to any tv with an hdmi port.
Pretty quiet.
Absolutely.....and the picture is really nice (especially for such a small unit). I've had mine for about 5 months and I love it!
Its should fit yes
I would like to know that answer also.
Yes you can. I bought these to use at work for our movie nights, and then took them home to try them out there and they worked really well.
I had a very bad experience. I returned it next day. It started with 1.5 2 hrs and within 24 hrs it came Down to 30-45min
Draw the power from the tablet
Is about 1 meter long.
The sound is decent and the comfort is so so. Add another $100, you'd get much better rewarding. Cheers!
no this case will not work with the kindle fire old generation or new sorry :(
I don't know but I'm not happy with my latest purchase of these. They lasted less than a month before the right ear stopped working
I bought these for the TripleFi 10 - not sure if it will fit any other model. They do work, though they transmit a bunch of cable noise through to the headphones. On the plus side, they're less rigid than the stock cable. On the minus, they are noisier when cables touch anything.
Airflow is good. There are air vents on both sides of the door.
Yeah, this can fit without any issues. The "bay" area for the power supply is clear.
Intel HD Graphics 4000, 1696 MB Graphics Memory, 1366 x 768 Resolution
Both of these have similar TDP's and they use the same amount of volts, and this one uses the Richland vs the trinity architexture, but both are FM2. I think it comes down to preference. If you get this, you should have enough cores and clock speed to process games and whatever for 2-5 years, and if you're into upgrading in a year or so, the 750k will be awesome!
Amd by far. Multi Core Apposed to 2 cores enough Said
They are not 5mm. They are 4mm. Thanks
I would not recommend a Gigabyte but these will work :)
You can. Then you will have your documents in the MediaShair app. What I miss is the chance to "OPEN IN" those documents in different apps like Adobe Acrobat, once you have them in your iPad.
Use another player that supports Samba,such as NPlayer. You can play almost any format. Just click on network options and choose SMB and connect the app to the media server. User ID is admin and password blank as default. Enjoy
We basically ordered this for a new tuner; we do do not have installed navigation. Sorry we couldn't have been of more help.
No
Refresh rate. You don't need high refresh rates for the PS4 so you can go with the 2455.
I used the Apple tv connected to it and it works.
I think it should be benq new 3d glasses 2 . 3d with benq own eyes should be right
Don't know. Never had to wash it. When you find out, please let me know.
It is 7" X 10"
The Tom Tom cardio does not require the heart rate strap. This one does.
Technically it does but it doesn't gives u a steps reading but a mileage instead
TomTom says these heart rate monitors are compatible. http://us.support.tomtom.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/17406/~/which-sensors-are-compatible-with-tomtom-runner-%26amp%3B-multi-sport%3F
The night vision distance is ~80 feet.
hi there- don't think so. it is only for the think battery
Yes and yes :)
Hi, The item have auto shut off system. You could leave it plugged into the charging. Also, it can be operated during charging. Thank you for interested in our products. Regards, Customer Services
Yes, it is in the rear next to the power and data cable plug-ins. I have two usb 3 hard disk enclosures. One is a 4 Tb and the other is a 3 Tb. Each has its own separate power supply. I can switch one or the other or both drives on, then press the Port's power button on. The Port's power button is a press on, press off not a rocker switch.
About 2 inches
It is 1/2 inch. Sorry :( Don't think it is squishable to fit through. Just 1/16 too big.
As of today they are in stock but that can change from day to day especially with the volume of sales increasing as we get closer to Christmas.
hi all this allows you to do is use a external battery to a cigarette socket, so for you air compressor you could have a left over wet cell batter, connect the + and - to the battery and connect the male end of the socket to your female end socket here a picture http://imgur.com/rFmhSSt
Yes
No tablet, just the case and keyboard.
yes, if you have a wireless printer.
No, the Beats audio sound is not that impressive
No it doesn't I bought an external blu ray drive made by LG for mine.
They should work with any Bluetooth enabled player.
It is adjustable. So it may fit your nook hd.
On the go. It is easy to take along and doesn't have to be plugged into a PC.
I have the Envy 15t, but they both have the same keyboard layout to what I can tell. For the new envy, the three keys for volume is located where the three keys for rewind/play/foward was. This one is for the older pavilion so it won't reflect that. But in term of size, they all fit and the button display isn't really noticeable. If you need just a sufficient cover, this works well and gets the job done.
I recommend that you take a picture of your keyboard and email it to the seller letting them know that you want to make sure you get the correct cover. Initially, I had trouble finding the correct cover and they suggested that I send them a picture so they could find the right keyboard cover. It was the perfect solution. They indicated that sending them a picture helps them get the correct covers to their customers.
I think so. But not sure. You would have to read what it says fits it. Might i think it will.
it says you can do up to 10 but it really depends on the signal strength that you have ....also i would not recommend to do more than 5 with out the lagging and the battery life on it
It will work without battery. Not sure you should remove the battery. But it will work in both scenarios.
Hello James, I know that with At&t your hot spot will act like it's own device. Adding your hot spot to your account would be a lot like adding a tablet to your data plan You might be able to put your sim card from your phone into the hot spot, but I'm not 100% sure. I hope this helps. Thanks, Andrew
It comes with a standard outlet plug and a USB cord, so you can charge it in a wall socket or on your computer -- I find the connection much easier than it was with my Garmin.
No
yes it has a headphone jack.
Yes there is a AE-L/AF-L button you can access with your thumb. It has two wheels to change you F-stop and shutter speeds too.
I have had no issues with the grip. I would remove it, clean the contacts on the bottom, and try again.
Brand name = BM. Batteries are rated at 2200mAh. Hope this assists.
I regularly leave mine in the dock with no negative consequences. I have been been very happy the dock and it definitely charges my Nexus 10 much faster than the USB based cable.
900/1800 yes 3G capability
It doesn't have battery option. You have to plugged in at all time and have to buy memory card also because it doesn't have any memory espase.
Approximately 5 days or so per my experience
The power socket will fall into the speaker.
No
They sent me broken clock
4,2,2
i do not use skype but my wifi connection was fine no troubles hope this helps
All modern Android phones should have stereo sockets ... the Turtle Beach phone audio cable is Stereo so ... you should hear stereo ... on the jack at the end of the plug you should see 2 or more rings ... this indicates stereo ... if you see 1 or less rings around the tip of the plug then you will only get mono sound ...
YES
Yes
Yesss
Mine was not. It is not even working anymore and I just bought it at Christmas. It was not a wise investment.
The first charge can take up to 9 hours. I use an Anker intelligent charger which charges my mobile electronics very fast and I think it took ~5 hours for my first charge.
It charges your phone pretty quick but it takes forever to re charge the ravpower
I should. I would double check with DirecTV
Yup. They fit perfectly. Actually this bag was designed for Blackwidow I think...
No it don't
It does not.
I wouldn't know..the damn thing don't work..I tried contacting the seller and he keeps giving me the run around
Yes it does. It fits even under the seats of smaller regional planes.
No. it is a solid piece of aluminum that holds the keyboard tray, the tray itself can fold but the drop arm is fixed.
I have charged somethings on it via usb while in sleep mode no problem.
Got it working with some 760's in a couple of my hackintoshes
Sorry Frank. I'm still waiting for the CPU. I ordered this M/B and the 20th Anniversary Intel CPU. Haven't got the CPU in yet so have not fired up this board.
Support for DDR3 3000(O.C.) / 2933(O.C.) / 2800(O.C.) / 2666(O.C.) / 2600(O.C.) / 2500(O.C.) / 2400(O.C.) / 2200(O.C.) / 2133(O.C.) / 2000(O.C.) / 1866(O.C.) / 1800(O.C.) / 1600 / 1333 MHz memory modules. I'm using Kingston HyperX 8GB Kit (2x4GB) 1600MHz DDR3 PC3-12800 KHX16C9B1BK2/8X. It's been working flawlessly but I don't overclock.
As far as i can tell, no. It seems both sides are integrated.
Everything that is on the item's list in the description...BUT the extra battery with recharger does not match with the camera model. In other words you cannot use it. The tripot is really, really weak and small. The memory card is 16Gb, not 32Gb. The camera bag is also of a bad quality. The rest is ok.
yes
No you can not (at least not officially). There are work-arounds you can do and some bios updates that you can apply but intel claims that it's an exploit and plans to patch it sometime. You need a Z87 for overclocking along with a "K" model intel processor.
I don't think so in the memory list from Gigabyte in the corsair section the fastest references is 1600 http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4601#
On Demand shows can be viewed at their "netflix"-like website http://xfinitytv.comcast.net/ondemand
BJ - the sleeve is 6"x81/2" w/protective lining, Perfect for the Kindle. And also for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7.0,plus!!
I have an iPad mini 3 (newest iPad mini) and the case fit perfectly.
Nope, only the EOS-M
There is no equalization adjustment. I would call the equalization "flat". Bass can be boosted a little by placing it in a corner.
They are the same, 1000GB = 1TB
Not all come with W7.....most come with W8. They can be downgraded to W7 only if you get a NON-TOUCH SCREEN.
my keyboard and mouse were not wireless
yes is has both dvd-r cd-r dvdrw and cd rw
Yes, it does. Access is on the right-side.
It does not. However it does have HDMI
If you register warranty with Dell it reflects it on Dell software on computer. Mine shows 18 months out from purchase with return to depot, and digial delivery warranty 6 years, tech support 18 months. Don't know exactly what it covers but you could google it on Dell site for sure. Check before you but because every computer is different, no consistency these days. Jay
You can download the document at sunfounder website http://www.sunfounder.com/index.php?c=downloads
Yeah it comes with the ones pictured. There are a few really long ones, some mediums, and a bunch of shorties. I don't have an exact count because I've got mine all over the place, but I can tell you I still ordered a bunch of the cables that are male to male, male to female, and female to female for other projects. http://amzn.com/B00J5NSOVA
I only had the chance to tinker with a couple but one is a relay switch allowing you to program an on off toggle switch, one is light sensor, and the other one I programmed as a dimmer with the LEDs
There is space between the barn doors and the lens, but it is far more efficient just to add a dimmer. I use VenTech VTSPEED Variable Dial Router Fan Speed Controller for Duct and Inline Fans bough here at Amazon for about $18. Works Great!
I bought this for a Nook HD and it does not fit. Well, okay you can cram it in there, but you will be stretching the case to do so. I would strongly advise looking at other cases.
I don't think u can install on it But you can use it with a light stand
it will work if you have a AGP slot on your motherboard. hope this helps
Turn on the bluetooth on ur device than search for devices but u must have the keyboard on to if it is still hard u could ask again and I'll explain better
No; the flash will not be in its master mode of operation in this setup. However, if you put the Canon 430EXII on the off-camera YN-622, you can get the YN-568EXII to trigger by using its S1 or S2 slave modes. These will trigger the flash when the flash sees that another flash has triggered. I've used that exact setup and it works great.
Yes it does
This is a new one. I suggest you contack Parrot with this issue.
Yes. It has one(1)
no
Only the flip out one.
It does
The charging port is on the bottom. It's micro-usb, the same as most android devices.
You have to have a cable modem separately regardless of which router you choose. But yes, it will work fine once you have the appropriate cable modem (probably a docsis 3.0 compliant modem.)
Ac, N, and G speeds are connected simultaneously. What ever the device requests.
I cannot answer this question honestly because I haven't tried them all. but the 750 has worked fine for me. I have made 60 cds so far and I am very satisfied with the results.
I took a look at the 7 in 1 on QVC and they appear to be the same except the 7 in 1 mentions that it has Bluetooth Technology. In fact in QVC s description it calls the unit a 5 in 1 then lists the features which are the same as the 5 in 1 except for the mention of Bluetooth. Hope this helps.
Yes the battery is replaceable. Replacement is a Sealed Lead Acid Bat 12V 6AH, http://amzn.com/B005T8OI0G. To replace first remove 4 screws on the bottom to split the case apart. Certainly not an easy push and slide door but still accessible.
The on-line estimates of power consumption of desktops are all over the place. So you need a meter. The EC650LCD specs say 390 watts. So you'll just have to see how much power your two desktops, taken together, require. Buy a cheap, simple watt-hour meter, $25. Plug a power strip into it and plug both computers and both monitors into the power strip.
You can move the mount up and down to suit your needs.
No, you need to charge the unit. When fully charged you can use it for 10 hours or so. Then place it back on the charger when done and it will resume charging. It is a great headset.
Dear, The EOS Rebel SL1 includes battery, charger and all supplied accessories that Canon provides in the box. Thank you!
That happened to mine, no amount of resetting worked, I returned mine to the seller, magellan offered a replacement as well, but I wanted to go back to Garmin.
Yes, it is covered by 1 year manufacturers warranty.
Place rods into plastic housing, place the ends with silver tips into pockets on softbox, work around from there
They are very bright, fotodiox customer service is great about getting back quickly. Message them through Facebook.
No, but is a great pair of softbox for the price.
Its really a budget decision. Both produce sharp images and good in low light, but with the sigma your packing more focal range without having to swap lenses.
I have and it's great. Focus ring is incredibly smooth. Very well built lens!
Yes, it is. Same seals.
Yes it does.
I don't have much to compare it against, but I'd say its slightly loud, but not too bad. If it is completely silent, it's very noticeable, but otherwise, its not too bad.
No its 120volt
Hello Dennis, Thanks for your interest! We tried researching your question online, but sadly, we could not find any solid answers. We recommend contacting the manufacturer about this matter. We hope this helps steer you in the right direction.
Is the box on a wired connection, because if not it is sharing WiFi with all the other devices in your home. This can cause the slower speeds.
If it is a "k mount" lense, yes they will.
Yes
Yes it will work with Android but not with windows phones
Hello, I can confirm that it defiantly works on iPhones. And, based on the way that it looks it functions, I would say that it is possible for it to work on the s4, HOWEVER, the device will not work without the iPin app, if you can find that on your phone there shouldn't be a problem.
No, it fits only Tablet self without keyboard.
I don't have this lens. but the Pentax lens 50-200mm has an F/4-5.6
Just one.
It works great if you locate the camera where it can see the ball on your car or truck. I located my camera under the bumber next to the removeable hitch.
Yes it does, it will be in the settings, I did that on mine and it worked great. good luck.
I am not sure. I am having interference issues and would like to do that myself or move the transmitter inside the cab of the truck
No I always got what I order and on time it was just a mistake
Very easy. You simply go to the Settings menu-&gt;Password and type it in.
I have not tried to import gopro videos. I will tell you, moving files/photos from the iPhone to the SanDisk connect and then to iPad is slow. The iPhone has to be connected to the SanDisk network, the disconnected and connected to the iPad. I use my SanDisk primarily to store music and movies for travel/vacation.
No
Just add sandisk app on your iphone and it well work
The description on Amazon lists the H20. Just to verify I have an H20 and it works on mine in both RF and IR. I prefer RF because you don't have to point it at the device.
Yes. This is universal the DVR and the other boxes. I just got new Genies and works fine also.
The base and most parts are metal (painted white) with plastic parts that hook on top to give a cleaner finish. All in all it's a relatively decent mount (great value for money) but I found that I had to tighten some of the screws to keep the projector steady.
Look at the very top left corner of your remote and you will see the BC # in small letters
I have one with a backlight. The number is RC65RB. I hope that helps you.
6ft
I do not know whether it would work with android devices. It may work as it is bluetooth system only but an android tablet may not slot into the space provided for typing purposes. It would not work as a case for an android tablet as it is made for Apple tablets
You only need this filter if you plan to use the MoCA adapter on the Tivo. If you do, you only need one of these and you want to install it where the cable line comes into your home. The filter stops the MoCA signal from travelling outside of your home (say to your neighbors home if they happen to have a MoCA network as well). If plan to use ethernet or wifi to connect to your home network, you do not need this filter.
You don't with Verizon. You have a dedicated fiber supplying your service, so your moca network can't interfere with anyone else's service over their network. I assume you have a moca network between your TiVo and a Mini, is that correct? I'm jealous. I used to work for Verizon FiOS in tech support, and all we have is Time-Warner in Hawaii. FiOS is amazing.
No you install it between where your cable comes into your home and before the splitter, so each outlet is enabled
Yes, I recently moved all my music off my HD to this Pny device and had no problems during the transfer.
Same story for me but shorter timeline, I only got a month before it died.
The thickness is 0.97 inches.
It depends on who you placed your order with; every seller sets their own shipping styles. For instance, I ship same day and priority USPS mail. So you would have received your product from me in roughly 2-4 days from when you placed your order. Todd (NBQ)
yes. I downloaded some songs from my phone to a CD for the kid and it played just find. It also has a AUX jack to plug a mp3 or phone in directly and play
Yes, but I wouldn't advise buying this item. I ordered my first from Amazon and it wouldn't play a CD. Ordered a replacement and it had a annoying buzz that wouldn't go away until you unplugged it from a power source. Then I bought the same model for the same price at Walmart but it wouldn't play a CD either. Had to return it also. Stay away from this product!!
i loved my kk2, it was great to learn how to fly. The Dji is amazing at stabilization, gps positionning, the handling has improved a lot.It was a great improvement for me.
It is not have a fast enough response for gaming. If you try to type fast it misses keys. It will not USB to a computer only USB for charging. Wait for next version as this one has too many bugs in it.
you can change the computer to do it but the keyboard itself will look the same no matter what because the laser is just a light with diferent stuff and it cant be changed
There is no Multi-Mouse function with the Virtual Keyboard.
No.
That blue button under the clear cap is a resettable circuit breaker. Push it to reset the breaker.
There is on/off button,so you can turn on/off all sockets with one button.
It's made in Japan.. Not China and Not fake:). Regards
Send me a Zotac zbox en760 and I will test it for you.
I ordered mine from Amazon.com (not a third party seller). Mine came in a box. The drive itself was in a static shielded bag, but it was secured in plastic retainers. It looked like this: http://www.thinkcomputers.org/reviews/wd_caviarblack_1tb/1.jpg
The voltage is the same as all the other SATA drives--it has to because otherwise drives would not be interchangeable/replaceable. The amps are not listed, but the watts are on the data sheet: http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/SpecSheet/ENG/2879-771437.pdf
yes
No
As long as it has a 1/4" tripod mount it would work fine.
I am sorry I don't know. Asus should have better customer support !
Yes we have the 1545 and the battery works great :)
Joanne, I see no one answered your questions, but this is the same model number I have. Did you end up getting this battery? If so, does it work okay? Thanks!
No it dose not .
No. They use different operating systems.
no it doesnt come with a ssd, but it does have an extra hdd bay so you can buy one and install it.
Windows 8 comes pre-installed.
Yes, I installed a samsung ssd
This chip is a bluetooth 4 version chip. Seems to work very well, but I don't know what the amazon unit requires. Might be worth a try. Sorry I don't know more.
Yes
Yes, the product was very useful for the more effective use of the camera, and open different forms of recording videos with the Go Pro Hero 3 +.
Hi Michele, it should work with any handset that has the 2.5mm plug receptor. That's the one smallest size - not the medium size that fits for iPhones (etc) or the largest that fits HiFi headphones. Hope that helps. PS: nice sentence structure to your question...way to avoid ending with that preposition! (-;
You can find out by going to the website www.antennaweb.org. If you enter your zip code and a couple other pieces of info, the website will tell you which free channels are available from your location.
One good option is the samsung pebble. It will sync with your phone and store all your music, several thousand songs, for playback anywhere. It will also connect to your pc so you can load it with music that you have on your pc.
So far the furthest I've had them apart was about 30 feet and they didn't lose an ounce of clarity. I do leave 1 closer to my phone/iPad whenever I use them though.
One 2GB memory.
It comes in a box but yeah the battery does weigh that much very heavy
No. You need to get your own. They have a "usually ordered with" section that prescribes a standard, cheap 12-volt adapter.
I think it consumes .5 amps. It says on the light. We are very happy with the light. It also has a day/night sensor which turns it off in the daytime. We are very happy we bought the light and will probably buy a couple more later on.
The size is provided in the product specifications.
Hello Hambrighty, Thanks for your question! Our screen protectors do not leave any residue once removed. If there is anything on your screen, a nice buff from the enclosed Microfiber Cleaning Cloth should alleviate anything on there. :) If you have any more questions, feel free to let us know here or at support@ismooth.com Have a good day~ Brooke Customer Service iSmooth
It certainly can!
Input on home sys is high impedance and TV out is low. This could damage one of your devices. I have done it with devices other than TV and stereo. I would not do it for long or often. Go to hi end audio store and ask questions, don't let them give a simple answer.
No. You get the input by plugging the jack into the earphone jack on computer, iPad, iPhone, into the unit's receiver.
As long as you are connected to the LG, yes
It all depends on your car. I would more than likely that you will need the aux cable also. Definitely something you would have to buy and try to see what works best.
I don't have the model number, but it was the best available. I bought it a year ago and spent considerable money. I don't use it. When I uploaded Windows 8.1 from Windows 8, my computer shut down completely and I had to send it back to HP. HP wiped out my hard drive to "fix" it. I did not repurchase the $1500 in software and it is almost worthless. I am afraid to store any files on it anymore. It works. It does not....and I quit. I bought a 512GB Surface and it is works.
No, this item is for Sigma SA mount.
You can't disassemble it. I would recommend a vacuum cleaner and a can of compressed air. I vacuum mine once a week. Call Contour Design, if you have the RED, it's still under warranty.
This is only a cover for the keyboard it is not the keyboard itself
I use mine at 31 feet with no difficulty.
Yes, but as indicated by dimensions it offers room for a 13.3 inch Macbook Pro. You shouldn't have any issue with any tablet fitting into that bag but you will have room to spare.
You have to do the thumbs separately.
It will work on any camera which have place you mont tripod on, basically all the camera has it and it's universal size Thanks
I tried this on the nabi 2 and it worked for a day or two, I ended up getting a actual replacement charger from nabi.
yes i think it is
Absolutely they will
It Should Fit I Bought My Son The Hp Slate 7 And Tgere Wad Still A Little Wiggle Room. So I Would Suggest Comparing The Slate 7 Dimensions To Your Tablet And If They Are Close It Shiuld Fit Fine
it does either one it's just a setting you have to change with the button
if you are referring to the backup camera portion of the mirror...yes it auto dimms. When driving you can not tell, it looks just like a factory rear view mirror. This is an excellent product. Highly recommend it.
The 9.7 tablet fits very snug. I tHink it'll be fine for a smaller tablet. It's great for the car.
Yes, that is correct. This high definition bundle comes with RG59 shielded coaxial video cable. There are actually two cables for each video line for each camera. One cable is for video signal and the other is for power. On this high definition system, the ethernet cable will connect from the DVR to the router pick up and IP address from the router and also to provide remote viewing on a computer, smartphone and tablet - both inside the DVR network and outside the DVR network.
Most carriers have an email address to send texts. Configure the DVR to send an email to your phone as a text message. For example, AT&T would be 5551234567@txt.att.net
Camera Model: QH8003B bullet, Camera Model: QH8007D dome,
Yes, this radio will work with any vehicle. The vehicle kit does not have any speakers, so you would have to connect it to your Goldwing stereo either through an auxiliary audio cable or through the FM transmitter that is built in to the radio.
It's manly 4 the car, yes u do 4 home youse , or if u have a smart phone u can get the Streaming service on your sat Service
I have a after market radio and have ni problem with i
No. I have mine inside and secured to the front dash and it works perfectly.
Yes, it will.
I would suggest not buying it.
This simply a straight thru adapter, it has nothing to do with HDMI 1.4 standard. if you'd like to stream 3D movie, you should go with High Speed HDMI cable. I used this adapter to connect a 50 feet long HDMI from surveillance camera DVR to a 55" HDTV 1080p in living room and the video quality is incredible. Hope this help.
Hello, Unfortunately the sim card is not included. Thank you!
You can use it on a normal post-paid shared data-only plan as well, if you like. Either way, get your SIM from Verizon. There's also been a firmware update in the last few months to support the newer Verizon LTE technologies (what's now branded as "XLTE," I believe). In some cases this should get you better or faster performance - partly due to mitigating network congestion.
No, we have expedited as well. You can select that when you check out. It's USPS Priority mail 2-3 day service from Portland, OR. Thanks!
Yes. You would need to provide Verizon with the IMEI number of this device. They in turn will issue you a new Verizon SIM card to install in the device and that should be it.
No this only receives audio.
Never try, but what I know,it never pair thru the Bluetooth, the manual does not explain how, neither
You can plug in RCA cords it will do line in
yes it is
Yes,I use a FlySky and it works great! Do not use the software that comes with this kit. You can Google free flight simulators that work real well with the FlySky and these adapters. Your computer will pick your FlySky up in your plug and play files and your flight simulator program,and then you can make adjustments to your FlySky controls.Hope this helps!
Was unable to figure it out. Sorry.
yes the ugoo7b should see your Nas as a media serverjust add a new source on the your video files or audio files and we should have an option to see any network devices on your network
No, it works fine with me soundsticks iii
It will fit into any dash that accepts a double din. Check http://www.metraonline.com/ to see if they have a double din install kit for your traverse.
I'm not sure, but it will fit a 2003 ford 150 & a 2012 ford 150
Yes
The unit plugs into the wall..and there is a car charging cord as well..
the windows sismtem is 8.1 but i'm having problems with licency number, can you help me about this ?
Yes, you can.
Yes,work with my PC,and with my I phone too.
The manual does not mention linking two. Seems the design intent is for one, placed near the audience.
Sorry I am not very tec savvy I haven't tried it , but if you're able to have two different things on Bluetooth at the same time I don't see why they wouldn't work together , but as I said I haven't tried it myself.... hopefully this helps you.
Yes. As fast a top of the line smart phone. (Except for the slow charging iPhones)
Yes it does. Connects via Bluetooth. Awesome little speaker!
Yes
Unfourtenly don't
The one I received was about 7 feet.
You can use it, but because of the 200+ watt TDP I would go with water cooling. I use a Corsair H100i with great results. Running at 5.2GHZ a core with average temps of 35c. With the Noctua I heard the averages are about 10 degrees higher.
The remote can be programmed for 1 streaming device and 1 tv. It works great for Apple TV but you would need another remote if you want to control both streaming devices.
I'm using the Asus Sabertooth R2.0 board with it when I bought it. So yes.
I think so. It willl work with it, if it is AM3+ and R2.0 or more. I am using ASUS M5A97 and it works also very well. AMD FX9370, ASUS M5A97 R2.0, 16GB Ram, and GTX 560, SSD - Win Score is 7.7(GTX 560 Score, others are 7.8 ~ 7.9 - 7.9 is the highest). For the game, depends on what you play. If you want to kill Diablo, it will works well.... also Battlefield 4. If you are just a normal user, you can't idemtify the differences between FX9370 and i7.
I did not use the item, had other problems with size. I saved it for a new computer I will build soon.
Yes it does! Fits comfortably in a low profile chassis. When you use low profile and you need VGA, you need to use an extra slot for the VGA bracket.
Don't know. I bought mine for use in Jamaica. I will post a review when I get a feedback from the user
They are both great cards, and the 760 outperforms the 270x slightly. However, the big kicker is driver support which has dogged the R9 and other newer ATI models. I would suggest thinking about the games you plan to play and checking their individual support forums for any issues. Also, be sure to do a physical check in your case and make sure the card will fit. This card is incredible large and you might have interference issues with things like your hard drives.
The instructions are based upon an Arduino Uno. You could use another board - but with the instructions being regularly incorrect it may make it quite difficult to complete all examples.
28.5", it is in the description.
In my case, I have a usb printer connection. I downloaded the drivers and installed the printer normally.
Yes it will work. My wife has the flex.
No you would not pay anything else. You only pay to recharge your sim card after the 25$ credit has been used up. No monthly fee. And just fyi your sim card should last you a long time. I have had my alarm for about a month and have only used up about 2$ .
Not really. Wouldn't buy this item. Mine and my friend,s unit both went down within three weeks of ownership.
If you us the on the go (otg) cable you can and all so add a hard drive or what ever you like one should of come with your tablet
No, however I use the buttons on my external sound card for that purpose.
No to both parameters. - Paul
There is a laptop sleeve, and a strap to keep it. But the back of the sleeve is not quite thick and therefore not super protective I think.
It holds my galaxy 10.1 in the case, with charger, etc.
Knockoff of what? K-Swiss? Maybe...Notice the spelling of the product; "American Shiled" ...Do the math- that being said, its a very good bag.
I bought the beg in September last year and ap to now it works without any problem, I am using it with iPhone. All the best Giorgi
The material is, but the bag itself has holes that water can get through. They are the silver circles on the picture.
Yes
It has a 2700Mah lithium polymer battery which is internal. There are some erroneous specs out there that I have seem including an AMD CPU vs ACTUAL Cortex A9. So no, no replaceable battery.
I have never heard of Tonton. Youtube access for sure. Netflix, I'm thinking so, but not sure. Battery life is about 2-2.5 hrs no matter what, then you have to plug in or use while plugged in. This thing is "awesome for the price"! Tablet cases can be found at Walmart really cheap. Hope this helped!
No, it doesn't. It only has a micro SD card slot. There is no cellular data capability.
I just held the old plug in front of a ruler and estimated. You could also borrow or buy a caliper. Harbor freight had one for $10. They are handy for lots of measurements.
yes. that's one of the first things I did.
I don't think so. But there's a ton of apps that let you watch tv
I'm afraid that I cannot answer that question. However, I have been having trouble with the tablet charging and even powering up. I am in the process of returning it. Matricom has emailed me a "quick fix" (which didn't work) and they have instructed me to return it for a replacement. We'll see what happens.
No it's not awkward at all. Just need to hold on the cover very carefully.
Yes
Don't know, but stay away. My sons broke in less than 90 days. Thank god I bought the warranty from square trade.
You SHOULD be able to get the free Overdrive Media Console from the App Store (many if not most libraries are going to this reader - our Memphis library has). I read a review on Samsclub site from an owner saying that her two sons played games against each other on the internet, so you should be able to download from the library - you may need a micro SD card to expand the memory capacity, but they're not expensive and simple for anyone to install.
Yes, the base has a standard 3/8" UNC screw. But there is no need to use another head for photography.
Around 44", but fully extended, this tripod is too flimsy to be steady for a camera. Can be better used as a small flash stand, or as a camera tripod when fully retracted. It is very light and compact.
It weighs 2 lb 7 oz including the ball head, according to my kitchen scale.
Fit perfect on 8 " tablet (I have a Next book) Dimensions are weird. Like 5 7/8 by 7 3/25. Worth the buy
If I remember correctly the inside was + and the outside -
No, it is not. A button on the top of the pen must be pressed to turn the camera on. An indicator on the back of the pen then lights blue. When the button is pressed again, the indicator light turns yellow and the camera begins recording video or takes a photograph depending on how you have set the camera. To set the camera, the pen is unscrewed at the middle. A sliding switch can then be moved for either video or photograph.
I believe I can only answer one question here. All PCI-E editions are backwards compatible with their previous version. 3.0 &gt; 2.0 &gt; 1.0. I don't know the other answer though, sorry.
It supports both dual and triple monitors. I had to hooked to three for a while until I needed to clear up some desk real-estate...
This graphics card is probably the size of your laptop, so no. It's designed to fit inside desktop computers, otherwise you'll need to buy specially made graphics cards for the type of laptop you own. Laptops are much more difficult to install graphics cards in because they require expansion slots, compatability, special graphics cards, and sometimes technicians who know how to safely install the card. Try researching graphics cards or upgrades made for your HP ENVY laptop. Hope this helped.
Hey Carlos, I actually haven't looked for one. I keep all that equipment in a pelican case.
hi sofia ,it covers the on & off button not a a very good fit ,
air vent mount. but had to add a custom strap to stabilize it. A small brass strap was used but you will have to drive small screw into dash to secure it
It comes with a tiny USB receiver that you plug in to any USB port. This set does not have Bluetooth.
I don't believe that you can, unless there is some sort of device that will connect your tablet to usb devices. You might be better off with a blue tooth connected keyboard and mouse.
Well, I don't know. Here is what is printed on the cable: Hi Speed HDMI cable with ethernet E321464 AWM Style 20276 80(degrees)C 30V VM-1 It works sending from a DISH Hopper to an Epson projector, as it does for a 5 year told Mac Mini. It does NOT work with an HDMI switch and splitter in-line tho. I got lazy and didn't debug that, I just re-cable the 10 times a year I need to.
Good question I don't know I ran it in wall Great cable! As goo gas my 'audioquest' it replaced
After the split it's 8 inches or so the whole cable is 6 ft.
Rajesh, This cable is specifically for connecting your powered subwoofer to an soundbar or Audio Video receiver. The dual rca connectors are connecting to the sub and the single RCA connector plugs into your soundbar with an sub out rca connector.
Yes it needs 2 studs. The 14" should be fine. Weight capacity is 105lbs.
I believe what you need is an HDMI Cable and you can use it only if your computer has an HDMI port.
No, the mount does come with M6x35mm & M8x35mm.
works mounted on wall even works sitting on the floor
According to the manufacturer: "The [AmazonBasics Extreme Performance] and [High Performance] receive high VHF and UHF digital TV broadcast signals. The [Regular Performance] is optimized to receive UHF digital TV broadcast signals."
No, it comes with double sided tape.
Turn it over.
Not at all for me. The screen looks absolutly beautiful!
It technically should work, but you would have to get an active DP adapter capable of running the resolution and HAS to support Dual-Link DVI. I recently had to contact Monoprice for a very similar situation on one of their 4k monitors. They have live chat, and were able resolve my questions quickly.
You'll need the new attachment that is sized for the iPhone 6. The remote, tripod and monopod work fine.
Never tried it. The remote is Fantastic! Coupled with tripod and iPhone holder, makes shooting zoom ins much steadier. Even without a tripod, it makes getting random shots quicker. Great for Sunrise and Sunset shots.
Sorry, don't know, I'm using it w/my iphone & it works great!
it does not come with games after purchase.
It stands fine on its own. I haven't had any problems so far and I'm not expecting any problems soon.
I do not believe the sleeves can be removed.
yes
no remote control and no USB connection.
no
why is there print on the screen saver after I installed it
Yes it does. INVELLOP has these anti-glare ones, and the clear ones. The clear ones have a lot of reflection. You won't be disappointed with these anti-glare protectors.
Not at all. In fact, I noticed better quality due to the lack of smudges from fingers. It really is a great value. -Yayko
The included instructions only said to search on YouTube for "Installation of INVELLOP". I just searched and found http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEl9hqZRJd4 However, it currently will not play for me, reporting a playback error (even though the preview thumbnails display correctly). Hopefully it works for you or they fix the video.
Yes
If you did not get 3 in the 3 pack, you should definitely contact their customer service. They will help you resolve this and may either refund your money or send you new ones. As for the bubbles, if done properly, there should be no bubbles. I watched the cited video twice and I have only one small bubble on the outer portion (which does not affect anything). If you follow the instructions to a dime, you should have very few, if any, bubbles. And if you do, the video will show you how to take them out.
4.1, 1 GB RAM, 4GB Storage
I am using the green drives 5400 rpm and streaming to a Mac and Apple TV and a Linux laptop with no issues had been flawless for well over a year
It works just fine with one drive. That is how mine is set up.
yes, although you have to train yourself to get the timing right when pressing the button because the same button also controls the battery check, power, and music pause/play.
I have not had that problem I found the correct fit with the included tips and shook my head from side to side and they did not fall out at all,and they feel nice cause there is no loop going over your ear much more comfortable
I wouldn't try it but I don't know what happened
We do not offer the AKG K3003l, however the sound and build quality for the Shure unit is top of the line, and includes the first in class customer service from Shure.
They are compatible and I don't think there's an issue at all , the se 846 are really in a league of its own
I am using the antenna portion on a windows 7 laptop. The software disk that came included did not work correctly. After numerous tries I plugged the USB plug into the laptop and to my surprise I was receiving wifi signals I had not be getting before. I can not with certainty if you would have the same results on an XP machine. For what its worth I would say just about anything I've seen that will run in windows 7 generally will run on XP.
I used a Dell desktop with Windows 7. It did not have a wifi or anything like it. I just plugged the Long Range into the USB port and it loaded drivers automatically. It considered the Long Range a wifi card and just took care of itself. I did not use the cd with programs that came with it.
Camera is rear facing only - isn't going to work well at all for Skype vid, speaker isn't loud enough really on it's own, headphones would be ok. Mic seems fine.
If you have the space and $$$, always best to use a preamplifier and amplifier for sound quality.
The manual states that the phono input is for MM cartridge and recommends a "boosting transformer" for a low output MC cartridge. The specification lists phono input sensitivity - 60mV or more. The manual is available at Yamaha for download. Hope this helps
With DisplayPort 1.2 it will be 60hz. DP 1.2 allows Multi-Stream Transport (MST) support which translates to this monitor being recognized as two 1920x2160 monitors each at 30hz. If you go the HDMI 1.4 route you will need a card with two hdmi outs for pretty much the very same reason. A single HMDI will only give you 30hz.
Yes, the one I got on January 9 came with pre-installed Windows 7 Professional 64 bit, and it contained Windows 8 system recovery disks, which I suppose you would later use to upgrade to Windows 8.
Sorry but I bought this as a gift for a relative that lives downstate.
Weird a few questions above yours asks the same and everyone there said yes, it comes with a remote, all these answers say no. I am confused.
Yes. It worked for me. Same exact model K760.
Though I have not done it, don't see an issue with painting it. Make sure that you do not impact the ability to open it to change battery and reset the unit.
Everything works well, I love this iPad mini case!
I don't know about the warranty. I have been using the case since December including the clip with no problems. I saw the comment about the clip in the reviews so was concerned but it has not been a problem for me.
I don't know if they make one that small but you could probably cut down a full size one to fit - there is room in the case for that- I just turn it over in the case when not using it to cover the screen from outside potential of scratching - I really like the case - hope this helps
Update? Sorry, the original firmware is about the only one you are ever going to see. Don't expect much from this manufacturer.
Thank you for your inquiry. Currently we carry: -500G for $99 -1TB for $139 -2TB for $199 Please let us know if you would like to go with 2TB.
Yes there is.
Standard AC/DC plug. ?. Yes the mounting hardware is included. http://iliveelectronics.com/32-bluetooth-sound-bar.html#product_tabs_product_tabs_faq
no usb port
Had the same problem, couldn't find one, and ended up just using the camera on my cell phone.
Yes it does
Hello, I bought a black one, I guess that there are available also in green. Good luck with your purchase! :-)
I had it for a very short time and didn't like it. I can't remember seeing Onrtv.
I did. I got it to work once but then couldn't get it to again. Ended up returning it.
This one doesn't have wifi, you should go with 70D
Most of them are compatible with the canon DSLR's but the Auto Focus may not work.
You do get a shoulder strap and battery charger.
The Fuji camera is not Micro 4/3 so it will not work. Micro 4/3 is a format exclusive to Panasonic and Olympus cameras.
They work with any normal auxiliary port. I used them with my iPhone before returning them!
Bluetooth to the phone, or headphone jack to phone
My answer un spanish. Nesecita mucha oscuridad.
It's flashing because it's dead. You need to charge keyboard off of tablet with USB cord. Then should sync automatically!
Hello, This product will fit, but it is not 100% plug and play in your application and will require a double din dash kit and a firm understanding of installation procedures. Ford logo is included.
Yes.
Not sure about the torch, but I checked the specs on phonearena.com for the playbook, and it is compatible. Just make sure you that I checked the right model for the micro hdmi compatibility.
I dont think you can
Yes you can, up to a 32gig card.
yes it does. to the right.
I wish I could tell you. I even not played the first game on it. I use it for surfing, YouTube, and paying bills. I DO wish the display was a bit sharper. Sorry but that's all I have. I am very happy with it and Windows 8.
If you buy tonight, yes.
If you are asking if it comes with a pen, then yes it does.
Hello, Yes, it has GPS. Best regards, Amuras
It should do ok with those programs but I haven't used them much on it. There is a good amount of ram and everything that I have run so far that has been fairly intensive has worked well. I would recommend this laptop to pretty much anyone. Great deal for a great product.
os is cached on the 20 gb ssd. This computer is lightning fast. I love it
Think of this like the touch pad of a laptop, but with a pen. You have to connect it to a computer for use. So, if it's just this alone, no. The drawing pad does not display anything.
5.75 DIA & 5.5 DEEP
No they do not but are very simple to wire up and they work great. For the price you will not be disappointed with these lights!
I don't think that they will.
yes it's good , it's lite weight and not comfortable
Neither
Unfortunately no, the RTA15 cannot act as a bridge.
I would recommend the Samsung series of monitors with 3d Glasses. i.e.. Samsung 20" S20C300BL
No
Correct.
Yup! I've had mine for a month now and everything works great.
Like so many of these sorts of keyboards, the function row is dual purpose. The primary purpose are for things like locking the device, cut/copy, and audio control. To use them as function keys, you do use a FN key combination.
It has hard keys. The keyboard is quite small but useful.
Yes, it sits onits own similar to a laptop.
They certainly are. I believe it's an SMA connector.
Yes my mini fitted perfectly
The iPad Mini w/ retina display is a slightly thicker than the regular iPad mini. I'm assuming the clasp/hinge that holds this keyboard to the device is slightly bigger to accommodate the the retina display model.
THey worked on my Droid
I do not see a Phone jack..just LAN port and USB port that I use with my wifi via DSL.
CD AND DVD WRITER
If the Fire HD has Bluetooth capability it should.
No
The dimensions are about the same. The Main difference is the ML04B has a front 'door' that is lockable, which when closed hides all the front ports and the CD drive while still allowing you access to the power button. So it's mainly an aesthetics difference or if you have children, you can lock the power button as well when the front lid is closed.
Yes it is and comes with the writing to connect together. Worked great and will buy another when the time comes. Seems to stay charged well with no problems.
It is bluetooth capable so "yes". My daughter uses both her iPod and Mini IPad on it daily. Great buy!
Not sure, I haven't tried either.
Yes, this PC comes with OpenOffice which is compatible with Office 2007 and also with Office 2010.
how do I know ? It is a great Computer for you tube netflix email
It's a touch screen so not sure why you would want it to be wall mounted but yes it's possible.
Go to www.swann.com for those answers
One film. Lifetime warranty. Great product, easy to install. Even though you should never have a problem with it, you don't have to worry because you can get another for free
Approx 9 1/2 in wide, 5 inches in length and 1/4 in thick at its widest and 1/8 in thick the rest. It's almost completely flat
Yes it does! It comes with a battery operated pen, a little holder for it and some replacement nibs.
No does not work. wanted to return but returns are to China.
Yes, it does. However I was not pleased with mine and sent it back.
1 triple a battery for the pen and the pad is plugged in
I think it works with anything that's gopro.so yes I think so. I returned my camera it would only record for about 2 min. Then say there was a error. You might have a better experience.
nope! just to test thoroughly, i used to rub my hand across it, tap it, etc, and none of that is picked up.
Yes, the driver of this tablet is tested to be compatible with windows 8.1. Please feel free to download the latest driver from our official site. Thank you!
NTFS is the file system used by Windows. Macs use a different file system that is not compatible with NTFS. Toshiba makes a version of this hard drive that is formatted to be compatible with Mac, you're better off just going with that even if it costs a little more.
Yes, it is inside the plastic case.
I purchased this case to go with it - Case Logic QHDC-101 Portable EVA Hard Drive Case - Black. It fits the product perfectly.
No, I have several and in some instances I have to put stuff under the stand to raise it. You probably will never need to lower it but a tall person will need something to make it higher.
I think like 4.0 it is really good in low light. A close second to my Alfa a6000
The WCS actually spins the record for you. All you do is apply the cleaning fluid and apply it using the applicator as the platter spins.
Yes, according to specs of Linksys RE6500 it has RP-SMA type of connectors, so you will directly attach antenna to it, not using UF.l cable at all.
Sadly, no. If you run the camera at a busy location and leave it running day and night (when it goes to sleep) and set it to shoot with no delay as I do, you will get a month out of new batteries. If you invest in an alkaline battery recharger (about $15), you can recharge and get at least another month out of them. ...If you wish longer battery life, set the delay to a minute...but realize you may miss something!
Hi, yes, the images are reproduced in color!
Yes the fit right on. No adapter needed. They just screw on.
Yes
Yes, but in my situation I found stock antenna gave a stronger signal
Yes. In fact, D-link recommends it if your router is on a different floor in a big house. I have 1 but could probably use 2 extenders to cover the entire house. The product truly works as described. I had to manually set up the extender but it was easy using the directions.
what kind of question is IMAC??
I've used it on my Verizon FIOS network. Note that the Verizon Router does not enable WPS button. So you'll need to connect this extender to your network using the other method. Not a big deal. In short, it works with Verizon FIOS.
never mind the 3.0 USB the computer is HORRIBLE. Purchased for daughter for basic school work , it can hardly handle that. Mouse pad skips. A responsive mouse pad is extremely important with windows 8 that is not touch screen. requested to return after having computer for 3 weeks . The retailer refused... DON'T BUY IT . REVIEWS ARE NOT ACCURATE.
yes
Yes I believe it does.
The last port is charge only.
Yes, that is what I am using it for - it is a perfect fit with all the right cut-outs in the right spots!
No
No, battery not included. You need to buy one battery
I really don't know. My daughter has a nextbook 8" Android tablet and it fits perfectly. I hope that helps.
Crop Sensor!
What you are saying is true my next book did not fit any case Walmart , Radio shack, or Office depot had to offer. But this one fits perfectly it seems like it was specially made for this particular tablet.
If those lenses work on your Rebel, they should work on the 70D. These cameras have the same lens mount.
camera body with cap. Lens with cap on both ends. Software, manual, flash brochure, strap with tHe adapter.
Hit the menu button.
I don't know what kind of battery it has but it's a good one. You charge it with a cable with a typical micro USB end. The kind that charges most android phones and tablets. Plug it into a wall outlet or a USB port on a computer. Takes several hours to fully charge but it lasts.
it does not. but I would recommend just until your phone battery life is about 30-45 % before charging it up and stuff. other than that its a great device.
You cannot. You may only use the stylus to move the cursor. This can be good for when you are drawing or something that way the touch of your hand does not interfere with what you're doing!
It should work as long as it can detect bluetoothb devices. It works well with my Nexus 7.
I have no idea, Jeri - best to write Aerb directly and ask.
Yes, it worked with my Lenovo yoga
Recharge it fully. Jim
Hi, It seems like your computer is detecting the tablet as a special input device, please try the next few steps to turn off this setting: 1. Go to Control Panel &gt; Pen and Touch 2. Find "Press and hold" under the Pen Options tab 3. Uncheck the box "Enable press and hold for right-clicking" 4. Click OK and save the settings. If the solution above does not change anything, please try check/uncheck the box "Support Tablet PC" in the driver window and see if it helps. Thank you.
Yes. I've used it with sketchbook before as well as manga studio. The drivers seem iffy with photoshop and I haven't managed to get pressure to work there.
It keeps the tablet from turning and/or staying on, so I can't rightfully say how the sound quality stacks up. The snugg case is infinitely better.
Sorry, until you asked the question and I went to look at the remote, I didn't know there was a timer. It appears that it can turn the player on by timer. I don't know how often.
Yes, I have 6 of them working perfectly! You just need to pair them first, put the Epson in 3D mode and hold power button in the glasses until LED is blinking.
No. These are made by Quantum. I have an Epson Powerlite W16 projector. These glasses worked fairly well. But I noticed on several different DirectTv recordings that there was noticable ghosting in the distant background in scenery. Some recordings seemed to be OK. I purchased the Epson glasses http://www.amazon.com/Epson-V12H548006-RF-3D-Glasses/dp/B00AB9IDOU/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1393951995&sr=8-2&keywords=elpgs03 and compared them to the Quantum glasses. The Epson glasses worked perfectly on my projector. I then returned the Quantum glasses to Amazon. I have no opinion on how either pair would work for you. Whit Kirk
Only if the song has alot of bass but u can adjust that for your phone. Great headphone, I've been using the for awhile now with no problems.Great buy
I am running into the same issue as I have not found a solution.
From what I've heard, none of it.
I tested it out; the SD card slot is in the front and no, the SD card doesn't really stick out at all.
Check your carriers frequencies for 3G and 4g. As long as they match then it will work.
yes!, it tells you the type of radar signal and a gives you a different sound alert for each different type of police radar.
You can do it your self or hire an electrician. You would need to have experience fishing wires, drilling holes in tight spots and also the extra long 6 foot drill bits help a ton. You can pick this all up at home depot, but if it is just for one camera it may be the same price to just hire a professional, but if you are installing 3-6 cameras you can save a log going the DIY route.
Skytex is a low grade system, so forget it.
move some files to a small flash drive such as: Patriot Spark 64 GB (USB 3 and very tiny)
2 x USB 3.0, one on each side
I certainly think so. It is a sleeve and isn't designed to be a true fit.
Yes.
It will work with A Nikon D1x, just keep in mind that it is not A TTL flash so there is no communication to the camera.
yes 1 year warranty. but i don't know if you are not in the u.s.
Nice Speaker, you can use bluetooth or you can use whichever you like, I often use them both, buy another sd card. load music and you are on, or you can bluetooth your phone, tablet or laptop.
Es mun bueno y excelente material!!
Single button on the mic. Press to answer, press to hang up - no mute button.
Mine didn't. I had to purchase Office separately then install it. I would advice buying another laptop though. The housing for my screen came apart after three months of use, not out of misuse, but from poor mechanical design (see comments). Samsung refused to pay for a new screen, so I had to buy a new laptop.
Did not look into this.
No it is not detachable, however the cable is a flat cable and that allows for it to be placed over the cassette in the deck thus avoiding the "dangling" cable.
Hi yes it does
Yes it would
Yes it does. This is the cover I bought to go with one I bought a few months ago.
Mine fits mini only.
No
No reason. It's a DX lens but as long as the camera is in DX mode it will work just fine. It would probably work in FX mode but would cause heavy vignetting in the corners.
The t2.2 version is a cine lens, ment for shooting film. It has a de-clicked aperture ring to adjust lighting in a smooth fashion versus having preset aperture points such as 2.0, 5.6, 11... I love the f/2.0. I shoot primarily landscape shots with it, and its great for night because of the low f-stop. Hope that helps!
No
I do not know for sure but I'm 99% sure it will. Try it and let me know. If it does not work, I'll buy it from you (I need another one of these for my other system.) email tkh at tkh dot com. Current price is about $29, so if it does not work for you, I'll buy it for that price (but you have to pay shipping to me.)
Yes it will, that's exactly what I used this for.
This adapter will take you to 4096x2160.....SOoooo SWEET......
We ran WOW on the computer and the sound in fact came out of the monitor so it seems to support two channel embedded sound at least. I have no way of testing it beyond that.
it won't speed flash it only does one shot at a time it's slow to recharge to flash for the price it will turn on a small led for hd video thats not very bright led light i did have excellent customer service from seller. it is a real good buy for the price compared to nikon i don't have a D50 I got D500 camera. if you have a hot shoe then it will flash for you when you turn on hd video it will turn on the led light.
Yes, more stock are coming before Xmas.
yes
The package I received did include a standalone charger.
38grams
for me, a 3 minute clip at 1080p takes about 340 MB of space so you're looking at around 4.5 hours of video with 32 GB of storage before it starts recording over the oldest file.
It has a touch screen and I got the keyboard sold separately. I seldom use the keyboard but use the Touchscreen most.
You need to plug it into your vehicle for power. The plug comes with it.
I'm not sure to be honest it broke before I really got to test it out.
No
That is true.we are considering getting a case and have Gotton a foam storage case for a iPad and it is fine for this tablet. I think the protective case is $10
Plastic
Yes but you're still going to need a receiver to pass the turntable sound through. I would go for a 2 channel receiver like the Yamaha Natural Sound Stereo Receiver (R-S201BL). So you simply would plug the RCA cables from the turntable into the Yamaha, then run your speaker wire (which you'll need as well, preferable 12-16 gauge) to your Micca speakers. Voila old school 2 channel vinyl sound.
length is 2m thanks
The sound is quite compared to most mouses ive used this mouse makes little noise while giving great performance
Not sure about the warranty but I bought it used and it came very fast and works as new. Hope that helps.
No
The sound from the speakers are avergage...but the audio enhancements need to be turned off for better sound quality via the headphones
It gives you a website you can download the free lightscribe software.
30 min
if you purchase it from geekbuying,you can send it to liuyi@vayava.com,thanks

I don't see why not. I believe you'll need an app to emulate serial data via the connection. I've paired this with my MacBook Pro and was able to wirelessly transmit serial data using the Arduino Serial Monitor.
You can watch sites like YouTube, and download your videos onto the tablet. It will convert some video file types so that they will play on the tablet.
I use Pro Office Suite which can open and edit MS Office documents.
HI, I try many time to resister in Google was impossible
The cx comes rooted. You can install apps2sd from the play store. I haven't installed the app but I do have some games on the cx919 running smooth with a nyko play pad pro.
The Blue Tooth keyboards suggested are not very useful. They are too small and hard to type. If you have usb wireless keyboard and mice you won't need one at all. I bought one and found it just wasting my money. Besides you are using CX-919 at home to connect to your big TV. So use your PC USB wireless KB and mice is much easier.
If you connect it via HDMI port to TV, it should have sound. If not, check settings to see if hdmi is turned on (under HDMI). Check you volume on TV.
Yes it has multiple RCA outputs and use the blue power antenna lead to activate the amp and crossover if being used.
No it's not a touch screen. However, it works great no problems or issues and I use it daily.
We do ship to Australia. It is not free.
I use the product only for my mobile & tablet. As i dont have laptop sorry i can't comment on it. Thanks
No. This tv does not have that ability. Since it is retro in design it is set to be stood on the three legs. The housing is not very flat and is probably about 6 inches in depth.
This comes with a built in intel HD 4600 graphics card. It is comparable to the GeForce GT 620m/630m. This is no where close to the quality of an R7.
Dear Cindy, It doesn't include. Regards
it will not wake up on its own to alert you off anything. but it does have a local weather alert station that it Tunes itself to.
I wouldn't worry about a light rain for a very brief time, but water could easily get in this thing. The knobs, plugs, speaker, and battery compartment are not sealed.
It's smooth plastic. Been using it a lot and no issues so far.
Hi!, Sure it is. I have mine here in Uruguay, and it works great!
Yes, I own this ultrabook/laptop and it does have the Ethernet port on the right side.
Yes it does as long as it is through Amazon they will cover it
You qualify if: If a Kindle Fire HDX has been shipped to you in the last 30 days, or a Kindle Fire is in your cart. Add a Kindle Fire to your cart or Register a new Kindle Fire
Yes it does
I've never worried about a virus with a Tablet, but this is supposed to cover everything. I'll read the forms over and if there's any exclusion for viruses, I'll let you know. Otherwise, it should be covered.
It is active as soon as you purchase it. I called and they link the plan to your purchase so it starts immediately. I hope that helps Amanda.
Hi Brandon it does but it only comes with one hdmi output so if you're thinking about adding a blu ray or DVD player it will only be through the red yellow and white outputs.
The popup flash in the NEX can optically trigger the HVL-F43M flash. No TTL.
Yes it does
I like the Sony, size works just fine.
Towards the bottom of this link you'll find the PDF download for the manual: http://www.lg.com/us/support/software-manuals
yes
You want the LNA 200 as close to the antenna as possible. The power inserter can be anywhere down the line.
You can remove it but it's an intricate part of the of the case and snaps together with the back. I just remove to clean and then snap everything back together.
Hi Carl, A 12 mo. manufacturer replacement warranty covers this product.
In the first half of the turn it can go from 0V-11V in the increments of 0.3V/0.4V , the other half is 11V-12.2V in increments of 0.1V.
Just one bay.
YES! Put one in the receiver mode and the other in the transmitting mode.
Hi! Yes, two BTR9 can pair with each other to form a transmitter/receiver pair. In this case, however, it's important that you have some manner of volume control on the playback device, since the BTR9 does not have any built-in volume control.
Hi Mark, I have tried to connect the transmitter to the audio output from my flatscreen and sending the Sound to wireless speakers. The setup was easy, but i felt the audio was slightly out of sync with the movements on the screen. I dont know quite what to say. It was not convincing!
Sorry, I have not used this product yet.
Look in your manual, on their website, or take the battery out of the camera and see what it says. This is an LI-50B. If yours is an LI-50B, then it works!
Yes it will play all regions, but you have to select which region when you set it up. You are allowed to change regions up to five times only, then it will be fixed to the last selection.
you will have to get in touch with the manufacturer with that question....
Yes, a 3.5 mm jack is on the box also
The side of the box states that a 400W PSU is recommended.
Ours was having the same problem and the screen was not responding where the port was. We contacted the amazon seller and they immediately sent us a new one, and a pre paid box to send it back in if I remember right. I'd contact the seller. It comes with a 1 year warranty.
It's an Android. So, I believe so.
it was a bit hard to plug but it wentin
Just Checked on an Ipad Air 1 and the answer is NO....maybe via a jailbreak
yep, you can program all buttons to do what you want, using the logitech software. I set the button behind the scroll wheel as a middle click.
While I'm not sure if it uses Bluetrack, I have noticed that it works differently on different surfaces. I've noticed a change in sensitivity when switching from a heavy lacquered wood desk to MDF to my cutting mat to formica to marble countertops to bedsheets. Bedsheets being the worst. It's fairly negligible with average internet trolling use but when I'm using programs like solidworks and illustrator or anything else in the adobe creative suite where accuracy is important I've found it to be frustrating.
Works fine with chromebook
Yes.
yes you can trasfer between the two.
Yes. The SanDisk wireless drive works great for photo back-up from the iPad. That is the primary reason I purchased the device & it has worked very well. When transferring a lot if pictures, it can take a few minutes, but still pretty quick for wireless. I move pictures to the drive, & back to the iPad quite often. It is also very handy for moving pics from my digital cameras onto the ipad for editing using the SD card slot. I use it between my iPad4, iPad2, & iPhone5.
From SanDisk Support: Hello Mr. Easton, It is a very quick and simple process. 1) There are Apps for iPad, iPhone and Androids that allows you to transfer photos, videos to/from your mobile device to the drive's internal memory or to an SD card in the drive. 2) All you have to do is turn the drive ON, launch the app, select the photos and then hit copy to Drive button. Here are some helpful links: http://www.sandisk.com/products/wireless/media-drive/ http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/12895 http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/12894
yes. In the app settings.
Yes. This works fine with canon 7D if you are not using big lens. With big lens its difficult to hold for long time.
Yes - there is another screw tripod mount on the bottom of the hand strap attachment. It's a bit bulky afterwards, but it does work.
Yes it does, both keyboard and trackpad. (UN60E8000F)
No
It appears to me that the Gex is lighter. Maybe due to the fact that the main shaft appears to be Carbon Fiber. I don't know if that's it being approx 3lbs lighter would be a good thing or not.
He he have in stock Genuine dell power supply compatible with your unit.
Go to the menu screen select settings, select the down arrow, select sounds and warnings and mute. Navigation manual is available at carshowelectronics.com
Set your satellite setting for "Sirius" NOT Sirius/XM, and you should get all three bands for presets.
Hello and thank you for contacting us. Unfortunately I cannot guarantee that this item will work with over the air signals. I am sorry and if there is anything else i can do for you or if you have any other questions please let me know. Sincerely, Chris Nickels Red Planet Trading
From what I can tell no, same drivers, same mic, same cord and inline controls, just a different color scheme and Kingston Hyperx markings on each ear piece
Yes, this amp will work well with them, especially in strings and vocal effects.
Yes, they all do!
No, they do make one for the Blackmagic Pocket camera, that camera has a smaller chip. Didn't see it on Amazon. Check this website http://www.metabones.com/products/?c=bmcc
Yes
It should. My husband's Kindle Fire HD has a generic keyboard that looks similar to this one. The salesperson said any Kindle product should work with any Kindle. I can't swear it will but that is what I was told. My son uses this on his Kindle Fire not HD and it works beautiful.
I purchased the 2 year warranty with it for a few dollars more. I'm not sure about whether or not it's available in all countries but I don't see why I wouldn't be so long as you pay for it.
Yes they are 2.0. No, it does not need 2 USB to work. The second USB plug is because the there are USB ports on the keyboard and that cord needs to be plugged in for them to work. I personally do not uses the ports on the keyboard so I only have the keyboard plugged in. Hope this helps.
It is the same product. Corporate efforts. thank you
No. They are 110V.
7.5 inches.
David, A number of things come into play here. What kind of speakers are you using? What is the size of the room? This network product is primarily there to give you a lot of features for smaller speakers (only 60 watts) and to be a space saver. Eric C World Wide Stereo
Thanks for your question. This wonderful piece will communicate with a NAS or PC using DLNA. I don't believe that it will connect directly with a hard drive. The complete users manual is downloadable on the manufacturer's site. This is a wonderful shopping tool. This is a fantastic sounding receiver. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Marantz dealer.
Stays on.
requires the headphone jack for sound. the usb is for power only.
they are both about 52-inches long.
I haven't used the Jawbone Jambox, but I'm perfectly pleased with my Jawbone UP24. As for this Durherm Powerful USB powered blah blah blah....it's awfully cheap. At $35, it looks, feels, and sounds like it should be $5 at a flea market.
It would not be enough speaker for a large flat screen.
I haven't but when you conect this with directX my games and emulators automatically recognized my DualShock 3 as a Xbox360 controller, so the custom configurations for the xBox 360controller that i had automatically worked. If steam supports X360 controller this gives you one.
not sure about the mac, but don't buy a pair if you don't need a pair. they are also available in singles. but yes they can be run individually.
Yes
very good
Yes it will work that particular model can accept up to 16gb of RAM and has two ddr3 slots internally so you can put 2 8gb of ram in it.
Hmm, the description says the item is 1.5v, I'm not sure how that compares to other ram. However I've noticed a greater difference in battery drain with Linux than windows. Other than that, generally ram doesn't affect battery life much at all.
Yes. It should work fine.
Well, I dropped my iPad on our ceramic tile a couple days ago and did no damage to it at all. This case is not going to protect as well as a rubber or silicone case, but the iPad snaps into place, and I feel it is well protected. So far, I'm very impressed.
Yes it does I have the iPad 2 and it fits really good I like it alot
I have the iPad 2 and it fits perfectly. If it's the same size as that, it should fit.
no idea.sorry.
Yeas it has HP's name on it.
There is a mini HDMI out port with a dongle to connect to a standard HDTV.
yes
no this does not work with the Hero 3+
Yes
It was glad to know that you already used the product, for the first time of power recharging, the power led light and blue MD led light will turn light. And then you can set up the operation with the mode you want according to the manual. You are welcomed to contact us if you have any other questions.
Yes, my daughter loves them
Download and run the Microsoft windows 7 advisor to determine if your specific laptop can support windows 7. If it does suport windows 7, then Yes, but it is not a restore disk and will not automatically install all the manufacturer drivers. Make sure to affix the new eom license key sticker to the pro book after installation. Once installed, the license key is specific to the processor or motherboard, I forget which.
yes it is
Depends, do you mean as something you plug into an expansion port on the side of the laptop? No - Do you mean something that you are using as a replacement of the original laptop HDD? Yes, if you have the knowledge of how to install it
no it dose not support a (TPMS)
Yes, it fits.
It would depend on the size of the soft pouch.. I put it in my purse and it protects the camera.
Good question and I'd be skeptical too. My review was legit (not sure how I'd prove that...), just haven't made time to review stuff in the past. The tablet is decent for the price.
Whatever the warranty is that msi offers, it will apply to this laptop. It's in all original packaging. I think the details are on their website, yeah.
Glossy. Nice and clear.
Plastic
Yes they fit all hard saddlebags up to 2014 models. Also the fit & finish is great.
No
Yesthere are many different brackets you can use that you can run zip ties through to hold it on
No, this not an oem part. The rubber inserts are not needed the bed is lined
yeah i works just fine with windows 7, its what i have for my art station pc
It did not come with any software, but for $65 we were able to download the software my daughter wanted.
Yes and yes. It is quite simple to use with excellent performance. It is one the best at this level and price I've experienced.
Yes it does.
Hello, thank you for your question. The maximum height is 66.14 inches and the minimum height is 17.32 inches. This information can be found on the product detail page under the "Product description" section. I hope this helps!
hi jessica, sorry, but please kindly understand this skin works for apple Macbook Pro 13 15 17'' laptop only.
The prices for these change daily. Bought one the other day for 154.00. Just buy whatever cost less. Be sure to match the stats
Drive only means drive only in Intel box without any cable or screws or software which are there in retail packing.
Not replaceable. Biggest drawback and why I have switched to models from The Friendly Swede.
I can't speak for the Galaxy Tab S, but it didn't work very well on my Xperia Z2 Tablet. I use the Wacom Bamboo Duo and the Truglide pen/stylus combination, both of which work very well on what has proven to be a tough tablet for which to find compatible styluses.
Using it just about every day, it's lasted a month so far.
Sorry. but I have no idea. Why don't you contact the carrier? That is probably your best bet.
This case did not come with a screen protector.
yes it does it fits perfectly
No this model did not come with bluetooth
I've tried repeated attempts to set time/date. All failed. I just use the file creation date when I upload to my PC then stamp it with a video editing program.
Absolutely not! Casual water spray, Not rain is all I would allow to hit them. The underside where the USP port is would allow water to get into the electronics. You would be better off using something like a GOPRO and it's waterproof housing.
It worked with my FIOS router. But it doesn't really help to extend the range,I ended up buying TL-WA850RE and it worked better.
My experience says yes. Since the antenna are detachable, the larger antenna will work and improve the signal ratio. If the antenna are a different connection size a RP-TNC / RP-SMA adapter will work nicely. All interior, not outdoor, antenna of the major brands are of either of the two connection types, when detachable.
The easy part is removing the ear cushion and removing the sticker. The hard part is getting the ear cushion back on. I want to say it took me like 30 minutes to get the cushion back on. I think there is a YouTube video that shows you how to do it.
Yes a very nice and solid hard case. Noontec.com has a lot of info also.
Hello Michele and thank you for your interest in our product. This commercial tablet stand is sized specifically for the 4th & Air generation tablets by Apple. When looking into dimensions for both the iPad2 and iPad4, they are listed as being 9.50 x 7.31. I do not foresee any issues using this specific stand with an iPad2 and its charger. Please feel free to contact me for further assistance. Thanks again Andrea
Hello and thank you for your interest in our product, this specific item ships in a box with the dimensions of 42" L X 4" W X 16" H, and is approximately 20 lbs. Please note this is a shipping box only and may be packed with paper/bubble wrap which would cause the dimensions to be larger than actually needed for the item. This item will have the Overall Width x Height x Depth of 15.0" x 47.0" x 15.0" when assembled. Please feel free to contact me for further assistance. thanks again Andrea
The antenna is for the times you want to take the television with you. (Camping, Road Trips, the Park) Remember this is a small antenna in comparison the the old ones we used to have on our homes before cable so don't count on great reception. When you are home you can remove the antenna and connect your cable box to get all your channels.
plug it in
Yes, it does, although I hate to admit I have not used it, for Skype or anything yet...
Had a hard time with that too. Turned out to be the F5 key turns it off & on, sent it back before I figured it out, now I wish I had it back.
They fit well over my ears and form a good seal to keep extraneous sound out.
I installed a good equalizer in my phone after I got my set, and they sound great. I don't use SD cards, so I can't answer that part of your question.
Yes
It swivels from landscape to portrait along w sliding at various pitches. Its a great unit. I use two of them on a mobile road case for data entry at events. We wrapped the cases in our company logos at a local vinyle sign shop for a few dollars, makes a worldnof difference cosmetically.
yes
both are possible
Yes, but the hot shoe will not power or trigger this mic. You will need batteries.
Sorry this tablet has no GPS Module built in and there is no GPS app for the time being.
I really do not think the cost of replacing the screen is cost effective. I bought a refurbished Acer Iconia A1-810 8inch quad-core 16gb tablet thru Amazon for $99.00 and am much happier. It's the same size as an iPad mini, so you might check something like that out.
Yes. It already comes with a chain but you can easily take off the chain and put a key ring in it place.
Yes, They are wonderful! Gave one to my daughter who teaches 4th grade and the kids love it as well. Have fun with them.
No. They are individual characters.
16 1/4" wide, 12 1/2" deep, 4 1/2" tall with the cover on
Noe - It will. I have a 2010 MacBook pro and that's what I'm using in my machine. I checked with the OWC folks via an online chat and they assured me it will. Hit them up that way if you want more conformation prior to making a purchase. Take care. - C
I have A Sansung external usb burner with 8.1 windows and it reads br blanks ok
I wear them over my glasses and find it works perfectly
It should work according to the specifications
It works if plugged in, but does not charge the battery. Plus the plug in part is a 90deg and wobbles out easily.
I believe so because it looks like it's the same size as my acer chromebook but check the thickness of your notebook because mine is an inch thick. I hope that helps.
yes... On the plug is writing this : Power Supply , input:100-240v-50/60hz 0.5A max , output 9v---2A. :-)
Hi, Thank you for your interest in the item. And the battery is inside the item. You need to charge it by the power supply. And about the TV function. it just support the Analog TV, but not digital TV. Hope you can install the antenna and the channel search.
Dericam. Or buy Blue Iris for viewing/recording software.
check amazon....I think we only had thirty days....honestly the worst thing I ever bought I sent it back went to best buy and got my son a kurio 7s a much better product in my opinion. I don't think they even refunded my $76 I paid for it.
Sounds to me that the speaker is blown, or there might be a crossed wire. Are you still elidgable for the 30 day replacement/refund fulfillment by amazon?
You may be able to do that on the Jabra website. I tried to get a bigger ear clip because this one was so painfully small but when I called Jabra they said they didn't make different sizes.
no it doesnot have dongle to plug into pc usb port.
The lenght of the power cord should not be a problem. Did not measure it, but it should be 6ft +/- I run it in a Caddy Deville and have plenty of spare cable...
Yes everything pictured is included with the price.
Hello Riele, I do not see a remote pictured on this item. I just ordered this kit and do not expect to receive a remote. Perhaps you are confusing it with the flash?
I am not sure but I think it did
Yes...mine was 10 years old...replaced it with this one and it works great..not a problem...
No keyboard is required since the TV has a virtual keyboard for necessary inputs. Using your hand you can type in your inputs fairly easily. Otherwise you'll need to use the remote for keyboard input. There are USB ports, but I'm unaware if these support external keyboards, wired or wireless.
They only watch you when you're touching yourself.
Yes it has the plug for iPod 5, and iphone 5.
I don't know what the other guy's talking about, because I have 3 of them, and they all come with their own charger. It's 100-240V input with replaceable AC prongs. Output is 12V, to one of the standard round plugs. This makes it charge much faster. It's not 5V like USB! So yes, it should work fine. In the worst case you'll need a simple travel adapter.
They fit a 3 year old, and an 8 year old, equally well.
Yes...
Not that I know of. It has a USB connection but I don't believe it has the software to play what's on the phone.
Hi, No, monitor is not included, but it comes with a keyboard and mouse. Thanks, PCrush
Most (if not all) external drives will work. External drives have a USB out and simply connect the drive to the USB on the laptop. Drive should come with a USB cable.
It should work with the wifi setting...I am not sure why its not working.
It works anywhere in the world
Hello J, No, it is on 433MHZ. This will work just fine with your WiFi. Thanks. www.FortressSecurityStore.com
I would say they are pretty accurate. Doing normal web browsing at 50% brightness could run 8 to 10 hours.
No you can not charge an iPad through the USB Hubb.
Yes there is an AC plug along with the attachment to the coax
yes. it worked for me.
As long as you have the correct bluetooth drivers, there shouldn't be a reason this doesn't work specifically with linux.
yes.
The battery lasts for about 4 hours. The screen does have its own light. If that's what your are asking?
Yes this item is compatible with the x250
China
It comes by itself.
Yeah. So like if you have one that breaks, or need one replaced, you can just order more. Shouldn't cost you.
I don't think so. I have a tab 3. Try searching screen savers for SGHI497. Hope this helps.
Yes this drive can be used to mount OS disks
We do ship by ups ground within 1-2 business day when payment recd. Depend on your location from California, the transit time is 1-5 business day. If any other question,or concern,please contact us again. Regards, kimoutlet
I want to be honest with you I think the anual EFE is $ 10 a 15 dollars but not sure
Absolutely not. The unit is plugged into the mains, and into your router. The router has to be on, but that is on at all times anyway for your WiFi to be on.
Product Dimensions: 14.1 (depth) x 25 (width) x 4 inches (height); 18.4 pounds. These dimensions were written in the Amazon website and I confirmed the measurements on the one I had purchased.
Hi Carl, I have only noticed this effect when watching SOME movies on Comcast cable. The effect is brief and usually associated with scenes involving subtle sound effects; a door opening, chirping birds, background dialogue, etc. I have yet to hear the 3D effect while viewing "regular broadcast" tv. Hope this resolves your concern.
Yes this is the one to get it has everything you need to install it. Installation was very easy and it worked perfect.
Dan, I am successfully using a Western Digital Red 3TB Sata III drive in my IX2 without any issues at all!
Yes for iSCSI. Sort of for VMware. It is not on the HCL, and it isn't high performance. I use these to backup ESX, and for lab use of ESX.
I am not sure about the hot spare but it can be configured with RAID5 using 3 drives.
No, but it does have a wide angle for good coverage.
Analog
Records all at once
It plugs into a standard 110v AC outlet. Some of Q-See's DVRs use an AC adapter and some just have a cord.
No problems at all it works great.
I give this pc an 7/8 in graphics desing

No, the camera is covered by Canon USA only.
Yes, the sensors request batteries, all batteries are include in kit
I would assume so, I use it with my iPad.
Yes, it has room to expand.
Both are always on, it can't tell if it laying down or not
I don't know specifically. It worked great for our trip through Northern Europe and the United Kingdom this summer.

I'm using this setup now. I've had it directly connected by a MD port connector and now have it connected through the belkin thunderbol-2 dock. Mid 2014 MBP 15"
No
Hi, Max supported RAM is 16GB. We have no data on the HDD aspect. Thanks, PCrush
Windows 8 Pro 64bit Best regards, Amuras
I am not sure. I usually use wifi, but I think there maybe an extension but I maybe speaking under correction. It's best if you contact the seller Adorama Camera. The customer care answers swiftly and are very precise. Hope my answer helps.
This particular tablet has been perfect for all you mentioned! Light weight, so easy to carry. My daughter used it for class over the summer (college ) and my husband used his for gaming, web searches, and emails. I use mine for web searches and emails mostly. Yes! We each have one.
My charger quit working after 2 months..I use my verizon phone charger.
One of two ways. You can connect your Memo Pad to a computer and transfer files directly from the computer to the tablet. Or you can separately purchase a card reader that will connect you a computer. You can then remove the SD card from the tablet, please it in the card reader and transfer files from the computer to the SD card. Personally, I believe directly connecting the tablet to the computer is probably the best and easiest method.
It does not wabble or move around while the car is moving. It is very stable. I'm not sure how much smaller the iPad mini is compared to the regular iPad, but it fits the normal iPad to the tee
Yes
Office 365 wich is an online only subscription 30 days free then you pay
No, that's why I'm selling mine. :)
Rather short, maybe 24" Probably designed that way so you don't have a lot of dangling cable in your way. Once you plug in, you control it from the radio controls anyway... no need to mess with your device itself.
Sorry Andrew, I don't know for sure, but I find it to work perfectly in my Baofeng UV-5R radio. Check out the Baofeng info on www.milkor.com You should find your answer there. Good luck.
This is a sealed unit and I see no way of opening it to reach the board.
Mine did not work either. They are useless to me. Waste of money.
I am not technically savvy and don't know what an IR is. However, the case is very basic and has no cut outs what-so-ever. That is one reason I returned it.
Yes you can do that. Picture quality really good even when you do play back. I used this system for my optical store and really happy with that because i can see everything store, inventory, customers, employees. I personally recommended but if it not good for you. You. Can return it
Yes. They are IP66 rated and mine are working in -37 ambient in Northern MN. Also working great in 100 degree direct sunlight. One thing to be aware of is the plastic on the wires is brittle at about 10 above. No issues with rain or snow on the lens. Just don't submerge.
I bought on Amazon PNY Elite Performance 64GB, 90mb/s cards. They work flawlessly.
I have the same model TV and it's been working like a charm for me!
You have to check with Samsung on your ver of the TV you have. I checked my TV before I ordered and worked fine.
NO , NOT SAME , THANKS.....................
this model does not have a heater....just the action of the ultrasonic waves heat the water to about 120 F or so
Absolutely
Yes. It does come with keyboard and mouse. Really a great computer. U should look into getting extended warranty through Hp. They cover accidentally damage. Only through Hp only. Only have 3 days from the day it comes in.
Yes, the BT Media remote is compatible with the iPad Mini. Please email support@satechi.com for further assistance. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
Go to amd.com (amd bought ATI), click drivers and support, select tv tuner products, tv tuner series, theater 650 pro series, then choose your operating system.
Hi, thanks for contacting us. I have just checked on ati's website and the last OS they provide drivers for on this card is Windows Vista. Unfortunately I cannot find any drivers for windows 7. You may look to see if other people are using some third party software to make it work. If there is anything else I can do for you or if you have any other questions please let me know. Sincerely, Chris Nickels Red Planet Trading
Yes it will; that's exactly the type of camera we purchased this lens for.
Yes!
Room temperature
yes it does work very well
Hello, If your file sizes are larger, they will fill the the supplied 4GB USB drive "faster". It really depends on the file sizes of how many can be stored. The resolution of this frame is 80 x 600 with a DPI of 72. If you do not resize to this optimal resolution, there could be playback issues or pixelation. It is actually very easy to resize. Here is a helpful link: https://nix.zendesk.com/entries/22222492-How-to-Re-Size-Photos-for-your-Digital-Frame
Yes, you can. It comes with a remote that lets you do that, as well as alter slide show speed, turn off and on, and some other features...I think you can alos play music with this, but don't have it in front of me, and I don't normally play music with these.
X15C has motion sensor to turn on/off the frame to save energy when no one is nearby.
Absolutely!! This is why we purchased this stand. The other ones would fall (or threaten to fall) on your face. This one is remarkably stable. We can both watch (we use a Kindle, but the same issue) in bed, laying down, and then push the stand out of the way while still laying down with never an issue (ok, we're lazy, but isn't that the point of laying in bed? :)). The stability of the unit is remarkable. In all our use of this stand, it has NEVER come even close to falling over.
Yes, you can use the tablet stand with a 10 or 12 inch tablet. The bands that hold the tablet in place are adjustable. You will love it. I use mine every day.
The user guide states the speakers are 13 watts.
There is a "jack" for USB and an auxiliary RCA connection
No.
9700 is nano led
It uses an adaptor (12v), so you can use any available in your country if the one provided is European.
Sorry, don't know for sure. You can check out the manufacturer web site at www.weaknees.com. They say it works for all models "except Sony models, Toshiba SD-H400 and THR22".
The gain on this material is approximately 0.8, but if you would like detailed information or a sample to test, please feel free to contact us at 608-352-0002. Thanks!
If you are going to have ambient light get a grey screen. Look on carls web site to see the one that works best for you.
I have used this device, externally powered with portable hard disk drives formatted for FAT32 and had no problems but have not used with a USB printer. I suspect there would be printer driver issues.
sorry we do not ship there
Yes
Have you tried re-syncing it? When I initially bought it, I had some trouble with it not responding. That seemed to "fix" the problem.
Both of the ears still work on mine perfectly :)
Yes I do
No
If I understand your question correctly, no. I tried using a Cisco PoE switch, then this splitter at the IP camera end. It does not power the camera, Cisco business tech support said it won't. The PoE switch "looks" for a device response before turning on the Power. This pair of splitters let you add power on one end of your Cat5 cable then split it off on the other end. Make note of power loss over distance. You'll likely only be able to run under 100 feet.
Power plug: 2.1mm x 5.5mm
45"
Yes, this should work just fine under 10.4.
I have an epson powerlite and this screen is totally amazing, it is even good in ambient light, top notch product and fast t/a!
I don't remember the exact size off the top of my head but it comes rolled up. This screen can't be folded so take the length and add about 2 inches for the shipping length and it might be a 6 inches radius for the circular tube. Hope this helps and I threw the box out so I can't provide exact numbers
anyone has any ideas on how to make a ceiling box that can rollup a piece of progrey 71 by 126
Not quite sure what you are asking but don't bother with this system. Remote does not work well. the system shuts down after a certain amount of time and you have to reset. I guess you get what you pay for
yes but if you can buy just a little better 5.1, I like it but the sound turns off and the hard drive is loud when you first turn it on
The dimensions with the stand are 18.3" (width) x 13.1" (height) x 6.6" (depth), without a stand they are 18.3" (width) x 11.1" (height) x 1.2" (depth).
YES.
I'm not sure about the E6500. I installed it in a M6800. It fits the PC and works but does not have the lock down bracket that dell has.
Yes Denise. I had an older Sony model that was about the same and it fit perfectly. It was a good buy for me and looks really nice on the stand.
Stand is great, it is very stable and looks nice on my dresser with a 32" tv on it. Very well made. Can use anywhere and will not tip over very easily...
No, sadly you can't. :( it's also a lot shorter than you think it is. It was hard to put together at one point because some peices were just inches off than what they were supposed to be.
Yes
This is a terrific unit at a great price- if you are upgrading from anything more than a few years old you will be very happy with this purchase-
For a quick "sprtiz: figure about 14 psi or 1 BAR, but if you hold it down for any longer the pressure of compressed gas decreases rapidly over time.
Like three times or more .
Yes it does.
The batteries are the same size as the stock one you just get space for 2 instead of just one
Actually I have not looked into it. I use it in my mini-studio and LOVE IT tho
The automatic backup is software that is included with the drive. The cloud backup is just syncing to dropbox, which would cost you about $100 per year, so in other words, you are better off buying two WD My Passport drives than paying for cloud backup.
Only with a mighty mighty P-tap
the device has two display ports , one hdmi, one dvi and one vga port, if your monitors has support display port display is ultimate otherwise you will have 2 different quality display, my monitor support display ports so no problem for me
Dear customer, this item includes a 32gb card reader, you need to buy 32gb card.
mine as 2 fuse, but either way this is a class D. it is very power efficient... no good on sub to use on 4 speakers great choice
It worked with my G.SKILL Ripjaws Z RAM, so it should work with your X RAM - just don't expect to fit a RAM cooler on there.
Yes.
2.4
Sorry Darrell it does not have a stand alone GPS ... you can connect to mapquest on the internet .. this about the only downfall of this table. I am totally happy with it otherwise. Hope this helps you.
These are all standard size which measure 120x120x25mm.
Yes its will
Unfortunately no, it is not. The Asus memopad is a straight wifi enabled tablet. It does however have the ability to use skype and google hangouts, provided you are on a wireless network. I hope this helps, happy shopping.
Yes u can put on this netflix its a good tablet
They are like rubber
yes,please make sure it is bluetooth enabled.
It should, it's pretty adjustable. I would recommend not attaching and detaching it a lot. The little plastic pieces break after a bout a dozen times.
If it has Bluetooth it should work fine. The version of Android doesn't matter.
No, up to 8 only. But very cheep plastic tabs broke very fast. My solution was to use rubber bands to hold my tablet in place. Pretty lame right?
Hi Dan, I personally use the BTS myself when cycling and they fit spectacularly. I use a Giro Atmos helmet and also wear Oakley glasses. The glasses themselves barely touch the band of the headphone but it still fits like a glove. The helmet (Giro Atmos in particular) has great clearance for these - however, some helmets that cover the ear might not. Hope this helps!
I did not get Crysis 3 with it. Did come with the never settle for less bundle Gold.
What do you mean? It's meant for PCI-Ex16.
The card is ~9.5" long, including the bracket and ports. The PCB excluding the bracket, i.e. the space it needs inside the case is at least 9 inches. Power connectors are at the top. I hope this helps. Thank you for asking.
Yes. There is: 1 - DVI-I 1 - DVI-D 1 - HDMI 2 - Mini DP
The drive is format in FAT32, limiting the file size to 4GB. I did not format the drive to exFAT, but to NTFS. It was really easy and you can can store much bigger files. That works for me. To format the drive to exFAT : 1. Insert your flash drive into an available USB port on your PC. 2. Click "Computer" from the windows start menu. 3. Right-click on the icon for your USB and select "Format". 4. The format window will come up. From the "File system" menu pick "exFAT", and click "Start".
Yes it is wide and does interfere with the ac power cord (left) and mini display & SD (right). However, if you are connecting everything to your computer like I do at home, I bought the StarTech.com USB 3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet NIC Network Adapter with 3 Port Hub - White - USB 3 Ethernet Adapter - USB Charging Hub by StarTech and solved that problem.
I don't know, I never do this. It is fast and it is possible that it can do it. Check the specs to see if it is compatible.
Absolutely! No TTL. Totality Manual.
Short answer - Yes it will. However it depends on other specs as well. What processor are you using? Do you have 8 gigs of ram?
Might be tough to cut open. It's pretty solid plastic.
No. You just touch the tag to the back of your phone to cause some action . You can place the tag anywhere.
Its a mechanical relay that makes a click sound.
Yes, there are 2 relays on this module with separately controlled inputs.
This was designed for an Arduino UNO board. Raspberry PI is intended as a mini desktop motherboard. It is only designed to use USB and other standardized ports for peripherals. It doesn't have communication pins to communicate with the reader. I don't recommend buying this board anyway because I cannot find documentation ANYWHERE on it.
It's range is about a few centimeters, (about an inch). I don't think it would work well for a wireless fence solution. Keep in mind this is Near Field Communications so the ranges are inherently small because of the wavelength.
Most of the Channels are Arabic
The tower does not include a motherboard so technically yes it can as long as you use a Intel mobo.
Yes it does. Go into Apps, click 'more apps' at bottom of screen, click on 'Samsung Apps', and scroll down until you see the Redbox icon. I presume that you must have an account of course.
No, and yes it shows some, but then you have to log into some other crap on your pc (Free subscription) although it wouldn't take code or download anything I wanted. I don't remember. It is more complex than any description let's on. I used it twice it has been in gun cabinet ever since. It really is a turd, wish I hadn't lost my old one. Forgot I have it, maybe shoot it with my 45 this weekend, and make room for something useful
No - all ports are accessible with the case on
No, that is a different size.
The only significant differences are lumens(brightness) and power consumption. HD25 = 2000 ANSI lumens ; HD25e = 2800 ANSI lumens. HD25 = Max 339W (Normal), Min 241W (Eco+), &lt;0.5W (standby-ECO) ; HD25e = Max 262W (Normal), Min 191W (Eco), &lt;0.5W (standby-ECO). You're better off with the HD25e as it is brighter and uses less power. Also, the HD25e does not come with a lens cap like the HD25 does, but this seems pretty trivial to me.
I ended up with the L shape end
No - all ports are accessible with the case on
Yes amp works real good 10 inch subs perfect
Cold has a good effect on electronics, but you still must prevent moisture from intruding.
Don't understand went out won't connect. I use mine with my toshiba laptop every day. All you should need is a double usb cord.
I did some brief reading about how to match amps and speakers, and my understanding is that the amp's power rating should be less than that of the speakers--around half the peak rated wattage. But as well as power you have to make sure the impedance of the speakers matches the output impedance range of the amp. If you're running two 8 ohm speakers in parallel on each channel, that's actually 4 ohms, so check those numbers. We use this Grace BTAR122 in conjunction with two 80 watt Polk Atrium 4 speakers and it sounds fantastic.
No. The antenna would interfere, and being in the cabinet you may have RF issues. I am also not sure if it would fit dimensionally.
As long as the computer has Bluetooth compatibility, I don't see why it wouldn't work. I've had this keyboard for about 4 months and I love it. My main use for it is school (college). The light up feature is very handy when characters aren't visible due to poor lighting. All in all I have no issues using this keyboard with my ipad and computer.
Here' what I found on online help If you have a touchscreen, touch input is on by default and can't be turned off. If you expect your laptop or monitor to respond to touch and it doesn't, check the manufacture's website to make sure it supports touch and that you have the correct drivers installed. Check for urself: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/touch-pen-settings-faq
These batteries will show the remaining time.
No, they work just as OEM canon batteries, they even give charge status.
They can be charged with the charger that came with the camcorder. They will perform just like an original battery.
The 2 that I bought I could not get to work in either dell that I have. Ended up buying a genic one to work.
Hi, thanks for contacting us. This card is not dell specific. If there is anything else I can do for you or if you have any other questions please let me know. Sincerely, Chris Nickels Red Planet Trading
AC input 120-240v at 50//60htz DC input 12v- 24v (car charger) Output DC 4.2v Thats off the back of the charging unit.
The battery does not have to charged while it is on the camera. Also, you can charge the Canon original batteries with the charger that is provided in this kit.
It's only for the charger
Yes
THE TOP DID BUT THE BOTTON Of my laptop was smaller then the case
Yes! I love mine!
Yes! We've had ours for over a year and our dogs go through water all the time and we've never had a problem!
Yes, it run off satellite reception, not towers
Yes,It will work with your optoma projector.
It will work,but Acer K137 projector requires a converter box like 3D Thertre+
Yes it can. It' almost like your smart phone it will adjust the screen back to center parallel to the ground. However, when you start to record it will capture all angles like a normal camera should. When you mount the camera upside down it will correct the orientation BEFORE you record. Does that help?
Just taking a stab here and guessing he meant an uploader to sites like YouTube. I don't have one but it can't be that difficult to upload from a pc if it doesn't have one.
It cpomes with everything you need except tools. I recommend using your own stud finder and level because the one enclosed is not that great.
Work no problem for a 50 inch.
yes it has a movie record mode for short videos that does a fairly good job with sound also. The sound is a little quiet on mine but on my dad's (same camera) the sound is better
Doesn't come with card. Yes you can use 4GB card
As long as the firmware on the tablet accept that size then it should work.
I have had this card in my Samsung S5 for about 5 weeks, no problems.
I don't know for sure, but according to Motorola Droid Razr M website, it says "Removable memory: supports up to 32 GB microSD", so I think it would work. I don't see any other information for the type of memory card supported by this phone, so I think it will accept almost any microSD, 32GB or smaller. Good luck and hope that helps.
It should with any device that requires an micro sd card
Don't know to be honest. If it's a recent tablet, then I'm sure it'd work right out of the box.
Yes I think so. It's adaptable to most phones with a flat surface and autofocus capabilities.
Im sure it does. I have galaxy s4 and it does the job. For the price you cant go wrong anyway.
If you need a semi quiet replacement for a high rpm 120mm case or cpu fan this is the best for the job its also adjustable and it comes with two silent mode pin cables
I am 6'2" and it hangs below my hip, with more adjustment available if you wanted it lower.
Here are the dimensions of the monitor in landscape; width: 699.80mm, height: 523.7mm, depth: 230.4mm, height adjustment is 150mm.
The battery charger, battery, the laptop itself, the paper work including the instructions and I believe that is it. I'm sorry if I messed anything else but if I did it was nothing significant. Check around the box bottom though for loose screws. Mine had a missing screw from the bottom of the laptop and I found it in the box. Tighten them to a snug fit if you can!
2-1/2 - 3 1/2 Hours.
Yes, of course. As a matter of fact, I own two laptops like this one and both are hooked wirelessly. Windows 8 recognizes my wi-fi immediately.
Both
Approximately 2 1/2 feet - but you might want to read my review. Their are others who can supply other sizes, more styles & quality
Connect the DVR's HDMI Out to the sound bar's HDMI In, and connect the sound bar's HDMI Out to the TV's HDMI In -- fully utilized.
I don't have an ipod so I can't test it, but since it is a Bluetooth connection it should play any music you ipod plays. The sound bar is only broadcasting the signal from the ipod not processing any of the content.
Had to take a regular cable and shave the end down with a box cutter. Be careful not to cut the wire or your fingers. Bad design for sure. I was able to finally get the cable to work and now love the stand but it was a pain in the iButt!
yes it fits
The bypass sensor that I purchased at amazon didn't fit. But I ordered the sensor from autopartsfair.com. Hopefully this helps!
I can't say for sure but I don't think it will. The device is small enough where you have to sit at your pc so that it picks up your movements. So someone walking around will not be activity that would be picked up. Thanks
No. Not with both hands. Even with 1 hand it is hard. Only way I can get cursor to move is with using only 1 finger
Yes...works great
Thats how mine operates too.
No, it does not. I have to power it off and on for it to sync up. Other issue is when charging, via the cigarette power source, while playing music, there is a of noise.
Greetings, Great question. Currently, 1TB and 2TB drives are available in the 2.5" form factor with a height dimension of 9.5mm. The height dimension is important for physical compatibility with this configuration. Best regards, MITXPC
No, only an AC plug. It works great.
No this power supply only allows you to use the camera while connected to AC power therefore not using the battery power. You must still charge your batteries with your battery charger. Hope this helps.
I'm not into video functions, but when I did a search for the app, it was not found. Hope this helps
Yes it does but the laptop is too slow. Not very happy with it.
http://www.amazon.com/Faceplate-Housing-Replacement-Classic-Version/dp/B00F8G56UA/ref=sr_1_27?m=A25JIQS96U9YO9&s=merchant-items&ie=UTF8&qid=1388191717&sr=1-27 www.amazon.com/Metal-Housing-Backplate-Classic-Version/dp/B00F8FAV1K/ref=sr_1_30?m=A25JIQS96U9YO9&s=merchant-items&ie=UTF8&qid=1388191717&sr=1-30 thanks
Yes but make sure this is an approved drive for your DVR, I am using it with my Dish Hopper ... it is a simple plug into the USB port on the rear of the Hopper and allowing the Hopper to format the drive (it asks you to). You can then transfer movies from the Hopper Hard Drive to this external drive... which doubles the capacity.
No it doesnt unplug from your keys unless you undo it through the keyring. So if you have a lot of keys having them dangling below it putting pressure on the port would not be suggested.
Sure. You need to format it first.
this model i bought included mouse/keyboard and wifi. I didn't use mouse/keyboard, as very basic and bought logitech wireless ones. Wifi works a treat. Awesome little rig this is and very quiet.
There is no docking station, so it doesn't matter. You have to use a USB cord to connect to your iPod, so whatever charging device you got with the iPod can be connected to the radio/docking station. (To the extent you can get it to work; my problem has been that it doesn't...) The image makes it look as if you're insert the iPod or the iPhone to charge or play, but actually what is provided is simply a place to rest it and make it LOOk as if it's charging. You need a cord to link the two.
You will also need the cable to clone the new drive before you install it. Kit also has cloning software if you don't have it
Also don't bother with the CD that is included with the drive. Do a restore from a Time Machine backup or a clean OS install and then restore your data and apps from Time Machine.
A tray [or other mounting kit] is not part of the package. You would need a separately purchased tray or mounting kit specific to your equipment. It fits into most laptops. I purchased separate drive kits for use with servers or Mac Mini equipment. The screw thread is standard, but you'll still need to be sure the screws fit into your computer/server [flat-head, flush-head, etc].
I'm running it in my Dell XPS with Windows 8 Pro so far no worries, runs great!
yes....by clicking the wheel to the left.
Yes
No
Comes with 4GB and can expand to 8GB max.
I didn't like it
It operates. It is OK.
Both of my sons have successfully installed their antennas in the attic. We have a newer roof with a radiant barrier, and that is a no-go. We tried to put ours in out attic, but the radiant barrier material interferes with the signal. The Orca is small enough not to be a distraction in the landscape, and we get a very good signal, through heavy woods, many miles from the origin of the signal.
They provide a couple sets of different size mounting screws, it should have what you need.
I own the Redline and Passport Max. The Redline has better range, by far better range. But it does give false alerts. The Max has good range and blocks most false alerts. I work as a hotshot driver in the oilfield and travel all of the US. I now use the Max exclusively. Although the range is not as good as the Redline, it still alerts you in plenty of time. With its fast speed and gps it is in my opinion the best choice.
Chromecast will work with the tablet. So you can transmitt videos, youtube, hulu etc from the tablet. to your tv via chromecast.
yes it does
The hard cover back is made of hard plastic. The inside of the front cover feels like a thin layer of felt fabric.
Yes you can. The case fits the ipad mini perfectly. The charger, the headphone plug, the buttons, and the camera can all be accessed with the case on.
Lindy T., This is not a wireless system. Customer Service TheBetterBuy
Bullet
I assume mean the iPhone or Android App? For the NVR at home, I have a dedicated monitor out of the VGA port on the back. It does 1366 x 768 and the images are very clear. As another connection, I took the HDMI to my main TV ( a Samsung 60" HDTV) and it displays in full HDTV mode. Apparently, the NVR adapts to what the display can resolve. No settings were changed in the NVR parameters.
The connection to the vhf radio is different from a stereo. As far as I know you can't use it with a stereo.
Yes, you can unscrew the antenna, but since the antenna cable is hard-wired, no connector on the antenna base, you cannot put away the antenna.
It's for a vhf radio I don't believe it will work for a cb. You can mount it on an angle as it is adjustable.
The number of the USB refers to the transfer speed. USB 1.0 is the slowest, and almost never used anymore. USB 2.0 is the most common and most devices are gauged to operate at USB 2.0 speed. The newest USB is USB 3.0, and not many devices other than flash drives and some external hard drives are using it. I hope this clarifies it a bit.
We normally ship on next business day after payment and will take within 3-5 business days to deliver within the US
I am just guessing but I interpret that to mean unusual wear - more than normal wear and tear. You could email or phone the company.
I believe it was August 2013. The manufacturer web page may have more detail.
Yes it works, it has the same slot connections on the base of all Hero cameras. This is an excellent clip that is strong and very versital.
Yes.....we frequently use it when we rock climb.
YES
Belt clip included
My husband prefers the silicon earpieces to the foam ones.
I don't see why not, but I haven't tested it personally. Even if the little button doesn't work they're a solid pair of headphones that can be used for anything.
Yep
I don't know for sure, but the headphones have a 3.5mm mini-plug which works on Mac and PC computers and on my iPhone. If you have a standard 3.5mm jack for a mini-plug, then yes, they will work. The sound is excellent. I learned about them by Brent Butterworth who reviews stereo equipment for About.com. The range is excellent, bass is full, highs are clear, yet it it still has a robust midrange. I'm no reviewer, just know that I like decent sound. Worth the few bucks they cost. Good luck.
It does not come with an ac adapter. You must buy it...think it is strange
It is dual temp.
The jack is at a right angle.
if 600 watts is enough, in fact specifies the minimum rcomendacion 500 wats, however, you must always choose the optimum.
There is a hole in the back for camera!
No
Mine is a PDSWF-ST47BU-VP, it was created after the docking station. There was vague indications that it might work with the docking station. I called VuPoint and they confirmed it will and it does. The docking station supports multiple scanner models, they can confirm your model. Sold by: Plethora7 LLC
I don't know; I have a PDS-ST470-BX2 and it works well with that. You can find out the answer to your question, though, by calling the manufacturer (VuPoint Solutions) at 1-888-788-6888 in California - Pacific Time Zone - 9:00AM-6:00PM. They have answered questions that I have had and have been helpful. Good luck.
Hello. I bought the Docking with the PDS-ST470R-VP and works well. Was interested to me, but if you dont need the portable wireless and need two-sided scanning even have to be connected to a laptop or PC, you should analize the Brother DS70D. Regards. Raul Zarabozo
No they send two stands, two light bulbs, two light boxes, and a bag to carry it in. The bag is cheap so my zipper busted but I'm only useing for my house for my 13 month old pics. I too am new to lighting and kinda clueless but my pictures turned out good.
No, it won't.
It functions as a conventional mirror. Good thing too, because the rear camera can almost not see out the rear windshield at all. It is mainly to record the vehicle interior.
Here is a link to a discussion about the board: http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=110876.0 What type of motor are you trying to control? A stepper motor? a servo motor? What type of micro controller are you using an arduino?
Not sure. I need to chk but I bought two diff brands and they didnt come with the datasheet.
I believe this should work on any canon with up to date firm ware and a mic input.
As long as the camera have the mic connector,it will work.
http://www.nordicsemi.com/eng/Products/2.4GHz-RF/nRF24L01P
I think the better option would be to go with bluetooth, although with all the correct components you could use RF24L01.
The mirror comes with the rubber straps that go around the existing mirror and those straps are stretchable. The slight problem is that if the original mirror is wide, the distance of the one edge of the mirror to the camera may not be enough to cover the entire width of the original one, so yo may have the tip of the original mirror visible. Esthetically is not ideal, but not so bad. Moist likely it will cover all buttons that are on the original mirror.
The actual mirror dimensions are about 12" wide x 2.75" height x .5" depth (not counting camera head). I think that dimension is the package sizes.
Work anywhere in the world as it is gsm based location but you can not control your vehicke remotely
It doesn't work period . This tracker does not work
Yes. My tablet and phone are both android and paired very easily with my JLab earphones. I highly recommend them!
It ships with a mini USB charging cable...you can plug into a USB port to charge
Yes all ports are accessible with it on. Buttons are a little stiff in the beginning but they get better.
No, the button placement would be different on a 1st gen series.
Agree that the adhesive tape is a little bit weak but that is what I do improve it. Clean up all edges make sure clean of dirt or residues before final adhesive; apply some heat and leave the Ipad upside down; put some pressure on top, such a book; leave it for awhile. You can always buy additional adhesive set
Yes, it will work with the 1st generation ipad mini. That is the same model number that I replaced the screen on, and it's still working great almost 2 months later.
It didn't for us.
No. It has very nice sound.
The sound quality is not that great. If you're looking for low price, that's all that it has to offer - but, not great sound quality.
The pairing code for my speaker was 0000. Hope this helps.
Key and download link will be sent immediately by email.
When properly programmed, yes. It's basically a front end on Asterisk.
You can use anything that will work with the FreePBX software distro. We're using PolyCom SoundPoint 500 and 501. I am not familiar with Yealink hardware but the software is very flexible... my guess would be yes, but you should definitely do some more checking/wait to hear from someone else.
yes
I don't know for I returned the product unused for a different option but it should work.
No, it does not.
Yes. You will need to purchase a coaxial splitter. Connect the "in" side of the splitter to the "tv/tuner" side of the winegard power injector. Then connect the "out" sides of the splitter to the TV's. The signal can also be split on the "antenna" side of the power injector, but you will need to make sure the splitter is a dc power passing type so that the power from the power injector can reach the antenna head unit. Hope this helps.
No
Yes
No. Cyberlink software only works on Windows. However, there are 3rd party alternatives that work great on a Mac with this drive.
Yes
the max. burning speed is 6X. Yes, it supports 50GB disc
It uses a micro SD card.
U.S.A
it work perfectly with my I phone 5s, with Sky Pro -"Dual GPS" & Status Tool - "Dual GPS". Did you download the the app on iTunes ?
The keyboard battery is included and it can be recharged by the same type of charger that you use for the tablet. It keeps its charge just as long as the tablet.
Thank you for contacting us. It does not come with a stylus and it is the only keyboard we have. Lastly it does not have the backlit option.
Yes
Not without additional hardware. This system has a hardwire LAN port only (http://www.simplymonitored.com/index.php/product/nvr-models/nvr-5004-4p). With that said I would assume you could purchase an inexpensive wireless bridge/router to connect to your wireless network at the location needed for the security box and just plug the hardwire to an extra port on the new router.
It arrived in a box. However I didn't get all the right pieces. And it's very flimsy.
I would think so, but I don't know, as it stopped working after I played the first blu ray. I wouldn't recommend this product.
Not sure about the limit but the adapter included is 5v/1A
I have comcast... Does not work and I can't get a reply about returning.
no 7mm drive height max. there is many available for sale but i has to say thin in the description.
I do not have this problem. ~ R. Marsh
This not a modem. It is a router.
I didn't have any rental property software prior to buying Quicken Rental Property Manager. Excel is all I used before Quicken. I know I'm not using all the functionality that's available in the application, but so far everything I've used I've been satisfied with.
No there is just one disc with the ability to install the software on 3 computers. You don't need three discs just one.
I guess it works for every Mac. I use it in a Imac 2008 and 2011. Just plug in.
I have successfully edited videos on these drives using iMovie with my 2008 iMac.
It actually has 4 gig but it only has one gig available for your personal use. 3 gigs is used up with all the software. I just put a 16 gig SD card in it and it's great
No, up to a 32gb card can be used.
Amazon app store is accessible on any tablet because it is browser accessible. Most of the apps are only for Android or Kindle devices but it is accessible from anything with a web browser.
Honestly if you already have this just open the market and install Kindle or Nook. Once you open the app you are in reader mode, none of the other features matter. Just find someone a little more tech savvy to install the book apps and if you want an email app and put their links on the front page and everything else can be forgotten.
I got mine in December 2014. No replacement screen protector yet...
No bulk- fits like a double duty glove. Rubber edge and backing with open-up easel.
Doubt it.
no its not
Yes on both counts. "WHAT'S IN THE BOX Monitor Stand Riser Stand Base VESATM Screw Cover Power Cable VGA Cable Drivers and documentation media Quick setup guide Product information guide"
its a screen... there is no software or hardware on it... lol
Yes. This is just the single component that is in the PWR514K01 set. I have both this one and the PWR514K01. They all work together.
It is not the purpose of these devices to provide POE. Their sole purpose is to provide a power-line Ethernet extension that is more reliable than wireless and reaches locations wireless adapters can't.
Yes the next book belongs to my 8 yr old boy and it has been protected fabulously...love it!!!
It should disappear completely within 2-5 days depending on the severity / size of the bubbles. I would give it the full 5 days, however it's tough to judge without having seen the size for myself. Worse case, wait the 5 days, and if you are not fully satisfied contact customer service. In my experience it is some of the best out there.
dry
No, love the cover, works great!!
I had to adjust the opening for the charger, it isn't long enough to allow the connector to lie flat on the tablet. My husband just removed the material at that end. Beyond that, I can access everything and the tablet is very secure in the case. I really like the cover. The keyboard could be a little better quality, but I'm not displeased in any way. It works well and is easily removed when I don't need it. I bought my Surface for grad school and the cover and keyboard are super for that.
I have the Yiynova MVP22U, I don't seem to have a problem with the readability of the fonts, you can go to Control panel&gt;Display&gt;Adjust ClearType text to make the text better to read, you can also Calibrate the color there for better contrast.
Yes. It does have a built in battery with a limited amount of run time after charging with the 12v cigarrette plug in. You will have to keep it plugged in to guarantee the video is always being recorded.
This one no but HP F210 have.
The Tablet that I Have also has Telephone Capability so that it works the same as a Cell Phone.
We provide the warranty, not AT.
The SoundLink Mini power supply is not compatible with the Soundlink III. Parts for the SoundLink III can be ordered by calling 800 367 4008.
Yes, it has Bluetooth.
This projector has a hdmi port, which is what is needed to have chromecast. So yes its compatible
I use a laptop with external speaker. I don't use the projectors speaker.
Yes, per the User Manual Technical Specifications: "Rated frequency 50/60 Hz Power supply 100 to 240 VAC 10% 2.9 to 1.3 A"
Yes with pre installed google play store there are thousands apps including books and bible you can down load to this awesome tablet.
I don't know my dear when I got my tablet it didn't go on dem but go in the settings and see if you can find it there when I got my tablet it only work for 3 months and stop working there after better luck with yours
20/1.7 or 14/2.5? I chose the 14 and have been pleased with the choice. It is perfect with street scenes, mountains and forests. In addition l, it is a pancake lens and packs light.
No. While of course it's overall size depends on the lens mounted, the GX7 is by no means a tiny, pocket sized camera which is one reason it offers so many wonderful features and feels so good and operorates so well in hand. This is a camera that can be shot with professionally all day. For pocket size you have to look at the GX 7's smaller brother, the GM1. I sure love the camera though. Hope this helps.
Honestly, I'm not familiar with this brand of canvas, but I'm of course familiar with canvas in general. I have to say, the leather is fantastic, it appeals visualy, tacitly and the scent of the leather is appealing. I waited a long time to make the purchase trying to make a decision. Now that I have the bag, I can't believe I waited. For me and my taste, it's leather all the way.
It fits perfectly if you have the headband adjusted to it's smallest size, otherwise it stresses the structure.
Yes
Yes you can you just have to download play store from an external website it's easy to find just Google it
Yes it does come with a charger
I do I do for nothing!!
It did/does on ours tooo until I didnt pull tight at switch tight around that area....its around but not fastened at frame or screen as rest of case.. can only describe in pic I think..the buttons work fine loosened case and tablet still protected. Personally I think they need to remold the and send us new ones for the price we paid.
Not sure. It fits a tab 3 perfect. Look up the dimensions for the tab 4. I would think they be the same. If they are off a little bit it won't fit because the case fits the tab 3 to exact dimensions.
The device worked well initially. The app is virtually useless now. I only use the device as a battery.
Since one answer says 6x8 and one says 4x6 I thought I'd add my answer: it's just under 4x6. Mine measures 3 9/16" wide x 5 15/16" tall. The thickness is 7/16" with the pen attached.
We had the same problem with the Jot. Likely the built in battery, possibly the switch. I contacted the manufacturer thru their website and the y sent a new one.
Actually I didn't use it. I still have it in the box for my niece. I'll travel next Friday. When she use it I'll told you how it does :)
If you send to Evernote as an image then it will do handwriting recognition so you also get searchable text. If you send as a pdf my experience is Evernote does not perform handwriting recognition on the pdf.
You need a steep down for do this! not steep up.
If you get an answer let me know
That's what is claimed but you will get a tremendous amount of heat by doing that.
If you have a Tivo Premiere (Series 4; any model) or a Tivo HD (Series 3), the Roamio Pro is a nice upgrade. If you are upgrading from a Series 4 model, the HD menu speed and responsiveness is great. Record 6 shows and Stream to tablet or outside home. Streaming from another location, like on vacation or at a relative's house, is a work in progress.
No. Roamio only works with cable TV.
You need a cable card to interface to your provider. Cable card lets your Tivo look like a STbox to the provider. I have Verizon FIOS cable card is an M-Card and is $4.99 + tax monthly.
I just spoke with TIVO chat and they said you can add lifetime to the box purchased from Amazon at time of activation.
EVGA has a global warranty. However, you would have to either send it back to Amazon for RMA, or to EVGA Taiwan as they don't have a presence in Australia.
Seriously not that much that makes you pay more not worth it
I have an iPad mini and it works great, with a cover. I am. Ot familiar we the size of the Galaxy
Hard to say, but as I know, it will work well with Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300 Galaxy S4 i9500 Galaxy Note 2 N7100, maybe some other items, which have vga inputs.
It has Google Play Android Market inside, you can search Taiwan TV applications and install. And we can pre-install one application with Taiwan channels for you if you need.
No, it most likely wouldn't, since the case is specifically for the beats studio 2, so if the headphones you have is exactly the same size as beats studio, then yes, otherwise unfortunately no
Yes
Yes, you can. Actually it comes with two cords, one normal and the other has a remote control with a mic incorporated, for skip, play/pause tracks and answer the phone. You have to choose the right kit, it comes with an apple devices kit, or android kit...
I bought the same model, DON'T BUY ELECTRONICS ONLINE, warranty is not valid after 30 days, mine stopped charging at day 40, Spend a few more bucks where you can bring them back and get refund or another set. By the way, NOT bluetooth
No
I wear glasses, and while it does take some adjustment, it works out fine for me. I found the best results by raising the temples of my glasses a bit so that the arms of the Bluez rest just under them. It shouldn't affect your vision nor the conduction of sound. It will take a bit of playing around. I really enjoy mine.
They have a limited 1 yr warranty and 30 day money back guarantee. If broken from abuse, they might even have a 50% off a new pair in a certain time frame. Not having to do any of the mentioned scenarios, can't guarantee. So far they seem durable and work great.
My experience has indicated a home wi fi will not interfere with the system.
If you have direct line of sight: probably. If you're going through walls: probably not.
If your cable box and TV have RCA plug receptacles ( yellow, white,& red plugs)
Very well. I received the unit today, and made several calls using the earbuds/Mic. Extremely clear. Much clearer than even a $125 set of Bluetooth headset.
They have them on their website for 3.99
Hi Roy, Good question! We don't recommend you use any earbuds when you're sleeping. But, if you're just taking a rest Zipbuds would be more than comfortable! As always, exercise safety first. If you have any other questions please don't hesitate to reach out via our website contact form and we'd be more than happy to help out. Best, Zipbuds Chris
Yes they are angled so they won't fit in the wrong ear. I use mine at night all the time and never have a problem. I love them.
Yes the closer the TVs are the better. I use them in a Motorhome where they are only 10' apart but it works great
Yes USB is a standard. We have used it for ours without issue.
Yes. It works great with mine.
Have never had an issue, worn during multiple paintball events all summer and during the rain.
No it is a free upgrade. Windows 7 is still preferred in most corporate environments and Win 8 offers few benefits if you don't have a touch screen so they are giving you the option to upgrade in the future. It is a no strings attached deal.
These tablets are not set up to do this as far as increasing real estate if I understand your question correctly. However it will easily project to another screen using the built in Miri cast software on TV and monitors that have Mir cast built into them such as smart TV's and various other streaming devices. Many blue ray players have this ability and Amazon's TV and Roko's and others.
Yes this computer have Bluetooth. I want to recomend you soomething else If I may. Buy one with al list 8gb on ram. Trust me this kind if lap tops needs a bit more gigs on RAM.
Not at all.
Manual focus only, and you need to use the 18-55 lens or maybe a prime lens...the camera does not detect the other lenses through the contacts.
I had the same problem and agree it is useless. I got rid of it after a week.
I think best buy sells a charger that'll fit it. It doesn't cost much either.
If your MP3 device has Bluetooth capabilities, then it will certainly work. Keep in mind these headphones work only if your device and these headphones have a direct line of sight.
Capacitive as opposed to resistive touchscreens "sense" touch by recognizing electrical impulses from touch. Resistive screens sense by pressure of the touch. Capacitive screens do not respond well to use of objects like a stylus.
Yes. But didnt even come with instructions. Constantly gives a busy signal every 20 seconds during the music. No response fromcseller. Dont waste your money
U may have to check your tablet to make sure its bluetooth capable if its not you cannot activate it or if it is bluetooth capable you may have to scan for an open device
black
Turning the wheel on top to 'M' allows for manually setting shutter speed and etc. with the built in software. I've never used it but it can be done.
4200 mAh
Yes, it has gravity sensor , the picture can rotate automatically.
No , it can not play xbox 360 games .
Seems to be good. It was purchased for my 9yr old son and he has not mentioned anything.
Yes it does.
yes, mine was supposed to have a 8g to. I think all the apps that was installed on the tablet used over half of the 8g
The battery will last for 10 hours of music playtime and yes it works with windows phone
I feel it wold work for you. When it is not on our boat--it is out pickup. The boom box can make you want to get out of the truck--it is loud. We enjoy of boom wireless.
Unable to get it to pair with Bluetooth in my PC. Even downloaded the mini boom app.
Yes as long as you have a wireless computer
There is a setting for auto start. I don't use that option, so can't speak to how well it works. I use the manual start/stop option.
Yes you can. It will work for all the lines in series, if you install this one before the split off jack.
No it does not and the hole the lock goes through is only big enough for a luggage type lock
Unfortunately it's got nothing - no optical either. I was pretty disappointed after my purchase, and returned it as soon as I realized my mistake.
Dear Customer, Thank you for your email. Yes, our QV-1 LCD ViewFinder will fit the Canon 6D. Best Wishes
Nope. It screw mounts to the thread on the base of the camera. There's a little play, but not that much.
The cord on the X11 is straight. I don't know about the X11i.
Two Year Replacement
Hello Melanie, it does not play multiple CD's.
If you are referring to a USB drive externally, and yes it has a USB port on the front right hand side. You can load music on that and listen too
download Google tv remote on both devices and enjoy
I don't believe so. The box is compatible with fat 32 formatted and NTFS formatted drives, but not Mac formatted drives.
Yes, as long as you're using only a single GPU and are not running an SLI build.
Yes. All CUDA enabled cards should support OpenCL.
They have built-in speakers. They have an FM modulator, so you can play it through your car radio. The headphones worked the best.
They move from 105mm center to center out to 230mm center to center, in order to fit just about any vehicle.
Yes it does - 3-in-1 Card Reader (SD / SDHC / SDXC) - thanks!
Yes its an anti-glare matte type screen.
Yes is does; 3-in-1 card reader (SD / SDHC / SDXC ) - thanks!
It's really good. I haven't noticed any difference between indoor and outdoor readability quality. I frequently use the automated adjusted screen backlit setting.
Yes batteries die quick becouse of all the apps
I am so disappointed in this device,it is the worst I have ever purchase .I can't use it I am now using a Asus brand which is better brand.Sorry I can't help you for me it was not a good buy.
There isn't one
The case dimensions are 15"x10" if your laptop is of the same dimension then it will fit.
This is for all models note books. You note must be a slim like Mac Air not thicker than Mac PRO in order to fit correctly. A 13 note inches note will fit more appropriate for this notebook briefcase.
no zoom, only focus
Without day light it is perfect!
Yes works great with my xbox 360 and xbox one.
Yes, I bought this product for the Sony s tablet and it works just fine!!
We are located in los Angeles, California..
Yes no problem. You do not need to modify the registry.
Yes, the power supply accepted from 100v to 240v AC.
Check if hissing plugged in without batteries installed , if it does you know its not the batteries hissing. If only hear when charging ,wearing safety glasses, check for a over heated or leaking battery.Use only batteries charger is designed to charge.if all checks out should be OK. I never leave home while charging and have my chargers on a boot tray in work area and check during charging period.
yea but as long as you get it in a little bit it worked for me
Absolutely! It comes with all of the power cables you need to power 2 video cards with 2x 6pin power cable each. Or it can power 6 cards with 1x 6 pin power adapter requirements. I run 4x R9 270 off of it currently and it does an excellent job!
If the two cards can potentially max out over 1000 Watts I wouldn't risk it.
Yes.
If it has a headphone jack then yes.
No. Not in my experience. And, I use them every day.
No real need to do that. If you set the timer to 10 mins. it will just record in successive 10 min increments until the SD card is full at which time it will be to erase segments, oldest first and re record over them.
Most likely not. It's a very precise fit for the nexus 7 2013 model. Even the 2012 model wouldn't fit in this.
there is only one action to take - contact the seller/manufacturer. your keyboard has just failed, and being sealed, there isn't anything YOU can do about it. in the world of computers, dead keys are not an anomaly.
its a cheap keyboard
How do you determine what the CPU speed? Mine appears to have 8 GB, but the memory is partitioned poorly, 1GB Internal and 5.6GB NAND so you are not able to load many applications at all, even if you add an SD card and move some of the application data to SD. In short this thing is very disappointing. I have also seen a lot of issues running applications from the Play store. It is OK for a browser, Pandora, iHeart Radio, Dropbox and Citrix Reciever, but definitely not for games.
Sorry, I gave it to someone as a gift. I'm not very computer savvy. Wish I could help.
Works great in both my 7D and my 1D Mark III. I don't shoot vider, but the quickness allows multiple shots at full speed.
The CF card will work on the D200. You'll have to check the specs on the d70.
Yes, it has a USB plug and HDMI.
Hello, I believe what you are asking is will it AF with your body. As this lens is an AF-S lens, and thus has the focusing motor built into the lens, it will AF with Nikon bodies like the D5000 that do not have a focusing motor built into the body. Thanks, please let us know if you have any other questions.
Yes
Less pixels will help battery life you can also use Lithium batteries. I like the camera, I like what it does and it's ease of use. I have accepted the fact I use a few batteries so I make sure I have a spare.
I don't see why a 64 gb wouldn't work the size of the card shouldn't make any difference but to be honest I have not tried a 64 yet so I couldn't tell you for sure. Good luck I hope it works out for you!
I've used mine in both my truck, and my motorhome. The sound is very acceptable. Not as good as a built in, dedicated sound system, but I wouldn't expect that. You'll get from 8-10 hours of battery life, after that you'll either need to find a 12 volt adapter or use a small inverter as it only comes with a dedicated transformer/charger.
its been a while since we have purchased it. We found this bracket to be very useful. We are using this bracket stand at our business front counter so customers can check in.
No. You apparently need a 2014 model to get the 4k Netflix content. Sharp has a new model coming out in September that should be able to streak Netflix in 4k, assuming you have the bandwidth.
Yes. I'm a huge hockey fan and I've never had an issue following the puck or anything. Also, as a sports fan I think the 4K is great because you get exceptional video quality regardless of viewing distance.
No
Yes
Hi, Charging mechanism for this Sony Walkman NWZE384 is via USB cable (mini-B) in which you can connect to a computer using USB port. You may check on this Sony USB charger (model: AC-UD11) and use the supplied USB cable for the Walkman, connect it this charger and connect it to your wall. Hope this helps. Ely
no
Yes, with this gadget you can connect anything that uses good old fashioned RCA stereo plugs. You might have to turn the volume up a bit more, but it works just fine.
There's no plastic covering the screen .the flap does cover the front of the tablet and also locks via two magnets ingeniously built into the cover.the case is very well designed for form and functionality.it is a perfect fit for the sero 7 pro and has a nice sturdy feel in hand..1000% satisfied .illumishield screen protector took care of the screen protection issue(bought together)installed fast easy and bubble free do not buy EZgardZ screen protector they are impossible to install or remove bubbles
Yes the cover is magnetised so it won't open by itself.
I'm having the same problem
Our dvd players whole top needs to open to load. This holder has a spring loaded back which is easy to slide the player out and back in without any trouble and keeps it snug so it doesn't bounce around while driving. It took a few times to get the arms adjusted right and to practice removing it but now my son who is 6 can change dvd's without help. it was a good buy for us.
Remove headrest and slide on the bracket. Replace the headrest and tighten the bracket. The faceplate has a spring. Just place the DVD player into the bracket and adjust the sides and tighten. If you have a DVD player that opens, you may have to remove the player to add/remove DVDs.
yes, it did.
It preserves the stereo sound it actually has a pretty good quality . The only down for me was the auxiliary cable always getting in the way .
It's sound and motion. It will stay on but will turn off unless something passes it or makes a continuous sound
Yes!!!!
Since the DBPOWER LED 1080P projector uses an LED array and NOT a bulb it is NOT a user replaceable part as far as I know. Try contacting the vendor directly for a definitive answer.
Make sure you set your sound source to Line. Otherwise it won't play out the speakers.
I'm not sure. I returned this product. The instructions were very vague.
Yes it can. The output of this device is the standard 3.5mm audio plug, your car stereo need to either have the aux input or if your stereo has the RCA input (white and red L/R input) in the back you can use a 3.5mm to RCA converter cable. The device also needs a micro USB power input, something that plugs into the cigarette lighter will work. Sound is very clear, I use it at home connected to my living room receiver via 3.5mm cable, no static at all.
of course if you can
Don't know if this helps but I know it's 720p
I have a MAC and so I had the same problem, but there is an icon in the upper right of the screen that you can use to adjust the volume. All computers have a way to do it without the use of a keyboard, so you just have to figure out how to do yours.
I've bought eight (8) Dash Cam camera's from this seller and I didn't see a "purple rubber piece" in any of the ones I bought. You may have something newer than I have.
To set continuos recording on this DVR-027 Dash Cam, all you have to do is make sure you plug it into a "continuos" cigarette lighter outlet plug, and leave it on / running. I just did this for my son. So just make sure your camera is ON and running when you turn your vehicle off, via the cigarette lighter outlet plug. If your cigarette lighter outlet plug turns off when you shut off your vehicle's ignition, then you will have to hard wire another cigarette lighter outlet separately, in order to achieve the "ALWAYS ON" function needed.
Yes. T3i is Canon 600D and it is in support list. I think you can get new angles and you can transfer videos to smartphones/PC/Mac with WiFi and it's convenient. If you are away from your computer when you are traveling with your camera, you can always use this tool to copy files to your smartphone and share via internet.
Terminals are enclosed. This is the only manufacturer image available. It is similar in construction to the ACX-10. We can ship today, if you order from us soon.
I just tested it out and plugged it into a USB 2.0 port and it has been just as stable with almost the same speed as when plugged into my usb 3.0 port.
yes, it does show name, and artist as long as you log it inwhen you add songs (such as off a CD)
I purchased this bag and I am very happy with it. Handles are very comfortable. To answer your question. I carry laptop (HP255), I pad, makeup small pouch, scarf, and sometimes shoes (as i bike in the city). I have even put a helmet without a problem. I am petite, this bag doesn't appear big but when you need to make things fit its wonderful. Hope this helps. :)
The mount is compatible with VESA 100x100. You should however consider the width of the TV and the mount. If the width of the TV is less than 24", the mount will be visible behind the TV.
I don't know about the sound elements to the camera. I only use it for still photos. It works great for those. -regards, Dan
I have no idea it says it should be placed in the dash as far forward as possible
This package does not contain a disc....it contains the key for a download
Yes it is. I install it on macbook and it is doning well, no problem so far.
Same. Also realize no Operating System installation media has the latest drivers - otherwise they would have to re-package and re-stock too frequently. You just install the currently available version and upgrade the drivers during the upgrade.
Don't even try, it is not powerful enough.
No hope of upgrading with this also. Discontinued.
No, I use plex to watch recorded stuff
No, it does not have a card reader slot. Thanks, PCrush
No, Gen 1. Gen 2 is a bigger phone. Trident doesn't show a case for it yet on their website.
The Lorex 360 IP POE NVR (network video recorder) system has preloaded software and finds the camera in about a minute. Plug all cameras in before turning on power to NVR.
either way you are good with the two cameras, the thing is, this one is more sensitive to deep sky objects and have a high frame rate for solar system objects
Yes
Safraz, This model does not have an audio output, so connecting your audio bar directly to your cable/sat box or other source device would be recommended. Thanks for your interest in Samsung televisions. --Mr. S
Yes, it has a headphone jack.
That is a very good question, but I cannot answer it. I don't have a loop DVD or I'd try it for you. Sorry.
Dear Ananth, Thanks for your inquiry. This is a solid state integrated amplifier. The power output depends on what type of speakers you are using and can range from 45 watts to 60 watts. Eric C
Yes, I'm presently living in Australia. The Onkyo came supplied with a US power cord I simply looked through my 30 Kilos of spare electronics cords to find the Aus version and plug it in. Many electronic devices use this type of connector including laptop chargers and electric shavers. I'm extremely happy with my LS-T10.
No. the CD6005 USB port is not compatible with the USB port on computers. it will only accept apple devices like ipods and ipads, and USB devices like thumb drives, and external hard drives.
I have not had to replace the battery for the last two years. Since the price is so reasonable, I would purchase a new one instead of replace the battery. It is nor worthy replace the battery. I hope that help.
I don't remember getting a warranty either. I find less expensive items tend to come without warranty. I think the shipping back and forth charges would be more than I paid for itq
If you hold your iPad with the home button on the bottom, there is a button on the top right side, that if you press quickly, will turn the screen off. When you are ready to resume using your iPad, simply press your home button in the middle bottom part of your iPad and the screen will reappear.
Battery dead on it? Try charging ... I have found with this product that if pressed closed too tightly, it can continuously press button(s) which will drain the rechargable battery quicker. A few hours on the included charger should fix that ... if not, warranty service may be required.
I did youtube from browser, looked like hd.... on setting 1920x
My daughter has a 13 inch white macbook but no speck case. She also has documents in the case along with it. I suspect it will fit with the speck case but may be a tight fit. My daughter loves it and it seems to be good quality
Yes
It handles minecraft and photoshop alright, I have both on my 256 GB SP1, but I'd recommend increasing the amount of ram you can use for minecraft to get better performance out of it. It's an integrated gpu and the ram usage is locked down so I wouldn't expect a huge amount of graphics horsepower.
Yes, please check Amazon listing.
Yes, but keep in mind it only worked for 2 months
Only Wordpad. It does come with a free trial of Microsoft Office as well, but you would need to buy it to keep it. Personally, I just downloaded OpenOffice, it's free.
Same dillemma here. I haven't been able to change to km :(
There is a play back on the unit itself. Do not need to connect to computer. Computer is only used for speed display and also gps.
Yes. If your Dashboard is flat enough to hold the suction. You might get a lot of shaky video by mounting it on the dash though.
if you have a double din, It should fit!
It worked with my MacBook Pro but I returned it due to issues I had with certain mp3 formats
Mine in not working also
It depends on if the book is in WP3 wave format.
no, this is a bluetooth reciever... you need to buy a bluetooth for streaming
It has 1 USB-2 and 2 USB-3 PORTS, 1 HDMI, 1 VGA, and 1 Etherner port.
I don't know if they're still made, but there are some still available.
Without knowing the make/model, I can't tell you for sure. On my Victory Crops Country. I plugged it in, the blue light came on. I hit the pairing button, on the Otic unit, and paired it, with my phone. The bike head unit was on aux. After pairing, I simply played music, from my phone, as usual. No problem. I use it pretty much daily, during my rides.
Yes it does
Pen, it looks like it does, below of the MFR specs. Interfaces/Ports HDMI: Yes Total Number of USB Ports: 3 Number of USB 2.0 Ports: 1 Number of USB 3.0 Ports: 2 VGA: Yes Network (RJ-45): Yes Audio Line In: Yes Audio Line Out: Yes
Yes it does
The head unit, wire harness, remote, wired microphone, removal keys, 4 flat head screws #2 Phillips, 4 pan head screws, one tiny screw, trim ring for faceplate, mounting cage, and the instructions.
1 IN FRONT
Possibly, but there is an easier solution. The TiVo has an eSATA port which allows you to attach an external drive. I have a 1 TB Western Digital My Book AV DVR Expander (under $100 from Amazon) attached to mine. The TiVo automatically recognizes the external drive and transparently manages it as an extension of the internal drive. Easy, simple and effective.
There should be no holes. Where are the holes?
Yes, but audio will be somewhat muffled. it won't protect it completely from a hard hit or shock, but they are very tough.
They are the same camera size as the 3 so they should fit. I'm not really happy with the product, it's a cheap knock off and parts are not interchangeable with the GoPro product so if for instance you break a latch you can't swap it.
You will need a mounting bracket for each drive
The case will accept any standard PCI devices, including USB hubs, in the back.
Two 3.0 ports right on the front.
You would need to buy and install a WiFi card.
Thanks for your question. Cables are not supplied with the unit. They are optional.
I haven't tried to do that, but it is basically a 4 to 1 USB port...so it shoud be able to do that. Maybe you should ask an Apple Genius to be sure.
Yes.
Camera, battery, Charger.
Like the S90, it's decent at wide angle. At 24mm, it supports a maximum aperture of f/1.8 (so a little better). Plus, the newer processor will help reduce noise at higher ISO settings (again, a little better). For low light photography, you might look at a camera with a larger sensor like the Sony RX100 or RX100 II. I'd also look at the Panasonic LX7 if you need decent low light performance throughout the zoom range.
lcd display only
Yes, this camera has date stamp.
Yes. I used it for a soccer game with a Canon T3i (600D) and got some good results. The lens focuses fast, and the zoom is more than enough to get some good shots. I've since gotten the Canon 7D mark II, and it is even faster and better at focusing. Here's the Flickr album from the soccer game: https://www.flickr.com/photos/epi_ren/sets/72157647438740175/
Yes it does. The lens is nice and light and works great for video, being an STM lens.
No, just put them all on the same channels.
Yes it will. I have one in my 2010 genesis coupe and I also work for Hyundai manufacturing plant in Alabama and the only changes in the models are other than the horse power are small outer cosmetic changes. The trunk space is still the same.
Hi Those are the shipping package dimensions not the dimension of the speaker box. I don't have the dimensions of the speaker box here at the office but we've made and sold hundreds of these and they all fit, never had a fitment issue. Thanks
Amazingly yes. My 70 inch Samsung is hanging on the wall with it. The mount is pretty heavy. It's the real deal. I was surprised.
i really dont know because my husband put it up but i tell you is very good product i love it so dont hesitate to buy it my tv looks great im glad i bought it.
It'll only fit Cherry MX Keycaps, like it says in the title. I don't know what a Mac Air is (Macbook Air? iPad Air?), so I'd reference this site for more information concerning mechanical keyboards and how they work: http://www.overclock.net/t/491752/mechanical-keyboard-guide
Yes, an 18-55mm lens.
A brand name of a speaker as follows: "Logitech's Bluetooth speakers have proven to offer solid performance in small, affordable packages, and the UE Boom (named for the Ultimate Ears brand Logitech acquired) is no different." No reference to the TDK speaker.
Yes that appears to be correct. I tried it and mine stayed on but to get it to come on I had to press and hold the fn key and the right arrow for 3-5 seconds then it stayed on. If you then repeat that action it will turn it of. The Azio slim LED backlit keyboard is outstanding. DM
no you can set it up the same as any other regular hard drive
yes. they come with a spkr ear/mic for each radio. W2gli
I have no experience with iPAD Air. But I think it can work well with the iPAD Air according to the description on the product page as it demands no other driver software at all.
3 1/4 inches by 2 1/4 and 1 inch high. Sometimes I have to unplug it from the base and replug it to get it to work. Other then that happy with it.
Hi Chaska, Yes. It will fit 2013 13" MacBook Pro w/ Retina display. Thank you! Cici
Yes. I have connected multiple external hard drives to this hub. It is a powered hub and will power drives that are not externally powered themselves (Drives which have only a USB connector and no DC adapter input).
It works on both.
Sata only
I think it does. I hear the drive in it wind up when I start using the PC.
It sure does. I use it with my tablet all the time
18w x 14 1/2 deep x 5 1/2 tall.
Hi, This price is for one peephole camera only,not include the monitor. And we are directly factory of this item! Price for one peephole camera and monitor is USD130. Would you like to buy one set? Waiting for your early reply! Thanks Abby
I would imagine you can. I don't really know how the Vizio speakers are set up. The mounting is one screw or bolt. You may have to engineer something for your particular application. I have Logitech speakers and they are held on by a single screw to the back.
Yes. I bought this just for that reason. I have a battery case for an iPhone 5 and my headphone plug does not fit in the headphone hole in the battery case. This does the trick and it is just the right length.
Only the viewable area
You know I have the same camera. Yes it does work but only in manual, which is super annoying! And the picture is not as clear as I like. But I didnt buy it for a clear picture I just use it for wildlife (hunting) photographs. Hope this helps :)
I found it to be great
Yes if you have Google Chromecast. Just plug into HDMI and download app and it works great
It has 2 USB2's and 1 USB3.
Yes it charges with a standard micro usb. Kindle, non Apple phones, all charge this.
You need the TV volume. This is a chat headset.
No it will not. The EVL-3 runs off the 4-wire keypad bus on Honeywell VISTA series panels. Unfortunately the Lynx systems do not have a keypad bus and as such cannot use the EVL-3. If you are looking for a wireless Honeywell system that you will monitor yourself, we recommend the VISTA-20P with a 6160RF/6162RF keypad/wireless receiver combo in addition to the EVL-3.
Yes
Yes
Well, you can't use mine, but you can buy one like mine and it should work.
Hi This is a powered soundbar...it has all of the speakers inside. You may want to get a dedicated center channel if you already have left and right speakers. This is perfect if you currently have no speakers and want to upgrade the sound of your Tv.
No
YES
While I don't have the EVGA policy in front of me, I can promise you that an aftermarket solution will void the warranty. The company can't trust that you installed the cooling solution correctly, so why would they keep it under warranty?
The card itself is capable of SLI. Whether or not your motherboard and chipset are capable depends on what they are. But yes, you can certainly run two of these in SLI. Or three. Or four.
Mine wasn't bundled with a game, but I believe you register it with Steam.
Hi, Marie this Blueray DVD back panel offer basic surround sound ,one USB,one HDMI,one optical, one coaxial, one RCA video output,one LAN wire connect and power by JAVA and one USB on front panel,I bought this DVD just for watching multi region format only if you looking for wifi connection you better off buy Sony or Samsung brands for the money and quality and save hundred $... The Saachi brand quality ok ,a little bit noisy and sometime the machine not responding you have to unplug the power supply to reset would that answer you question
keyboard
NO backlit keyboard.
The 1TB and 2TB versions of this drive are 7200RPM, the 4TB version is 5900RPM. REF: http://www.seagate.com/www-content/product-content/sshd-fam/desktop-sshd/en-us/docs/100726566c.pdf
Just audio, no webcam/mic.
There are some very easy instructions to follow. It didn't take more than 15 minutes to set it all up.
No, it won't connect to your computer. You will need to purchase a transflash card which plugs into the glasses and an adapter also. After you have taken some picture you take the transflash card out, plug it into the adapter and plug that into your computer. I find it an easy and well thought out way of doing it. The card and adapter will be less than $20.
12 X 32 Zoom about 50FT
YES
Cards show up on desktop as they would with any other card reader so you can transfer data from the card or to it
Yes it does
If you mean prescription glasses, yes you can. I wear prescription glasses and these ones are big enough to fit on top of them. Not a perfect fit, but after a while you won't notice them. Hope this helps. Cheers!
No, but Windows 8.1 is a free upgrade that be downloaded and installed once you have the unit.
It doesn't detach, the keyboard is the cover that rest closed onto the screen. It is magnetic so when you close it the iPad turns off, just like the simple cover.
Yes, Scientist have been observing the Borg for quite some time. When they boarded the MotherShip, they apprehended special blue-tooth technology and bio-luminescent lightning from the Borg. Yes this is Borg technology....
The case does add a little weight, but the screen doesn't close until it's held like 2 inches away from shut. The case provides excellent grip. The computer does not move at all when typing. I also want to mention that this case makes it way easier to open the MacBook than without.
No, I have a MacBook Air 13 inch and all of the ports are accessible. It's a great case - especially for the price!
My husband said yes. They come with wire also.
I dont see why not - They are not super powerful but they sound awesome.
No idea but everything I've ever had from them has been rock solid, and this psu is fantastic.
They are preliade
Mine came with the speaker.
Nope, it's internal and hold power vey good with low light, aprox 3 hours and a half to 4 depends on ur work.
This is the GTX 750M, N550JK touch screen. Not sure about the RAM though. Excellent device. Cheers.
The company states that they use whatever drives they have on hand.
Yes
No
The laptop's system is preinstalld with windows 7 pro software and also comes with a license and media for windows pro software. You may only use one version of the Windows software at a time. Switching between versions will require you to uninstall one version and install in the other version. Thanks.
yes it does. It also comes with the option and the CD to change to windows 8 if you so desire.
Yes, it has bluetooth. Thanks.
Yes
2 days for Amazon Amazon Fulfillment (Prime customer) or 2-4 business days on seller fulfill order
Millions of laptops use the mini-card. Antennas play a big role; size, cable length, placement (near metal or electronic noise sources), and direction/orientation. That's where you'll see a difference.
Yes it is. I use it on my g network at work.
About 3.5ft
You would need to change out the whole motherboard. It wouldn't be easy or possible even supported unfortunately
Mine did. Its a compact charger with the acdc conversion all in the plug and it plugs in 4 different ways.
Mine has 100-230 volts adapter with 50-60 hz, i guess will work on both.
yes i always use more than one Bluetooth device in the same room without any kind of interference, but i dont know if the item is going to have the same behavior with you. Thanks!
about 3-4 hours
The Ultra Book was a gift to my granddaughter and as far as I know it is exactly what she asked for. She is very happy with it.
Absolutely. The cover folds both forward to cover the screen and backwards to serve as a stand. Further, the strap can serve as a handle or over the cover to hold the cover closed. Just remember, if you want to iPad to go to sleep when you close the cover, insure you have the home button on the right hand side when you close the cover.
It's very light, I'd say it measures in grams. Yes, magnetic closures. I just got mine and love it.
Mine did not come with a stylus.
I think they are plastic....ribbed
It has Page Up and Page Down keys that work within a single document or email. The keys do not navigate to a previous page on a browser screen. The Page Up/Down functions are accessed through the "Function" key and Down or Up Arrow keys.
Try changing the "AA" battery. If this does not work, I don't know what do to.
I have the mini with retina display and it "fits" jut fine. There is a magnetic strip on the side that attaches to the iPad magnetically (of course) so there really isn't anything to hamper it fitting. It is just the keyboard, there is no back to it. There is a slot that the mini can rest in as a stand when you're typing.
I got this battery for my Canon PowerShot SX510HS camera and I like the entire system, camera and rechargeable battery. The camera came with a compact wall-charger that simply plugs in. Therefore, I do not know if it works with the SD750. I can only say it works with the SX camera.
yes, it have, and Rotation angle: Horizontal&#65306;355, vertical: 90
The anti glare works well, have even used my ipad outdoors without a problem.
I use a stylus with a rubber end and it has made no marks or dents. The tech armour completely covers the entire screen except for the home button and camera. I am very pleased with the product. It also doesn't seem to get too marked up with fingerprints and is easy to wipe clean with the cloth it came with. I would purchase this product again for other screens.
I have not noticed any effects like that. The iPad Air 2 continues to depict its anitglare component
yes, this part is compatible for that unit. Thanks for checking.
Dear Friend, Thanks for your email, but we only could post the small package to Brazil, we couldn't post this package to Brazil. Have a nice day. Best regards Joey
I use these headphones AT LEAST five days a week on my way train ride to work. I use the remote everyday to skip songs and adjust volume (since I don't use iTunes sound check). The remote hasn't failed on me and is built with the same metal material the other pieces are made of. You will find that the plastic button part has a little "lateral play" in it but so far it hasn't been an issue. Build quality appears to be top notch. Especially when you consider these are under $200.
The noise isolation is superb. I use these at the gym and it does a great job at canceling out the music that the gym plays.
The T51p is pretty true to sound. If a song has deep bass it is produced with good impact without distortion or bloat. When I first got them I didn't like the way they sounded but after about 48 hours of continuous burn in, I love the way they sound. You can hear all the subtle details in the music and everything is crystal clear. It's one of the best portable headphones I own.
Over an ATT network I can hear clearly and be heard by the person on the other end. This may depend on the quality of connection I guess but I have not had any problems.
no
I could not get this system to work. I therefore return the system. I purchased First Alert Wireless security system DWS-472. I purchased a second system and have the four cameras viewing through one monitor. I am pleased with that system since March 2014.
Cheryl- please go direct to the Liftmaster website. Then type this in. On the brocure it gives you every single dimension on it.
I've looked up your service tag on Dell's support site for your laptop configuration and I can confirm that this screen will work with it.
Approx 3" wide by 5" tall.... Though I did not like this product. I put new batteries in it and worked when I tested it. The next day I took it to my office and they did not work. Hoping I can send it back still.
it is the wosrt piece of equipment ive purchased its battery consumption is excessive it worked for one week i lost the return documentation or i would have long since sent it back
No. This is a solid lens, but you will need to use a tripod for low light, and a higher shutter speed if you are hand holding while zooming.
This Antenna does not bring in FM stations
Depends on the size of their head. The speakers have a strong spring (ie. the bottom of the headphones close snuggly). They might not stay on the head if your 1 year old is walking around but if sitting I would presume it would be fine. From the top of speaker to the headband it's 3 1/4". The inside width is 5 3/4".
No, it's not long enough for that.
No, they are not foldable.
2 ohm. I guess the complete answer didn't publish.
It may be that your devices connected are drawing more power then the hub can handle. That happened to me when I plugged in more than five devices. I have ten things to power/data transfer, but I have to use two of these 10 port hubs. After about 2.5 amps (12.5 watts) of total draw, the hub is not reliable. Hope this helps.
Aloha, Maria. I have no idea. Sorry. I wanted extra USP ports and liked the features. I am thrilled with this product.
I did have it, I looked up how to hook them all together and I did, but there were missing pieces that were "free" included with the headset, but there was nothing there. I looks up on my own time if this was a common problem with this headset and company and turns out it is.
Very light, very thin. If you are new to the new Nexus 7 (coming from the 1st Gen) you will not even notice the case. The new tablet and case together weigh less than the old tablet does. The only thing is that the buttons are set so far back that they're hard to find, but that's not the case's flaw.
So this is a tricky question. On my unit, I can upload bike routes that I have downloaded from sites like Geoladders. They show up under saved routes. I can just upload them, start the route then the GPS will guide me. There seems to be relatively frequent map updates but I don't know how (or if) you can upload a new large scale GPS map.
That depends of your budget and your visual and performance tastes on playing. For a wide middle-range gaming experience, a single one is more than enough.
I've used many gpx files from RideWithGPS with no problem. I would assume a similar export from MapMyRide would work also.
It's not bad most of the time, but you'll occasionally get some glare. I run mine fully back lit all the time and just charge it accordingly. Also, you can buy a screen protector that's glare-free and just cut it down to fit the Touring Plus.
Hi Maksym. From Dell's website, the specs say ELECTRICAL Voltage Required: 100 to 240 VAC / 50 or 60 Hz 3Hz / 1.2 A (typical) Power Consumption (Operational): 20W (typical) / 38W (maximum) So I would say you should be able to connect it to 220v with the correct cable which would be: Manufacturer Part# : 0H370 | Dell Part# : 450-14023
The standard length 6 1/2 ft if your using the screw in, but they give you other cords if you need them
Matte finish.
You can get a scratch repair kit from computer stores and computer sections of dept stores, you can also make use of the scratch repair kit in other similar surface that have scratch issues.
They are RGB order
1.8 cm all sides.
I believe it has a 1 year warranty, but I haven't tried calling them or anything, having a warranty doesn't mean for sure they'll honor it. I recommend purchasing it with a credit card with an extended warranty, American Express cards usually have this by default, other cards some do, some don't.
I've used this drive for back-ups for all of my files (about 350-40 GB), and I haven't noticed any heat issues. You should be ok.
5.3 x 3.4 x 0.7 inches ; 6.4 ounces. This information is listed right in the product details.
It will support VT-D and VT-X here is a full specs page for it http://ark.intel.com/products/77780
One year according to the offer in the box. No indication what cost is afterwards or how long you have to move the "extra storage" before offer expires.
Shelley, I have the iPad Air... It fits well. However, the quality is lacking big time. I have had to get 2 replacements so far due to keys popping off the keyboard and the case falling apart. I had a different case previously (for my iPad 2) from Kensington that was fantastic. This one is just poor quality. Kensington has been great sending replacements, but I'd look for a different case... Zagg makes a good one I hear.
I have an iPad Air, but don't know the model number. It should be compatible with your model, however. The Kensington cover/keyboard I purchased had an excellent wireless keyboard, however the hard plastic case holding the iPad Air cracked.
It does not fit the iPad 2
After the 3820 the old general rule "if the socket fits the cpu it works" is out the window. The best place to check is at Intel's CPU compatibility check list of mainboards that work with a specific CPU and sometimes you can find a confirmation for a specific mainboard at the mainboards website for a list of compatible cpu's. Here is a link to Intel that will help, http://processormatch.intel.com/. A1 Mobile Computer, a1mc.net Dale Poston
Hi, this model has 4 physical cores and 8 threads with hyper-threading technology it's really great!
Yes
Yes, it is. I programmed the samsung galaxy tab 3 to my tv in a matter of seconds with the case on.
Not this model of the case...The cut-outs would be all wrong...
sorry i have no clue. it seems like it would be hard to find
It's my daughter's and I asked her--she said she thinks so. It is a nice bag, I have to say. Not enormous, that would be ugly, but I think big enough.
Its not bulky at all. It is very cheaply made though and has an odor of chemicals.
Yes
The light has a female 1/4" thread at the bottom, which can be mounted on a standard camera tripod. There is also a handle that comes with the light that screws into the 1/4" receiver, for handheld use. The handle has a hollow base and fits loosely over a typical light stand. I prefer to use an additional adjustable bracket for more control. See my Amazon review of this item for the specific bracket.
I've ordered 3 lights from 2 vendors from this item page, and all came bundled with a power supply (packaged separately from the main box the light comes in). It may be optional in some parts of the world but appears to be included with this Amazon item. The light can also run on Sony-compatible batteries. Note that there is a quirk: You need two batteries if you want to use both color temps of LEDs simultaneously. Each battery lights one set of 300.
Yes. The DVR (NVR in this case) will work just fine with or without an internet connection. Without an internet connection you just can't access the video remotely.
Yes but os on air vision is Linux and it's command line only. There is no gui on air vision box. So yes, but not for camera monitor.
Go to EVGA's website. It has backplates that fit with each of their specific graphics cards then come back to amazon and look it up by the part number.
According to the compatibility list it is supported. Here is the link for you to verify, just in case. http://www.evga.com/Products/Product.aspx?pn=100-BP-2770-B9
Yes it will
Yes, do a search for "Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player". This provides wireless connectivity to HDMI...
Yes
Mine is a 2009, so I assume they shall fit your as well.
This monitor is awesome .It comes with everything you need to hook up to your computer or tv.The cabels included are the following,HDMI,MHL,VGA and a power block.
The Height is the same but it will not work very well with two 27" variants. Unless you buy three of these units. It will not conform to the other two monitors. I own 3 of these units for aircraft simulators and office work, and can say I attempted to use it as a middle monitor for my previous 27 inch Samsung LED units and it didn't work too well. I ended up purchasing 2 more of these units because of the quality and price. Hope this helps.
not sure but the seller has a link that tells all models this will work on.
Yes it is possible.
YES, with one button.
this thing is huge, it will fit my denon d5000 or akg k700 with room to spare. it may be too big for the mdr z7.
Yes
It is just a diffuser, not a light.
Try looking at Google images under the search "before after flash diffuser"
My flash is Sunpak and it's perfectly fit.
yes...mine works perfect
Wouldn't be answer any question about this product. Since I had to return it, because it wasn't working .
Hold button down for 3-5 seconds.will be green that's on. Push again for 5 seconds it flashes red. That's recording
The pen itself never worked for me, I could not get a response from the manufacturer....do not buy if you have not already.
The camera connects to a USB port in your computer, then you may upload the pictures to the computer through a cable that comes with the camera/pen. if you can print digital pictures from off your computer, than yes, you can print the pictures you take with this camera.
You need to flash and use new frimware iwill send instraction how to flash may be tomorow
Its Has Google play store and free games and in-store purchases. I enjoy it. Just skip CC info if you don't feel like give them info.
It fits my iPad mini... Just fine.... So I would think it would!
The main difference is that the nex-6 has a viewfinder and the nex-5t does not. The Nex-5t is more compact. The nex-6 has a standard shoe for a flash but the nex-5t has a proprietary shoe that only accepts the nex compact flash. Otherwise, they have the same sensor and autofocus system.
Yes it does!
Yes
No. It's just an antenna.
It depends on your DVR.
Yes it can, the camera connection is BNC so it is a straight forward connection
No this camera will not work with the Lorex NVR (lnr380) you would need a camera that does 1080p this one only does I believe 700TVL. This camera uses a different wiring set up than the Lorex NVR (lnr380)
You get the disc in a box with loading instructions. The key code is included.
Yes, you can download the program from the Bitdefender website to your hard drive or any type of storage device then use the activation key from the CD to activate.
Yes, as long you download 2015 version from web site and use your serial number from this one there is no problem at all, I did it for my pc's
For this Belkin grip 2000 mAh battery case, you can charge it at 2 amps and it will take 1 hour. It will take a half hour at 4 amps.
It's surprisingly easy. It fits nicely and isn't loose at all, but when you want to take it out, it just pops out. It's excellent!
No it doesn't. Here is a reply I received from Belkin support. "The sleep/wake function is a setting on the iPad itself. You have the option to select or specify the time when your iPad will go to sleep when you close the cover." I have the Belkin keyboard case for the iPad 3 and when I close the case, the iPad goes to "sleep". As far as I can tell, this feature is NOT part of the Qode case for the iPad Air.
its good enough to play up to date games with settings just below best graphics and perform without any lag. and you can always purchase a better graphics card in the future
I have no idea but the hard drive has not giving me any problems, and it's a beast of a desktop
It's a quad core processor.
Asus does not provide specific model of the motherboard included; however, the motherboard chipset is the Intel H81 chipset (LGA 1150 Socket) with an integrated Intel HD Graphics 4600. The board also includes 2 x PCIex1 and 1 x PCIex16 expansion slots with 2 x USB 3.0 and 6 x USB 2.0 ports. Also includes both HDMI and VGA out. None of their current standalone Intel H81 chipset motherboards will have all of those features in one board.
The graphics card is an integrated Radeon HD 8570D.
I BELIVE SO
No restore disk. Once the computer is up and running it asks you to create a restore disk using a DVDR. So basically you have to create it once image desktop is up and running
Any amount but this system come with defective cameras
They work really well at night. Depends on the distance and the angle, but generally it does show the licence.
Not to my knowledge. The camera wasn't designed for that.
Yes it does! What people seem to think is the lens is actually a lens protector, as the camera has a protector installed when you buy it. And if you damage the original one, it's cheap to buy ($19.95) and easy to replace. It even comes with the tools to do so. Here's the replacement: https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/shop-by-accessories/other/virb-lens/prod119599.html
Yes, there are many artistic tools built into the program.
I purchased this software because of the answer you received from Donna but I cannot find any way to add music or create a DVD.
Yes, you can.
It fits the GH4 perfectly but it does NOT work properly with the GH4. If you insert a battery into this battery grip while mounted to the GH4, the GH4 will NOT power on. Read my review here. Thanks!
Yeah! If you use a Intel processor it will work. I'm using this PSU with an R9 280 and an Intel Core i5. You can simulate the power consumption of your computer on http://www.coolermaster.outervision.com/ It is very helpfull.
Yes, this can run a Titan as long as you're not running more than 1
Tested audio on Samsung TV and it works over HDMI.
Yes. MintBox 2 ships with internal 2.5" 500 GB HDD. It can be easily replaced by opening a single screw.
Yes
No
I couldn't find a cover to fit this tablet
No it doesn't!
No you can't. The apps are hardwired in the firmware. It is possible that LG might update the firmware at some point to include some other apps, but we don't know if or when that will happen.
As long as you use the special cable that the handwarmer came with to plug into a USB port, you can use it. However, the instructions make it clear that you MUST use the supplied cable, since it incorporates a smart charger that prevents overcharging of the battery.
TSA Checkpoint Friendly, Yes.
No, never had it wet inside
I have had many items in this bag and have stood it upright and it hasn't fallen over.. But maybe I had the right amount of items in that just didn't cause it to tip over. Just remember that you can always lean it against something of it comes down to you being worried about it needing to be stabilized.
Fits a MacBook Pro 13" comfortably widthwise with a couple inches of extra depth.
Greetings, Standard comes with Canon USA Warranty, import and Gray are not supported with Canon USA Warranty. at H and B Digital all our Canon items have a Canon USA Warranty.
I would say yes. I have the rebel t5i and t4i, it works fine, i don't see why it didn't on thee t1i.
There is a Hi and Lo setting, I have it set on low, and sitting in the window behind the drapes, and it isn't that loud.
No it did not come with keyboard
Version 2 of the X3 does, I believe this version is limited to 64GB support. FiiO releases firmware pretty regularly though, so they might have addressed it through that. Just be aware that there is a version 2 of the X3 and that might limit future updates of V1.
Currently there is no mid-range adjustment capability (at least in the latest firmware version 3.0. The cool thing about the bass and treble controls is that they are hardware based, directly adjusting the amplitude of both frequency ranges on the Wolfson DAC itself - not a software-based eq. There is an older beta firmare (2.14 beta, I believe - very similar in design to the latest release 3.0, but implemented an extra software eq function that seemed to have a subtle effect on the sound
Thank you for your question , actually most of track I've ripped by me from old CDs , the other part exchanged by my torrent friends , majority of tracks are 44.1/16bit , Fiio.net recommend hdtraks as also X3 came with discount card to by from HDTraks
Recommended placement for the REA20 would be between your router and the dead spot in your home. (As long as the signal strength of your home network is above 70%).
Is similar witn the extension rpt. As repeater.
I have this exact model and in my BIOS I can choose "SATA Mode" to be either "RAID" or "AHCI". It's set to RAID, and if I try to set it to AHCI it won't boot to windows. Probably because the partitions are unreadable as they were made in RAID mode. But, if you care enough to install the OS from scratch, you can probably set it to AHCI and use your two independently.
It'll definitely run AutoCad Lite, I've used it with Solidworks 2014 and it runs smoothly.
According to the website, the tablet itself weighs 2.4 lbs (with 4 cell battery).
I don't know mine is an iPad 2 , don't know what generation the air is, but it's says it's for the iPad 2,3 and 4
It works for the ipad mini. That is what my daughter uses it for. Fits great!
I think it does
I do on mine, mabe there's a way to shut that sound off. Still learning my camera.
ideal, light, easy to work with, I pick up about 16 channels normally
just hold the button down for about 10 seconds and it automatically scanned for the right dial location
VGA only
Recommended Resolution: 1366 x 768
Yes. But u won't need to. The battery last forever in mine.
If you have to buy an adapter for the stereo and a harness for the wires
It should fit fine if you have a single din slot, it's half the length of a normal single din unit
I am pretty sure there is a red and white rca colors on the back of the unit to connect to rca audio which is red and white.... Rca yellow wire is for video and you do not need that wire.
It will for sure. It works and sounds just as good with or without a television on top of it
26 1/2" 11 1/4 "
27.5 inches wide (side to side) by 12.5 inches tall (top to bottom) outside edge of bezel not including the stand
Mine did not come with a battery.
So do I. I can't get it to pair.
Not a perfect match without the battery grip for sure. However, with a fast enough shutter you should be able to get good shots considering the camera stabilization. I prefer to use the 50-200mm lens and this camera with a monopod. The lens as you know is a long one and can get tiring to handhold for long.
If you have certain lenses the focus ring pulls forward and back to enable Manual focus - if you can see a distance scale on the lens , you are in MF. And you might think AF doesn't work - just push the focus ring forward to get into AF
We are having pronlems to and looking for solution, for now we are working from the old desktop no from the fancy windows 8 screen
Home
Not sure i bought a coiple for my semi trucks recently they work great. Ill let you know when i find out which ones are compatible
I think so.
Try moving your keyboard back or closer to the receiver
You need an usb outlet.
It's BNC connection,but you need H D-S D I D V R
Don't know. Sorry.
I honestly don't know I bought it for my IPAD 3 and IPHONE5
That was MY only upgrade, everything else seemed sufficient.
These computers are modified. But in new condition. Just better.
Highly likely that it would work just fine, but you could probably roll your own hardware for cheaper than this if all you wanted to do was have a Debian box.
Works with VLC under Ubuntu as a regular webcam.
now out of stock, may in stock after few days,sorry, thanks
Yes , if you set up a wireless home network that's password protected - you should be able to see any other computer on the home network. Refer to your wires router for setup instructions.
I have not personally tested it ... but I have run Arch Linux and it does have NetworkManager support and good community support -- so it should work -- likey with little issues.
Yes - it will wifi connect your computer to any other wifi device on your network - including printers.
Yes, The gridlines are enabled by default but if you would like to disable them you can cut the white wire loop on the wiring harness to remove them.
I have had it for about three months now with no issues it works great it doesn't fog up in the rain and has a very clear picture day and night.
Yes ;)
No
B0 is blue and it just so happens to be discounted off the retail price. K0 is black and is selling for full retail. I've seen this happen before with products. I can tell you that when I bought mine in December both items were the same price.
Not it will not, 3rd and 4th Generation only
I've had mine for a few months - it works like my pen on my Wacom tablet - no clicking sounds. Contact Wacom directly
Eplida. However, you'll notice a bottleneck because of the core clock long before one from the memory.
The picture shows the GPU Reactor without the MSI cover on but yes, it will come with both.
Yes I had no problem using the item in the US
Hello. Yes, it is. Thanks.
It should say in ad or where your Looking. Google the nexus7 when they came out..note dates..
I don't know. I could never get it to work on windows. I returned it. I also could find and customer support.
Sorry. I messed up. It works great with Windows 8.1. With the bluray software, not included
it is USB 3.0. Thanks
According to the information provided, the TV "upconverts" automatically. In any event, I like the picture quality very much. I have not watched much UHD material, but the ordinary picture is very good. No complaints. The overall quality in my experience is just fine, too.
The top mounting holes are 10.25" from the top of the TV.
Thanks for your question. Yes, the output does do Dolby Digital 5.1. This is a fantastic TV. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Sony dealer.
This item is an MHL version.
This tv does NOT support the h.265 codec required for 4k streaming from Netflix or amazon
Yes. The tv has 3 (2.0 version) USB ports
Yes, you can.
To be honest I'm not sure. Sry
Mine stays on while in use
Yes
No the keys are not backlighted
It shouldn't blink, it's the number lock indicator
Size: 45cm x 11cm (18" x 4.3")
Not sure, I could measure if necessary. BUT it comes with a cord about 3 feet long with a power plug on it.
Yes it does, however it is a bit awkward. Light bar needs to be more user friendly. This is definitely a low-end type of viewer.
Hi There is no volume or mic adjustment on the headset, so please go to the control panel of your PC to adjust the setting on the outer speaker
I don't shoot video, but I've been out all day taking pics and have never gotten the battery below halfway. Usually it takes a couple days of shooting to get to half. The battery also recharges lightning fast!
I just checked the website for Focus Camera, it does include the 16-50mm lens. FYI, if you were looking to catch the deal before it expires, you have time since the rebate for $100 off holds until 1/4/2014 per their site. I hope that helps!
Hello, yes, there is HDMI interface
Native Resolution:320*240
Works well with my Chromebook, iPad and Galaxy S3 Andriod phone. If device has Bluetooth it should work
This case is for the "Droid Maxx" Not the RAZR maxx or RAZR maxx Hd
No, but it is shatterproof.
Greetings, Thank you for your interest in our products here at MITXPC. Due to the chassis size, this unit will be unable to support any PCI-E expansion. If you would like assistance in configuring a system to support your application, please send us a message and we'll be happy to assist you. Best regards, MITXPC
Greetings, Thank you for your interest in our products here at MITXPC. We cannot guarantee 100% compatibility (as of 9/23/2013) with Ubuntu 13.04 as the motherboard manufacturer does not provide a full set of Linux drivers. We would recommend checking via Ubuntu enthusiast forums for compatibility. Best regards, MITXPC
It will work with your tablet you dont need it but it is really handy if you do photography. We do underwater photography and use this to read our sd cards instead of carrying our laptop with us handy gadget
Ayrstone used to sell wireless video cameras that worked with this Hub. However, I think they got out of that segment of the market just like they stopped offering routers. Therefore, I am pretty certain that this would work with wireless video cameras. I have called their tech support line in the past prior to making purchases from them and they were extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Therefore, I am certain that if you called them, you could get a definitive answer to your question.
Hi, this antenna has the suctorial mounting base, normally you can install it on glass surface or just place it on a flat surface,the diameter of the base is about 5CM.
Hi, for the 12DB 3G antenna which you inquired, but pls kindly know that there is only SMA connector type type inventory in our AMAZON warehouse at present. If you request TS9 connector, pls order the correct item refer to the following link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EC4K74E we'll customize the connector and sent it to you. thanks.
No they are not
NO, It can not Project desktop PC screen to TV at present.
Item passed a 3 meter drop test as well as being shock proof. I dropped mine on a cement driveway, still works fine.
Mine has a WD10JPVT Scorpio Blue drive. 1TB.
Yes.
Naa. That won't happen. You can only connect to one speaker at a time, and if you want to use two of them, you will have to connect it using wires.
No it will not
It works perfectly, and protect your tablet from scratch, falls, dust. Sometimes you feel it kind of big, but in my case, I don't care.
This case is fully functional for the Note 8.0 with the exception of SD access, but none of my Otterbox cases allow access to SD card port. I feel like even if there was access to this port it would be about impossible to remove with the remainder of the case in the way. Maybe the user with this claim was using it for a similar tablet like the Tab (??)...
Dust proof under normal conditions. No waterproof ... it has breather holes..
Screen protector works well. I've yet to see any dust buildup underneath it after 3 months of use.
yes
I believe the only APP available for DirecTV on Windows is for the Sunday Ticket
yes it comes with office
Totally can be fit, but need to remove the middle section hdd cage in order to do so
Yes
yes it does
Have not tried that, sorry
No
yes, it should
Yes it does.
sd
Definitely. I own four cameras, three of them more expensive than the G16, yet it is the G-16 that is my go-to camera for macros. It's far ahead of the other cameras I have for this. I have several tripods but have got excellent macro results with bracing as well.
THe memory card is a class 4 card.
Try using a different HDMI cable, if that doesn't work try a factory reset. Test to see if it's the cable or the device by connecting with the included VGA cable - if the audio is still irregular then it's a bad speaker most likely.
Yes
The specs on Canon's web site say raw and have a 2014 copywrite. http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/digital_cameras/powershot_s_series/powershot_s120#Specifications
The digitizer is the glass! Make sure you get one with the iC chip, unless you have a hot air rework station to transfer the chip from your old glass/digitizer.
If your computer is a 2012 MacBook Air, then your computer has MagSafe 2, and this one will do the trick. Please note that the 2011 MacBook Air, which was sold by Apple until June of 2012, uses the older MagSafe connectors. If the end of your charger looks like the one in the picture, you have MagSafe 2. Compare to the other WeCharger Magsafe (WECHGR-MAC-M01), and note the different style of connector at the end- the plug connects to the computer at a 90 degree angle- that is model is "original MagSafe" aka "MagSafe 1" or simply "MagSafe".
Yes. I have a model A1398 and it works great.
Apple MacBook Pro MGX72LL/A
Yes
I like mine but I,m 63. I,m guessing young folks prefer lite wait without full cups ....or something like a wireless speaker such as the Creative Roar. Happy shopping dad !
I don't use them that way, but product description on Amazon indicates they are. I would suggest checking with company to confirm.
So far they have held up. I am sure they must have been dropped at one time or another. If you have heard this, maybe try another brand. My grandsons have had them since December and haven't heard of any problems. If I hear of any, I will post it.
Yes
Depends on who you get them from check the description. If it's from Dr.Dre company then it will most likely come in a box but if it's someone else you can ask them by sending them an email and asking or like I said before check the description.
These are "noise isolating", the battery powered ones are "noise canceling".
New models come out almost every year. There are no problems with the headphones
No, the adapter comes with US flat-pin AC plug, we don't sell EU power plug. You can use a European AC plug adapter.
Yes it does
I cannot find a carrying case specifically for this model. I found a a soft cotton bag with a snap closure that fits my VZ-1, and keep the whole thing in a small toolbox with some other accessories and cables. Works for me.
It's the same.
Hello, you can copy the music into it from the computer, thanks.
No via usb, Yes by using the hdmi adapter for ipad or iphone in order to mirror your ipad content...
I've had mine for quite a while with various wireless mice and keyboards without a problem. I do not have the USB-dongle for my mouse and keyboard plugged into the USB ports in the monitor, however.
Needs to be reprogrammed. Contact Fortres and they can walk you through it..
Yes it will. You can adjust the mount to fit your tablet in both horizontal or vertical position (landscape or portrait).
Yes that's compatible. For future reference, when you buy a CPU, check the socket type. Your CPU is an LGA 1150. So you have to buy LGA 1150 board. This is one of them
When I received mine, it was Windows 7 Pro with Windows 8 Pro discs (for upgrade).
No, but you could probably use a USB extension cable.
High profile, because of the heat sinks built in
I hooked mine to a 32'' televison
No its only for and bluetooth
I did not have mine long enough to get to use this option. My usb port like all the portable speakers I have gotten online all seem to get loose & disappear into the unit. I had to return mine 3 weeks into owning it & did not repurchase another one. I am sorry I couldn't be of any help on this & hope if you do buy one you do not run into the same issue. Blessings, Kristie
Yes, they are loud enough - they work perfectly.
I wouldn't say noise canceling, but they're good.
Yes, the standard fan was included. This is compatible with the Z87 chipset, and you can run it with as many (or as few) memory modules as your motherboard supports.
No, different socket type, you would also need to replace the motherboard.
No it is not. This is the 4th gen i3 that has the 1150 port.
The screen wouldn't be dirty compare those touch screen.
I'm sorry, I haven't had the opportunity to open it.
I don't think it works as you are asking it to. It takes the phones signal and transmits to a radio. Opposit of what you want.
Yes, and it works well for this efficient little processor.
I have a HTC one m7 and it works great. I would assume it would work for an m8 as well, but I don't know for sure.
Sennheiser's are known for amazing sound quality. The RIG has a moderate to good sound quality. Its clear. What makes the RIG special is it's mixamp, and the ability to plug in diffirent things into it like your phone or controller. You can even take the headset and plug in a phone coord that comes with it to make it a mobile headset.
Like 5 feet to the sound board then like o3 feet to the headset it's self
It is similar, but that being said I can say that it is of a high quality and for being part of a package like this I was very impressed.
There are two, not identical, but they both hold a charge well.
Cameta Camera only sells Nikon USA models and not grey market.
Yes, it does.
Yes it includes a bag
I have a version LGG2. It fits that. Its a nice case.
Jimmy yes it should fit the camera. There is a mounting screw that will screw into the bottom of the camera and its a universal thread size on all cameras. I have a GE, a cannon thats 15 years old and a brand new nikkon dslr and every camera I own fits the tripod.
Sorry but I don't know. I bought the tripod for my spotting scope and it supports it well. good luck, wade
No it doesn't feel heavy, it feels like wearing a DRI-FIT HEADBAND just a little tighter because it has to hold the camera in place.
Sony states you should get up to 13 hours of continuous recording. Your media is probably formatted with FAT32, giving you a 4gb file limitation. You should either let the camera format your media before use, or format it on your computer using EXFAT.
You can turn off the sound in the app... It should work great for street photography.
You can use any Micro USB cable. there is a small door that opens. That's where you find the charge port and microSD slot.In case you don't know a Micro USB cable is a cable that is used to charge all Android phones
Hi Jum M., approximate battery life for this Sony RMLVR1 when in use are as follows: Live-View/REC - 240 mins Wi-fi is ON (no display, clock only) - 280 min Wi-fi is OFF (no display, clock only) - 340 min Hope this helps. -Ely
Yes. You can use qx10 as video camera recorder But only If you are connected with a smartphone. Not alone. I hope that my reply are good for you.
I have tried QX10 from about 30 feet away from the phone and it's still responsive enough that I can control the zoom. 30 feet included 3 corners and 2 walls (typical residential).
Yes, the camera can be mounted on a standard tripod. It has the recessed screw. I use it with my Cloud Dome for jewelry photography and it works great. I like using my iPad so I can have a larger view of the jewelry. Love this camera. Very easy to use, portable, and high quality images. Highly recommend.
Yes
If your phone doesn't have wifi, then this thing is useless to you. This does not require a wifi router to work. It directly connects to the phone via wifi.
Yes it runs on a battery . A external battery . I use 12 volt alarm battery in my canoe. 14 bucks and rechargeable
yes, find a way to hang the transducer over the side, make sure its parallel with the bottom. use a small 12V 7AH SLA battery to power it up and go Fishing.
my friend. who recommended this to me for a Nikon, uses it with a Panasonic Lumix just fine. However, this might be a special case, but this is out there too. http://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/50587229 I think part of his issue though is with the channels lining up. Low batteries also affect how well this works, so be aware of that. If they're low, your functions will be severely limited. :)
Yes, it works with D700 Nikon. Its a manual flash.
I would guess that it would. It is very similar to the GPad 8.3.
No
Yes...and it's charge lasts a long time!
No, it won't. Please be informed that this item only Compatible with Galaxy Tab P1000 P1010 P6200 P6210 P6220 P6800 P6810 P7300 P7310 P7500 P7510 Galaxy TAB2 P3100 P3110 P5100 P5110 Note 10.1 N8000. You're welcome to email us with any questions or concerns before ordering or after you have your item already.
Yes! It has the google play store which has all sorts of apps including Instagram.
yes
yes
yes. but not if you put your case on. it fits just perfectly with your "naked" S3
Yes, you can control who has access and give "rights" to users after you set up your admin account.
No subscription fees or other charges. Data is stored on the local drive which is also accessible through your network as a network resource. You'll need an internet connection, of course, to let this drive access the outside world. Data is NOT stored on a WD server somewhere. That said, you do access the drive through an app on your mobile device, so data flow is presumably going through a middleman somewhere, but the actual data is stored on the drive.
No, you have to power down by logging in to dashboard and switch off.
You can do remote access using WD My Cloud Software.
I don't think so. It is just too slow.
Yes it will! The screen protector is pretty much exactly 15.6 inches diagonally, and does not cover the margin area of your screen, just the part that shows picture. You should be fine!
doesn't really affect the brightness, it does have a slight glare problem but it's worth it. keep it clean though.
It does for me, there are no fingerprints and no glare... I am very happy with my purchase.
Yes
I do not have that answer. Will have to contact seller.
2 options, a Bluetooth dongle or aux input.
It's v3.0. Anything after 2.1 EDR has no difference in audio quality when comparing Bluetooth versions though.
Hello Adimar, Yes, the Sharp GX-M10 is compatible with the Nyrius Songo HiFi. Connect your Bluetooth enabled device to the Songo HiFi via your Bluetooth settings, connect the Songo HiFi to your Sharp GX-M10 through the AUX (headphone) input and switch your Sharp GX-M10 to its AUX function to allow the sound to come through. Best Regards, CWD Support
Not sure. I have not tried that. I have only used it with my Kindle. According to the instructions, it should do what you want.
We have a number of customers that are very happy with the Sundown SAZ-1200D with a pair of SA subwoofers. For the SA-12s ported, around 34hz and 1.75-2.25 cubes each works well.
This camera has special batteries u have to buy just for this camera! If u buy extra and a charger u will always be prepared
I don't know sorry
Thank you for your interest in our bundle! For a compare-and-contrast inquiry such as this, we advise speaking with someone in our sales department. They can be reached at 800-991-3350 EST.
I believe they are AAA and I think it came with them
about 30 ins end to end.
Yes I think so. It's pretty big!
Nope is all one piece I'm satisfied with the case for the money
If you divide the edge into 3 sections, only the middle section has magnets. However, when I put it in my hand bag, it stayed closed pretty well. You need to make sure it is closed properly before placing it in a bag. So far, I am very happy with this case. The best part I like about it is that I can open and stand it up easily in 1 second.
Unfortunately no... It's sized for iPad aire
No it has like a rubber padding that grips it when its up right. Very sturdy in the upright position.
Yes! I own a black sticker and it is totally visible through the case.
Yes, it is a good product that fits snug around macbook air. I would recommend it because I really like it since it protects and looks good on my computer.
It is super light! I would guess a few ounces. I have the yellow and it's so thin that it accents the decal I have on my laptop. I like it.
there are vents on the bottom, I have only owned this item for a month but the feet seem fine
contact the seller!
It should fit
this laptop has a intel celeron 1007U dual core @1.5Ghz
No
The hardware versions for the Linksys EA6500 are versions 1 and 2; for the Linksys EA6900, versions 1 and 1.1.
Dear Customer, Greetings! 4GB onboard and extendable memory could be to 32GB. Thank you.
yes you can when i`am out with my grand kid`s i connect my wifi from my phone to there tablets
My sons usually lasts about 3 hours on a full charge but we have only had the tablet a few weeks so its still "brand new"
It does not work at all.
Restart the device if you haven't tried already, that usually helps programs respond (, on a good day lol), if that doesn't work the devices internal sensor may need repair/check for recalibration.
No. It only comes in Red, Green and Blue.
mine is not recessed when i push it down it lightens up
Yes. On the back there are: AUX. OPTICAL. USB. AND ETHERNET
The iPad Air version has the lighter keys. It's the iPad mini that has dark gray keys; that is the wrong image they're showing for this listing.
sorry, havent tested on the PS3
I would return any logitech you purchased and go with this one. It's great. I have no complaints at all. I've purchased 8 different ones before these.
I just spoke with ZAGG and they said that Beach Audio has pictures of two different keyboards posted here by mistake. The keyboard with the separate Tab and Caps lock key is for the iPad Air. The other is the version for the iPad Mini.
Good bass. See the movie, but I think the sound quality is good. Sound is a very rich ... Compared with the old headset ... (g35) .. You probably seem satisfied.
Memory can work in latest Intel processos i3 i4 i7 gen 3 and 4
I don't know, we had it a day and had to return it. It stopped loading. When we went to cut it on that evening, it would not come back on; it just said loading.
Yes
No. Olympus puts the image stabilization in their bodies (and the 5-axis Olympus image stabilization is absolutely amazing).
No. It comes with Windows 8.0 installed. You can download the upgrade to 8.1 from the Windows store.
Yes it is... I haven't done so yet, as the performance is fine without expansion (so far)... But it was one of the criteria I used in selecting this particular model.
Yes it has a DVD-Writer
Yes , because Skype and Netflix come ready with windows 8 apps , iTunes is optional yes you can download I recommended Gateway
My sister had the something similar. Her touch screen would work fine until it went to sleep. When she woke it, the touch screen would not work. Weirdly, hibernate worked as described. Rebooting the system would fix it temporarily. She fixed it by changing the power settings to stop it from sleeping. That fixed the problem. Really, you need to give us more information, as your question lacks specifics such as when this occurs.
The outside yest but the inside is of metal but the plastic is nice but I also would've preferred metal
Hi Richard, I don't have the exact dimensions, but it is quite large in length. The width is approximately 3" height maybe 15" but the length is the size is about 22" plus. I hope this help and I hope I am accurate. Please if I am wrong charge it to my mind and not my heart. But compared to the MacBook I ordered the packaging was quite huge in my mind. Bests, JW
Yes, of course. Anyone with windows 8 can update to 8.1 for free. I love that.
yes you can. This desktop has both VGA and HDMI
Included in the kit, Olympus lens, 12-40mm 2.8 lens
There is no rival to the 75mm 1.8 Olympus Lens currently. It's a great short-telephoto/portrait lens and it is not too bulky. The f2.8 12-40 PRO lens is sufficiently good that it is - in my opinion - somewhat wasteful to have additional wide angles unless you really need a F1.8.
Yes it does
Just connect via a wireless connection and download it for free. It was automatically tell you an upgrade is available in the settings.
I'll be answering tomorrow when I'm back to the office
This has a dedicated graphics card, its pretty response. Although, I haven't played any steam games, but I'd be willing to bet it shouldn't have any problem.
It can probably keep out sand if it was completely zipped. It doesn't seem as if it was waterproof--maybe water resistant, but I definitely wouldn't expect it to resist more than a few drops of water.
Dear friend, We are sorry about that,could you please tell us which frequency did your SIM Card? As you can see our item just can work with 2G (GSM) SIM card, so if your card is not 850/900/1800/1900 MHz, then you need to change another GSM SIM card for it.
No
Press and hold #1 and hold to the ear. Follow the verbal instructions. Decide on a four digit pin before you start. Don't pay any attention to the screen, just follow thr verbal instructions. Good luck Bob H
Not this one...the bar-style one may be easier for someone elderly.
it is a standalone system so yes it will work on anything with a 12 volt electrical system
i believe you can. i think you may need a splitter for the wires. this mirror works good for the price.
No
It lasts me about 4 hrs.
This tablet has wifi.
yes
I dont remember it comes rooted or not. But I know people put custom ROM for upscaled 1080p. So it can certainly be rooted.
The case doesn't have a light. It's just lightweight. I have the latest paperwhite as well. This case is great!
Yes
I'm using to hold up well to long-term use? now works fine. any problems because I know them. thanks
yes, and you will love the deep bass sound
No FM Radio
It definitely can't power an apple DVD drive. The company blames apple and that seems to be right. A tech at Other World Computing, who have been contracted by apple to develop drives, told me that Apple elected to not follow the standard IECC spec for USB3 and instead went off and wrote their own driver. This is also why certain Bus powered HDs perform poorly
Yes
No it has no WiFi capabiliy
Do not buy this product. Sound quality is terrible, it is not actually HD, no camera and most everything is in some asian writing. I threw it out two weeks into having it. Hope this helps.
Yes, of course. This laptop comes with its own wall charger.
Yes, all their SSD come with the screw.
Super Cache model comes with extra software to make it a caching drive if you so choose. Both can be used as boot drives, however.
Yes, works great I put my operating system on it no issues. This drive is small and out of the way don't have to waste a bay up front. If you can afford would go for the 120 gb
The Only thing I could find was $200.00. So I went the ones for $99.00 and have found them great. I listen to my audio books as I am going to sleep.(Better than my husbands snoring) They are very comfortable, if you are someone who is fussy about sound then maybe the other ones. I can listen to my music with no problems.
I believe there are only two slots for ram memory sticks and both are being used by the existing 2 gig of ram each. To get it up to 8 gigs you may need to remove both memory sticks and install 2 new ones of 4 gig each. Basically you are throwing away the existing ram to upgrade to full 8 gigs. As for me, since I only use it as a multimedia server for my bedroom the 4 gigs is very adequate. Good luck.
No DVD/CD drive. Should work well as a word processor. I run Media Center on it. Stream video from network attached storage and Netflicks with no performance issues.
should run these games with normal settings
You did not provide actual model# and there are many 46 inch 7500 TVs. It will work correctly on following model# only: UN46F7500, UN46F7500AF, UN46F7500AFXZA
Yes
Yes, for the 23mm F1.4, it is on the lens? In the XF series of Fuji lenses, the XF27mm is the one exception. For that lens you use the rear dial.
People don't buy this lens for the hood and cap, they buy it because it's a great piece of glass.
Our apologies on this. Amazon has the specs listed wrong and all merchants reflect this because we all source the same ASIN # (which is an Amazon product identification number). We've contacted Amazon directly about this, hopefully it will get addressed soon. The stock CPU in this is an Intel i7-4700HQ.
I just watched a video on youtube that answered this question. It seems really easy, there is an underpanel that allows for easy upgrade. Check out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55qZwSqOIkk
Any internal hard drive is swappable, why couldn't it be changed via an upgrade. Firmware problems? The ram and the hard drives are completely accessible to a qualified technician.
These laptops are very upgrade friendly. What I would do is just but a external hard drive case for 30 bucks.
Thanks for your question, This listing does not include a camera. The lens is a Smartphone Interchangeable Attachment, i.e. Attach to turn your smartphone into a DSLR-like quality camera. I hope this helps!
I bought the iPad Air 2 yesterday and also tested a couple of the available keyboards in store. This logitech bluetooth keyboard barely works because the iPad Air 2 is slightly thinner than the iPad Air 1; actually, 6.1 mm vs. 7.5 mm, respectively, which is quite a bit. Therefore, it doesn't feel quite as sturdy and safely held in place. I decided to wait for a few weeks to see whether an updated model is released. I would recommend you do the same. I hope this helps.
found this by googling: http://www.amazon.com/HQRP-Charging-Logitech-Ultrathin-Keyboard/dp/B00HZGGTCK
These are just audio speakers, which don't require drivers. As long as your computer has an audio out port, they will work.
I don't know. I just plug in over night.
No. You can unplug it. Also, there is no "hum" like other devices give off when they are on, but there is no sound. So, even though I keep it plugged in, it never hums or pops like other speakers do.
Make sure the iPad is compatible with the case. I tried an iPad Air 2 in my folio and it did the same thing. The magnet that activates the keyboard is located in slightly different places on the two newest iPad Air tablets.
I don't know.. ipad air 2 is too new. Maybe check on Logitech website..
6in high x 3 3/4 wide x 2 3/4 deep NO BASS OR TREBLE CONTROLS Speakers are great for the money.
I have this and love it. The keys are soft and built into the cover - there are no sharp edges so I don't see any way it could ever scratch the screen.
i am currently using it with an ipad air 2 and the only problem i see is that the auto lock and auto on isn't working but with the thumbprint scanner, it doesn't really matter
Just measured them: H9.5"xW3.5"xD4", the speakers themselves are advertised as 2.5" diameter
Yes. That is how the built-in amplifier is powered. Speakers come with two cords - one plugs into your audio out jack on your monitor or cpu and the other cord plugs into a standard wall jack.
I use a 'Vangoody' case that was made for a Ipad Air. It has two outside zipper pockets to hold the A/C charger. It also has a 'velcro' pocket on the opposite side. There is a 'top' zipper opening for the Ipad Air. I carry my Ipad Air attached to the Logitech Ultrathin keyboard, with both slipping inside of the large top zipper pocket. Plenty of padding for the top zipper pocket also.
I don't know as I don't know what the "european keyboard" means. If it helps, I can tell you that it is a QWERTY keyboard. The enter key is horizontal as opposed to vertical. It's not same as an ISO keyboard. I hope this helps.
Yes, flight time is about the same. You will not get longer flight times unless you buy the new DJI Vision. You can buy other brand longer lasting batteries but they will not fit inside the copter (velcro to the top).
This camera only comes with the following accessories: AC Adapter/Charger USB Cable Strap The instruction manual can be downloaded for free from Nikon's website. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact our sales department at 800-991-3350 EST. We thank you for your time and consideration!
Mega pixel is not really that important. If you have more than 10MP you should be fine.
I can not say yes or no. Did not see anything like that when I signed up. If someone throws something at the screen I would doubt it would be covered since it wouldn't be a result of the tv failing
sorry no
I don't think so - I use the arrows or touch the screen to navigate around.
No they fit is only for their note 10.1 2014 the dimensions for that model are 10.3 by 7.1 slightly larger than the note 10.1
I don't know why it keeps flashing. Mine flashes once when I turn it on, then that's it. Wish I could be more helpful.
According to the manufacturer's information on the battery, it is 3.6 volts @ 2500 mAh.
The sound bar comes with an fm antennae which is nothing more than a small cord that fits into the fm ant imput. I haven't used it much, but the times I have used it the reception was fine and the sound was good.
Yes this card is. I have the canon rebel xti and it uses a compact flash memory card. Canon's and Nikon's come with two types of memory cards which is compact flash and SD. Compact flash is bigger and the SD cards are smaller.
Yes
It has USB slot in front. So I think anything that fits in that might play.
Yes, this unit does have a delay when you use the auxiliary jack. However, the delay is very very slight. To give you an idea, I can still effectively play a keyboard if I plug it into that dock.hope this helps.
I checked my system and there is nothing for an HDMI connection
I am not sure but there is an auxiliary input, so maybe that is where you would use the mixer. Best guess.
Thanks for your question. There is loading access for CDs on the front panel. This is an awesome sounding system.
It won't work with any tablet smaller than 7". My nexus 7 barely fits.
Mine does not light up. Since we always have lamps on in our den, it isn't necessary to have lights on the Crosley.
No, only audio output for headphones or iPod, iPad etc....
o.
If your device has Bluetooth, this will work on it. I use it with a Note 4 and a Note 12.2.
I cannot say definitively. This is Amazon, and they do have their customer guarantee policies for damaged/defective products. However, I purchased mine as a used product, so I cannot say a brand new version would not have a copy of Nintendo's warranty provided with it. That being said however, I do believe that some form of a product warranty would be available to you since you are buying this product from an Official buyers/traders marketplace.
No, you can not. You can only upload them to a computer.
Thank you for your interest in our package deal! In regards to your inquiry, this camera does not create 3D images.
Well they are pretty fragile. They're only good for travel and car rides.
Yes I wear them to watch movies on my ipad and wear reading glasses with no problem
I am not a long distance runner but I absolutely think these are the best headphones I have ever worked out wearing. For my shorter runs they are immobile and comfortable. I did however wear them on a ten hour flight with zero pressure or discomfort. So I am a fan!
I just read the description for this monitor and ya it could be a little confusing..... The BEZEL (the black edge of the monitor that the screen goes in) is glossy... I get my head at the right angle and I can see my tv that's behind me reflected in it. But the monitor's screen itself has nothing, no glare, no reflection.
Hi, It has only a Tilt movement, Forward 0, Back 20. Thanks, PCrush
The simple answer is yes. There are five buttons on the bottom right side of the frame. The first button on the left is the menu button and the second selection on the main menu is input select. Have fun.
Yes, the VX2452mh's built-in speakers can be bypassed by plugging into the monitor's blue-colored 3.5 mm audio-out (earphone) jack a set of headphones or external speakers. The assumption here is that audio signal is already being inputted through either the monitor's HDMI port or through the monitor's green-colored 3.5 mm audio-in jack.
They don't but if you are under warranty. They will replace them for you
Strictly plug-in.
Yes, as soon as I plugged in, it was ready to use. I tried in Mint 17. The only problem is that the sound is not as good as in Windows.
Yes, brand new. It is covered by Acer's (the manufacturer of Gateway) 1 year warranty.
Yes. The AirEnable Kit is shipped in what I call "Standalone Mode". However it can be reconfigured via your iPhone using a free telnet app to "Wireless Client Mode" or "Wired Client Mode". Please visit the Quick Setup page for more info: http://airenabler.qnology.com/quicksetup
Don't know. We returned the unit due to poor sound.
No, these are the features: *Cassette player / remote control *Headphone jack *CD Player with 3 disc changer *Front audio line-in jack *AM/FM stereo radio
It has full HD 1080p the 3 has 720p , it also has a low light sensor. I don't have a Looxie 3 so I can't really compare them side by side.
Sorry, it might not work with nexus 5.
It will work with Google Nexus 7 2nd Generation.Thank you very much.
Vertical Refresh Rate: 50 - 75 Hz Response Time: 5 ms (GTG)
NO, it doesn't fit GS60. You can search the keyboard skin with ASIN: B00KTVZOAG. That one will fit MSI GS60.
i dont know. because i dont have not yet
It shouldn't - Nexus 7 1st gen doesn't support slimport.
I had lag issues with my old router, with the Netgear Nighthawk I have no gamin lag issues. I own the XBOX 360 (Wired) and the XBOX One (Wireless) and I have not experienced any issues with either of the gaming machine.
The box that the unit comes in (packaging) outside dimensions is 16"d 20.5"w 7"h (width is actually closer to 20 and 5/8ths or so inches - the other measurements are pretty close)
It's a class A/B amplifier. I'm not familiar with the older Panasonic receiver, but after testing multiple AVRs, and comparing brands, Yamaha has really come a long way and has an amazing sound.
Yes. I use this amp to power a pair of Infinity Optimus P163 speakers, which are honestly a little big for bookshelf speakers, but the amp works fine at normal listening volumes. If you like your music loud and need to drive bigger speakers you should consider a more conventional amplifier with more power, but for most bookshelf speakers this amp works. You will also need speaker wire to hook them up. This amp and most speakers accept the banana plug wire ends, which I recommend as well.
The power light is blue.
It has 3 usb ports, one on the right and two on the left
No it does not come with Microsoft Office
Power supply adaptors are 110V AC
You can set this for each channel. Motion activated or continual.
What do you mean by tvl? I have this system installed and running so I can answer just about any question, I just do not understand what you mean.
Temperature doesn't matter
No, iTunes is a Apple program that runs on Windows computers.
Yes it does. It has a DVD burner in it
I have no idea. My guess is it's put together in the U.S. from parts bought everywhere else.
I don't see why not. Mine handles Office Suite, browsers with half a dozen tabs open, lots of simultaneous opened Word docs, and one of the biggest memory hogs of all time: Photoshop. I haven't run into a memory problem yet.
What you are looking for is a replacement notebook battery (14.4 Volt Li-ion Laptop Battery), part number 121500171. It's compatible with quite a number of Lenovo laptops. Here's one site where you can order it: http://www.drpowerglobal.com/drbattery/item/notebook+battery/121500171/lln232-ap.aspx. Hope that helps, and good luck!
touchscreen
DDR3-1600/PC3-12800
Yes version 4.0
64 bit
1 port
BEAUTIFULLY. I can run the game on ultra settings and the performance is still absolutely flawless :)
just press the Fn key + space bar
NO
sorry for the delay, but i am a writer and i seldom check my e-mails. but the software that comes with this all in one desktops is lenovo c355 * c455 win8 driver pack v1.1 cd. i hope i have helped you. again sorry for the delay.
Yes
No, pnly the laptod and the power supply
I bought this for my parents who live in Europe. It has a range of voltage and 220 is well within. It won't fry ;)
Yes
Yes, you can
No problems. Works great.
no
Not, it has not CD drive.
depends on your settings.
Yes It dose have both Full key pad and a numerical key pad and it dose have a CD reader
Yes there is a wired ethernet port in back of computer but it is wireless capable and ready out of the box.
I haven't done it yet, but it shouldnt't affect your ability to upgrade your ram. If anything it will only help your performance.
Overall though it is great. Fps doesn't drop at all and the graphics can be set on high quality without it lagging as well
Yes it will work
Yes
I don't see GE70 in the listing. I believe it is an S20. That is what is pictured.
Yes, Mini-HDMI
6 hours
It fits the Samsung tab3 8", there is also ones for the 7" just gotta make sure its the size you want
It does NOT have a lighted Keyboard. It does have an HDMI port.
I'd call it semi-gloss or satin. It's not completely matte, it reflects some, but not like a glossy screen does.
These should work with any Bluetooth device or can also connect wired.
It is about 28" folded and the case is about 2lbs
A1286
i cant say about that, but i am not recommending this product. mine was burned suddenly in the first time of using it.
No, this unit only fits the HP Slimline series
YES, YOU CAN SELECT 2 ,3 AND 5 MINUTES.
Go to any phone or GPS sale place take you old one with
overall 10 5/16 X7. Actual viewing area 10" diagonal. Jerry
I have only charged it once...before Thanksgiving. Left it overnight. The stock battery lasted 20 minutes. This lasted Wed - Sat with intermittent use.
No
It has rubbery grooves all over the straps. And you can tighten in. It's very secure. Now if you were flipping a lot it might slowly slide off. But just hanging upside-down. I think you'll be just fine. If you really are doing crazy stuff. Mount it to a helmet that straps to your head like the red bull stunt people.
I think this is the type of door you're looking for. http://www.amazon.com/Toughsty-Backdoor-GoPro-Hero-Skeleton/dp/B00KS2E060/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1409753414&sr=1-1&keywords=gopro+skeleton+backdoor
It should, this should fit any and all things 3+. But I do not have the dive housing yet.
not sure try gopros website for better fitment specs it helped me out
Hit around 115mph with it on the windshield. Didn't even budge
Yes. It remains attached to both windsurfing boards and snowboard when wet IF IT IS ALREADY ATTACHED. If you try to put it on an icy snowboard or wet windsurfing board, cling is suboptimal, but again, once attached, moisture and/or cold has little effect on suction.
Hero 3+ camara is better just because it can see better in low light and so is the housing it goes down to 130' or 140' I think so unless your a tech diver you will never be going that deep. The reason it's better is because the buttons are much easier to push especially with gloves on.
no, its not a pan n tilt, just manual op
Hi... Yes use the evga cooler its better, looks soooo good and its quiet (:
Dear, It works on my Asus G750JX with GTX770M. Need NVIDIA driver. This comes pre installled on my ASUS. Not a specialist. Just find this very satisfactory setup for 3D gaming.
It can support more than 1 device at a time. It cannot support more than 1 connection with the same profile type. This means you can connect a keyboard, mouse, headset and whatever else as long as its not the same device type. 2 headsets will not work simultaneously nor will 2 mice as they use the same profiles for input/output. Hope that makes sense.
This item is shipped directly from Japan and took approximately 8 days to reach me.
Yes. We have a stock in Japan. YOROZUYA JAPAN
the cs918 which is a similar model sold on amazon.com has xbmc preinstalled on it.....you get ice movies w/ all the latest 2014 2015 movies genesis w/ the same and many many sports channels i have seen them but am not into sports and wrestling channels........the cs918 is awesome i have 2 connected w/ rii and wireless keyboards and mouses........you cant go wrong ifyou already have a big led or lcd w/ hdmi...!! thanks
Some people say they are same. I have one, I like it If you want to have very smooth and bright skin &#65292;I suggest you buy TR350
Maybe I don't understand your question, but this monitor has HDMI, DisplayPort, and DVI connections, so if your source device has one of these outputs, then yes, it will work.
Honestly I had similar combo and couldn't get the ttl to work. I ended up getting pocket wizards. I also had some issues with the triggering with these, and with my pocket wizards no such troubles.
Yes the water does rise to the beat...they are awesome to watch.
None
It is a micro sim (smaller than normal sim but larger than nano sim). Word of caution: 3G version was launched in Singapore on 19th Feb 2014, exclusively by one electronics store: http://www.challenger.com.sg/partners/promotion/Lenovo. It was recalled after few days due to erratic performance of the 3G card: http://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/tablet-den-328/lenovo-miix-2-8-inch-tablet-4583872-5.html. Still no news of the new batch of Miix 2 8 with working 3G card till now.
yes
Yes it has a nice camera for stills or video.
There is an optional detachable (and very cool) keyboard that doubles as a screen protector
what kind of adaptor cable to connect the Yoga's micro USB to a flat screens HDMI. Where can I buy? I have bought one around $10.00 but it's not work when i connected. I could't find out any. Can you help that. I am very appreciate.
Yes, of course it does. I don't think I've ever bought any kind of device that didn't come with the cord, but who knows....
Yes. It comes with kingsoft office on it which works great.
yes
This tablet includes 16GB flash memory, supports Bluetooth 4.0, supports MicroSD card, and Google Play is available for download.
This is strictly a Wi-Fi tablet; therefore, it would not be locked.
It is supposed to be mounted horizontally specifically at the back of your rear view mirror. The power button should be on the left side if you're inside the car. 'Hope this solves your problem.
I dont know, i got this so i could install one end to my car stereo and the other to my i pod . I was intrested in this only because i could change songs without taking my eyes off the road.
You turn off the notifications in the apps.
no the tablet sucks im sorry I purchased it.
Android
No they don't fit my head at all. There are much to heavy and loose. They have a quite good sound, but don't buy them for running...
We sell an original power adapter.
i think its same item. c-typ112 is this camera item. 18485 is this gold "color" camera item number. it is same camera,,.
Hello, They are the same. The camera comes in Gold and Dark Red. The catalog number of the Gold is 18485 and the Dark Red is 18489. The verbiage Type 112, is a fairly new numbering system Leica is using to differentiate between the older cameras which had similar names. For example the prior versions of this camera where C-Lux, C-Lux 2, etc. Regards, Roozbeh OC camera 949-347-1276
No it doesn't.
Never tried this but... I believe Cyberlink PowerDVD Ultra can play 3D Blu-rays. Connect Pawtec to laptop and HDMI out from laptop to TV HDMI input. One would expect a 3D capable TV to display the movie properly.
Being a US citizen, I'm not confronted with this issue, so I cannot definitively answer this one way or another. However, I cannot think of any reason why Lenovo would have a stipulation that the warranty is void if the laptop is in another country. Lenovo is a Chinese company, and Amazon is pretty much a global company. Therefore, I would think you should be fine.
The second GPU is only active 1) if you have SLI mode turned on and 2) if you are actually using a program that needs advanced graphics. I wouldn't think removing it would improve battery life at all.
Yes it does.
500 GB 5400 RPM Hard Drive, 8 GB Solid-State Drive.
If you buy if from baofengtech it will. That's who I bought mine from and it's a GREAT product.
no it does not detach
Absolutely not. I spritzed BOTH the Zagg shield itself AND the surface of my iPad Air very liberally. Once the Zagg goes on and is centered properly, you simply squeegee the fluid from the center and push it away from the home button and camera and all is good. Any residual moisture you can't get with the squeegee will evaporate from under the Zagg and leave a perfectly invisible shield. Don't be afraid to get the screen of your iPad wet. I have used this method on 3 different iPads and 4 different iPhones without any issues.
Unfortunately we can only ship Amazon orders to US and Canadian addresses.
I suppose, it has distance lines as you back up. When you get to the red line stop. I see people use them to hook up boat trailers and you can tilt the camera up and down.
Yes,you could have a try.One customer do like this:"hang the monitor on the rearview mirror. Installation instructions are sparse at best, but I wired it up before actually installing it to ensure I knew what wires went where. The blue wire is the backup wire. Connect it to the backup light for backing monitor only. I connected it to the license plate light to function as rearview and to remind me to turn my lights on when I travel." and so on
not sure
Hi. Though it does fit, tightly, to my Yongnuo YN-568EX , it is made for a different model. As for your ii, I don't know. Good luck.
Yes it does! The only thing it doesn't have it a web cam which I wish it did but other than that it's a great Monitor for the price.

For a single 1080p stream, it would be more than enough. For more than 1 simultaneous streams, it will depend on other factors.
XBMC is not running well.... have tried both Frodo and latest Gotham and both have audio sync issues... sync gets worse as the movie progresses.
Yes, I have two of them running with Seiki 3840x2160 displays running Linux Mint.
I haven't had any focus issues with my 3+
That depends on memory card size and battery life. Memory card time can be lengthy (hours and hours with the right size, get at least a 32GB). Battery life depends on what you are doing. If you are running wifi with the iphone app I can't seem to get more than 30-45 minutes continuous, but I bought a 2 extra battery pack so it hasn't really been a big deal...yet. If I am using strictly the camera without any apps, my battery life lasts much longer.
yes, it plugs to the wall. I never used since shortly after I bought it my cable company came up with a modem/router with extended range.
Yes, I pulled the CD tracks off the Genesis hybrid SACDs, it sounds damn near as good.
Yes and Yes. This writer works perfect with my mac (8-core Mac Pro 3.1). Since it is SATA, you need to purchase both SATA and the power cable to install it. The drive boots up very well, just tested with my factory 10.6 DVD. It records a high quality audio (installed in music production studio) with CD-Text.
The 120 does have remote learn function. If using with a TV audio output it has auto on and off. When it sees a audio input it turns on. I am using a Panasonic TV remote for volume can only assume your Xfinty remote can do the same. Some functions like Bluetooth need the 120 remote to turn it on or it can be done with the buttons on the 120.
Yes, the cable on this mouse has a braided outer layer.
Size: 129 x 72 x 40mm (5 x 2 x 1 in) Shipping Weight: 9.9 ounces Straight off of Amazons product page. Just scroll down you'll see it. In case you're not familiar with the metric system I converted them to inches.
Unless it came out today, Oct. 6, Otterbox has not come out with a Verizon version as yet. If you check their website, under comments of this case you'll see it unfortunately (for me also) say not for Verizon model. Hate to have you make the same mistake I did.
Yes. That's what I have :-)
Works great on my Verizon LG G2!
Yea it fits it really good very good protection
It came with a belt clip
Yes it's compatible.... The iPhone 5s and the 5c are identical in size and dimensions.
1 year manufacturer warranty if bought full price from amazon. If bought from resale, then it would be less than 1 year. if you buy from Amazon, they will of course replace it within a particular time period, which I don't know what is it.. maybe 3 months.
It has a power cord to charge.
Yes it can. I keep it plugged in all day at work.
The little Biitch works good for me . Not a single beep . Sorry to hear that cause I love mine
Mines does that only when it needs to be charge. Best thing I think you should do is let it completely drain and die out.
These are internal to the device.
they are totally different machines. the Tab 3 is older for one, slower processor, less memory, the screen resolution is much smaller, no stylus pen, etc. - Note 2014 is newer, better technology, stylus pen which is useful if you plan on using it. if you just need a tablet for social networking, movies/youtube/netflix, checking email and occasional gaming, get the Tab 3. if you plan on note taking and art related stuff, get the Note 2014.
This question has been here a while but I'll answer anyways and say no this is NOT for the Verizon model.
This one can use as repeater, so you can connect the other router through wifi to extend the coverage
No.
1gb
Mine had the right shift key. It should all come with the right shift key now. I believe the seller fixed the problem.
You can use it as a regular tablet. When you turn it on, its a standard tablet. Kids mode is accessed by tapping on the Kids Mode app icon.
Yes, it will work in india . This projector is Easy to use. You will not have any problem to use it there.
Sorry, but I don't have Netflix.
Yea, fs700 is super 35mm, so the field of view won't be the same as a full frame sensor but the lenses will work.
I am not sure, to be safe I would suggest buying Win 8 Pro and updating to SP1 when your ready
Yes it does.....
Do you mean Backlit?
No. 8GB is the max.
Made in China :)
I doubt it. I had it attached to the top of a window pointing in the right direction and it was still flaky. You want a clear shot and as high as possible. Antennaweb is extremely optimistic in my experience.
You would lose at least 3 dB or half the power if split in two plus the loss through the splitter - likely 4.5 dB total. Also, Noise figure may increase. That is a significant loss of power. Depending on how good your reception is, it is worth a try, but you may need another low noise amp or simply another antenna for the second TV.
Yes, it willl pick up both frequencies, even radio frequencies. I've tried different antennas, but this one is the best, it even gets more channels and i don't need to reposition the antenna to get better image. I would recommend it.
It comes with Dell backup and Recovery already installed. You have option of creating back up disk, backing to an external hard drive, or to the cloud.
Awsome
I don't believe it does...suggest you contact Dell directly. Very helpful.
Yes
Yes.
I bought this laptop in January 2014 and just measured it. It's 14" 3/4 by 10" 1/4.
Yes. The internal battery that keeps the clock updated, I cannot say. But the main rechargeable battery, yes, you can remove it.
Yes this is the version you would buy to create a virtual machine on a Mac. I used this version to build a windows 8 machine on my iMac using Parallels. Works like a charm.
Have you tried "classic shell" yet. Makes it operate like win 7, but faster. Also boots into desktop vs metro crap. I have not seen thAt metro screen in the 5 months i've had classic shell. But if you still need to go to win 7 you will need a key ($100) and a install disk or usb.
Not sure what you mean? You have to have Internet service coming to your house through an Internet service provider such as Comcast or AT&T, that would be true with any router perhaps you're looking for a wireless hotspot which you can get somewhere like Verizon. However I would not suggest this product for a router get a Belkin or a Linksys for the same price.
No
Yes, there is the option in the router console to set it up as a wireless repeater, though I don't have personal experience with using it in that capacity.
Hi, the item installed windows 7 pro 64bit. Thanks
Can be used with any mp3 player or electronic device with a conventional earphone jack
absolutely easy
The first time or two with rechargeable batteries, the indicators don't get it quite right. Go ahead and use it until the battery goes about dead, then recharge it again and see if it gets it right this time. I have a Harmony remote that did the same thing, and so did my cell phone the first time I recharged it.
PS/2 keyboards have a standard wiring configuration. If the device uses a PS/2 interface it is setup to accept any keyboard with a PS/2 connector.
Yes it is possible. These are IBM original keyboards. As old as 1987 - 1992 give us a call if you'd like. 516-693-1530
No and I wasn't aware of that when I bought it. I guess I just assumed it did.
i dont remember seeing any. was a pretty basic radio, only plus was usb feature but sound wasnt good and remote didnt do much but for the usb and cd functions
Yes. We have listened to many CDs with good sounding MP3 files and never had any problems.
It comes with webcam
Performance wise, it's worth every single penny. When I purchased mine I swaped it for a 1TB M500 SSD and the boost in performance was phenomenal. Nothing sucks more than having a very powerful PC but a slow HDD. Doesnt really work well!
No it doesn't have a 120Hz Screen to play 3D in the first place
3rd what?
Delivery to San Antonio TX 3-4 business days by standard delivery Thank you
yes i guess. i just checked the power adapter and it read 100 to 240 Volts , 1.6 Amps input. 50 to 6 0 hz
Nope, just normal one. Hard to type without external light.
Mine came with 8.0 so I had to download 8.1. Perhaps they have upgraded this model since December when I purchased. Call Dell?
Very good equipment, fast!
It is 64 bit
Yes you can burn DVD's with this model.
Yes it does. Slides out on right side.
Yes...It comes with DVD drive
According to Crucial.com, 8GB
I mount it to my Canon Rebel T4i. It fits fine.
Built in, just plug in Ethernet cord.
Yes you can.
Our shipping is calculated per weight. Items that are added through amazon are saved via UPC code. Sometimes the original listing has a high weight which leads to that overcharged shipping. Unfortunately there's not much we can do about the shipping cost as it is calculated automatically through Amazon.
Yes, the 3.5mm plug is located behind a gasket. This is also where you can find the micro USB plug for charging the device.
I bought it for the Latitude 10" and it worked well (any case that fits the Microsoft Surface will fit the Latitude, FYI), until it just stopped connecting. It comes with a usb cord charger, so you can charge via computer/tablet or using a wall adapter. The battery is internal and not removable. I am currently in the process of exchanging mine because of the connection problem, but as long as it goes well I would recommend this product.
I use the earbuds that I keep in my purse to use with my iPhone, so any that are compatible with Smartphones should work.
It's on the front edge of the unit.
It has a sd/mmc plug available as well as a USB plug too.
It does have both a built in battery and DC power. I wouldn't order this player though. Piece of junk. Lasted about a month of light use
Yes
I don't know, but I highly doubt it.
There's a usb cord & plug in adapter. It does have flash. Also spot to mount external flash. I would recommend getting the 55-200/300 lens for it.
You can, but you have to remove the tail attachment or remove the suction cup making it no longer waterproof.
No, the is to stop the anti flicker for the 2012 and up Jeep JK. It should be find on your YJ. It's not needed anyway. It's barely visible
Yes. The Note 4 will accept a MicroSD up to 128GB
Yes
it works on samsung galaxy tab 3
Yes
Power cable: About 4 feet of cable. There is a connector on one end and just some open wire on the other end so you can attach any simple red/black wire of whatever length you need. Transducer cable: I installed mine on a 9 foot jetski and have a big coil tucked into the hull. I would guess it's in the 15 foot range.
yes
yes, will also fit 2595LMT. welcome order from us
I believe it will work on the D610, it does on my D600...but not on the D3100 because it doesn't have the infrared signal. You'll need a wired remote for the D3100. Seems completely silly that one model would have it and not the other...right?!
Yes it will it work great
It doesn't specifically do that; once you press the button, the camera (if you have it on Automatic) will adjust focus and then take the photo immediately after!
Yes.. unlocked.
Not that I can see but it does have detents. It's not a bad case other than that I prefer that it would fold back like a portfolio. But it's really designed just act like a stand that can sort of full flat. A little bulkier than I would like.
really don't know. I always turn it off when not in use
Yes it does
Yes, there is an app for Netflix in the Store. As for Amazon Instant Video, you can stream it directly from internet explorer.
Yes. With the different ports it works well, USB and HDMI. Charger will pug in to your USB on Computer and the quick charger works well. Buy the Bundle, a good deal and you can increase the memory. Upload Windows RT 8.1 right away. I think you will be happy. A little slow on screen touch but...! Hope this helps.
short answer: maybe. can you attach an external drive? yes. it however will only be as functional as the app you plan to use. you may be able to view video content or pictures through media player but you could only write a file if there is an app that allows it. windows rt is very limited and only allows you to use windows apps. so if there isnt an app that allows you to read/write data then no, you wont get much functionality out of it.
I don't know any tv that you can surf internet without a computer hooked up to it. This does apps.
Passive and works just like the theaters. I was surprised how good it was.
I bought 40" version for my bedroom and bought http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TZ4CRG/ref=oh_details_o03_s01_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 this VideoSecu Low Profile Ultra Slim 1" profile TV Wall Mount for $17 and very happy with it. I'm sure there must be something similar for larger TV.
Yes.
1 CPU fan and 3 system fan
Cpu and ram does have OC controls
Yes
I don't know. I don't have mine hooked up to the TV.
Yes it does.
It comes with Windows 8 Home, for which Windows 8.1 is a free update from Microsoft.
At the top right hand side of the unit is a vertical button push it in and the cd drive should open.
I'm sorry I was misinformed, the operating system is window 8. Operating system: Windows 8 Home, English
No. This computer comes with integrated Intel HD graphics, which does not game well.
Yes. Good for portraits. Ringflash gives great fill in facial portraits. It also leaves ring reflection in eyes
Nope. There's reasons to own Canon and Nikon. Sony is pretty much an island unto themselves.
Its not Intel its AMD A6
Yes I'm pretty sure it has a microphone. I don't know how good it works I've never tried it. You could always hook a better Mic into the microphone jack
I got an English version of the manual from E-Prance. I don't think I can attach a file to this message, but I was able to upload it to the DashCam.com forum at http://forum.dashcamtalk.com/threads/samoon-3h2f-gs6000-a7-ambarella.3178/ it should be at or near the latest message.
You can use a standard micro usb charger to charge the tablet. Anything over 1.2 amp will be sufficient to charge the tablet. Amazing has a lot of accessories just type in Proscan 8 inch and then what accessories you want like keyboard...etc
will only work with the galaxy tab 3 will not work with galaxy tab 4 will not work with galaxy note
This might not be 100% accurate...but I bought this for a friend of mine who doesnt have any other devices at all...and she said sometimes it pairs automatically and sometimes not. Ive also got one...and Im paired with 10 other BLuetooth Devices....I also find that sometimes its auto and sometimes not.. although it only take a few seconds...I usually turn blue tooth off and back on from my phone..and it finds it right away
Yes, I can have my kindel in the basement and have the speeker up stairs and it plays Loud and Clear!
It fits in my mid tower
You have to download a "beta" driver from Netgear, but the Beta driver works great for my Windows 8.1 systems.. The drivers on my CD were for only Windows 7. The download process was easy.
Any USB port should work. The question is how it will pick up your wireless network? Can't answer that for you. That depends the signal and the environment.
No but you can purchase a cloud version for about $100.
You call Asus and get really REALLY pissed.
The PSU is not standard, 14 pin connector to MB. No SATA cables neither from PSU, the HHDs are powered by proprietary cabled plugged into MB.
you put it in the back of the main speaker, can you actually charge it with an usb cord, since the battery is rechargeable. Battery lasted only 2 hours with continuous play when fully charged.
Well, I have the newer model of BOSE noise cancelling which I was using. Let me break it down: On long duration comfort-both the same. On Battery life - Phiaton. On the noise cancelling efficiency - Phaiton. On construction - Phiaton. On the reproduction of High, Mid and Low - Phiaton by far. Additional Feature - Bluetooth. I no longer use BOSE or other High Quality Noise cancelling headphone since my purchase of this headphone. BTW, I am an Audiophile.
This is a Universal design to work with all radios that require a hook up for the unit to work with the emergency brake, wire, etc.. So it should work 100% ok
you have to check and see what the tread size is on ur lens it should be printed on it somewhere these are for a 55mm.
There is 1 wide angle lens, 1 telephoto lens, 1 macro lens, 4 adapter rings 4 caps 2 pouches
New inventory in stock 12/5 DOES comes with a CD Drive.
The Adapter comes with a CD that has the driver. If you did not get one please email us at Support@iSharkk.com so we can send you one right away.
At the moment blue only if you purchase it with amazon FBA, there are more colors availables: white, black, pink, purple, orange, yellow, green and blue if you do it at my amazon store www.electron-master. Com thanks
The monitor screen is 13.75 inches in height. The bottom edge of the screen is 2.5 inches above the table top. This measurement changes slightly, depending on how the screen is tilted.
Appears to work with both. The key to this question is lies in the fact that the adapter has both a Red Dot and a White Dot. It should be compatible with both types of lenses.
It does not...
I use it mostly for work but I havent found any issues so far. I tried playing SC2 on it but that didnt go well, which had nothing to do with the monitor, just that SC2 is more of a keyboard game. Depending on the game, do keep in mind the max res on this monitor. Ive had a few friends who wanted higher res.
Your keyboard and mouse work the same as usual. The touch screen just gives you more ways to interact with your computer. They all work together.
i just bought a 500w corsair . it works flawless. also have a R9 270x on the same rig http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Builder-Watt-EPS%C2%A0-CX500/dp/B0092ML0MY/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1415836474&sr=1-1&keywords=corsair+builder
Under lan it shows it has built-in wired connections, but it does not have wifi. Not having built-in wifi is good, through because I have a small usb wifi stick and it works fine for me, plus I can remove it and it is not on wifi open to possible hacking. This sound system is great and the graphics work good, with your apu. I have not bought a graphics card yet, although I really want one. I have been petty impressed with this board and it is worth every bit the dollar you spend on it.
No blue rays but key pad is full screen. Not bad for the price...track pad is a little weird to use so bought a wireless mouse
110 only
Mine's mounted so I can't measure it. According to Gigabyte, board dimensions are 244x190 mm (approximately 9.6 inches x 7.5 inches). It's a Micro ATX format. That's important because it isn't just board dimensions that are important for mounting purposes. Locations of the screw mounting holes are too (mount offset is also important but I think that's pretty standard). If your case was designed to hold a Micro ATX board you should be fine.
Yes
Yes, surely you can. Looking at its thin case, you're right to become suspicious of it, but it has a nice DVD drive.
It should work fine. I'm using the one from Analogix &lt;http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DWGB6CU/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=3GK74964CJJUE&coliid=IW1TCTU8T3RKX&gt; with my HP11 and Nexus 5. Works great. Actually thinking of getting this LinkS one as a cheaper one for home.
Yes it will ,with no problem
Black
I use it on a PC (Windows 7 Home Premium).
I haven't tried Linux, but as you say, they're just USB speakers after all, so I'd expect they would. I didn't have to install any specific drivers to get them to work on my Windows 8 machine.
That's the only thing that you cant do which is plug a headphone into it.
I don't see it, but they pump great sound trust me and you can control the volume
Yes,it can be used with any device that has a usb port. Plug n Play.. :)
.yes it does.....the control buttons are on top of the speaker and if you push the light button it switches modes color patterns and movement, cycle through them and there will be a mode where it pulses to the beat of the music and then there are a few more modes where it changes colors and patterns. It also has a lights off mode and if u run your finger in a circle around the edge, like u do on an iPod you can switch the colors from rainbow to each single color.
Not at all,,check Ur charging cables and out let,,,,also there is an app for the speaker
Since I received product, the battery still the same. My wife use the computer on a daily basis easy 12 hrs. The quality of the product is Outstanding.&#128077;&#128077;&#128076;&#128076;
1200 DPI. http://www.thinkscopes.com/blog/2014/05/23/lenovo-dual-mode-wireless-touch-mouse-n700/

Battery Type: Lithium-ion (Li-ion) - Voltage: 11.10V | Capacity: 6600mAh - Rate: 73.00 Wh | No. of cell: 9 I hope this information helps.
Just by the button on it.but the Google play does not work on it so it worthless. When u call them for help they were rudee.
The Aluminum model is 3.9lbs this is the carbon fiber one, which is 2,6lbs
this baterry is a replacement for the t5720 though it is ever so slightyly larger it will fit
I don't know that it replaces the KEBT - 650. They don't list that as one of the option but it is a 2 pack item. It was an exact replacement for my Motorola though the batteries seem a little bit thicker then the originals. They were a very tight fit in my radios but they have been working since I put my then in and charged them.
I didn't research that far James. I just matched up the old ones that were in my Motorola radios!
I used them for the talkabout 6510. They worked fine, pretty sure Motorola uses the same battery for all the models.
Seem to work fine in my Motorola T8510 Talkabout.
My laptop model number wasn't listed but the battery fit. Just make sure the model number on your old battery matches this one.
Slimport only works with Nexus 7 13 model not the older model.
Not sure. I use it with my Note 4 and it works well. I would assume it works across all Samsung devices that use micro usb.
I think this bridge is for cards that have an empty slot between them, it would not work on my setup of a micro atx asus card with two GTX 760 cards in slots adjacent to each other. I had to use a flexible ribbon bridge.
Is it compatible with a Samsung Nexus? I imagine, if the Nexus has WiFi. Does it connect to the smartphone via usb, no uses WiFi. Be happy to answer other questions, it is an excellent product.
Length: I measure 5 inches (from that parts that would cover the front of the camera where the lens mounts to the cover over the front of the lens). Diameter: The lens cover portion isn't really a cylinder, so it's hard to give a full description. However, the narrowest point in the lens cover portion is about 2.875 inches.
No padding I believe that it is leather Sometime I use, other times not. If outside good
yes
None. The previous (30-pin) model did have external connections for both AM and FM antennas. This model has a wire hanging our of the back.
Yes very satisfied with this cover. No have to adjust the tablet, eaxy to charge with it on. I really, really likd this one.
Just like the picture, I think it is silver or grey or you mean black.
No it does not
I have an E6420 and it works great
yes
Plug the camera into the USB port on your computer, let the auto install take the lead. (You can always browse the camera/drive for the ".exe" and run it manually, too.) It's very simple. (Just have your password ready to access your WiFi network.) Then when it says to, remove the camera from your computer. Plug it into it's power supply, aim the camera and your set. Hope this helps!
The wire shown is to power the unit.
NO.
No, this docking station is not compatible with Linux. For further assistance, please email support@satechi.com. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
Sorry, it can't.
When you want to charge your ipad, first of all, do not connect to computer, because the hub will automatically assume you are transfer data, instead of fast charging. (this is all for protecting purposes, in case the 1.5A current will blow out your hard drive or flash drive or even the usb port on your computer) When you connecting with your computer , each port only provides 500mA instead of 1.5A.
We haven't taken it further than 500ft in height and distance, although it is supposed to reach 1000ft. Probably in youtube you can see some trials.
Mine died on me after 90 days thant God amazon took care of me, until it died.i liked it!
can take micro sd card only,
No
Yes but it isn't worth it. It has some real performance issues with newer updates. Google it. Mine is rooted with an alternate boot loader.
Splitting will always weaken the signal.
No - you have to provide it yourself. I dumped this antenna as it did not pick up stations only 35 miles away. Replaced with a "Lava" style that cost a lot less and works a lot better.
Yes, I think so. I also hope 1ByOne will have a 12 inch mast included. If the mast has a hole so that the coaxial cable can pass through that will be perfect.
Any channels picked up by an over the air antenna are going to be your local stations..........CBS, ABC, NBC, maybe FOX, etc. It will NOT pick up anything like ESPN, CNN, etc. as these are cable or satellite channels. It will also pick up your local PBS channels. I live in a fringe area and get 14 local channels with a different version of the same antenna. If you want more than just your locals, you probably need to get something like a Roku and use your internet. But for basic, local channels......this cannot be beat. Hope this helps.
I think key things to look for are, slow connectivity and responsiveness; and the other would be if the light does not lit up where it shows which bluetooth #1,2, or 3 is connected to. So far, mine has lasted awhile, I think it's been over 3 months and my battery is not completely drained. Hope this helps.
Yes
I have Piriform's Speccy http://www.piriform.com/speccy installed on my machine. I can't find either on the RAM or the Graphics tab a separate notation for graphics card memory. I'm thinking it's got shared memory. It states it's Intel HD Graphics. In talking to someone in the past, I seem to remember being told that most the laptops have shared memory.
I would buy the otterbox defender series case I bought the other one and it doesn't come with a cover I hope that helps.
Yes, Sam Sung N9005 also called Note 3
It adjustable to you can set to how ever you want
I've used my battery till it was at 10% this took about 5 hrs.
It opens to about 135 degrees
no I downloaded Office 4
The laptop has an internal battery, you cannot remove it without opening the casing. I guess it is still possible, but not as easy as in most laptops.
Yes, it does and it's a nice one.
No
Yes
Yes it can
I believe it does, but I've never had a desire to see or try it.
Yes, and it will up-convert them to high definition (close to Blu-Ray quality) when you use a HDMI cable to connect it to your TV. It will also still make them look better if you connect it to your TV with any other source. To get the best out of your Blu-Ray Player, always use a HDMI cable if possible. It makes a huge difference in picture quality.
Creator NXT will make a movie of the VHS but you need a video capture card or some way to get the video/audio into your computer. Google or search on Ebay. The easiest way is to buy a DVD recorder. Some come with a VHS player built-in.
Yes it's actually designed for if
There is not an easy point access. It can be moved to get at the SD card but it is not easy.
Perfect fit
Yes it does!
No.
This is the same size as the original Apple cord. It can be used with the Commuter case.
its way better.......
It is made in China
Yes. I just finished setting up my new XPS 8700 system a few days ago. Although I was unable to download 8.1 at first (I could not find it available in the Windows Store at first), I was eventually able to do so and it seems to be working fine right now. I am not sure about the reason for the delayed availability, but it could have been due to the need for the computer to install some Windows updates (as the computer was manufactured in late January 2014) before becoming able to accept the 8.1 download and installation.
I just hook up my usb to it, and the computer links up just fine, no need for any setting
It works perfctly. Enjoy
Yes I think so. If you log onto ur amazon acoount & download the amazon appstore. You download via link from browser not thru Google play. In browser search for amazon appetite. Must goto settings on mg and click box for third party apps... First... Sorry. Just Google how to download amazon appetite it will be clear. Then log in and u have access to all ur purchased & free apps.
Don't know ordered it for Mac air laptop
Antenna wire screws into outlet I believe where the cable would normally plug in. Very simple on my TV.
The shipping weight for this box is 52 pounds.
Yes. Easy!
17-7/8 inches, so call it 18 inches. Measured. Jim
If you have thin glasses. They are bulky behind the ear. Try them, and if not you can return. Amazon is usually very good with their return policy.
If you are asking if you can put a camera on it and use it as a monopod while snowboarding, then yes. If you are asking if you can use it to put your weight on while snowboarding, then definitely not.
I don't know what MP is, but it does have a built in camera! I love this computer.
It is the inspiron 3521
Yes this devise will work on a USB 2.0 port. But as with any legacy device, your transfer speeds will be reduced due to USB 2.0 being a slower input/output channel than USB 3.0.
The 925 is 19x22x9 roughly, I could not measure exactly but it is no bigger. Hope this helps.
No, only the big unit contains the buttons and ports.
yes
Yes they can be turned off in the gui

Sorry i have a galaxy s4
Any ATX power supply that is at least 500 watts but it must have a 24-pin ATX power connector and the 4-pin 12V connector. An older PSU with a 20-pin ATX connector will not be reliable. I'm using a Cooler Master Power Pro 550. If you plan to use a separate plug-in video card and/or several hard drives, you should consider a 600 watt supply.
In testing the unit in the field with a 15" laptop and Samsung Galaxy S4 cell phone, we have received a usable signal (stronger than -80dBi) line-of-site range of about 800 foot radius. We have deployed units indoors, usable signal through four drywall walls was about 200 foot radius.
Yes from the pan base it will extend to be 4 feet, when everything collapsed i would say its about 2 feet, but that's just an estimate, its an excellent product and I'm so glad I bought this piece, you get some really good looking shots.
Absolutely.
I don't know if radio frequency is better but my parents that require hearing aids say these are the best product they own. If you do turn away from the transmitter you do lose the audio until you turn back.
Yes. I believe it would because my MBP Retina 13 fits.
The reception is great for me. My office is in the middle of a concrete building with large HVAC equipment on the roof above me and I have no trouble picking up my local public radio station. I just adjust the antenna every now then if things get wonky.
Yes, you can pair wireless headphones to this speaker via Bluetooth. There is also an aux port if you don't have wireless headphones.
Yes. Digital display
In short, yes. Any input will be output as balanced when using balanced connectors coming from the DC-1. HOWEVER, if you get interference from the non-balanced input BEFORE it hits the DC-1, it will be amplified with that interference. The balanced out only guarantees that any interference between the DC-1 and power amp / powers speakers will be eliminated. This would be the case with any pre-amp with balanced out.
Sorry I have no idea, I use the Emotiva Stealth 8 speakers which do not require subs and I never felt the need to find out if you could use the RCA outputs for sub woofers.
Change your device to the HDMI output.
No you do not need the foot pod to track pace. But I do recommend the heart rate monitor it is pretty nice to see how your heart rate changes depending on the difficulty of the course you are running..
The bundle includes the watch and the heart rate transmitter.
Yes, and previous weekly totals as well. Monthly totals are also available.
This laptop does not come with an optical drive. You can use an external USB CD/DVD/BR drive or flash drive for most things anymore. The last few laptops I owned, I believe the only time I used an optical drive was to install Linux. Used a flash drive for Linux on this laptop.

I liked it at first. It upgraded and blue screened. It has not been resolved as yet. Could be just this one but I can't recommend it at this time
Yes, I have an iPad Air. It charges fast.
Not sure why you thought the reviews were all fake, more than 100 already, all fake? I don't think so, at least not mine. I assure you the wall charger is not a junk. It works great with a decent price.
Thank you for the question.The answer is Yes. Hope this helps! iXCC Customer Service
This one is a slide in pocket so I would say yes you could use it with that tablet also. I have the Samsung 2014 edition 10.1 so they are a little different tablets.
I havr the galaxy 10.1 2014 edition and this case perfectly fits perfectly. You are able to access all of the ports including the volume rocker and speakers.
Yes
Yes it will work for an older tv. That is why I purchased mine.
Yes, there is a stand with 4 positions.
The overall dimensions are 7.5" x 2..25" x 1.125".
Yes, you will see all hdd's in a real time.
Yes, it works fine with OS X.
It did not work for me at all... Win 7 32 bit, Win 7 64 bit, or Win 8.... Keep looking...
They come off easy. And don't leave a residue. They are more of a decal than a sticker
The Verbatim M-Disc web site at http://www.mdisc.com/verbatimusa/ says that the Pioneer BDR-XS05 is compatible with M-Disc blu-ray. But I haven't yet tried with my drive, no occasion or need yet to burn an M-Disc. Nothing there is on the box or in the user manual about M-Disc, but both were printed in 2013. You should better ask directly Pioneer USA and / or Verbatim USA.
This device is a writer, not a reader. If you are intending to read (as in, watch) BluRays, this isn't the device for you. If, however, what you intend to do is backup your data files to BluRay format, you want this. I cannot provide the actual write speed data for this device, but on USB 3, my experience is that it is fairly fast, determined of course by the amount and type of data you are writing.
I have the temporary norton security, but once the trial runs out you need to purchase a new one.
It does generate a lot of heat and occasionally the fan will speed up to cool the CPU. I don't know if it overclocks itself, have never checked but given the heat it puts out normally I wouldn't be surprised if it might overheat. Wouldn't be my first choice for a gaming PC. Otherwise, it is crisp, powerful and solid.
Yes. There is a red LED in the center of the drive that flashes under the plastic. There is no "window" for the led, but it is bright enough that you can see it through the thin plastic casing of the rive. The LED flashes on when the drive is being accessed/transferring data, and is otherwise off.
This one works ok---end that goes into paperwhite slightly larger than the original. Would not buy unless there's no other option
Not 100 percent sure, but I have the iPad air wifi only 128 gig and it fit mine perfectly. I hope that helps somewhat.
Yes, though it is not a traditional way of listing all the "to do's." Pages & sections each week for goals, outcomes, steps to complete outcomes, personal & professional priority list. This calendar/planner helps me to better manage my time, goals and focus. This is my 2nd year for ordering the planner. Hope this helps.
I don't know but it was a perfect fit for my HDX 8.9 2013. It was my 3rd screen protector to try and I won't need another one. It is a good one.
no - just this is just a clear protective cover.
No Operating System is provided.
Just got the 128GB version. Running Crystal Disk Mark 64bit - Sequential Read: 100.7MB/s Write: 100.8MB/s 512K read 25.2MB/s write: 57.11MBs 4K random read: 0.263MB/S write 0.943MB/s 4K random QD32 read: 0.457MB/s write: 0.694MB/s - Hope this helps everyone to decide!
Failed me after two months.
Unfortunately it is not. It only works with computers with usb. http://www.displaylink.com/shop/index.php
1GB
No, the monitor uses USB to handle the touch part of this. The IPAD doesn't support this.
Internal. Plugs into the wall using a standard 110v cable
All Dell monitors come with a 3 year warranty. Enjoy!
Use a USB to RJ45 adapter. You get the same result. Try to find USB3 version. It is a faster. Should not cost more than few dollars, and it is much cheaper than fixing broken Ethernet port. If not physically damaged make sure you have the right driver.
Two cables are included for connection. A DB15 (commonly referred to as a VGA) cable of approximately 6 feet and a DVI-D cable of apprpximately 6 feet.
It should, as long as your Dell laptop has the 15 pin SVGA connector for an external monitor. The connector looks kind of like a lopsided D on it's side with like 3 rows of staggard pins.
Yes
I'm running Ubuntu and Chrome OS, so cant speak for Windows 8...but I get around 6 and a half hours.
dual 770
Yes it does.
You plug this into a USB port for power. Then, on the back you plug in a pair of speakers or headphones for audio out. You then pair it with your phone and play music. It then will be played through the speakers connected earlier.
No, there is no disk drive (optical drive) on this computer. Most information can be transmitted online or through a USB devises these days but if you wish to use the laptop for watching DVDs or using programs that require disks then this is probably not the machine for you. There are also external disk drives that would plug into the computer's USB port but if that is something you would use frequently it would probably turn out to be a hassle and it an extra expense. I hope this helps
1.2 gb
You attach to the wall not the crib. The monitor lost volume after a few uses, so I would not recommend.
Ours is only 110V.
After a few minutes the screen will go dark and only light up if noise is made, works great and having two cameras is nice for different rooms.
I use it with the iPad GS app which you can download from the App Store. If you want to run the GS software on a laptop just go out to DJI.com and download it. The CD is just the user manual and the laptop app I think. You can get all of that from DJIs website.
No.
Just hold the ATS button, the radio will scan the whole band and save any station that is good into the memory. You may use the forward and backword button to recall it. To save each individual station, when you tune in a station, press ATS once, it will save to the next available memory automatically. You can find details on manual too, Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions. Walter
Recharges through a mini usb port. It does not come with any adapters. If you have a 220V to mini usb port adapter then - Yes.
Go to YouTube and ask for instructions on installing a screen protector.
With a 50mms lenses.
Yes, the pocket is deep enough. There's also another slot for you chargers etc.
Have a Nikon D3200 and it was too small. Had to return it.
It is Bluetooth... does your pie have bluethooth ?
Not really, it's more like a small flashlight. The keys are not really back lit, and are hard to distinguish at night.
No
Yes, mine does the same, but usually once it gets restarted.
Assuming your asking about the power connection it is 1.3 mm by 3.5 mm
In some aspects, it is similar to skype, but not that convenient.
ye, it can but u need to crest a folder which have the music u want, then it can play, remember, it powered by android
I have JVC HA-FXZ2000 ear buds that what I use they work amazing the Sony Walkman NW-ZX1 !
Yes, it is 7.1 surround sound headset
The Bass on these is great! I'm not entirely sure what you mean by 'what you need to look at to tell.' But if you aren't satisfied with the bass of these headphones, the software comes with a built-in equalizer. You can adjust the bass in the headphones.
As it has no slot for a memory card I would have to say no.
It is easier if you use Airplay on your iPhone. First, make sure your iPhone is connected to the same WiFi network as your Bose. Using the pull up memo from the home screen on your iPhone, you will see Bose Soundtouch as an Airplay choice. Select it and then play music directly from your iPhone library.
To my lnowledge this one is only 315 MHz. Another model is 433 mhz.
You do not need antennas for the pair if you're using them for short distances. Mine work just fine within 100 feet.
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IPY4C84
hello, the included power cord is just used to power the battery charger. It may reduce the lifetime of the light if power the led light.
Do not know that system. However the quality of the Bose 30 is excellent.
Nope. Very basic telescope.
Yes it comes with most of the Microsoft products.
Short answer: yes it should work. Long answer: Your TV signal, whether it comes from your antenna, a satellite dish, or cable company, travels along the same coax cabling in your home. I did not have cable TV either and am getting my TV signal via antenna. If you have coax cabling running throughout your home and are using the correct kind of splitters (provided in the Actiontec kit) then it should work.
yes you can use a different cable longer or shorter etc. I have had no problem switching it up.
It detects all region discs automatically. It is truly a great and reliable machine. You literally just have to put in a DVD and watch
Yup...it's what I got it for!
Thank you for contacting us. The camera box will contain a USB cable intended for charging through a laptop/computer (or a USB wall socket if you own one). Here's a list of the OEM accessories inside the Sony camera box: *Waterproof Housing (16 ft. / 5m) *Curved Adhesive Mount *Flat Adhesive Mount *Quick-Connect Mount *NP-BX1 Battery Pack *Micro USB Cable *Software CD-ROM *Instruction Manual
The height isn't adjustable.
No. It would be nice, but no they are not compatible.
Yes
No, it doesn't come with anything like that.
The fan specifications for this case are as follows: front is either x2 120mm or x2 140mm, rear lower behind drive cages are x2 80mm, rear upper behind cpu is x1 120mm, top panel is x1 200mm fan. Website for all your case specs is http://us.coolermaster.com/en/product/Detail/case/mid-tower-haf-series/haf-xb-evo.html
The II signifies that it is the second generation HAF XB, but is not necessary since the EVO also denotes being second gen. It really is just a HAF XB EVO.
Yes, it shouldn't have a problem fitting. The case has a clearance of about 180mm. The CNPS12X is below that.
It is not listed on Google Play. However you do have access to some app on google play and also you may downlaod SlideMe App onto this tablet and you will have access to lots of apps similar to that on Google Play if not the same. Other that that this Table is the best I have download mant apps from SlideMe and it works. Just keep in mind to download what you need and not what you want. Best of Luck.
Yes it comes with modeling bulbs!
It is compatible with any camera that uses a hotshot to fire flash. Works on my T2i without problem.
I am testing it out right now for the first time and with my JVC earbud headphones the sound quality is absolutely amazing, lots of bass full rich sound. Simply blew me away just like so many other things about this tablet.
included and placed in launcher.
Yes, it is.
4.4.2 is most recent update, but I do not recommend KitKat on this device. The Dell support site is flooded with complaints. Jelly Bean worked well.
The version listed here (equipped with an Atom processor) comes with a full copy of Office 2013 Home and Student. If you opt for the more powerful (and expensive) models with Core i3 or Core i5 processors, they only come with a trial version; that is the point people get confused on.
Yes, I tried it at work on a teammates Latitude 10 dock and it worked fine. I had video problems with the Venue dock. About to buy a Latitude 10 dock on ebay.
In desktop (classic Windows) mode, yes. The desktop UI can be manually scaled to be more readable, but it makes certain apps not work correctly. This is the case with all Windows devices with small high-res screens like the Surface Pro and some Ultrabooks. However, the modern/metro touch-based UI does not have this issue. All of the apps for the new UI will scale to the screen res automatically.
Separately, the keyboards range from $130-$160 and about $40 for the stylus from dell.com
Yes, if you download the hulu app from google play store.
For what? Shopping? Watching movies&gt; Be specific
I think 5V, 1A is low. The supplied adapter has 24 W and the output is 5V, 2A. Maybe the device will be recharged with 5V 1A, but much more slowly
Hi, this unit sounds amazing with my Sennheiser HD250 headphones, which are also rated at 300 ohms. It is an amazing piece of gear.
I have used mine a couple of times with no issues. I know the generic batteries seemed to run down more quickly when stored in the grip. I just checked it again and saw that the grip also has an ON/OFF slide switch that much be turned on. It's below the camera LCD screen. Hope this helps!
I have the Canon 70D fits well, really well made and cheap compared to the Canon recommended
nope, it has not Auxiliary port
this cable came in the box with the system - - all necessary cables were included.
Thank you for the inquiry, Deborah and we are sorry to learn of the issue with your Lifestyle system. To determine this issue, please call us while you are with your Lifestyle 135 system. The direct number for the Bose Product and Technical Support department is 1-800-367-4008. We can help you troubleshoot this with you.
Yes, with an HDMI output on your camera you can plug in this monitor and see (just as you would on your camera) what you are recording.
yes
I'm not entirely sure. Try and make sure his surface's settings allow for the keyboard. Maybe restart it? And try cleaning the metal connectors on the keyboard with a qtip and some rubbing alcohol.
Yes it does &#128522; I use it for my surface pro 1
No. It is made to work with the Microsoft Surface.
Yes! I have it (:
It's just like a laptop; you can download whatever you want and it does not have to be from the Microsoft Store
In a nutshell this tablet has full Windows on it. So it can do anything a computer can do and has the portability of a tablet.
Yes, Micosoft Touch Cover 2 is a keyboard and cover for the surface 2. It also has a stand that can be pulled out to hold up the screen.
I asked for the 2013 hdx 7 and thats what I got.Size depends on the year aswell.
No, you can watch from a distance or the side and it shows no distortion of color or picture. Not sure of the actual viewing angle.
Nope. There is noextra cost.
I had the same problem. what i did is found the video on youtube and it showed me which icons i needed to go through to change it to english :)
Contact the manufacturer and see if you can get that fixed. It should still have the basic 1 year warranty.
I have an Asus 15.6 inch and it fits.. so I would imagine yes?
I'm sorry, but I don't know. I would expect it would because it is all nylon.
Mine is black.
There is one large pocket on each side of the bag, right below the handle. They are not specially designed to hold pens or similar small items, but are better suitable for carrying chargers, power adapters etc.
I have a 15.6 inch Dell and it fits in this bag perfectly.
Not sure of the dimensions but I can tell you that it is the standard usb hub sizes found on pc's & laptops
Nope
My kids have them, as of the last couple of weeks no they have not.
Mind does not do that when I open it up, so I would suggest you contact Amazon Kindle support. If they cannot help maybe you could get the cover people to replace the one you have with a new one.
no
Absolutely. Adobe works great and google has a suite of office like products for free and that are wonderfully easy to use
Free wifi? yep. If it has a password then, no, unless you have the password. I use one of my cable companies hot spots to use my kindle at work.
Yes, if you have a monitor that has a HDMI input, you can run a HDMI cable from the HP 14 to the monitor. You can "mirror" where both screens are the same, or you can "extend" where each screen has it's own area.
I have buttons that keep popping off the top row. I advise you to save up and buy a better quality keyboard. That's what I am doing.
If you have a wireless printer (HP ePrint or Canon Pixma ) on your network, you can add it to chrome cloud print in the chrome browser and print that way.
Definitely with Linux. I haven't tried with Android.
Yes it did! It came with Windows 8.1.
Which one? Not ghosts.
I would say it's light enough to be portable but I keep it in one location. No batteries.
Lol!!
According to a post the reset button on the WD TV Live can also functions as a toggle between PAL and NTSC, if held longer than the normal time for a reset. Look at page 8 - Connections of the owners manual.
Unfortunately no.
Yes
Yes. I use the keyboard for a variety of my memo pads, computers, Android phone. Anything that has Bluetooth.
The case sort of "snaps" on, no way it will fall off. It takes considerable thumb pressure at the corners to completely remove the case. The side that folds back, to form the stand, easily pop off, just not the other snaps.
Yes, the fan is cooling down the system, esp the light, I think. I find the instructions for turning off the machine confusing. I let the fan run for 10 min or so, check that it feels cool, then pull the plug. The machine works great except for the OFF snag.
No instructions came with it. But you can YouTube it and you will find so many videos explain how to do it just be gentle with it. Let me know if u need help
Buy a new set...$$$$$
I am using AA butteries, as well as Sony camera batteries and both work well.
yes
The most recent one? I think so, I got my 7" on black friday, so unless something's changed since then you should be fine!
Yes, as far as you have port to connect with the tablet monitor (like VGA, HDMI, Mini-Display, DVI-I)
You should consider the Kindle Fire. The Android OS naturally won't support it. The work around: you need manually install Adobe Flash Player apk (not by Google Play), and then using other browser app like Dolphin or Firefox and enable to run Adobe Flash Player. The Chrome won't support it. This issue is not unique to this tablet, nor Dell Venue 8. If you do not understand what I talked about. Go for the "Kindle Fire"s, which is/are very good tablet(s).
It's probably best to wait a few months. Hopefully ASUS does a redesign on the dock, it's junk and not a tight fit like my old TF201 w/dock.
If it is a prepaid SIM with a set amount of data on it already then yes. Otherwise no you will need a SIM and a data plan. Unlocked just means you can use a SIM from any carrier and the device itself is not locked to just one carrier (i.e. AT&T, T-Mobile, etc).
No
no
Yes
It is supplied with a white led. The tube is hollow to amplify the light. The LED is a 5mm
of course
It does come with a warranty, but I'm fairly sure is from Japan. If it applies to the US, I have yet to confirm.
Yes
Can't say anything about the box\documentation as I didn't keep it, but on the headphones themselves I see no CE logo. All there is some Japanese symbols on on side, and "Made in China" and some model numbers on the other side of the headrest.
Nope, that's another $200!
No it is completely blank. When I first installed in on my PC, it was no showing up under "My Computer", I had to fist formatted. very simple to do, took only a few min. After that i restarted my PC and my computer detected it right on start-up.
4TB drive is the fastest of the bunch since it has more platters than the 2TB or 1TB version. So if you are looking for the fastest non-SSD drive out there, it would be the 4TB version of the WD Black.
Yes, the FZEX model of the 2TB Western Digital Black drive is the newest one.
I highly recommend this one, we own 3 of them and they have been rock solid for us for about the last 3 years. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817392044&nm_mc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC&cm_mmc=KNC-GoogleAdwords-PC-_-pla-_-Hard+Drive+Enclosures-_-N82E16817392044&gclid=CjwKEAjw56moBRD8_4-AgoOqhV4SJADWWVCcTrv06Ew4bvd9ASwWY7J922tvEgOMrHRcKMA6u91ixxoCMWfw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds
I have 2 bodies in this bad. A Canon 50D and a Canon 5D mark 3. I also have 2 lenses, 24-70mm and a 70mm-200mm. Plus 2 Speedlite flashes , 580EX and a 600ex. Extra Batteries, Chargers and A Gary Fong light sphere. In the other compartments, I have my laptop and IPad. I highly recommend this bag. It fits all my needs. It does get very heavy. I also use the outside attachment for my Manfrotto travel tripod. No complaints on this purchase. I wouldn't consider any other bag.
NO INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING
No problem. If you use it with cable, the headphone becomes studio v2.
This one does not have the digititizer (pen)
No. This model doesnt have pen. You need to buy from Lenovo official website to get the one with pen.
Samsung specs say 5ms GTG. http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/monitors/LS27B350HSZ/ZA-specs
Yes it does. And it works great,
Is that a question? Yes adobe photoshop can run on this computer. No. It's not included
On the Lenovo website it says there is no back lit keyboard on this model.
I have just have a test for my beats studio wireless according your question, when I'm disconneted Bluetooth function for my iPad with my beats studio wireless , after 5 min,the head phone will be auto turn of. But, if I m still connecting my iPad with my headphone but not playing any misic after 10 -20min, the head phone is still on. Which is means, if you want to make your hadephone auto off, than you have to disconneted the Bluetooth function on your iPad .
no it does not, also the touchpad is clumsy and uncomfortable
since I use it with an iPad air I have not seen or thought of a rear projection setting for this purpose, I have only projected from the front.
No
Yes, the receiver side has a 3.5mm jack to plug the Bose headphone into. The FiiO W1 transmitter will connect to the FiOS set top box. Use the optical or coaxial digital out for best quality sound.
Both the transmitter and the receiver use USB cables and USB to A/C power adapters - very much like you use with iPhones.
Not very far at all... 20 feet?
Yes but from my experience with this device the range is limited. I actually sent it back and hard wired wverything
That is correct. The rear camera slaves off of the front. So when the front is shut off by the power magic pro so is the rear
Yes it does. Its just below a Plastic lid.
I do all outdoor photography and have not had any issues at all. This is a great grip and the batteries are excellent as far as battery life goes.
Its a better experience in every aspect. I stepped from the K5 and the AF and clarity on all my high end lens now shines. Color depth is fantastic and the details are just better. I am glad I upgraded.
The battery is inside the film packet. It's brilliant. You just insert the film and the camera/flash works. Enjoy!
No. The VUP is only for VS2012 to VS2013. This is the upgrade path: http://www.microway.com.au/microsoft/visual-studio-upgrade.php
There is a Limited 30 Day Factory Warranty & 60 Day DealFisher Warranty
The DJI iOSD Mini does not display GPS information. The manual is available for download from the DJI web site. All the available telemetry is shown and explained in the manual.

You are going to need an antennae for this device because it is not included.
Model number which specified in description it fits to that model. Actually i had taken that to my friend.it was really great for him.its working fine.this is not a touch screen.
No it does not.
Download to computer. However, as an action cam, the video was terrible and very shaky.
The original company "Sharper Image" is out of business. Scammers have purchased the name and are using that to market and sell junk. The camera is junk.
I use a scan disk SD I think that what it is my phone SD also works
When you charge the camera, the charge light stays on regardless if it is fully charged or not to my experience. I lastly remember charging it overnight. I would say about 4 to 6 hours.
yes im using 620W PSU
Most cards are to some degree. AMD has that feature in their Catalyst software suite.
It should not be doing this. Make sure you have he latest drivers installed then call the manufacture for technical support if it continues.
Yes and check out www.overclock.net keep in mind that it is already highly overclocked and might be at the chips limits for performance. Welcome to the silicone lottery my friend. Some chips will do 1400/1800 on air @ 1.3v others will not budge past 1150/1600 no matter how much voltage you give it even under custom waterblocks. My 2 cents
You should be able to run it just fine with a 600W PSU. If you are going to upgrade in the future, say crossfire, then you should look into upgrading to a 750W or 800W PSU.
I'm not exactly sure but I think you can only use a dell pen.
Hey.. Not sure since i dnt have ipad air 2 but it works great with iPad air.. As long as the length is same i guess it will work with air 2 as well
Yes
DVR is capable of audio. Microphones are sold separately for cameras.
The camera did not work long enough to test that feature.
Yes while installed in its clear housing.

Yes, just go to settings, search language and choose spanish, I did with my tablet
Not in the list of models it replaces. This one does at Amazon.com
I looked but never found a Asus Z54c, but I did find a Asus x54c, you have to search for you specific model, sometimes you crossreference through Yahoo, then com back to Amazon. The plug in part has a few different positions, & only the right one will fit your computer
Yes, using the remote or controls on the device you can Adjust keystone
According to the installation instructions for the BC20, the camera has a horizontal angle of 140 degrees and a vertical angle of 115 degrees, with a resolution of 640x480.
I have no problem with the battery. Charge lasts for at least 4 hours.
This camera requires a SD Memory Card, which does not come included. It has 87 MB built in, but that will only be good for a couple of pictures.
Yes
The HMZ-T3 comes with in-ear earbuds with a lot of different sizes for the inserts Here's the link for the headphones included in the box. http://www.amazon.com/SONY-MDR-XB90EX-EXTRA-Headphones-Japanese/dp/B008G80FIU/ref=sr_1_89?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1383971396&sr=1-89&keywords=sony+earbuds
No there is not. Just USB charger
Ihave mine sinced 3 weeks ago, and NO problem, its great, i used it for games and its really good at it. Best pc for the price, trust me.
thats a good questions ,,you might wanna asked the seller ,,but i know it has 2yr warranty from manufactor
No, but as long as the lighting is good or if you're outside it take really nice pictures.....Hope this help you....
Yes. This tablet support HDMI output
It comes with built in wifi. So the easiest way would be to purchase a tiny usb bluetooth receiver. This would take up a usb port, but would only stick out of the computer by a few milimeters, far less than other cables you might have attached. That would get the job done.
Sure...my man (who I got the gift for) has what I call "monster hands", LOL...and he has no trouble with it :-)
Yes. They offer the plan separately when you purchase the tablet.
You can only use what is downloaded to the tablet without a wifi connection otherwise you have to purchase a data plan. Hope this was helpful! Let me know if I can help you with anything else!
You have to download and install flash player for android from Google maket.
Sound is not very good with out the head phones
That's going to be a software issue on your Mac, not an issue with the battery itself. As long as it's holding a charge, the issue shouldn't be with the battery. I would suggest contacting AppleCare regarding the icon issue.
No. I will not see anything outside at night.
it has an AC adapter and requires a nearby electrical outlet
Ah, yea it stick out a little. But you have a mid-size case or bigger you should be good. Had no problem with mine.
Yes, this motherboard is recent mine is 4 years old and it works with no problems, as long as it has a pci express slot you should not have any issues
The card will work on your Mobo so I don't think you have anything to worry about just make sure the other specs of your system are on par
Yes, but it does come with a 6 pin addaptor. But it needs about 150w to itself or so
My computer run with 400w, perfect work
I live in FL and it's just as hot here! In the summer, If I'm going to park in the sun all day, I just remove the suction cup holder and place it in the tray out of the sun. It's always on when I'm driving though and it's never fallen off after a 8 hour drive.
I bought the camera and didn't think I had spots - until I started doing some B&W conversions. Spots every where. I used the electronic sensor cleaner faithfully, used a Giotto blower for dust removal, and there were still spots that obviously needed swab cleaning. That however, has to be performed by the Nikon facility, which requires shipping across country for me. I opted to return the camera.
Yes and not only, even slideshow. You have to decide to buy a kit or to buy a body and a lens separate. It would be a little expensive, but... you know Some tips: The best macro lens for Nikon is Sigma 105mm f/2.8 EX DG OS HSM - 700 Sharpness test: http://cdn0.mos.techradar.futurecdn.net/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Best%20macro%20lenses/Res%20Sigma%20105mm%20f2-8%20EX%20DG%20OS%20HSM_105mm_f8_5391.JPG Again, second only to Zeiss. There's little central fringing at all apertures, and at the edges it's still better than some lenses at the centre. Compare to Zeiss Makro-Planar T* F2 100mm ZE - 1,550 Good luck 8)
the price is $2296
The body does not come with a bag from Nikon. You need to buy one on your own or look for a bundle that includes one.
yes the DX lenses will work with this camera.
It's better than the screen but fingerprints still show up.
Yes it will. I use it in a monitor that has an HDMI input but no coax.
Simple button for shutter release. It does not have the capability to press it half way down to autofocus,but if you want it to autofocus you should of put your focus mode into AF-A and then press so it will adjust the focus and then shots.
Yes - it arrived factory-sealed and brand new - nice camera too...
I installed mine with a Pioneer aftermarket receiver. The receiver will require an adapter harness to plug into the Jeep factory wiring harness.
Yes, it lights up blue.
No. It's powered off your USB port.
If you have it set to low or high there is a light sensor on it that turns the night light on and off. If it is set to power failure mode then the light will only come on when the outlet it is plugged into losses power.
They will light up a 12' square room and bigger with no problem... Best lights for the money I've ever had
Six are used for hi & low night light. Four are used for power failure. Ten total. I have the costco version- just a slightly different package.
This camera uses infrared LEDs to provide night vision in total darkness up to 30ft. If the camera is pointed towards a window, the infrared will reflect off the glass and affect the picture quality. This type of installation is not recommended.
I sent the camera back because of weak battery and the fact it did not have HDR. Those filters cannot be applied after the image is taken.

Yes, they use a standard 3.5mm headphone jack for speakers and microohone. Make sure you have those two ports, usually green and pink, but they will be for audio out and mic in, these are not USB. Great sound too
No, my experience with this head set has been great. I haven't had a problem with them hurting my ears. They are very comfortable. My only problem is that the wire is too short but besides that I am very impressed
Yes it does (both RAW and JPEG). I have done it many times but find it a little cumbersome (at least for me, it does not happen smoothly. Sometimes the camera and computer do not find each other easily). I use a micro USB cable, connect the camera to the computer and download images. Hope it helps.
I'm not sure about an actual physical remote, but the last update allows you to use a smart phone as a remote
I bought one from them. It was in English.
Yes it will...
No
No, there isn't
I'm not sure I didn't have much success with that unit I use iPhone 5s.
as already answer above, no.
Yes. The buttons are smaller and it seems like it is rubber.
Hi, thanks for contacting us. Unfortunately this card will not work with your system. I am sorry and if there is anything else I can do for you or if you have any other questions please let me know. Sincerely, Chris Nickels Red Planet Trading
I have not rooted one you could probably do so by putting an SD card in the slot with the stock android but I don't think it's necessary for most uses. I do about everything on mine the only apps I haven't been able to install were screen related. Like the new candy crush I have to use an older version because the screen is too small for the newest version.
Yes it does
yes
Greetings, No, this model does not support a 2.5" drive. The 'H' models will support 2.5" drive expansion; not currently available in the US. Best regards, MITXPC

Is your tv on hdmi, the best u can do is return it and get stream smart ecs
Shift keys are Larger than the Regular Keys, and also very clearly Marked.
The keyboard can be removed and your tablet will remain in the protective leather enclosure. As long as the velcro retaining strap is in place the tablet stays tight. On the negative side, don't expect the keyboard to last long before the keys start failing to respond! I got two of them and one of them didn't last much more than two weeks before they started to fail! I like the protective portfolio but not impressed with the keyboard.
These generally will drop and run on most o/s systems, however there are Intel drivers at http://support.toshiba.com/drivers . I'm unaware of any other software for this disk. I just plugged it into my Mac and away it went, after correct OSX setup of course.
No, there is no mounting bracket that comes with this kit. It comes with a mounting spacer that may be needed in some notebooks or laptops where the drive bay may be thicker. This ssd is 7mm ideal for ultra notebooks. For a desktop, you will have to purchase a mounting bracket on which the ssd will mount and the bracket can be mounted or slid into the hard drive cage. When you look at the item in amazon, look at the bottom and it will give you links to purchase a bracket also.
No
Yes it will work. Smooth depends on what processor you have on the motherboard. And of course, you need a sufficient power supply to run it.
No.
Please provide more detail about your computer! Does it support SATA III 6 Gbit/s? If it does then this SSD will work. http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Other-Notebook-PC-Questions/How-do-I-determine-if-my-computer-can-handle-SATA-II-or-SATA/td-p/2352227 If you don't know, do a google search with your HP model as keyword or contact HP support and ask them.
yes, DVD Recordable (Dual Layer)
Indeed it does!
Greetings. The CD is a must for the installation. Thanks for your question.
No
If you wish to compare image quality, the best scientific non-bias source is www.dxomark.com. The Sony A7 scored 90. The Mk3 scored 81. The A7R scored a 95.
Hi Clinton, you can use this Sony lenses: SEL55F18Z or SEL1855. Works great for portraits. -Ely
We got two of these. IMO it is the best bridge camera out there. It is weather sealed, and we've had no problem taking it out in a light drizzle; I wouldn't risk heavy rain or putting it under a waterfall...hope this helps. If you can, follow @brimarkphoto on twitter for more.
Hello, my dear friend. this product is a universal keyboard case for surface, pro, surface 2 and pro 2, and just for the window surface series.
I'm going by memory and I didn't buy it for the reasons you inquired about, I believe the sales information says it can be used for conference calls and does have a microphone. It does have an aux port. If you call Klipsch the sales people are very helpful. They even told me about the part needed to use Bluetooth on my older lap top. Good luck Mike
Just the tablet, the pen, and the charger. If you want a cover or keyboard, they are separate.
Not sure if you got the answer from someone else. But just wanted to confirm that it does work. Hopefully helps if someone else comes in here via google results.
Dear Customer, According to our knowledge laptop and notebook are the same things. There is no difference. This laptop will work with MS Office Thank you
Yes. It does have HDMI port
Photoshop now has an app, so yes.
Yes. I have a MacBook Pro and have no problems connecting the two. You do have to have the wire connected. It doesn't sync wirelessly
yes that is what it means
I am not sure I can answer that question because I bought the takes fir my nephew for Christmas. He loves it. Have you tired Google play store for the software.
Now dont get me wrong the first one I had broke within the first 3 hours of me having it but I bought a new one and it was GREAT but I broke it with my knee by accident and so I replaced it with my 6th Kindle, the fire hd6 so replace it its best
Just front camera, not great resolution. Definitely not a tablet to take pictures
yes they have a built in Li-Ion batery that can be charged by the included USB cable
The charger has prongs on the back that flip out and then plugs directly into the wall outlet.
yes they have a built in Li-Ion battery that can be charged with the included usb cable
I bought these headphones with the Supertech USB Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy Micro Adapter with Csr8510 Controller and CSR Harmony for Windows Xp Vista 2003 2008 7 and 8 32/64 Bit, so that I could use them on my PC for in-game chat on TeamSpeak and Ventrillo. These headphones work perfectly with both programs.
The information in this link should help you. http://www.geeetech.com/wiki/index.php/Arduino_GPRS_Shield
I returned it because it is very difficult to use. Buy Google Chromecast instead.
Good
She could got malaware or virus
No, this product is not qualified with WiDi.
I don't know how it fit on Sony Rx1 but it is perfected on Sony Alpha a7r...(sony make believe) don't try different brands
Yes it does. I currently have a carry speed plate and tripod mounting plate on it at all times.
I think that is a personal choice that is debated in many groups. Personally, I do not for what I shoot but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't.
Hi Neil, Original package includes Lens (1), Front lens cap (1), Rear lens cap (1), Lens hood (1), Lens case (1), Set of printed documentation. Vincent
As per Sony.net Weight (Approx.) : 15.16 oz. (430 g)
Sorry Daniel but i have not used da ismart receiver. Yes i own one but its new in da box. Please keep me updated wit any new upgrades and info. I bought da box to use wit my indash monitor. But still lookin for a mobile carfi.
Depends on what your media is and the USB port on your device (dependent on your devices clock speed) What max is I really don't know but I'd assume it would be whatever you get from USB 3.0
please note that the cable is fit for DV7-6000 series So it should be fit with your device.
Yes.
I dont believe to
Yes, it has one HDMI port.
No.
You might try Radio Shack. Make sure that the charger is not above 1.0 amps. Barring that I imagine that the charging cable for a Nitecore I2 or I4 MIGHT work as those chargers are also 1.0 amps input. However I am not sure that the plugs will correspond that enter the charger its self. I think you can pick up the Nitecore cable for around $5.00
Yes, that's actually what I bought it for and it works great.
First of all I have never received my order from Amazon.I am still waiting. Secondly There will be a small voltage drop but unless you are using some very sensitive equipment it should not be a problem. I just hope Amazon comes through with my order soon. Art
No
Yes. With or without the keyboard, the cover folds flat. Make sure you turn it off first or you will get interesting results.
Yes, green light on the top, a beep, and you'll hear the fan spin up.
yes i can barey hear it while its on.
I've already delivered the PC I built with this board, so I can't measure it directly. However, it is definitely a typical MicroATX form factor.
Yes. You will need to create Windows 7 Pro recovery disks first from the hard drive that comes on the computer. To do so, you will need 3 to 5 blank DVD-R or DVD-RW disks. Go to Start, Lenovo ThinkVantage Tools, and you will see the option for the factory disks there. It will take about an hour to an hour and a half. Then, switch the drives and install Windows 7 Pro from the disks you just created. You can also call Lenovo Tech Support and they will mail these disks to you.
Yes, the nvidia equivalent would be the 750 ti
I can't honestly say yes or no because 3 of my boys had these tablets and the battery never lasted long enough to experiment much
21.3 with 20 in screen.
Don't know about "original" but mine had displayport, vga, USB, power and CD with drivers.
Ralph, It has Windows installed. It does not have Microsoft Office or any other 3rd party software installed. I ordered several of them for my warehouse, and with all the dust and temperature ranges I still have not had a problem.
Hello there. Won't help too much but 1st reduce the screen resolution. 2nd find on App store an app called battery saving. Hope will help a little bit better. Regards.
Yes you can
No, Google play store can't be installed. Most of kid tablets can not preinstalled Google Play as the license issues and google will not authorize most of licenses for most of third party. So this product can't connect to Google Play. However, you can download the apps via operal and slidme, which are pre-installed in the system. Also you can install Amazon store to download apps. Thank you.
no, it does not.
you shouldn't have any problems since they all use the same catalyst software suite, however if you are using anything less than the Omega version 14.12 I would suggest you upgrade your drivers.
considering the 270x is roughly 80% faster than the 6870 i would think you shouldnt have a problem with those settings. If your buying a 270x go with the 4GB version instead of the 2GB version.
It sure does!
Hi, This card will support two monitors simultaneously, as stated in the manual. Given that, I don't really see why you would want to drive one monitor from the card and one from the motherboard - using system RAM rather than dedicated graphics RAM. However, if the latter is what you wanted to do, I can't think why that would not work. But, it's a great card at a bargain price so why not drive two monitors from it?
AC1200 doubled the speed of AC600. So it is faster but bulky in size. AC1200 means 11ac data transfer speed 866Mbps and 11n 300Mbps. AC600 means 11ac 433Mbps and 11n 150Mbps.
No It said SD
Yes there is power cord in the box.
no PC required, only internet connection
Its greater than 90 close to 180
It feels durable.
No it does not support a second video card. You can only swapp a HDD/SSD for an ODD.
This small size box, like Battery size. Thanks

Hi Kelly, The X10F can't be physically displayed in portrait. The stand will only facilitate landscape.
My wife and I both have iPad Air models, and we have zero complaints about the fit of this case. It is very snug and secure. We have no concerns about it slipping.
please be noted, it is built with kids friendly silicone materials, non-slip, anti-dust and scratch-free;
sorry, we did not have the ipad 2 shock proof case at the moment, but it will be available in future.
I'm not sure. This cover is for the Tab 2 10.1 inch and not the original Galaxy Tab. 10.1. Yes they're both 10 inch tablets, but they may have subtle differences in bezel sizes and placement of controls, which would make the cover incompatible. I haven't tested it but I highly doubt it would fit.
No. This is a digital to analog converter. Your IPod is also a DAC, it's already doing the conversion for you, so this device wouldn't do you any good.
Yes but there are some missing spots about every 10 seconds.
it can fit dv7-6000 and dv6-6000 series.But DV7-4000 series laptop is not included.
Cannot respond to the video card question but it is a fairly fast responsive laptop. It does not, however, come with a full version of office, it is a trial version. I have had to use add ins to modify windows 8 to make it more usable. There is no DVD/CD, you need an external. Only two USB, and they are close together, I need a USB extender for some plugs. Find I am accidentally hitting keys that do strange things, continually disturbing. Otherwise good solid laptop.
Yes Windows 8.1 provides support for many languages including Spanish. That's part of the initial setup of the computer
Yes. It's built into the top portion of the case.
The only issue I had is that the volume button doesn't align up with case volume button hole. Also the Id thumb print won't be usable as well.
1.no. Only landscape 2. No only one position.
That or install a external cd drive
I found that if I add movies to my skiva drive I need to do a reset to the skiva router to get them to show up under the dlna function. Even after the reset it still takes awhile for it to search the drive before they show up.
60 feet
Yes, it's always on. Light stays blue except when the Bluetooth device goes out of range. Then light turns red.
I don't know, haven't received yet? Sorry!
I have a Netflix account and have not had any issues when watching movies online.
Yes you can up date.
No, it's the DX format.
no it does not
Mine (Red body, purchased as body only) is labeled "Made in Thailand".
This has a slightly higher output voltage, and can deliver a usable charge over a slightly longer period of time versus the EN-EL14. In practical terms - it's about 50 minutes of recording vs 40 minutes, and 600 single image shots vs 500 over the older model battery.
It works, it's not nas... It works, but for The price I expected more. Hard to install
I ordered the exact same thing. Both were shipped together in the same box and were packed very well and all arrived in perfect condition. By the way, I am very happy with the purchase.
No
Yes it's 100% Bluetooth capable
they do not need to be connected to a camera shoe. They can be powered by battery so there are no cables to get in the way, however, these are very marginal quality and not particularly bright lights. i'd give them 2 stars
No, powered by batteries (AA's) very portable.
I believe all GoPro cameras have international warranty but it will depend on the authorized seller in your country some of them they don't have any work shop so they will send it to the state to fix it, Hope i answer your question. Regards
yes. it comes with a housing with 2 different backs. The water proof back is harder to hear the audio through (it is more muffled because the mic is under the housing. They also provide a non waterproof back that the audio is easy to hear. They are easy to change. The housing also has buttons on it so the camera can be operated manually while it is in either of the housings, or with the supplied remote.
I imagine that you would have to replace the screws that comes with it with masonry screws. but you also need to find a place to plug in that little wire to make it look like its running into the house
I have a similar setup using ATT Uverse. I basically just disabled the routing function of the uverse router/modem and let skydog do the work.
You need to get the glass panel with the LCD screen digitizer all together. It cost me $57.00 and the 3m glue that's recommended. It was an easy fix, unfortunately my teenagers were using it without a case and broke it again. My son tried ordering a replacement for $28.00 and it only the glass panel.Return what you purchased and order the whole thing together. Good luck.
When I received my board, it came with the F1 bios. I have since updated to F4b. No problems. I should note that I ordered and received my board in mid November 2013. Hope this helps.
Its 4gb
yes
Yes on both accounts. You can FF when watching the video recording and you can set it to notify you when motion is detected and on what camer so you can go right to that camera and remote view.
i use mine with a wifi
This unit is not 3g. You can only put in a micro card for additional storage. Works ok for a basic tablet.
It says it has a A70X
This unit is only 4 channel. They do make them that will handle up to 8 camera's though.
On the unit I purchased it is showing the GeForce GT 740M via Windows Device Manager.
No im sorry it does not do that.
It will still work, just will not get data on the panel and inverter.
The inverter has the cable with MC4 connector as shown in the picture. The other cable has a special connector to plug into the trunk cable (not included)
I learned you HAVE too use the cord that came with it. Also, no window pops up. You have to click on "my computer" and get into it that way. Kinda like a flash drive.
it is no more than 5 or 10 watti used it to strap to the front of my kayak and it was more than enoughfor what i needed
No, it does not. It takes 4 AA batteries which are included
I have the TV facing at over 90 degrees from the wall it is mounted on. [Odd situation, but just sayin'] There are also adjustments to compensate for not mounting it perfectly "square" on the wall.
Not sure but it fits all standard sizes...I have a 65" Vizio and it fits great.
I don't remember the system requirements, but I'm running it on Windows 7, 64 bit. Works fine.
From Corsairs site: Compatibility Intel LGA 1150, 1155, 1156, 1366, and 2011 AMD sockets FM1, FM2, AM2, and AM3
This one is better than the 212 evo but it is depend on the power supply that you have to support for the liquid cooler the H75 have 2 fan so it cool down your cpu faster. That is my opinion.
no dual core, has 1.2Ghz Cortex AB Processor Chip
The larger measurements are for the box it comes in
Yes
Yes
No, just a single pause/play button
Intel Hd 4400 is not a GPU, that is integrated graphics which means the graphics are run through the processor. The Haswell chips do have decent integrated graphics but you can't play any intensive games. It will play older games though.
Yes in device manager
I have a 2006 VW Passat and my husband installed it. I love it. I had a 5-disc changer box that came with the car and both units are identical size. We just installed it within the last two weeks.
I am not sure, please Contact Volkswagen to find out!!
MAR stays for Microsoft Authorized Refurbisher.
The memory is shared, but most of the time it is about 1 gb.
Yes
Yes. It has two slots.
No, but check the name plate, that will tell you the voltage and current draw, amps.
Yes it does
Hello. Yes, we can help. Would you kindly send us (Tablet2Cases), the seller, an email and we will provide you further detailed instructions.Thank you.
Nope. But you can easily make one yourself.
Thank you for your inquiry. The item originates from our HK warehouse and standard delivery to the US takes an estimated 17-28 business days, though our packages generally arrive sooner. Customs duties are rarely applied, but please note that these issues can possibly still happen.
Yes Thay Do But you will Need To look on the Box to see. I have a Philips, the only think is I have A Philips T.v @ Dvd @ Dvc. ?????????????
Unit has RCA-type outputs for audio (red and white) and video (yellow).
I don't think it's opens up wide enough and it would not take the weight for sure. I was not too impressed with this item as well. On my first one the screw mount broke (it's made of cheap plastic) and then I got a second one thinking it would be okay. The second one broke as well when tightening it. I wasn't even tightening it that much. I would veer away from this product. I bought of the the ones that clip on the vents and it works like a charm.
After checking the instruction book, I don't think it's possible but I'm no expert. There's no DVD player or recorder on this.I also have a Magnavox HDD & DVD Recorder with digital tuner. That one would be able to record to the HDD.
It isn't adjustable
Nope. . Mines have a hill too. ..I put a brick or something under one side of the leg to level off the screen. . Once that's done your main focus will be on the screen. . You won't even notice it.. Easy fix
no mount for cap
it connects to your phone like bluetooth, it has about a 15 to 20 feet range. You can record or just live stream. there is a 1/2 second delay from real time
Yes you can use it in the UK
No: just amount one can record locally
Yes you can use it in the UK
No it will not
Only up to 8''.
The red one seems to be a little thicker than the black one that I see here. I hoe that this helps.
32gb only it won't handle anything else
Hi. Sorry to hear this. have you tried contacting the vendor?
Yes
V.S. There should be two little sliders on the back of the computer that you move to discharge the battery.
I was wondering the same thing. I need to order this as a technical machine for a developer and can't place the order unless it's a 16 as stated in the title :/
Negative
The NC-239WF HD 1080P comes with 6mm focus length lens. And the same model in white color , NC-240WF HD 1080P comes with 4mm focus length lens.
The AC adapter is 12V/ 1A. Some customers connect the camera to UPS or solar power battery
The 227 is 720p vs 1080p fps 30 vs 15 night vision same 64gb vs 128gb I have the 227 with some issues not totally happy with it
Definitely, and you can connect it to an external TV too. I had been using it a lot to watch DVD movies on it.
No actually the battery life is pretty good. When it's fully charged I would use it for about 3-4 hours
Yes this unit runs on windows 8
You can buy it with either 4 or 8 GB but you cannot upgrade it later. The chips are hardwired to the main board.
Yes, it comes with a charger and rechargeable battery.
Manual but not regulator
I was wondering the same thing. This looks to be a very good keyboard. I may buy it. If I do, I'll be sure to post a review.
It's a revising number, but you should ask dish directly
No. The X2 CAN NOT be roof mounted. The X1 can be roof mounted with the RK-2000 kit.
Surface 2 tablet, manual and charger in the original box
yes
While I don't do gaming, my tablet is for business primarily, it's 2Gb memory is probably not adequate for heavy-use gaming, but it does very well for streaming video, if that helps. The atom processor is surprisingly good, and surprisingly fast, but if you're looking for gaming only I don't know if a Windows machine with 2Gb of memory is a smart choice. The tablet is fast for word processing, spreadsheets, streaming and video. It has been completely reliable in the year I've had it.
WiFi with bluetooth works fine. I commonly use the internet to stream music and videos while using bluetooth mouse and keyboard.
I'm fairly certain it should be no problem to fit on a motocycle. I purchased one for my moped and there is a lot of excess on the cover. Plus there is elastic pieces which helps stay on the wheels. Should work no problem! Hope that helps.
That's what I am covering with this.
No, but it works just as well the only thing missing is the logo.
No where near what they documentation stated. I would say about 36 to 40 inches is what the actual picture size but the outer screen is larger.
No.
No, it works off of Bluetooth.
Manufacturer warranty is 1 year like any other electronic items
Yes, it comes with 1 year manufacturer's warranty.
*coin miners are buying up every high and high-ish end card out there to mine for Litecoings and Dogecoins and such. The AMD cards are significantly better than Nvidia cards for mining. The demand is driving the price up everywhere. Very irritating. I would just wait for a few more weeks if you can. The price might drop in mid or end of January 2014.
Yes it will, but dang, you're gonna need a big PSU :P. I think my 900Watt won't even power a second 290X GPU lol. If you want a new GPU, this is the one to get. ATLEAST 200Fps Every game. Cod ghost, perfect to play with , besides because there is optimization problems in the game, I get a 0.2 second lag every 10 mins lol. No bad, xD.
The screen is divided into four squares. Click on one square to make it full screen. It connects to whatever you want.
The recording time is dependent of your setting on your DVR, whether you save more recording time by activating motion detection. And the size HDD you buy. You can leave your system to record non-stop but the amount of recording time is subjective to your HDD size.
You will have to port forward your router.
I'm using a computer monitor that's probably 3 yrs old or so. Hope this helps.
Yes it does have wifi built in.
Yes, it does have a microphone.
yes, it works for Amazon instant video. I used it last night. I do not know about Amazon cloud as I haven't tried it.
You can bring it to the apple store within the first couple of years no matter where you buy it from. The apple store will not repair older models of their products but they can recommend reliable places near you that can see to your needs. Here in La., I use The Orchard Apple Specialist.
The iPad Air is the latest in iPad technology. It has a retina display and it's ultra thin and very fast. It also is supported by the apple application store, as in "there's an app for that". My husband likes to watch movies on his.
Yes it fit mine perfectly. I bought a different one at Office Max and had to return because my computer slid around in it. I was glad when I got this one because it fit and the pattern is really cool.
Yes it works I have a S4 and it works great wit it.
No
Yes. It's the hard drive size. The overall storage capacity; as in internal storage.
Yes I do not have a contract I use it only on my wifi. You can add it to a plan if you want.
Generally you can do pre-paid data with iPads through various carriers.
I honestly don't know for sure.
It says iPad "air", doesn't it? You will have to wait till iPad water.
I ma not so sure about that. Best bet is email/ca// Apple and they can place you in the right direction of your question and to see if it is possible.
Yes, I have printed documents and have the Apple airport express that allows me to print through my hp printer wirelessly with no issues.
Not sure exactly what your asking, but mine works off my Verizon wifi when at home and other wifi's when away. Right now we are out of the country and it is working off the hotel in Mexico wifi.
No. It's iPad Air only
So the mount is well built, and stays to window but you have to tape the camera to the mount as there is no locking system
Yes you can. I purchased mine through HSN and had the option to pick just Wi-Fi,(unlocked) or, get one on a plan for a "hot spot". But with two Wi-Fi antennas, I seriously doubt you'd need to pay for a plan as long as you are near a wi-fi source.And I do believe you have the same choice through Apple.com
Bring your own Earbuds :) It does not come with them. Fine machine though...Highly recommended.
Very very light and thin. I had a faux leather case before that was heavier! Buy it, it's great with confidence.
the one I purchased is for iPad Air, so the iPad 2 will not fit (it's wider and thicker than the iPad Air)
The cover fits our IPad air perfectly, so I don't know what the dimensions are for the new iPad Air2. You might want to contact Kavaj directly to get a better answer.
Yes. I have an IQShield skin on mine and it fits just fine. The case is leather so there is some room to stretch a little. It's a really nice case. The best one I have had.
It has built in bluetooth, but I don't think it has wifi.
depends on the transceiver version- mine had the antenna soldered to the pcb....
Not sure. But it's bigger than a rockstar energy drink. Sent mine back.
I mounted mine under the eaves of house ,on the soffitt. They work at about any angle.
Yes, the motion detection (setup thru blue iris) works very well with this camera.
Not sure of osx but works fine on my PC. Also works fine on iphone using the ecostratus app
Yes. The volume of the TV and the volume of the headphones are completely independent. They do sound greatr, but if you use them everyday you can expect them to last about a year or so. They tend to lose a channel or get annoying static with a lot of use. Otherwise, a good product.
As long as your TV has an audio output plug on it, it will work. The charging unit transmits the sound wirelessly to the earphones so it has to be plugged into the audio out plug, and you can even put the tv on mute, and still hear the tv on the headphones. My 88 year old mother loves her headset.
I got it to replace the one that came with my flex 2-15 model #20405. It does work.
It will work for the Yoga 11, 11S, 13, and Yoga 2 Pro. I think you'll find this one will charge your device faster than the stock power supply.
I just let the battery die and it reset itself when I plugged it back in and turned it on
It does indeed and I have 3 for sale if you'd like to buy one cheaply? Search for the product on ebay and look for seller noelawill &#128522;
The buttons and dimensions are different in different models of the surface. Believe this is only for the original Surface.
yes it does has bluetooth compatibility and more
60 days. It broke after 90. The processor would get so hot the device would auto shut off.
Just a small memory card
I don't use it much, but I'm able to connect with my Hotspot. Idk about sim card.
No
Yes
No, it's a tight fit over the Pill.
From what I have seen doesn't matter how you hook it up it's a scam system sold buy people on back of a van I would recommend not buying it at all if you did you got scammed
Very easy. You actually have more options on a pc then on your phone. I love this system and easy to install
It has auto rewrite so it records over the oldest data first
I have it's ok but afterwards it's a little tough to slide back down once it gets wet.
The mounting screw on the pole seems to just be a typical tripod mount - so as long as your MHD camera has the "screw hole" in it or a mount that adapts to a standard tripod, this should work.
Yep. If you use the correct back cover. One has holes and obviously wont stop wster.
Yes, and you can access your settings and view what you already have in the memory (pictures or movies). You can do the same with your phone (wifi) but there is sometimes that you won't be with your phone in your hands as in the sports. It is good to avoid lose some good pictures by pointing too high or too low...
i got one last week and it boot up as A20 dual core not and A31 quad core what happened MAIL QUAD IS GRAPHIC PROCESSOR IT IS RUNNING ANDRIOD 4.2.2
A male to male VGA cable in 6 ft
Do you mean can you hold the stand rom the back? If so, yes you can. I usually hold the iPad on my lap and keep the case cover off.
Hello, thank you for contact us, yes this equipment come with 90 day warranty.
Windows 7 can handle all of those things. Your computer must have the hardware capable of doing each of the things you asked. Most desktops can add hardware to handle those items. Laptops have to be done at factory except some can be added to USB ports. When buying a computer always look at the computer specification.
No
I don't believe there has been a 112S. This is a very new unit. The "14" in the model number means it was released in 2014. You should check out the 213j. The performance is similar but the 213j can hold two drives and is only a few dollars more. You can start with one drive and expand later for more storage or redundancy with RAID. The only difference I see is that the 213j USB ports are 2.0 and the 114 has USB 3.0. There is an excellent comparison tool on the Synology website.
No, unless you crack them open and pull out the drives from the enclosures to install into the diskstation.
If your tablet is thin enough to fit into the clips the elastic strips should stretch enough. It is supposed to be tight to hold the tablet in place. I have a 10 inch Toshiba Excite that fits very snug. It is not easy to put into place but the elastic stretches enough. Maybe try putting a narrow end of the tablet in first at the corners and with the other two clips onto the long sides and push the tablet toward the end with the corners set to get the other clips to move to their respective corners.
Download it from Machspeed.com.
It has aux function, and I think wifi for Airplay function. Please reference http://www.ihomeaudio.com/iW3SC/ , thx.
I have a diskless version. I did buy the disk separatly and did not have any problem.i idid buy wd red label hd.
The manual says no. You can set it to use both on the same network for faster throughput. I have not tried, but that is what the manual says.
Yes It is a personal cloud. You can store any type of file. But the biggest advantage is with multimedia files.
You can install apps Directly into the unit so then you don't need the computer. There a apps for ftp, torrents, etc. I think you can't daisy chain them because they need USB interfaces to increase capacity and the unit doesn't work as a USB drive.
Yes, I actually did just that. You don't even have to mail them anything. I just had to cut up my old pair and send a pic it to them on their website. I'd fairly easy to figure out but if you need help with your aren't feel free to msg me
Cables do not get in the way while wearing glasses. You need to feed the cables from the back of your ear to the front, then insert earphones into in your ear. Then put your glasses on. No problem.
about 1" x 1" x 4"
Yes
No it does not unfortunately
These! Any day of the week. Have incredible bass for their size! Games sound great.
Yes:) thats what I did
Cameta Camera does not ship to Singapore at this time.
Square makes three version so of Square Stand (1) Square Stand for iPad 2 & 3; (2) Square Stand for iPad 4; (3) Square Stand for iPad Air. For more information, please visit: squareup.com/stand
Yes it has wifi and gps built in
I run it from my Belkin thunderbolt docking station connected to my mac book pro (only way to get USB3.0 on that old sucker). Works fine, so I would assume a hub would be OK as well.
I'm sure it will fit, but the string that attached the lens cap to the camera is too short for a telephoto lens. Additionally, the picture is a bit deceiving. The cap does not have the string on it. The string has a small "peel and stick" cap on it that you glue to the lens cap. The cap itself is Nikon OEM, so the cap is fine, but, as stated, the string is too short for a telephoto lens.
It is electric and it plugs into a regular wall outlet (110 volt.) It might have a bettery compartment, but I will have to check. The player itself is not really portable as it is a bit bulky.
The main unit is 12.5 inches tall, 15.5 inches deep, and 12 inches wide. The speakers are 12 inches tall, 6.5 inches deep, and 7 inches wide.
The sides of the Sharkk wireless mouse are plastic with a matte finish.
They are not reprogrammable. I tried to do it using Sharkk's provided software and in multiple games, and all they would do is minimize my games which is about as far from the desired effect as possible, short of making my computer explode.
yes, ultimately but it takes some fiddling with the wires and twisting of the earphones to fit your ears and head size. I'm a farmer and use them with many of my active chores. After getting the fit right, they provide great sound and good base and can even be worn under ear protection equipment giving great sound while mowing weed whacking, driving a tractor or excavator.
i had the same issue.
Joey - does the fenix 2 have ant+? If so, then yes.
No speakers
This one is the 4GB version, 1GB DDR...
Yes
Yes it is. A person who knows alot about computers/monitors told me to get it, as I don't know much. He said it was a great monitor. It's actually better than what he said. Wish I bought this monitor a long time ago. Well worth the price and no nonsense, e.g. installing programs, drivers etc. Just plug it in and go.
Yes, it should be compatible with the Nikon version of the lens
Sadly it is not, sand can get in pretty easily if you spend a lot of time on the beach etc
The refills can be purchased here: http://www.gadgetshack.com/spy-pen-refill-3-pack.html
Hooked it up to my pc with no problems at all. Simple and clear was impressed, even tn Even the sound was good. I recommend it
Negative $. Don't get it, it broke in 3 days
I bought this spy pen camera. It was very difficult to use and it broke before I ever got a good video made. I waited to long to try it out, so my Window for returning had passed.
Yes
It should. It holds my 10.1 toshiba perfectly
The corners are rigid plastic connected to an elastic band. Not sure if it will fit the HP Omni 10. If its on the average to thiner side it will be no problem. Some tablets are very large & bulky & will not fit. I'm using it with the samsung galaxy tab and you can compare it to that in a store to get to your decision.
I don't think so. Lenovo's compatability guide does not list this for the x1: support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/pd014572 I don't think the X1 has the doors or slot on the bottom of it to accept the docks connector that you can see in the picture.
Yes, it will. I checked with Lenovo compatibility matrix. Anything T440 and above (including "s" and "p" subseries) will do.
No. The only dock that works with E555 is ThinkPad OneLink Pro Dock, Lenovo part number 4X10E52935. Amazon ASIN number B00H4PID8A. It's an external dock that connects to E555 through OneLink port (same port that is used to connect the AC Adapter to E555). AC adapter will now connect to the dock and the dock will power the computer. E555 does not have a traditional docking station port at the bottom - that's why OneLink external dock needs to be used with this series.
Good morning, As is referenced on the Lenovo Options/Accessories guide: http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/documents/um006391 It does show that this dock is compatible with the X250. Thanks Charles Triathlon Computers (919)813-7776
Go to control panel and search "Touch" then select the "Tablet PC Settings" icon, it will then ask you to hit enter until the white screen is on your touch monitor. Then just tap the screen and click ok.
if you use this for a company that has many cars or trucks you would enter the plate number to be able to tell which camera belong to which car and so on
The video file is in .mov (QuickTime) format. Please turn on the camera before connecting the usb cable. Then the camera is mounted as a removable disk. Here is a beta version of the player software: https://www.ojocam.com/content/ojocam_player_0318_beta.zip Thank you.
Have you try a different SD card? After you re-insert the SD card; did you un-plug and re-plug the power? If you have tried all of the above, and it still doesn't record; the unit might be defective. Please email us at customersupport@cavalrystorage.com so that we can swap out with a new unit for you.
I put the stickers on my plastic cover from my laptop and it works perfectly :)
Unless you are using just one camera, a POE switch is nice. It provides camera power through the network cable. I'm using http://www.amazon.com/TRENDnet-8-Port-100Mbps-Switch-TPE-S44/dp/B000QYEN1W/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389139282&sr=8-1&keywords=trendnet+poe+switch The advantages of a POE switch are less wire clutter, and less traffic on your "Normal" home network. (4) 3.0MP cameras can generate a lot of traffic. By running the cameras to the POE switch, then my PC running Blue Iris to the switch I don't bog down my home wireless router with all the traffic.
hi william, thanks for your kind interesting. yes, you can find the customized case for acer iconia A1-810 7.9" tablet here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JABMUOO .
hi S. McKinney, thanks for your question, yes, sure, this case come with auto sleep / wake funtion.
It is kind of silver metallic.
I don't think so. There is a little bit of extra space when I put in my tab 3 8.0, but I think the note's bezel is too large to fit.
This case does not have a rear facing camera opening. See ASIN: B00GCEHXO4 for alternate case for Note 2014 Edition Which does provide opening for rear facing camera.
Not mine, but mine is just a wifi tablet. I assume that if you have a specific internet carrier it would have a sim card slot. It does have a microSD card slot to add memory.
Not necessarily. It does keep a text log of your GPS locations that is updated at intervals.
I have a previous model of this camera and the issue i ran into having it behind glass was at night the leds would reflect and make white rings that would wash out all of the image. day time worked great but i would see this being a problem with any camera that has night vision.
The slot is on the circuit. Has you seen a square chip on the circuit? That is it.
i use blue iris it works flawlessly though the trial version of it has a watermark.
yes. my case came today, just installed it on my 1 year old iPad mini (no retina display). It fits perfectly. The packaging actually says "for iPad mini with retina display or iPad mini"
I don't think so
Probably not, since the mini 3 has touch id.
ASIN: B009WU5XUG will fit the ipad mini
Yes, it does.
No it is just a basic mp 3 player no no bells or whistles beyond fm radio
When we first got ours we had the same problem with clarity and had searched all through the menu options with the blurry image trying to find it. The plastic part around the lens is what you use to focus the image. The first time it felt like that wouldn't move but if you keep at it gently it will work and then you won't have any problems moving forward. Once you fix the clarity you can read the menu better to adjust the image size. Good luck.
Yes that's how we used ours is with our laptop
i would look into the product specs for your lens size and that will tell u what size to get
What is the filter/lens size? 52mm is the size of these caps
Hi there, it has a rechargeable battery
No.
Not with current version. But it has been great to use on my regular sized IPAD, highly recommend for regular IPAD (2/3/4/Air?)
Yes
Correct. I have my PS4 running to a powered HDMI splitter. Off the splitter it runs to a monitor I use to play the actual game on, the 2nd output runs to my PC where I use OBS to broadcast. For OBS, I have the AVerMedia set as a video capture device. I've never used Xsplit but I imagine it's the same.
No
I believe it is. The "Smart Case" is the leather front and back protected model. The "Smart Cover" only has the front cover. If you're buying directly from Amazon I don't think you have too much to worry about :)
NO - the iPad Air 2 is slightly thinner with Depth of 0.24" vs the iPad Air with Depth of 0.29" per the Apple.com website.
If you are a Prime Member and want to use prime services, please make sure that you select a offer that has the "Prime" logo displayed. As for shipping speeds, prime is usually a two day service however they may be back logged that why they are pushing the date further back.
Almost the same size, but since the iPad Air 2is a bit thinner there is a slight difference
Yep!
Yes, it is the real Apple case
they only have 1 thunderbolt port and 1 usb you might be able to daisy chain with the USB but not at thunderbolt speeds and I wouldnt use them that way. theyre consumer drives but they work well.
Tested once but didn't make a record. Not big difference in transfer rate. But I prefer thunderbolt cos it enable daisy chain setting
Yup! Perfect for gaming. My old mouse was a little smaller so it feels weird using this big mouse at first but after you get the hang of it you just beast with it in games. I love this mouse.
Yes most programs allow you to setup the mouse and use the buttons
No. But you could just close your eyes and pretend it is off
I don't have any bad experienced. I'm happy and satisfy
You can format this drive to either FAT32, NTFS, ExFAT, or whatever. Will work for system backup or making a recovery disk.
Apparently the answer is no. I was not interested in password protection so I did not look for that feature. There is nothing in the companion literature or on the drive itself that indicates my 16GB drives have this feature.
Yes
I think it has more to do with the digital frame than the drive. I would be shocked that the frame has a USB 3 port. If by some fluke it does, then this would work better, but I can't believe that it would make any difference. I copied a few video clips and songs and just tried playing them via a USB 2 port, and they played just fine without any staggering, or distortions. Again, I have to believe it's the frame, not the drive. Hope this helps. ---Kelvington
No accessories except one BF4 KEY
YES
a) 6~10 days b) No. And also the keyboard can be removed and compatible with all the smartphone and tablet in the market!
I wouldn't know for sure, but if you contact your mobile carrier they can let you know. It will probably be in roaming mean you're Racine charges for every incoming and outgoing phone call you can be very expensive. Best bet contact your mobile carrier
No
Yes, this camera will work with the Samsung SDS-P5080N 16 Channel system. Most cameras made in the last 5 years are much the same. What makes one camera better than the next is the lines of resolution and the optics used. Almost all, like your system, typically use a BNC connector instead of the RCA connector to attach the camera to the recorder.
This would mostly depend on the quality of your antenna, it's correct orientation and how high up you can mount it. You might also try an amplified antenna. Hills, obstructions and weather will also adversely effect your reception.
Yes there is a coaxial port in the back
My replacement arrived in a similar package, however, this one only had dents in the cover sheet and not the protector itself.
You meant to ask, if it is 1- OEM for builders 2- Retail Version Answer is "1" the OEM Retail versions are bought only to attain some pathetic and useless Microsoft support incident.
Yes, I am able to connect the speaker to laptop via bluetooth to watch movie/listening to music. However, the connect stops working when you watch/listen via firefox.
I haven't had a problem charging mine. Charges great at home and with the car charger as I use for in my car for my commute to work. I listen music from YouTube, pandora and iTunes and take handsfree calls.
Yes.
The computer that I have recently bought does not have this port but I do see it on Amazon screen when you click the entire 1660s. Sorry can only confirm the screen not the actual.
64
no
The manual is only available after registering on ip cam central's website. Even after registration, ip cam central requires remote access to your systems for firmware maintenance and will not allow you to do firmware yourself.
Simply plug it into a wall socket. Then on your laptop, desktop or whatever your using open a web browser. Then click on your network icon and select Geeya_R303. Then in the address bar type in the following: http://192.168.10.1 That will take you to the configuration page for the mini router. There are 4 modes to choose from: Router, Repeater,AP and WISP. Also supports WEP, WPA, WPA2 and WPA/WPA2 security encryption. Hope this helps. I am using mine as a repeater and it's working just fine.
I purchased this item and it works ok. You have to go on line to register and activate it. The directions aren't written to well. If you are have problems I would return it it and buy a Belkin.
no
Screens are on sale @ ebay for 31 dollars
Horrible
Slanted to a point. Doubt it can be removed.
Yes it does. I believe that the mini and mini 2 are the same size
No it is not.
Hi PamSue, it does not come with a hand strap. However, the material it is made of allows for a good grip. I highly recommend this case for the ipad mini. Hope this was useful.
It's not very long but works so well. I also like the idea of having the extra USB ports.
Yes but has to be connected with ethernet cable. The cameras and Dvr are absolutely amazing...i can watch my house from my phone while at work
An internal SATA 3.5" or 2.5" (2.5" needs a bracket to hold the HDD) would be compatible with this system, Western Digital and Seagate are both ok with this system, thank you.
The processor is embedded already. And cannot be replaced. (And the cpu traces are propriatary to this line of APUs) However this is running the temash series of APUs from AMD.
According to Acer the max ram is 6 gb see http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model-datasheet/NX.M8WAA.014
I use this with a TASCAM DR DR-60D and I do need to enable plug-in power in the menu or I get nothing so Marna H is right she may have a problem. There is an explanation on B&H's shotgun mic section here http://www.bhphotovideo.com/explora/audio/buying-guides/shotgun-microphones. There are battery modules/boxes that will provide power, but the only one I could see on Amazon ( by Sound Professional) seemed very expensive for something that should be quite simple. My only suggestion is triple check your menus for a plug-in power option - good luck!
Other than standing the iPad on its side you cannot rotate it.
It has 750GB (7200 RPM) HD
Hello, No, it does not. Best regards, Amuras
No. HP website says it has Displayport 1.2 output, which is far superior to HDMI anyway -- supports much higher resolutions.
No, not from a desktop. From a mobile device or tablet it's fine.
You'll need to buy the rail kit. It's too heavy to mount horizontally with the supplied tabs.
Yes, but not very well; it operates by detecting infrared radiation from a warm body (for example), and glass will block much of that unless the radiation comes towards the glass at a pretty direct angle. This thing is weatherproof, so if you can mount it on the other side of the glass you will get better results. I had other issues with the device, though, so I sent it back.
It will only fit the 780 FTW.
If the E17 works on your computer save your money. It was designed to work with iphones. The E18 was designed to work with androids but it doesn't work on all droid systems. I use the E18 with a motorala droid4 and it works. The E17 was ok but i prefer the E18.
Yes it has search ability via voice command
Wall wart (charger that you can plug a USB cable into), USB cable, OTG USB cable (mini Usb to USB so you can connect flash drives or other USB peripherals). No earphones.
my hub works great i had it for nearly 3 months now just have to make sure you get a power supply that can handle the load
Yes.
Did you forget tax with Apple $60 and that your actually getting a smart case too that cost $39 from us, which Apple charges Tax on that too. So you save $60 by going through us! Merry Christmas
Yes
On the back of the rafio where you see the little opening to loop the wrist strap. That's the battery release. Push it in towards the back of the radio and pull the battery down. You're welcome.
It is, but that has no bearing on its price. The more expensive D810 is made in Thailand.
Comes with USB cable and has micro USB for device connection
I assume your are using Windows 8....if that's the case go to cnetdownloads and get vlc player..........that will fix your problem
No....50gb max
I have the same intercom system and wireless internet but I have not had that problem. My system is not quite a year old though. There is a paint ball arena close to my house that uses two way radios and I pick up their signal and can listen them as their playing but other than that the system works great.
The system has 8.
With 4 cameras running 24/7, you should be able to record about 25 days' worth of video with 500 GB. Thank you!
If you're computer has bluetooth capability it will connect.
Yes!
It is a perfect fit in every way!
Yes it does
I do not know what the problem might be in your laptop. But if the battery is fully charged & plugged in, it will not charge (since it does not need to). If the battery is not charged and does not charge when plugged in, I would contact the seller.
Yes
it comes with a power cord with a step down transformer that goes from the wall outlet into the hard drive (the answer is yes)
8 gbs ddr2
Good Question. I don't know if thats possible. Because the APP determines the location of the files not the card itself. If it was going to 32 different computers, then of course. I may be wrong. Let me know how that works out. Sounds awesome.
yes. mine updated itself to Android version 4.4.2 (as of 3/12/15)
I believe it's dual.
Yes you can plug a USB keyboard into the dock all day long...
If the buyer says it has 3 year AppleCare then it do but if it doesn't say so then it comes with one year where you can purchase it yourself within that first year. I bought the macbook from the seller that listed it in the description of the condition and it came as advertised. Won't expire till 2017 in June.
It supports 802.11ac.
yes it does
13oz
Yes
You do not need software for viewing, that can be done through a web-browser. You can record video to a Micro-SD card (up to 64GB) without any additional software through the built-in Micro-SD slot. Further recording would require recording software or an NVR (Network Video Recorder).
I got the same camera and it works fine. Note that the camera is powered by the ethernet cable. To send power over the ethernet I used a POE switch.
this camera support onvif 2.0, if this truvision nvr also support onvif 2.0, this is may work, thanks
I have not looked into the specifics. This was intended for pretty light usage. The computer is fairly slow operationally, I would not recommend for anything that requires anything but basic processing power. If you are looking to invest in additional RAM I would suggest just buying a better lap you.
Taylor P. Our systems do not use any proprietary parts, so you are free to upgrade anything you want, over the life of your system. And proper installation of new components does *NOT* void your warranty.
Paul Ranard, Yes, this system does really have blue LED lights.
Yes it is expandable to 32 GB of RAM, but make sure you get the exact same type and speed of memory that is already in it, which in mine is DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3-12800)
Jacob Cormier, Yes, the system has an HDMI port available.
The blue siding on the left is see thru.
The arrow buttons on the top should change the volume, as long as you are not in a menu.
Hi, first I must say that I purchased and gave my equipment to a JW sign language congregation in HONDURAS. I don't exactly know how they rotate the images but I see them do so handle it very well.
turn the in front of the projector,from left to right
I am using this like a cinema for a childrens and its very nice
2 X 8 gig sticks = 16 gig
Hi..... No it not hot at time I have had any problem, I have not had it to long
Yes it does
Mhz streams for megahertz, it relates to the channel your transmitter and reverberate are on. And how clean a signal you have.
Yes. Leave it on. In fact, if there is a power failure the whole re-booting, re-linking process needs to start over again from step-1. It's an overly complicated and one can tell Philips designed it, not Apple.
Average battery life of 2 weeks with standard Alkaline batteries, 2.5 weeks with Lithium batteries (based on 2-hours of average driving per day).
I don't see why not. I tried in my 7D and 5DMKIII and it worked beautifully. I even tried the master function to control my other Canon Speedlites and it worked flawlessly. I highly recommend it for any EOS camera. However, your T3 already has a built in FLASH which most likely is as powerful as this little flash. On the other hand, this little flash adds the ability to wirelessly control other Canon Speedlites.
Absolutely - the g10 has a hot shoe that makes this compatible with all external flashes....
It will charge it but I am having issues with transferring pictures
Yes
Yes. There is 1 alarm output. If interested, there are 4 alarm inputs. You can see more at http://www.zmodo.com/16-channel-960h-real-time-dvr-security-system-with-1tb-hdd-8-700tvl-outdoor-ir-cameras.html
I'm sorry this system can not record the audio, so it can playback sound, thanks.
Yes, it comes with cables and power supply, thanks.
How will i know since I did not receive my order yet. I was told , ,i will receive it on the 15 of April .
I really don't know but it had a lot of different models. I will go back and check and see if that model number is listed.
I have no idea. We have at and t phones and they work for those.
Yes.
Transmitter is not water proof, you cannot use it UNDER WATER. However, I wrap this transmitter in a plastic sandwich bag on my quadcopter- It really helps protect it from rain and damp ground... so you can make it water-RESISTANT.
Think line of sight. You can't see it your video isn't going to be seen either. If the reciever was in the elevator shift and the transmitter is mounted outside of the elevator so they can see each other. That will work. Look up cloverleaf antennas you will need them cheap drones makes one for 25 bucks it is worth it get a 600 mW transmitter and you will be good no distortion or washout.
The brightness is adjusted by using function and F9-F12 keys. The color is changed by using the function and "Page Break" key.
Yes
The PC come with a power supply and Windows 7 operating system installed.
This computer is equipped with a Atheros (AR5BWB222)wireless adapter.
The computer has two memory slots each one containing 4GB of memory. According to the specifications for this computer on the Acer web site 8GB of memory is the maximum amount of memory for this laptop. It comes with a one year limited warranty.
Yes, there is a cap lock and number lock light. It is very small but visible.
There is a Micro-sd card slot.
Sorry to say....I do not know. My solution would be to call a proper technician....
This drive is actually 15mm thick, which is the double-platter drive size. As such, it did not fit in my Dell Precision M6600. Your mileage may vary.
Yes it's well
yes,work for my windows 8 & windows 8.1
Yes
send it back this tablet its a totally joke i got one few months ago and i got the same problem and worst if u try to download a app from google play store...im sorry for the seller but this product its the worst investment we can do
i believe how mine was received. I have had no problems with it at all though.
No there are no Audio outputs on this tv. Although if your audio receiver has hdmi, this tv can stream the audio through the HDMI Audio return Channel (ARC).
Due to the very limited version of Linux that is installed in a very small partition on the board, they have a very limited number of drivers. Intel's Galileo Linux image officially only supports Intel Centrino Wireless-N 135 and Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6205 adapters. I would stick to one of those options.
The battery in the kit is not original Canon, but so far, it has worked OK.
No, the Camscura Pro HD Hidden Camera will not record audio. It records video only. Hidden surveillance cameras aren't allowed to have audio recordings due to wiretapping laws in the US. You can use an audio recording device separately but it cannot contain video at the same time. - BrickHouse Team
There is a small LED on the top of the box. It lights green when you first turn it on, then shuts off (to confirm it is activated). Thereafter, it stays off while recording. It lights amber when you press the button to cease recording.
I do not believe the battery is replaceable, it is built into the unit.
It does on the photos.
did you do the step to check the signal between the router and the repeater? That needs to be good. Also, what did you name it --- the book says name it different than the router (but pass through security). I notice sometimes with my Netgear it seems like it takes forever to connect --- other times it connects quickly. I'm leaning towards what the other reviewers say --- move the router so not to need the repeater. Previously I had a LinkSys repeater, it worked about the same, just ok at best.
The color was right but to small
The device (adapter) plugs into the phone line, perhaps through an unused wall socket or a splitter. The adapter also connects to your computer through a mic jack so the phone line has to be near your computer because it needs your computer to do the recording. I found the connection to be so cumbersome that I haven't gotten it to work yet - keep putting it aside for an opportunity to move my PC closer
Yes, you can tilt the item where it seems like a laptop.
Yes
Yes, it does fold over so that the IPAD is raised.
yes, it works perfectly with the RT. 10/10
nope fits chromebook c710
I looked over the box and there is no clear way of knowing if it's either. If your asking because or warrantee coverage for US I would contact the seller of maybe dunu. I just got the additional coverage offered by amazon. They are great hardware, you'll like them.
This is an international version But the product is produced in Hong Kong (China)! Where the manufacturing plant! Thanks
Yes
Actually, this is NOT the one you need; This one isn't bi-directional and doesn't flow in the direction you need. Good news; as an owner of lots of old electronics, there are adapters for literally any and all electronic components! Just keep using the Amazon search engine and you'll find what you need.
No ... only left - right audio output and a video output
Not very well, it works ok fully extended. The best Antennas I have are the Nagoya 701 and 771, they are fixed length but work awesome. The 701 is the short one 7" and the 771 is about 15".
The answer is no. This is a low quality stand. It's better to find one in TJ Max.
I'm not sure about warranty, I recommend you check twelve South website for that but as an owner, I taken mine on 8 trips since I bought it June last year and looks and feels exactly the same. I don't use it daily thought. Hope this helps.
Hello, It is Power Supply Voltage: 100 - 240 VAC , 50/60 Hz Power Consumption: Lamp on 350 W, Lamp on (Eco Mode) 280 W Thanks Advancity
My take is 250 _300 kw or 1/4 to a 1/3 of a watt. I mean it uses a voltage of 4.5 volts to 5.5 (on the adapter) i think.
There is a test botton on the flash, you press and make it flash.
Yes Thank you
No
NY USA
it's the same as your HDD/SSD can provide.
Probably, but I don't know for sure because I don't own that camera. I have a canon g16 and it fits it perfectly
Yes
Yes, it fits the 2014 edition. It should state that in the title description.
No screen size of kindle paperwhite is 6 kobo is 6.9 it's too wide
Yes, the Voyage fits nicely into the sleeve. However it is a slightly looser fit than with the 6inch fire.
It has aux input...so yes?
Hi My advice to replace 1- Asus Rampage iv black by ASUS MAXIMUS VII HERO ATX DDR3 2600 LGA 1150 Motherboards 2- Intel i7 - 4930k LGA 2011 by Intel i7 4790k 3-Cooler Master Hyper 212 Evo By Corsair Hydro h100i 4-Corsair Dominator Platinum 32GB (4x8GB) DDR3 2133 MHz by Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8GB) DDR3 1600 MHz 5- EVGA GeForce GTX760 FTW with ACX Cooler 4GB by EVGA GeForce GTX 780 Ti Superclocked, 3GB
Yes~when you turn on the computer the backlight will on. I really like that.
No
yes it does.
It was'nt an auto download on startup but you can download it for free from microsoft
Acer is a Taiwanese company; I believe the computers are actually manufactured in Denmark. Anyhow, I love my Acer.
The laptop came with Window 7 home version and factory software.
yes you ca. Please contact the manufacturer or the seller..
I have an LG G2 and it works with mine. As long as it has up-to-date blue tooth, you should be fine.
I do not believe so as it is not notated in the descriptions.
Only one. But it's good enough though.
Yes
It looks as if any smartphone with Bluetooth would work.
yes it will
Yes
I don't know which car you have but most car that I know has 3.5 in NOT out and the one on this device is 3.5 IN too so it will not help you to achieve what you looking for. back in the day before the iGeneration you could by a usb that has 3.5 out on it which will work perfectly with your car, im not sure if they still sell them.
no
Hi Thomas, this computer comes with DVD-ROM (DVD and CD ready only) drive
Yes you can, as long as the charging cable is NOT connected to a computer. So if it is connected to an external battery pack (like a Trent Powerpak) it will use the power from the external source, when/if that source runs out of power it will then use the drift battery. I have used this feature myself and that was one of the first features I wanted and tested when buying an action camera, the guy saying that you cannot probably only tried it with it connected to a computer.
Yes, you can get the live view from the HDMI output while recording.
Yes it does. It comes with all kinds of goodies. Lenses I don't know what to do with yet, too! Awesome camera! I had a pro tell me it was an excellent choice.
No
Yes, I bought a Bluetooth mouse from Dell - it works well with this laptop.

Hi Zhikun Zhang. We build, test and support our systems with Ubuntu exclusively. We do know that many of our customers use other distributions and operating systems on our machines though. I understand this is a very limited response to your question however since we do not test with Debian we don't want to set expectations outside of our business commitment which is to sell and support computers running Ubuntu.
The case does not block the air vents of the Surface Pro or Pro 2, however, it doesn't fit the kickstand very well on either. I no longer use the case because it was bending the kickstand, didn't allow it to close fully, and overall wasn't a good case, except in looks. I would not recommend it.
Hi, I have been playing some newer games like Watch Dogs and The Crew: Beta. They run pretty well on low settings and 720p resolution. I can play Grid : Auto sport on medium to high settings on 1080p resolution pretty well. Battlefield 3 also runs pretty smooth on medium settings with 900p resolution. So it will satisfy your minimum gaming needs. But if you are looking for better graphics you should look for the model with the nvidia gt750 card.
Hi Alan, you have to press the Fn key at the same time with the F9 key.When you use the laptop with the AC power, the backlit keyboard turns on automatically but when you use it with the battery,the backlit is off as the first choice. Regards,Victor
Black. It was an exact match and fit for the original,which my daughter sent me a picture of. I had it shipped to her address.
Yes! Each bluetooth pairing/connection is unique to another bluetooth pairing/conn. So, for example, you could have the left channel driving a left speaker and right to right.
Hi VLR, Please be noted that Bluetooth is not an instant transmission protocol and there is some lag due to the time it takes for the signals to be transmitted. Typically if you're listening to music or audio only, you won't ever notice this lag. However, pair audio with video or use Bluetooth devices with musical instruments where the user expects instant feedback, and it is noticeable. But the experience is very personal, some customers think they are okay with the lag while some doesn't.
Yes, the only thing you have to do =is remove the end slot with the hook.
I haven't attempted anything near that weight. It did do well with a DSLR and Tamron 150-600 lens, but that is no where near 33 lbs.
No, no wall plate is needed. The glass touch button is as big as a single wall plate / cover. It has to be installed as a single switch and you cannot install next to other switches.
Yes
Yes, first you need to plug the bluetooth adapter and make your computer be bluetooth enable. Then you can connect this Pure1 headphone with your computer by Bluetooth tech.
As long as the device that you want to connect uses a 3.0 USB connection, there should not be any problem.
The power adapter works with 100-240V. Thanks!
The idea you put forward can be realized to some extent. This hub generally could charge devices like your iphone or android phones through the usb 3.0 port. But some special devices like ipad or Samsung PAD will fail. After all the ordinary usb ports are not equal to charging ports.
I don't have an otter box on my phone, but when I tried plugging it in to my boyfriends phone case that is sort of like an otter box, it couldn't be plugged in. The transmitter gets in the way..another downside!
tldr; yes. See those tx, rx pins on the GPS module, those are serial output and input respectively. So, you'll want to communicate with it with the beaglebone's UART port. Here's a reference: http://andrewdai.co/beaglecar/sensors-and-interfaces.html#adafruit-ultimate-gps-breakout-v3-
No it will not
Why do you think that something os wrong with it? It has English keyboard
They are a bit big for a smaller head. I have a big head myself but lucky adjusted them to fit. Some of my friends who had smaller heads, The headphones fitted just fine.
They are fairly sturdy. Depending on how much you throw your backpack around, they should be ok.
Yes, they come with a black cloth bag that has a draw string. Nice material.
Yes it does automatically connects to your wifi but if you have a security password you have to enter it in the wifi settings
I do not have a Verizon 7" tablet, but the Tabsuit case is very flexible, so am thinking it would with perhaps the exception of where you need openings along the side, tops, or bottoms. I need to plug the Kindle in at the bottom, so simply slide the cover off that section for charging.
It supports 2 DDR3L-1600 SODIMM.
no it is not back lit.
Only one HD bay.
the user have to push record
Yes it will. I am streaming music to my stereo and at the same time I am typing this using a Bluetooth keyboard. It is working great! I also just connected my iPhone and get get to files while the other devices are connected and working. I did try unsuccessfully to connect both a Bluetooth headset and my stereo at the same time and that didn't work (I had to pick one or the other), but different devices seem to work just fine.
I tried it on my Samsung Plasma, no response. It might work on the newer LED's.
Yeah. It will
it is designed to work on samsung devices, but i only tested it on the Samsung Galaxy S4, and if you download the app it works on Nexus....don't recall which one. Hope this was helpful.
I do not know the answer to your question. But, on the bottom of my projector is a toll free number to ask questions. The number is 1-800-637-7661. Hope this helps.
Yes
I didn't have this problem till I got my PS4 about a week ago. But ever since then it happens every time I turn my PS4 on. Not sure why it happens. But turning the monitor off and on does fix it
Well if u ment "IPS" not "ILS" panel then the difference would be image quality and response time, also price. this is a TN monitor so it is snappy quick and low cost, but not as high quality, image wise, as an IPS. here this should help some http://www.cnet.com/topics/monitors/buying-guide/n but if ur going for mostly movie watching go for a IPS panel monitor. they have better image quality and also i notice this monitor has some backlight bleed (black doesn't look black in a dark scene or picture, kinda has some gray to it)
The setup software-Bluetooth connection works fine with a regular ipad, so I assume it would also work with an ipad mini or iphone 6.
Yes it does and a keychain aluminum holder for the additional tip. I purchased 2 additional tips and they all three fit in it perfectly. It is a great product and I use mine daily and have absutely no issues with it.
No
Yes
it has 2 HDMI slot if your laptop has one you can connect it
No.
yup it has an ethernet port on the back
I have never used it until it dies but I have used it for several hours here and there and it didn't charge for 4 days still came right on. This is the best portable speaker I've bought yet and I have serval some high end name brand but this beats them all! Hope this helps
It does get load more than you would think. I think it would be great for a backyard party. It might be pushing it for being on the beach though. That's just my opinion. It does have great clear sound.
I am sorry, we dont ship international.
Please call me at 615-473-3338 to discuss Thanks Ramin MonitorU
It did work for me. When I plugged it in I got the apple error message but I just clicked OK or IGNORE i don't remember but my photos transferred to my iPad Mini
It would not fit in my iPad mini or iPhone 6...
This will have the slot for both, but it might work once or twice. I have talk to many people, all said that it's not worth it to buy.
I do not know. I did not use that feature. I have not been pleased with the current one because the play back over the radio has been really poor. My guess is that it would still have that feature.
i am not sure i have a 4g the lg 730 work better this bluetooth dont hold a connection to the phone
Yes
I actually have my mp3 music on the computer and download it there. Then I hook up the mini usb to the USB and I can open the folder to view contents (you should get a windows pop-up) and then just drag music from my music folder to and/or from this folder.
Yes. It is not built in to the unit though. It is external. Plugs into the back when installed and mounts to the dashboard or the door frame. My installer put mine on the drivers door frame and it works great.
it only plays a certain format video. You can look up on youtube someone teaching this.
Not sure...Mine went in an RV....If you have a Double DIN area for a radio it should fit....
Power cord
The CDR810 has the button slot for the GPS setting but it is not cut out. Cobra might be doing some cost-cutting by using one mold for both cameras; many companies do this with TVs/laptops/cars.
The battery is internal. I use the power cord in my vehicle, but when I ride with someone else I use the battery. It lasts for well over an hour if you turn on the Screen Saver which turns off the screen. I do not think the battery is replaceable. I have also run it with an external battery designed for cellphones. Same cord.
No
Yes, if you want to get the iPad Mini model featuring BOTH wifi and cellular reception. If you only want to go the route of getting the more affordable wifi only version, you should still be able to use as a phone downloading telephony apps such as Skype. Since the iPad mini features both speakers and mike, should be feasible to use as a phone.
Yes you can but, if you are using a wall charger to charge the portable, you should probably use the wall charger to charge your unit instead because it would be faster. And it wouldn't drain the life of the portable battery either.
It can support a 30mm fan and it works better with a heat sink and the fan pulling air up instead of down
Probably not. Pioneer could care less about continued support. Sent mine back. Don't waste your time or money
Yes.
if you can get an adapter to switch to European Volts you can try. I would not do it. Rather take a notebook with me that can be operated with only batteries.
Yep. And it also chargers 2 batteries at the same time if you want to. Hope this helps. Bye
http://www.divephotoguide.com/underwater-photography-special-features/article/go-pro-underwater-photo-video/
Yes it works. It has a tight fit and will not fall off. I have it and so far so good.
In my experience, yes they will. I have used several different 55mm lens and they all work with this adaptor.
It only works with Bluetooth devices.
Actually, this computer has neither 2MB, nor 4MB. It has 2GB RAM.
Yes
They do. But sounds are very hollow
It doesn't get hot. Mine doesn't charge very well though. The cord needs to be in a certain position once plugged in or it won't charge. Hope that helps.
Yes. It works as well as the charger that came with it. I use it on my T100 as well. In fact, I bought 2 of them so I can leave 1 at work.
Yes. It is both an ATSC and QAM tunner. It does not however support NTSC. If your have a "clear" digital cable or digital over the air signal it will tune it.
This iView 3500STB works in Kentucky on Time Warner Cable. It will tune the unscrambled channels. It gets the numbers wrong but the channels are there. You say your TV could find unscrambled QAM channels so this iView set top box should do the same. If it's not working, I'd have to guess that it is a defective unit providing you have chosen "cable" in the menu for it's channel search.
not sure
No. That's the model I have and it's not wide enough
Yes, it will fit the Toshiba Satellite C55D5-A5305!
Hi! I have the Toshiba Satellite C55D-B5219, 15.6" and the top cover fits like a glove. The bottom one was too small. I decided to keep it anyways because the top one is what matters to me. I hope this helps!
I personally am not sure. The top fit on mine, but the bottom didn't. And frankly I don't know what the product number of my Satellite is.
I bought one and the hard shell comes off.
Thank you for your inquiry, we are sorry but we do NOT make a case for your model laptop.
I purchased this for my cousin and it fit just fine!
LUVVITT SILVERBACK (TM) Protective Back Skin for iPad MINI - Aluminum Color (with BONUS Screen Protector) - yes, this product works for the iPad mini retina.
I attach mine from the side of the kayak and paddle just slow enough that water does not flow over top. trolling at the same time makes it worth it. When I need to paddle faster I pull it inside the kayak first.
Mine will show a teardrop tipped with a minnow tail
Yes
I'm not quite sure what your asking. If you want to know if it arrived with a damaged key board and wi fi connection "no". As far as I know they are still working fine. I gave them as gifts I also bought the "Square Trade Warranty". I would highly recommend buying that with any tablet.
33-1/4"L x 3"H x 3-1/4"W
Yes it will it's also dual control. .......
Yes
Should as long as the double din size for your opening is the same as the radio.
great choice
Dear, it is Windows CE 6.0
This means loaded on a formatted hard drive. It's not necessary, though. If you can't format the drive, which most Windows operating systems will not let you do, just put the CD in and power-up. After starting, you'll get a command prompt to load from the CD. Then during the early part of the load, a box will come up saying your existing files will be saved in a folder named "old files" or something similar. Just O.K. that and continue.
Typically I leave it on. If I know I'm not going to use it for a while (days) , I turn it off.
Any cellphone with Bluetooth.
Not certified but it's the only lightening extension I've found that actually works. I have one on my Pioneer car audio system and it both charges my iPhone 6 Plus and allows the iphone to send audio, album cover, song info as well as Audible and Spotify data and audio. Highly recommend without hesitation. I don't think there are any officially certified lightening extension cables out there.
This Beats Pill XL can stream pretty much anything wirelessly as long as the device you are streaming from has Bluetooth capability. You can also connect devices via connector cords (included).
The micro usb port on the Pill XL is for software updates only NOT Charging - you charge the XL with the supplied power adapter (I own 2)
Yes, mine hasn't had any issues at all. I flip the switch to turn the keyboard off when not in use and when I flip the switch back on it automatically pairs with my ipad and works the entire time until I flip the switch back off.
It does not fit with other iPad, iPad Air exclusive
I appreciate your perspective. Here's what we wrote on our Q&A page: FLOTE meets extremely high standards for design integrity and excellence in functionality. Every detail has been addressed to provide a premium product. There are several other, lower-priced stands on the market today but we believe that if you compare our products to these other stands, you'll agree with us that FLOTE is well worth the price. Our customers certainly do, and several of them purchased FLOTE after disappointment with other stands. Please see the reviews at FloteYourTablet dot com. Thank you.
No
Im not sure but i do know it will charge an iphone no problem. The amps would be based off of the power supply attached to the cord i.e your radio.
Yeah I think so the magnetic strips are aligned all around the edges o don't think the clip with the logo is a magnet itself although you might ruin the look of the case by damaging it.
Dear customer,thanks for your contact.Please let me inform you that it is combined radio.And you can program the radio within 400-470.Hope it helpful to you.We are the main distributor of 2 way radio and 2 way radio accessories.If you have any problems,please email us freely,we will do our best to satisfy you.Angela at alwaysonline store welcome to you :)
Windows 8 is already installed, we can probably update to 8.1
Yes
Can you please confirm, if it is working NOW, as I too am coming to india and would like to get one. Also let me know which SIM card you use in INDIA, whereever you stayed. Thanks. Vijay
30 amps, based on the part number of the contacts (1331)
Only once. I cycled the power by removing and re-inserting the USB cable and it started recording normally. Internal settings are set for automatic recording when power USB cable inserted. Good current supply and good MicroSD chips are important.
It's the same camera. Typically, when it's called a, "Sports Cam," or, "Mini Sports Cam," it comes packaged with a mounting sleeve and velcro mount. For the most part, there are only two choices for the camera itself: Wide Angle, or, Standard, lens. Most of the variations you see on Amazon are just different sets of accessories the camera comes packaged with.
No battery indicator. I am not sure how long the battery will last. The overall product sound output is very good.
Yep. It works great with a helmet. More than just loud, it sounds better so you don't need to crank it up so much.
No
Camera is holding up fine in coastal Virginia where temps have been hitting over 100 in the car. The suction cup mount has let go once or twice from the windshield (both on hot days), but no problems with the camera.
I put it inside a storage bag in the rear of my SUV. It depends on your specific vehicle which you did not reference in your question.
But the person listed that probably included tax in their pricing..
I believe that is a mistake, it is the new version. However, using the SLR camera market as an reference, this item is "grey" market. That is, it is a product manufactured for the Chinese market, not the the US market. This matters to Apple, who will not allow the US AppleCare to used with it. At least, this was my experience.
Yes
Yes I just went and verified the warranty is thru Mar 2016 and phone tech support until June 2015. Purchased a couple weeks ago.
This is the mini 2.
I have the 16g. All I do with it is watch movies, play a few games and surf the net. If you are just gonna do things like that, the 16 is sufficient. I didn't want to spend a lot of money either.
Yes
Yes
Use a USB cable and connect it to your computer.
Dear, This is a 2 Din universal player. Please first check the dimensions of the space for your player in your car. If the height is 100mm, this one will fit in your car.
Yes.It can connection (Bluetooth and WIFI ) stable.Thank you!
Short answer... I don't know. But it should be. Download the drivers and it's plug and play. I really like it. . It does everything I needed it to do without any issues. My only recommendation if you decide to get it, is to but strong velcro, and the provided pad doesn't hold the weight of the dock.
You could be looking at the wrong docking station if your intention is to plug your macbook pro onto it to charge your device. StarTech Thunderbolt Laptop Docking station is like a extension/hub for additional ports.
I do not really know because I bought the bag for occasional travel and have not really used it yet. But the handles seem fine and sturdy. They are two layers thick of the denim-like fabric and feel as if there is a liner layer in between. They are carefully sewed in, inside the pockets, and they could be reattached if they came off with your personally crumby sewing job well-hidden inside the pockets.
3-4 ounces very lightweight
Yes, it can fold all the wy back...and a little bonus, the little flap that folds over when the tablet cover is closed holds it in place when you open it all the way up with the front jacket flipped behind.
The manual I received with my unit states that the Bose SoundTouch is 120v 50-60 Hz 60W max.
No. Our FM generally works fine in our area...the radio on the Bose comes in good. Excellent sound.
Yes, please see this clip http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=051Z--WWzW0 Hope this helps.
Yes. You can use it with any audio device with an 1/8" output (headphones).
I'm not sure if there is some confusion regarding how it is powered but I don't want to seem like a jackass but it depends. Unit is powered by 4 "AA" batteries (not included), if you use high powered batteries I think you could get 6-12 hours of use at moderate volume. If you use cheap batteries at high volume maybe 3-6 hours, again depends. Friend I bought it for uses the AC adapter, when we used it with batteries (standard alkaline) it lasted 2+ hours without dying, I hope this helps.
For DVD... yes it is automatic. For Blu-Ray, there are three regions, A,B and C with manual button push the region number (1,2 or 3) on keypad then press "power on".... no hassle. Nice unit.... very small footprint. Have enjoyed it very much.
Yes. There is a Microsoft Office for iPad app.
Yes, you need to press the BLACKLIST button on the call blocker to add the numbers to the BLACKLIST, however you can do that anytime. So, you can hang up the call and later on browse the list of incoming phone numbers and press the button to add them to the BLACKLIST.
IPEVO High-Definition Wireless Presentation System (WPS-HD) has a maximum working range of 10 meters. Please make sure no obstacle is between WPS-HD and your computer if you are looking to use it at maximum range. Naturally, you will have better results (especially if playing video) if WPS-HD is closer and have better signal to your computer.
Yes, it will mine SHA-256 coins or which Peercoin is.
Ymmv but I have had no problem
I have it on mine and download games and apps all the time.
No
It fits mine (without retina display) perfectly.
A little more than an iPhone 4s.
You have to connect both
Nope!! Dont buy it!!
The lid and underside are covered in brushed aluminum with a very subtle cool tint; the keyboard deck has a neutral-toned silver plastic with black keys and a polished steel-colored hinge that has a grey button in the middle to disconnect the tablet from the base. Under the tablet glass, the screen has a black bezel all around, with the silver-grey plastic connecting it to the aluminum back.
No office
no.
Yes 1 year warranty. Be sure to register it though..
No, just one phone. If you want dual connection I would suggest the Parrot double din receiver.
Yes
does it come with Window 7 or 8
Yes through the USB port
The connections are BNC. The security cameras also comes with BNC connections. If you want to use CAT5 Eathernet cable to run lines for the cameras then you will have to buy BNC Video Baluns (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007XUU6EA/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
Does not come with drive you install your own SATA drive. Like a 1 TB drive.
Do not come with the hard drive
You can fins one at microcenter or bst buy perhaps. The one that works best with this is called inland it's a integrated keyboard and mouse works flawless.
Yes! You can use Google docs, gmail, google keep and much more without internet!
Yeah, it's compatible. In fact, all the 600 Films, are compatible with Polaroid 636. :)
No. this is not a replacement for the original gimbal. This is a generic gimbal you could probably get it to work with some tinkering.
Yes
Yes, thats what I used to control it.
Oh yes, they came with it. It's all in Chinese :-) But it has images in various stages of assembly, a bit like an Ikea kit. Here, I scanned mine and posted it online so you can print a copy: http://tinypic.com/r/2rdxpna/8 (and just in case they try to delete/mangle the link, here it is again: tinypic DOT com/r/2rdxpna/8 Enjoy! - C
That's where I'm using it. It is in a tiny Foxconn AT-7500 which makes a wonderful desktop work computer. It will go anywhere a standard SSD will fit.
Yes
It seems that there is incompatibility between your monitor and the NVR. You need to chanve the setting on video out. You need to connect to any pc monitor first. What kind of monitor are you trying to connect?
The default password is "123456"
Yes it is. You will need to have an HDMI to iPod connector to plug into.
Yes
64-bit.

Almost sure 99% it is like most Pentax K Mount DSLRs are WR weather resistance. Check out Ricoh Pentax website to be sure. Great Camera
The music stops so you can talk. It returns back to the music after you hang up fro your conversation.
It's smells real good last about 2 weeks
Yes you can hook a amp I don't have my amp hooked up yet
Yes it does.
Optical fiber: Supports 5.1 Multimedia Speakers Optical interface
No it does not. However, a min of 5mbps download is required
I just tried mine without the power plugged in, and it worked OK with the track ball that is plugged into it. However, I suspect that any device that requires power from the USB bus (like an self-powered hard drive) would NOT work unless the hub itself is powered.
I am 6'6" and i love the shoulder rig for the price. I like to film with my arms close to my body (gives me more control). I also have android field monitor, a 14inch shotgun Mic, and a light on my rig. There are two sets of rods which are 22 inches long.
Yes. Absolutely. I also boughtc a matte box, follow focus, cheese plate and additional L bracket to extend the rig. It turns heads when i walk around with it. It's easy to maneuver with and looks highly professional.
It is wireless and does not need to connect. I do remember being confused about connecting because of the cable they sent. But I just turned it on at the little switch on the top right hand side and started typing. I found it too cumbersome and rarely use the keypad.
Yes. We already offer black, brown, white, red and burgundy. Give us a call if you can't find them 800-213-3021
They dont change the sound and are much more comfortable than the original pads. Also very easy to install.
Yes it does fit a 10.1 thats what I bought it for and works great!
I love the look, color, and material of the case. However, one of my buttons fell off the keyboard attachment. It could be reattached, but now it's lost. I am extremly upset, and feel I should be sent a new complimentary case. I am a loyal Amazon customer, but this was the first time I was somehat unhappy with a purchase.
When the keyboard is removed you can stand it up like you would with the keyboard. You can also flip it back and use the flap for more support
It comes with a miniDisplay to display port cable. The monitor itself has both miniDisplay and display port. Not sure it the included cable can work both ways.
This set of glasses work great with my 3D Vizio. They are a little thinner than the original glasses, but work the exact same. I would definetly recommend these for the price.
NO!~ not with Sony or Samsung or Toshiba was\t of money!
The view finder eye piece is designed for only one eye...unlike binoculars...and is focus controlled from that also so I would think you would be able to use it.
Using programs with high PC usage such as video games the battery can last over an hour. Playing DVDs it will last several hours and light use it could last all day. I received two batteries with my computer.
I believe that it will work on an phone that has a round camera lens. The Fish Eye Lens is magnetic but if your phone doesn't have a metal back (my son's iPhone is the plastic back) the send you small sticky rings that you can use. So, the sticky part attached to the phone and the other side of the ring is metal to allow the lens to magnetically attach. Probably best to ask the seller, just to make sure though! Hope this helps.
It should as long as your case is large enough for it to fit. My case was a mid tower and there was not enough room for this to fit over the memory. If you have a full tower case, this should work with DDR3 or DDR4.
Larger than 4, overspacing shouldn't be an issue. It's 2.5" across.
Yes. This sits up high. The difference between vengence versions is one has straight edges on heat sink (first blue ones) and the new ones have the 45 corned heat sink. The height in middle is the same. This comes with two leg type connections. Should clear it.
Try the BenQ - DGD5 3D Glasses. It should work for all BenQ projectors with DLP Link 3D technology.
Don't recall off the top of my head but if you got to www.theprojectorpeople.com and look up the model it will tell you. I think it's good for about 3500 hours. We watch ours pretty much all day every day for the last 5 months and I'm only at 600 hours.
Yes it will. The receiver mounts into the flash hot shoe and a wire is plugged into micro phone jack behind the rubber cover on the side of the camera. The remote unit will then trigger the camera. It will work up to 300 feet away. I am really pleased with the way it works. Both the sending and receiving units require batteries. I do have a bad habit of forgetting to turn the receiver off when I put it back into my camera bag. I just make sure that I am carrying replacement batteries.
Yes it will work in a pcie 8x or 16x slot The power plug is there because electric signals degrade over distance, and the plug is used to compensate for the distance. It's not required but I would recommend using it
Thank you for your question. It is approximately 19cm (7.48 inch).
you only pay if you subscribe to netflix, hulu etc.
It's both, your ExpoDisc includes user selectable Warming Filters (Gels) you use for warming portraits. Without the gels it's neutral. More or less using it for exposure and white balance, like an incident exposure meter for your camera. Hope that helps
Read the product description man. C'mon, don't be a goober.
It has a solid state hybrid drive (SSHD). What that means is that it has a combination of a regular hard drive (500GB) fused with a SSD drive (24GB). If you want to learn more about it, there is a great Wikipedia article that you can find easily by doing a Google search for hybrid drives.
Not sure at this point. I use it as an axillary to my phone or tablet if I want a better speaker than both devices. The volume is loud enough to be hear clearly and cleanly, but I wouldn't use it as a sound system.
I have bought in US and use the laptop in Brazil without any adapter (just for reference in Brz we use 120v 220v)... as I am not familiar with Europe standard, I am not sure how its gonna work.
No, no carrying bad and yes charger is included
Dear Sir,please let me inform you that the frenquency is UHF 400-470MHz 5W 16 channel
16 channels thank you for asking
No and it's a piece POS anyway, the rim encroaches on the picture, I returned it
Tell you the truth I don't know if it's gonna work on your Honda CR V. I bought it to work on a 2004 Acura TSX. That turned out to be a bad decision.
Closed back keeps the sound of the outside world out at the sacrifice of quality because the sound cannot escape the earcups and just reverberates around. Open back allows you to hear the world around you and generally has better sound quality. In my opinion get the G4ME ONE's. The pleather pads on the zero get super hot and they take more to power to operate as well.
No, its not.
Yes mine too does the same too, but when you switch off the power supply it totally goes off.
I'm not sure if it had one that a Google ?but it runs good cool and quit...
yes no doubt
Have you tried putting all the music in one folder?
Our Divers only support MP3 and WMA formats. To play iTunes audio files, such as podcasts, you must first convert the files into the compatible MP3 or WMA formats.
Yes it can.
No, I really wouldn't recommend this unit. Though it is small there are probably some better units out there to purchase. Have you tried a wireless device for jogging? Hope this helps
Yes
9 1/2 X 5/14 inches
The base of the keyboard is made of real aluminum. It is not just aluminum finish.
Its universal and as long as you have Bluetooth capability I think it should but I'm not 100%. It works perfectly with my Microsoft Surface. I hope this helps somewhat. Good luck!
If it is the same as the ME102A 10" tablet - then yes.
We have three colors for this item, red, blue and green. Just a kind reminder, this item is only fit for AGPtek Kids' Tablet.
Yes, definitely! I used it when I went to a BBQ by the lake. It was loud enough to hear, and it's compact enough to fit in a backpack (3"x3"x2"). Plus the battery can last for days (depending on usage of course).
It doesnt need to be plugged in because of the great battery life, but yes it is good enough. It can easily cover a medium sized room. It uses a micro USB port to charge. If you like deep bass, this is not the speaker for you. But if you enjoy other music, it has great quality for the price.
Connect to the dongles Wi-Fi using a phone or device. Log in threw the ip supplied on screen with the dongle. (Use your phones browser to enter the ip into the address bar) Make sure your phones Wi-Fi is on the dongles. Then select your home Wi-Fi on the dongles web page and enter your code to the network.
Depends on how it is wired. Used multiple cameras on a commercial building and the electician got them all to work.
Depends on your equipment, does nothing by I itself.
Since I primarily bought this as a wireless speaker for music content on my phone (especially when in the shower), I wasn't concerned about radiation, and unfortunately don't have the answer to your question. However, even when you answer a call from a linked cellphone, it's not necessary to switch on the privacy feature and put the handset to your ear. You can simply use it as a speakerphone and avoid any risk you're concerned about.
I hate to tell you this but you've wasted your money. The one I purchased died after 1 week of using it.
Yes there is.
Yes from every where I bought this for my neighbor who moved from south Africa and it plays all of her movies cd's
Mine came with both cables if that's your question
5.5 inches x 3.5 inches and about 1 inch thick. You could fit it in your back pocket if necessary.

It is a dual band VHF and UHF FM transceiver. Depends on what "marine frequencies" you want to use and whether they are FM or not. The VHF range is 136mhz to 174mhz, so if the marine frequency you are wanting is within that range, and is FM, then yes.
Not exactly. We have DirecTV (Genie-wired type) and an LG 55LB6300 connected to our Denon S514. We also have a second LG TV (same model, smaller size) that only uses the on-board speakers. On the smaller LG without the sound bar, we see the TV's volume level (numbered) go up and down on the screen. On the larger LG, once I sync it with the S514, when we use the TV remote to adjust sound, instead of the numbers, we just see a large + or - on the screen and the sound bar volume increases or decreases accordingly.
You just connect it directly to the tv. Using the optical cable works best if your tv has that capability
I have the same bar. I hooked up the bar to tv as instructed and hooked up the DVD player as instructed. Be sure to shut the sound off on TV to use external sound.
There is an adjustment knob on the back of the sub. Have you made sure that is turned up?
There are no grooves on the keyboard part but it still seems to grip pretty well. If wiggled around a lot it will probably slip (maybe while driving in a car). I love it and have had no problems with it.
I really dont know
I am using this with my E-PM2. E-PL5 has just 0.7 mm extra width. I believe it will fit E-PL5 comfortably.
I will not able to fit E-PL6.
Short Answer- yes, I think it will work with a magic jack. Here is why I say this- I am using this phone on a Voip line via BasicTalk. My Basic Talk box has a normal R9/R11 phone jack output (the typical "wall jack" we all expect a phone to have). IF your magic jack has a plug in for a typical "wall jack" home phone, then this phone should work just fine. Hope that helps...
It is designed for the Fujifilm Instax Mini Instant Film
The device has front Camera which in my opinion Is ok, but had problems the decide didnt work i meam problem turning on but it works perfectly now glad with it Good tablet
Yes it should
I made my own extension cables by using speaker wires (16 or 18 AWG) and 2.1 x 5.5 jacks that I purchased on Amazon (Zitrades). The jacks are available as plugs (male) or socket (female).
I have mines hooked up to my lap top and I can hook the laptop to the TV monitor and see it like that. You can't hook it up directly to your TV be a use it has to be connected to wifi
Sorry Aaren, I was never able to receive the product. Now, I have to fight for refund because I was charged for that, just no product for the warranty to cover.
They did not cover mine either.
You can go between BT and AUX, back and forth. AUX doesn't require battery
Not as bass heavy as some of the other headphones in the market, but pretty reasonable. If you prefer really heavy bass, you should look elsewhere. The Sol republics shine when listening to classical music or spoken word.
I have tried headbanging with them and they stayed in place. As long as you adjust the height of the sound engines on the track rails to fit quite snug onto your head, they'll stay on.
Built-In 3.5mm Auxiliary Cable to Connect and Play your iPod, iPhone, iPad, Tablet, Smartphone, MP3 Player, CD player, Tape Cassette Players or Any Additional Audio Devices, it will play music from smart phones yes, the cable plugs into your speaker/head phone jack on device. My wife uses it at work and loves it. It will only charge the Iphone 4, but will play music from other devices.
Yes, the IR led glows red as soon as it is dark. I own several Hikvision cameras and the night view is superb on this camera.
you don't need a router you need a switch. most switches these days are 1gb but 100mb will work fine.
Hello, I've been using the Diver for swimming. I don't think it can be used for anything deeper. Please be aware that the Diver does not have a "random" play feature and therefore all songs are played in the same order - not a big deal for me since I loaded it with 3MB of music but it may be important. Good luck
Hope this answers your question; If you turn it off by holding the power button down until the display goes off, then it will do what I call cold boot, several seconds with Dragon logo etc. If you just quickly press and release, it will start immediately the next time you turn it on. When you say reboot often, do you mean spontaneously? If so I've never had that problem.
11 by 5 inches.
They buckle. But one of mine has already fallen off. Which I was extremely bummed out about because I love the product. But it zips up and also buckles.
yes it does, Super Multi DVD burner. my son use it all the time.
Good possibility . My installation is not in the woods but I am picking up signals from that distance from some of my neighbors. I am in the country but it is open and flat. If you can get any signal this will boost it .
4GB DDR3 memory and Intel Celeron processor 1017U
Yes, there is a hole for a headset connection.
The speaker has a tiny light which flashes alongside the power button. In my opinion, this light shouldn't bother you if you point it away from you. If it does bother you, you can easily cover it.
Hold it for at least 20 seconds. If if doesn't come on. Contact RCA
You're right, no way to attach a heat sink... I also would like to see a regulator that could have the potentiometers attached off board..... there are applications that involve voltage / current changes and using the installed trim pots is not that fun...
The converter itself has a max output. The ammeter actually measures the output current going to the load
I haven't been able to find the ESPN app yet but it seems like new apps become available intermittently.
2.1 ghz with turbo boost up to 2.9 ghz
It does, but I returned cause the I got the wrong model, I ordered an Intel n I got an amd cpu
so far for last couple of months that looks like the battery hold a full charge on video and music to last up to 5 to 6 hours. it's less than 4 months old so u have to judge that yourself.
Unfortunately this particular case is only for the Venue 8 pro.
My iPad air fits perfectly. Compare the dimensions of the two devices and you will have your answer. If the Galaxy 10.1 is roughly the same size as the iPad air it will work.
Thats it. It's a problem with this headphone because otherwise they sound great. Check out the Sony MDR-1RBT, it's way better overall.
metal is just called an alloy, not sure exactly what it is but it's lightweight like aluminum or stainless steel. The telescoping sections are very tight together so any dirt or salt debris could make it really tough to telescope. For the price you can buy 2 in case something happens to one and then use one in water...they are VERY handy and a must-have for self filming.
Sorry, never tried it, do not know??
It is an awesome camera. I love mine. Takes very good close ups as well. Good detail. Best digital camera I have had so far!! Good luck on Ebay.
Yes. I installed Win 8 without recovery media, and activated it with the serial number in BIOS, and then upgraded to Windows 8.1 successfully.
Yes, this is possible: you can easily upgrade the HDD and increase the RAM in this computer
Routers are pretty much a matter of choice. A lot depends on how far from the router you will be working and if there are any physical obstructions between the laptop and the router. I have been very happy with the Netgear Rangemax router. Inside an average home you will have pretty good coverage in all rooms.
Honestly, I've had nothing but issues since purchasing this laptop. I personally have not used it for video editing, but would not buy it for that specific purpose.
Yes, it have
Yes, and it worked out fine for displaying images and else. But not the brightness adjustment and auto-rotate though. That's Mac's compativity issue, not the monitor's.
No cable lock. Big, colorful stickers with identifying information is the only solution I can think of... Also mark the case as it looks like a black notepad folder. I keep the monitor in my laptop bag when I'm not using it.
Yes. It has a few feet, enough to get to the glove box with some to spare in my application.
It's got buttons. You press "SRC" on the device on the top left. It switches from RADIO to BLUETOOTH to AUX.
I would get the high performance battery, charge would last longer, but if you want less of a charge you can get something with less charge. The number is 4400 mAh to 10400mah depending on length of charge. 6600 mah is the middle of the road. 4400 mAh | Chemistry: Li-ion | Voltage: 11.1 Volts | Cells: 6 | wHr: 49. [6-Cell Li-ion 11.1V] 18 Months warranty.
Steps in 10's. 530, 540, 550 etc.
Yes, my daughter has a 5th gen ipod touch and that is why I bought it. It works great. We have had it since Christmas and no problems.
I don't know yet I bought it for an xmas present
No. This is why I ordered them, and they would show a connection, but then had no audio.
Yes I do.
yes, it can work with bluetooth version 4.0
Yes
I believe that's the size of the box it comes in. It's a standard DIN size radio.
Look in your camera's manual and find the remote connection. Then look at the pictures that come with this item and be sure that one of the adapters fits your camera.
Dont buy it, is so fragile , just used 1 month and the display dont work
No
is there a question here? take the lens cap off, slide the power button to the right, and within a few seconds, it is ready to shoot...if not, change the batteries.
Yes it does. And works good for me.
Yes , it's android compatible, works awesome
Yes
No
At least no now, you have to use the app to change to miracast mode first, and then find the device under setting-display-wireless display. but we have given feedback to factory. they will give you a new setting choice in future update, in that setting, you could set the default mode to miracast, so once you set, in future, once you turn on, it will directly give you miracast mode, and maybe then, you don't need app in future.
YES IT WILL WORK PERFECTLY
Yes, you can do that!
I am not sure,but I do not think so because I usually use more than half an hour,it did not stop.
The DBK does not support BDXL. EBK models do. http://forums.anandtech.com/showpost.php?p=36209077&postcount=6
Yes, the Harman Kardon Aura works with both Bluetooth and Airplay connections on an iPhone 6. You have to do network settings before using Airplay and be on the same network. You can also use the standard 3.5mm cord, I haven't tried using the Apple lightning cord to play music.
They have different purposes. Aura works plugged in to energy while onyx has batteries. Aura has a dedicated subwoofer on its base that makes it unique and onyx uses mid bass for this. If you're looking for taking to places without an energy outlet and don't mind looking bass, onyx. Otherwise if you like bass and is only moving it every once in a while, go for the Aura
Stamped on the power supply for the Aura is 100-240v 50/60 Hz, so the answer to your question is yes.
I only use the case for transport while traveling, and have not taken it out in the weather. However, since it is neoprene, I believe that it would be water resistant.
This computer uses integrated graphics. http://www.toshiba.com/us/computers/laptops/satellite/S50/S55T-A5389 Considering the price, this computer probably has Iris integrated graphics. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HD_and_Iris_Graphics The memory limit it is dependent on non-Intel controlled factors, for example, available system memory, BIOS, system settings. This leads inspires more questions. Some answers are addressed here. http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-033984.htm
No there is no CD player just Ian ports and a ad slot
I got about 25 to 30ft before it cuts out.
I don't know if it remembers if you remove the disk, but as long as the disk is in it remembers where it was when it shuts off. This works even if the batteries die.
Yes,Yes
I would say, "No sir". It has Radeon (tm) hd graphics 2.10 ghz. If you are looking specifically for gaming I don't think this is your computer, sorry. My husband has installed a couple of games on my laptop that don't play on his desktop, but he says his computer has a much better graphics card for his games like Crysis.
Yes.
Yes
I could, although I would need you to directly cover shipping which would be a little more expensive (I'm guessing an additional $30, but not sure).
I don't know
Hello it does come with a sim card and no you don't have to have any other t-mobile plan you can and one tho if you feel that 200mb is not enough for what you do it does not have to be a contract it can be a pay as you go or use i hope this was helpful
Yes...mine came with a T-Mobile SIM card and the instructions guided me in registering it for my lifetime free 250 MB of 4G data. I would assume one could swap out another SIM card as long as it is the same frequencies (AT&T in US? Not sure about international).
Mine holds a Samsung pro 12..5 inch tablet..with tthree anchors..height is good but short on length..with three holds well..just remove one anchor..
Yes. It fits my iPad 1
Yes. That's why I bought it as well. It works great
One is for xbox360 Elite and the other is for xbox360 slim
Yes. I bought the xbox 360 E 4g with kinect and this hdd fits and works great
SD slot. You'd have to get a MicroSD adapter to use a MICRO SD.
with mine, the light turns off when it is finished. keep in mind, as with most rechargeable items, the first time you charge them, the lnltial charge time will be much longer than it will be from then on, because the first charge is a DEEP-CHARGE, with charges after that simply topping off a partially-charged battery. Hope this helps.
The base is 19-3/4 x 10-1/4 inches
It makes it pretty heavy but protects it very well. We use it for a construction business.
yes
It comes with a cord that plugs into 120v. The camera itself takes 5.0v dc
No. This laptop is not a touch screen..
This will definitely work on slave mode but I am not sure about hot shoe if it will work because different cameras have different size of hot shoe. I am using nikon d3200 both are working. For the price and quality pictures, this speed light flash is a steal.
There is no video Output (HDMI nor VGA). What do you want Kodi for?
Hi,Marceloc,thank you for your inquiry. It about 5~15 meters.
Sorry but I got the one without the Wireless option.
I think it might be too big but would definitely fit. I'm not sure of the size of an iPad. I'm very pleased with the case, though it took about a week for the foam to stop smelling strongly like rubber. I've gotten compliments on the pattern. I think it's very unique. Hope I haven't been too wordy.
Hi Chan, We will explain it more clearly. The ihome itself has a switching power switch. But the original (natural) power cord is still a 110 plug for usa/canada customer. For customer outside of the usa/canada, they need to buy a "power convertor" 110v to 220v. Once you get the convertor, then you plug the ihome power 110 plug into your convertor and then switch to 220 voltage. So overall its compatible to switch to 220 voltage for customer outside of usa/canada but you still need to buy a POWER CONVERTOR 110-to-220. Thank You.
Yes. It fit my 15.6 HP envy.
yes works well but after a certain distance it doesnt matter what you input it is pixelated.
It kind of works with any camera that does not require special software to access its images. It creates WiFi server using the mass storage driver from the card the storage works like regular card for the camera it creates its own network AP for you to access I have not played with it too much I have not figured out if it can be used on existing network as a node but documentation says it can be done along with push that I have not tried either.
It takes HDMI direct in.
You can use the monitor with surface pro 3 (plugged in) but it will drain the surface pro's battery. If you don't want the monitor to drain the surface pro's battery I suggest using an external battery to power the monitor.
As of now Acer is does not have the update for this model but it may become available in the future.
If I understand the question, yes both apps are on it along with kindle app for books
Yes you can
I wash mine with dish detergent. Run it under water to get it wet, then put a few drops of detergent on both sides, agitate the surface with your fingers. Afterwards, run it under the water again to rinse while squeezing the excess suds/soap out. When you're finished let it air dry.
Its plain silver/aluminum. No pictures or words on the back.
I'm not 100% sure but I do not believe so. It's a magnetic strip that's made specific for the size of the Air (1).
It's working perfectly well and it has on/off light indicators. Highly recommended as an original charger spare/replacement.
No. It is only suited for a Mobius or Go-Pro camera.
It might work short-term if you have a powered hdmi port. If the ultrabook does not have a powered port then you will need to find something with a usb power connector. When I tested it I was able to get about an hours use with it before the screen would start blinking. Pluggable used to make a version of this with a micro usb power plug wired in but I don't see it on their website any longer.
I have this case it just fits my phantom 2 vision plus. I would say based on what I see as the phantom 2 vision plus and the new vision 3 the bodies are the same and the camera does not go below the landing legs. So it should fit based on the overall frame being the same on both. I know it's a snug fit which is what you want. I have the Dji Inspire and bought a case for that as well. Great craftsmanship on this case.
Unlikely. I believe it will be too large but you can double check by getting the max allowable dimensions from the airline you are flying.
No. This would not fit the keyboard which is most likely why it isn't in those pictures. I made the mistake of believing the other answer.
Hello, thanks for your question. The information on the Product Page states that this bag will fit your DSLR camera with one standard lens, flash and accessories. Based on this information, it appears that it would fit the Nikon D5300 with Nikon 18-200mm VR II lens fitted on it. For future reference, you can find this information to the right of the product picture on the Product Page. I hope this helps!
There is switch on the back. Unplug. Change it and then power back on.
Yes it works on you stering wheel
Not Much. If you don't need it for a child to learn your own language...avoid this piece of hardware. Save your money and buy something useful. If you do have a child that need to watch cartoons in your native language, then find other products or simply you are stuck to buy this one.
you will need to buy a separate wiring kit
Glossy. It attracts some fingerprints. However, not nearly so much as the top cover. The cover attracts fingerprints so much to be quite annoying. One cannot touch it without leaving major fingerprints.
yes this will work
3.5-4.0 hours
Mine did NOT have the reset button. Although this isn't an issue for my general need, it would be nice if it had it. I use this only for traveling and charging while on the road.
NO. You can remove the vertical bolt, and leave the mounting plate on the tv for future use. I'd replace the nut on the bolt with a wing nut. If the tv not to heavy, it should be easy to align the bolt through the holes. You can remove the tilt knob, but it will take two persons, one to hold the tv, and one to hold the carage bolt to tighting it. A drop on mount still has to be bolted in place if the RV is being moved. Walt
Dolores, I too had to really tilt my tv as well and it has not fallen off or even moved. I just made sure it was in a strong stud in the wall and the TV itself was tightly secured to the bracket holder. Maybe add a small unnoticeable strap to tv itself to have piece of mind. Hope this helps you!
I said yes..
20.5 L x 15.5 W x 7.5 D
USB is incompatible with other version. files can't be accessed
No they don't you have down load only from Apple store in the apps
Yes it is cellular but you wiil have to buy a data package from cellular provider.
I wouldn't say it is half the price of the other cards. It is comparable. For example, Saphire R9 270X 4G is probably closest to this card by the specs. It is usually sold at about the same price when both are available at the same retailer. Prices of different brands reflect reputation and their quality control. There is also big variation of prices across retailers.
It can play YouTube pretty well, but so far as I know the Netflix is coded with different format, it might not be compatible with this tablet.
Very well, I have had it for some time and no issues. My 6 year old and 3 year old have taken the tablet over and they charge it as needed, so if it can handle them I think your in good shape. Overall its not bad for the price.
We sent it back the second day!!!&#128545;.
Please do not waste your money on that computer. The battery does not work, is damaged. The screen freezes, and the touch screen does not work repeatedly, until you restart the computer. Some of my friends bought this product with the same results
No, it's an Intel card, and not supported. You will need to get separate Bluetooth and wifi adapters.
I can't answer that, because the tablet only worked for two weeks, so I recommend you don't buy it.
I don't know. It works well, but the sound is very low and the camera does not take good pictures. That didn't matter to me, but the sound did.
No
Same thread pattern as OEM screws.
yes. you do. just plug it in a electrial outlet with the charger that came with it.
I have a Toshiba satellite c875-s7205 and this battery did not work for it (it would start up with it but then randomly shut off power about every 10 mins).
Yes, but I had to enlarge the radio opening in the foam a little to fit it in there.
Mine came with a power cable.
yes you can, wired through usb or wireless.
Bluetooth is not supported on this laptop model.
no it is not.
Sorry, I'm not sure about that. I wish I could help.
It has no magnets. It is a normal case without the function of turning on and off the tablet screen.
It is a two-in-one tablet PC. There is no docking station
Yes, you can.
1 TB
The flash drive is in Fat 32 format which will have limitation on 4GB or below file tranfering. If you format it to NTFS, you can transfer any size of files as long as the whole capacity allows it. Is this what you mean?
Check that the pins in the usb opening havent bent due to inserting at an angle. Format the drive. What happens when you insert it into a computer?
If you mean mp4 movies then yes. I'm able to connect to my tv & watch things that I've downloaded in mp4 format.
All of the above. It is brand new in box unopened with manufacture seal still intact.
battery is internal--see review under battery issues
Yes you can just like a desk top.
No. Mine crashed. Took 3 weeks to get Windows 8 on USB. Didn't work. Returned it. I loved it before it crashed
yes it has, keyboard is very comfirtable also, fn+f9 turns off and turns on backlit
No it does not have a CD player but it can play YouTube and Netflix.
Yes, the transformer trio (tx201la) runs both Windows and android. Android in the tablet and Windows in the keyboard. Both usable in laptop mode but not separate. So you can't use Windows on the tablet alone, and no android on the dock without the tablet. Heads up, don't upgrade to 8.1 until they fix the os switcher or else you will need to reboot every time you want to change the os
No, this APU requires a FM2+ socket, and it is a 28nm.
If you're not overclocking it works great.
This case uses a slot line or slot in 12.7 mm optical drive
350 - 450 watts
I have a lg smart tv and it works great. It should work for you if your tv has a USB port to plug in the keyboard receiver
Sorry but Zalman only has software for Windows pc's
Dear Sir or Madam, Thanks for your inquiry. Yes, you can charge the power bank and use the power bank to charge other device at the same time. Thanks. Best regards. EasyAcc Support Team Apr 24, 2014 by EasyAcc
No. It will not. The Grip tabs are made for the larger screens (9-10")
Mine did not come with the necessary licenses for Office, so I returned it. The rest was correct.
NVIDIA GeForce GT 740M Graphics with 2048MB of dedicated video memory
The battery is very poor. If I watch youtube videos for 30 min the charge is about 20% from 100% charged. Since the beginning I have had charging issues as well. I would recommend returning if you can. Here is link I was sent about the tablet: http://www.mymidpad.com/FAQ.html
This stereo had several issues- never did get them resolved and the company did not stand behind it... Id run from this unit.
Yes it is the viewing area.
No it doesn't come with carrying case. There are many variety of cases on Amazon.com that you can choose from depending on your use. Just make sure that it is for 10.1" tablet.
I am not sure, I think it will handle whatsup for sure but don't know what is the FL studio.
It is unlocked GSM. You need to have your own provider.
You surely can!!!!
This is not for a stronger signal but the band or type of wifi. If you computer does not get N. The regular bear is for a weak signal. Works on OS X.
The case cover slides on using grooves and actually needs quite a bit of force to slide on. I don't think you will have an issue with the case cover sliding off accidentally. I also carry mine as external storage for my camera in my camera bag, no issues.
Yes, hooking it up to the Xbox one will format the drive the way the X1 will read it. If it does not you will have to hook it up to a desktop and format the drive itself.
I'm not sure but it did not fit the 7" android or 7" RCA tablets that I have.
Looks like to me it fits iPad but not good on much else
hi friend, this item is not fit for your galaxy 3 7 inch tablet,sorry bringing you such inconvenience! best regards
It did not fit my 7 inch tablet.
yea use the cable that comes w/the power bank and connect to ur wall plug.
Yes it does its the phone I own and use this for
using either of the two usb cables that come with it, you just plug it into the micro usb port and the other end can go into either a wall charger or you laptop/cpu.
Yes u can
yes the original Canon battery and charger will come included
I looked at the back and the power supply. There is a little red switch which allows one to swap between higher and lower voltage. I don't know if this helps and if this is a standard feature. I bought this because it was a good deal.
No it does not overheat but it does from time to time drop your Wi-Fi connection and you must retart to get it reconnected.
Yes, I have two.
WiFi but do not buy I am sending mine back do not work with wifi please dont buy
Not sure what you mean by unlocked but it works right out of the box.
Depends on A/V from unit source TV Show/Movie/music, etc. The unit will send 1080P video if selected and up to 5.1 sound, again if selected. Unit has many, many options.
I bought this a while ago and it is a great system. I haven't had any problems with it and it runs great. I was looking for the same price range and for what you get in this system it is a great deal.
I am not really sure as I live in Egypt so in all cases the warranty thing will not matter for me. Sorry!
Yes, for shizzle
Yes it does, via the HDMI.
No
Yes. The computer i got came with 1 stick of ram and the motherboard has 2 slots for ram
It is more of a rubber type finish. Has not scratched my Ipad but I don't take it in and out of the case.
No
I'd have to go look at the papers for the warranty information. The camera was brand new in box and all. This is an amazing camera package at an amazing deal and I love it.
That is a little tabletop tripod, about 6 inches tall. You will need to buy a real tripod.
I use on on my iPad air so not sure. I would think it has the same charger it would
There is a Display Port to Mini Display port cable so ---&gt; mDP to macbook, DP to monitor, walla 4k goodness, make sure your macbook is late 2013 for 4k to work, it will only work @ 30hz under mac os, but will run fine @ 60hz in windows via bootcamp,
the monitor comes calibrated out of the box, it is actually quite good. but im sure you could use x-rite, but i have never used it to calibrate any screen. so i dont know forsure but calibration out of box is very good, it even comes with a calibration chart in the box
No
Yes
I found that in the Vali's price range, ss amps gave better sound so I sold my Vali and now use a receiver for my headphone amp. I have HE-400 headphones and a Fiio X-3 as my source. I have tried various low end tube amps and they all seem to suffer from the same loss of detail veil problem. I think tubes offer the best sound, just not at this level.
yep. if you have rca outs on the back of the cd player, use those right into the rca in on the vali. if you only have an optical audio out, you'll need a dac. there is a schiit optical modi. you'd plug the optical out from the cd player to the optical in on the modi, then rca out from modi to rca in on vali. easy
Yep! I have the newest iPad and it fits in the groove perfectly! The Bluetooth connection is also seamless.
When put away, the keyboard completely covers the IPad and is held on one end by magnet. This protects the iPad like a case.
There are only 4 stock fans. The 230mm is on the top. The 120mm on the back. And then the two 140mm are in the front and on the side with the opening.
Yes, this is a full size case. Huge in fact.
Sorry, this can't fit on 13 inch even take out of the keys. For 13 inch, here is the link:
Yes it does
You should be able to bend it back with a little bit of force. Brace the opposite side of the wire with a set of needle nose or something strong and attempt to bend it back with your fingers, this will insure you apply the only amount of pressure needed to bent it back to alignment and not over bend the wires..Good luck!
Not if you have a case on your iPhone 6. My case is very slim (so slim I may replace it!) and yet the connection couldn't be made. Disappointing because I loved my previous iHome.
I do not believe so. MacBooks use a custom connector, not the standard M.2 connector.
That is exactly what I did. It sits up stairs in the middle of the house. Router is downstairs at one end of the house. I was having issues getting wifi upstairs to the opposite side of the house. Now I connect to this instead and have no issues having great wifi upstairs or downstairs. Can have issues if portable device is attached to upstairs(this device) and device is on opposite floor. This has not been an issue for my family of 5 or our devices. Works great!
No, it is not.
No do not change.
It does indeed have an ethernet port.
Yes.
I do not have a definitive answer but I believe you can use the modem without using the router. You can turn off the router's broadcasting ability and send the signals via cables to a router.
no
It comes with a trial of MS Office, but you have to purchase the full version after 30 days to continue using it. You don't lose access to any documents made during the first 30 days.
Yes. Windows 8.1.
No but u can buy an external DVD/CD drive and plug it in via USB when ever u want to use it.
Nope. No Optic Drive (CD/DVD) player. You can use an external, they range anywhere from 30$ to 80$.
No CD/DVD dive.
I think so. I've had it for months, and edit videos quite a lot.
Mine was brand new and had a year warranty from HP.
No
unfortunately, no.
HP Pavilion 23-h050 has : Installed memory (RAM): 4.00 GB (3.44 GB usable) Hope this answer your question.
It does NOT.
The short answer is yes. The ran can be upgraded to 16gb (2x8) but comes with 4gb (1x4). So from a cost vs benefit perspective I would only add one stick. The hdd could be upgraded through replacement. The system only has one bay available internally. You could easily add an external hdd for additional storage.
no
It will work with the SL1, though using the remote feature might not work depending on the plug that the SL1 uses you may need the RF-603 II C1 http://www.amazon.com/Yongnuo-RF-603-II-Wireless-Transceiver/dp/B00HOX8X9G/ref=pd_sim_p_4?ie=UTF8&refRID=0MEGM592V1AVFA7AVGWF the C3 models are for the camera models with the N3 remote terminals most of the rebels have had a mini plug remote terminal. So the transmitters will work either way but it would not be able to be used as a remote shutter release if you have the wrong remote terminal cord. Yes this is the newest version of the RF-603 models.
Yes.it will fit
no the mouse and keyboard are not wirless
Honestly, I haven't played games with it. But, I imagine it could probably handle anything you threw at it--it isn't an old computer. Having used it: I don't think Windows 8 is all that great though. It just provides you with two different ways of looking at the same programs.
two slots
No you can NOT add any card. There is a very small mother board. The power supply is an external brick. It is the perfect machine for me, home use.
Yes
Either disposable or rechargeable batteries can be safely used.
Yes you can do itgood day thanks
Although our unit has a generous range on coverage, it is primary designed for in-home use. If you are interested in coverage on the go, call us at 1-800-994-2095, and we can get you set up with a great, personalized product to protect you when you're outside of the home. Thank you for your interest in One Call Alert!

That is 100% correct, we should be offering of FPV complete kit that is plug and play in about a weeks time, that will include this monitor and a video transmitter, along with batteries, charger, go pro cables and more.
I don't think there's any easy way to get into this thing to change the battery, but you won't need to think about replacing the battery for a LONG time. Battery life is VERY good on a single charge (about 25 hours), and if you really need to run it longer than that between charges, you can plug it into a car charger or AC with an appropriate "power only" adapter.
Pretty sure it only does that after first putting it in and after having it connected to a PC. However, there is an issue, this thing is slow and laggy in the menus. Sometimes it takes up to 8 seconds just to skip to the next song. I can't recommend it.
Nope! Unlike the Clip Zip, the Clip Sport has no recording features.
Yes, the lights are white and can be turned on and off via a button on the keyboard.
I am not 100% sure, but I think the tablet would connect to 2 OontZ.
Could not say yes or no. It is a snap on style. It would all depend on the thickness .sorry I am not familiar with the hp envy.
IPearl makes covers for different laptops. Make sure the one you order is for an HP 14.
It says it's made for Chrome Books.
It's 2GB.
Yes..but let me say...this is a POS! Sound/record quality is terrible. Shuts off automatically and you miss most of the lecture you are recording.
Yes it is
I ordered mine over a month ago and never received it.. so I have no clue, sry..
Yes they are
Prolly not. I have a dodge caliber and it just made it. And also, ull want different than a 4g. Its not big enough.
Yes and yes
Yes, this one comes with the nVidia GeForce GT 750M dedicated graphics processor. This particular model has 4 GB of dedicated video memory.
No, there aren't any compatibility problems with Mac interface with BenQ monitors. I use the XL2720T with my Macbook Air via D-sub and was able to mirror the display with no problem. I also used the same connection to extend the display with no problem either.
It has a 6 inch display
It does not come with Microsoft office.
Do you mean, does it speak street names? Yes, it does do that.
It is pretty easy. Follow the directions - you hook it up to your computer first to download everything into it. The directions will explain. If you have a kid between 17 and 28 they will know exactly how to do it :} I love mine - it was the best $200 spent ever!!!!
By multi waypoints I assume you mean multiple destinations at once. I have used it to go to a store, my client's home, and then back home, so I would say yes it does multi waypoints. I don't know about custom routs specifically.
No it came only with a keyboard (not such a good one) and a mouse.
yes
The chipset on this pc forces that it have 4 slots. i am unaware of whether it is 1x8 or 2x4 2x4 would take advantage of the dual channel memory though
Definitely! I already updated from windows 8 to 8.1 and it only took a few minutes to install.
You have to update it to 8.1
It visually recommends a lane or lanes to be in but it doesnt announce what lane to be in like google maps
Yes. 4 total. 1 for HDD 1 for USM. 2 open trays.
Yes they are all Cannon without cases, but the tripod is plastic and weak. The value of this bundle is well worth the money.
Yes, one battery and a charger are included
I am running 8.1 just fine, have 5 r9 270x's running, had 6 on scrypt, but running x11 only can seem to get 5 stable
No, but you can get X-Mouse Button Control from download. It's free!! It's great too
Hi W.B., performance will vary depending on the wireless environment in your home, interference, construction of the home, but this router should work well for you. We would also recommend taking a look at some of our routers with enhanced signal transmission given the size of your home, such as the R7000 or R8000.
Yes networking is the same not matter the operating system. Have windows, apple and some other brands all running on it
It has vga, lan, hdmi, usb 3, card reader, 2 usb 2 slots
It realy is Win 7, It has a OEM Windows 7 sticker on the bottom of it
go to crucial.com plug in your model and they will be able to tell you just how much "goodies" you can cram in there
Yes, in the front on the right-hand side.
They are not magnetic. It slides into a bracket and clicks in. It won't come open whEm lifted. Very nice bag.
Yes it does do "AC" aka 5g. It works with my Belkin AC120 router on both 2.4g and 5g
Hi Vishu, it cannot be plugged in to just any projector for video presentations because you need to run the software on the device where it will be plugged into and there is a system requirements for such action. Please check this link, http://www.belkin.com/us/support-article?articleNum=77880
Yes. It also comes with clips you can add to the ends of the world to hook up to the amp.
In order to view the picture "right side up" it must be mounted as shown. Mounted with the "ball mount" down, the video will show on your monitor inverted. I have not found a way to invert this electronically. Garmin needs to fix this oversight. They would sell a lot more cameras without this restriction.
It should work just fine. I've plugged Bluetooth devices, flash drives, and external hard drives into it and had no trouble at all.
A few questions: Are you using this with a Mac? Are there usb 3.0 hub drivers to install for Mac? Are you referring to the physical plugging-in act or the device plugs in but doesn't charge or get recognized by your computer?
It depends on what they take from your account if they take the 59.99then you will be sent the 7 if they take 125.99 then they send the ten. In my case they charged me so many times and i didn't know what to do a and they would only send more tablets I lost a good 500.00 before i had to cancel my cards. Good luck
Actually this item can support 4-5 hours stand-by status and 3 hours for normal use. But if watching online videos or playing online games, it may about 2 hours. The battery life depends on how you use it.
Yes
Depends if your cable modem has a usb port, but I'd guess it wouldn't work. Usually a router is something that has a usb port for something like this. This would allow you to plug a drive into it and then be able to access it from computers on your network: http://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-WNR3500L-Open-Source-WNR3500Lv2-Processor/dp/B002RYYZZS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1428902380&sr=8-1&keywords=WNR3500L
Yes
Sorry, I own the "CS 140 K"
It's plastic.
The Mac and PC versions are one and the same, but needs to be formatted if the PC version is to be used with a Mac. There is a video on-line that explains how to do this.
That really would depend on the height of your bed and type flooring you have. The more you extend for height the less stable the unit becomes.
Yes
The ease works by deleting the recording. There is an option to erase all or to erase a specific recording, and yes it will prompt to about being sure.
The slimport does not have to be connected to a power source. I've used it both on my nexus 7 and nexus 5.
I found the unit unreliable. I finally removed it. Better to know it's not there than to count on it being there. I have not found a replacement.
You probably need to find the seller who has inventory in the US. Otherwise, you might end up with products shipped from china. We have full inventory and customer support based in California. Let us know if there is anything we can help.
Yes
You have to wire it through the wall with powered ethernet. (POE)
Laptop is not enough. You will need a POE injector. Power over ethernet. It gets connected inline between camera and laptop.
Hello, you do not need any tools to adjust. Its tight to move but it will.What are you looking to achieve?
Yes, it will
Yes, I recommend the screen protector, but the case is small and doesn't fit exact to the tablet.
can't say resolution is same as that of my ipad but this tablet is so handy, works well and is pretty fast... resolution isnt that bad , could be a bit grainy at times but i only use the cam for skype :-)
Yes, with the applicable app.
Thanks for your question. These will pair with any device that is bluetooth equipped. This is a fantastic sounding headphone. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Life n Soul dealer.
I am looking for the same info.. if you check out this camera on walmarts site there is an actual video on there! Helped me to decide that this is the camera that I am looking for. Also, I believe the macro is as close as 1 cm ! I need a macro to photograph my beadwork.
Also check out YouTube video on Fujifilm S9400w Top Features by FujiGuys. They explain it better.
You need to pop up the flash, even when the camera is in auto.
Yes. Please read the specs.
There are two independent zoom levers on the Fujifilm S1 camera; there is no manual zoom ring. One is located around the shutter button; you zoom in by rotating the collar clockwise, and zoom out by rotating it counter-clockwise. The zoom speed is slower than the lens mounted lever for more precise adjustment. The lens mounted zoom lever allows zooming in and out very quickly. Not having manual zoom ring may seem like a disadvantage, but my experience using a manual zoom ring has been that it introduced jerkiness and general "unsmoothness" in videos.
The keyboard and mouse is not the best thing in the world. The sensitivity of the mouse is decent. The keyboard will be a bit uncomfortable to type with.
Yes it does. They're red if you want to know :)
Not this particular one because it's for the Air. The Air is smaller than the iPad 4.
no, two total different sizes
Yep, both the front and rear cameras.
No. These are for mining cryptocurrency. It is not an adapter for an external video card.
These do not connect to the board. You must connect to power leads coming form your power supply.
It didn't work at all. The signal was too weak for my Samsung G3 to pick up. I tried this one next and it worked like a charm: http://www.amazon.com/Kinivo-BTD-400-Bluetooth-4-0-adapter/dp/B007Q45EF4/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1408152752&sr=8-2&keywords=kinivo+bluetooth+dongle
Yes. With any application there is a balance between speed, efficiency, and heat generation. With a NAS speed is less important for a small group of users. You will probably get better performance for a desktop with another drive that has a faster spindle speed and more cache. I only buy Hitachi drives and have for years because of their reliability. They made the drives for IBM servers for many years. They shipped in HP servers and I never saw one fail.
"RATED:5V 450mA,12V 850mA"
Every hard drive will produce some sound. The Deskstar drives are very quiet.
1080p with HDMI
hello Physical Characteristics Form Factor: Tower Height: 14.2" Width: 6.8" Depth: 15.8" Weight (Approximate): 17.40 lb
This is just the case. You have to get the device separately.
yes, you can unplug them and us any headphones/earplugs you wish
Yes it will be sure to pair it with an i5 or i7 and at least 8 GB of ddr 3 ram for best results
In the default camera settings, not too good. Too bright and washed out. But with the update to Android 4.2.2, there are many more settings and features on the camera. You may be able to find settings that are pleasing to you. However, even with a 5 MP camera, tablet cameras will not give pictures as good as a dedicated camera or even a modern smart phone. It has a 4X digital zoom. As you zoom in quality suffers.
Yes, this CPU can burn CDs and DVDs.
I don't know. I've found the memory to be sufficient though. But I tried installing an ASUS silent 210 graphics card and it actually made the games worse! I'd buy from Amazon so you can return the memory if there is any problem. That's what I did with the graphics card.
I'm not sure, but I don't see why not. It should be easy since it's a wide body tower. Looking at the back, I see 3 expansion slots, so I would assume that you can.
I use the Apple Lightning-to-HDMI adapter and an HDMI cable.. Works well.
No you can't, you can only charge it or power it with the outlet plug
Yes
You need to replace the digitizer cable (the one near the middle that feeds through). It only costs a couple of bucks but it will do the trick. It did for me.
Not that I know of. The documentation is very skimpy also. Therefore, I doubt it.
It's possible if you can get an adapter to connect it.
They worked for 2 weeks and then they fell apart
Yes, easily.
7200 rpm drives get SATA III while 5400 drives get SATA II. No, key code for automatic upgrade.
no pen and I don't think that this laptop is compatible.
You can do both upgrade on this laptop. Thanks
You will need a potable cd drive. I have a potable cd drive to watch my movies. You could buy one for like $20-50 depending on the brand on amazon.
Hi. Yeah you can take it apart and upgrade its ram. hard disk, etc. Max ram is 8GB. Take a look at http://download.lenovo.com/consumer/mobiles_pub/lenovo_g700g710_hmm.pdf. Hope this helps.
You can basically flip the screen all the way around to turn it into a "tablet".
Yes it does.
Intel HD Graphics 4600. It's built in graphics (is not dedicated) card that comes with latest generation of Intel Haswell processors.
This has user replaceable 6-Cell Li-Cylinder battery. Exact model of battery can be asked from Lenovo support.
Yes, it does. The memory is 4 GB DDR3 RAM.
Yes, it has a built-in camera
This laptop does not have a touch screen
Yes it comes with adhesive
yes, it does ;)
yes, it does have. 10/100 Fast Ethernet, 802.11a/b/g/n Wireless LAN Connect to a broadband modem with wired Ethernet or wirelessly connect to a WiFi signal or hotspot with the 802.11a/b/g/n connection built into your PC
No, there is not. The only way to power on/off your macbook is with the screen open with this dock.
Hello, You may close the screen when it is attached to the unit. But I take my laptop home an a regular basis and I have a plastic cover on the top and bottom to protect the unit from scratches. Here is the kicker... You will have to take off the bottom plastic protection every time you want to lock/secure your laptop to the Landing Zone Dock. I would still buy it again, it
You do know that you are looking at just a cover and a Bluetooth keyboard, right? The Tablet is not part of this item. So can you connect it to an external monitor? The keyboard is Bluetooth. If your monitor is able to "pair" with Bluetooth accessories, you might be able to. But the keyboard is meant to "pair" with the Tablet. It is the Tablet that would connect with the monitor.
Yes, it came with free upgrade disk, although I personally prefer windows 7 pro.
No disrespect intended read the product specs!
Yes it came with one screw
Maybe try using the charger and when u plug the USB into the laptop and connect it to the wusic speaker it might work?
Yes, the speaker is fully functional with any app on any cell phone as long as it has Bluetooth.
I cant give you a solid yes but i can say that ive never found a video card that wont support any monitors ive thrown at it. Plus this is a newer card so i would say yes but no guarantees. From what i can tell all video cards on the medium end support all monitors maybe every video card does. However best thing to do is google it. Ive never had a issue with a video card not supporting a monitor and i build computers a ton.
Yes, it does. Press the 'CALL' button to switch to FM receiver mode.
There really not much difference the shell seems to be a bit tougher. And seems to scan faster with the new chip in the GT3.
yes, in your setting you must select a country don't leave it automatic
Still warms up the room, but it is NEAR silent.
Yeah, you can run Minecraft on the highest optimal setting.
its plastic but feels pretty sturdy
I use it for everything except movie watching (I use a chromecast for that). Battery life is actually pretty good. It does not handle super graphics intense games, but It can run Sims 3 for example on the fastest speed with pretty good ease. More graphics intense games would probably struggle a bit or need to have settings lowered. I have been able to play games for at least two hours (maybe three) without the battery going dead. Web browsing and word processing could last a much greater amount of time.
yes
http://www.onkyousa.com/Products/model.php?m=TX-NR626&class=Receiver It has Audyssey technology, so it would require a mic to setup. So yes, I'd bet the farm on it coming with a mic.
I too have a 2005 Silverado and fits in dash perfectly, you'll also need wire harness and antenna adapter
This is a double din, but it runs a little large, so you will likely need to cut your trim kit (I had to cut mine). It is also a bit deep, so depending on your vehicle you may need to cut away some plastic in the back end of your car's head unit cavity (again, I had to do this with mine).
Hi Richy This is a "double" din head unit. Thank you for choosing The Wires Zone.
It is. It has a dew different ways of mounting. It fits a standard double din opening. You may need a kit to make it fit in your car.
Unsure. You can contact the company most likely and see. Sorry I was not very helpful.
It does make an audible motor sound, however, in my experience it's what I would characterize as fairly quiet. In a silent room, it's certainly noticeable, but it's still less volume than the shutter of the camera. If it's grinding, that's not normal, but the sound of the parts moving is not unusual.
To answer your first question, this will support Display port monitors that are from 1.0 to 1.2a. The second part is a question of the kinds of monitors being plugged in - if you only use 1.0 or 1.1 monitors, this hub will not significantly increase the throughput to require 1.2; a 1.1 graphics card should support 3-&gt;1 1.1 displays. If you have a 1.2 display, you will need a 1.2 graphics card.
Just a router
I can not see how this would possibly work.
The front is soft and protects the screen. The back hard and sturdy. Not likely to protect if dropped but fits perfectly and will help protect tablet from scratches when placed in a bag and much easier to hold while using. Hope this helps.
Sorry for the long delay to answer your question. This battery is compatible with your computer. The best way to find out the correct battery is to take out the battery from your computer and check the model number. If you see model number A1245 on the battery and this is the correct battery for your option. If you have any questions please feel free to contact us at (626)698-8163 or Call us toll-free : 1-866-566-7820. Thank you for your support and it's our pleasure to assist you.
I was running one of these with an older PC Power & Cooling 430 W PS, never had an issue. If you are going to overclock it, you are going to have a tough time with two of them on anything less than an 850 watt power supply. But that has been my experience; your mileage may vary.
No service contract needed. This is a WiFi only tablet.
Both run Android KitKat 4, but the Google Play Version does not have any of the LG proprietary software. I have played with both and kept the LG Pad version, it is a.great tablet.
I use it with a rode psa1 it's fine with some heavy cables. Great shock mount. Cheap, quality and small . make sure you have it orientated the right way round. One of the holes is too small for the yeti adapter.
Sorry not sure what a perk farm is but I have 11 different things; phones, tablets and it seems to do the job just fine. The wall charger is always the fastest.
8 3/4" long x 1 14" w x about 3/4" high. The top 12 ports light up (you can light up only 6 at a time - I'm assuming that they are active when lit. The 13th port is active all the time so that you can link these, I assume).
Hi Thank you for your interest. It's glossy screen like Apple cinema display. Thanks.
The red button starts and stops recording. Each clip is saved as a separate file. There is no pause. It's very easy to stitch them together in a video editing program on your computer.
Yes it can.
It has a High speed burst mode setting [10.5 shots per second] (within manual setting) however the quality is compromised and locked at 2304x1728 and cannot be changed. As you take more pictures the shooting may slow down. There also is the standard continuous shooting mode [3.9 shots per second] (within auto). Essentially the same as above goes for this mode even though it is slower, you will be able to take pictures at a better resolution.
We have been able to upload the photos wirelessly to both Android devices and an iPad. We haven't tried a Kindle or laptop. The camera takes a little prompting when you want to connect multiple devices, but it's not hard to do. The first device is a snap once set up...
The camera that we received is an HFR52.
I'm using Sony 32GB SDHC Class 10 UHS-1 R40 Memory Card (SF32UY/TQMN) it is working properly
There is a Canon CW app you need . I put it on IPad. Turn that on and there's a button to left of menu button. Turn on the button with the blue outline , and the camera and tablet or computer will sync and pictures will come off camera. I have to save ach image on IPad after. Have never used a computer for them. With my past cameras everything is so time consuming and hard for me to figure out. This one is done in a matter of a few minutes.
I like this camera. It is easy to use and the picture quality is excellent.
I was planning on getting the 340 but after reading tech reviews and consumer reviews I bought the 330 in pink 2 months ago. This is the BEST camera I ever used... the lighting, the sharpness of the pics (great low light too) I love it so much I just bought another one in pink to have a back up..don't want to be without this camera. I would absolutely buy the 330 -nice metal body unlike the flimsy body of the 340. Get the 330 before its gone!
It should work for the fire stick. But the one I bought would only work half the time. The one I got to work great is {View HD HDMI to Composite | AV Universal Converter for PAL & NTSC Standard TV (HDMI to AV Converter Metal Case (VHD-168)}. It cost more but will work.
I have two outside and they work fine both are under overhangs so they don't get very wet. I am not sure on the temps.
In my experience with these headphones, yes.
Dear William, It uses four AAA batteries. For more FAQ or installation tips, please visit SoHoMiLL.com. Katie
It comes with the i3-4130 processor.
Mine came with 8.1. The keyboard and mouse are of a decent quality and it comes with both.
Yes, it's listed in the extended information.
I would say No. The HDMI and some USB ports are on the bottom back of computer. If you mount it the bracket needs to allow access to side USB as well. After that then YES it can.
Yes and they are quality. Best out of the ones I tested at best buy for sure.
No
I've had my Lenovo since June and almost exclusively keep it plugged in. I used the battery a couple of times but only for a short period. So, I really can't comment on the battery life. However, I do understand that it's good for only 2 hours or so. I've read other complaints about that. Also, can't comment on the battery replacement issue. Sorry!
Good morning. Thank you for your question. Yes, you can hook it to your TV. And it is color in daytime;B/W in night time. I believe you will love it when you use it. Oliva
No, you will need to purchase a controller or use the ptz controller that comes with your dvr if applicable.
Yes
Yes it does n very responsive
Rabbit TV is not the same as regular cable or satellite TV. They do offer live channels, however most of their content is available on-demand. You are not able to watch channels like MTV or History LIVE, but you CAN watch most popular episodes from those networks and other major U.S. networks on-demand any time you'd like. The most recent episodes for most shows will become available online starting the very next day after they premiere.
I believe you can get your local abc so yeah
I have a Mac and the pics and video upload easily and the quality is great. I use iPhoto and iMovie.
The one I bought had it included and you must get one with it. I dove in the Caribbean at all hours and never needed anything more than a flashlight.
It depends on your charging method. A few hours via AC power with a depleted battery. Crank for two minutes, rest for a minute, and repeat.
One microphone right next to the charging port. Yes you can talk into it and the person on the other side can't tell that I'm using a Bluetooth device :) I'm using my Google phone and all the buttons works such as play, pause, skipping track and the volume button. Definitely worth it and I get almost a whole day out of it. Hopefully this helps.
I have Windows 7 and they work just fine.
Hey Ben...not to get too technical..but they seem to increase the signal in proportion to the 2.4 GHz..the operative word here is "proportionately"..I think you will be happy with the results and the price is right...check out the Asus routers..Net gear is nice..but Asus has the edge..and Asus support is second to none...good luck..Jim
Hi, the keyboard itself will, as it is simply a bluetooth device. The case, however, will not. The ports are different. I believe the company has a brand that works specifically with the 10.1.
Yes . That's what I use. I like it, too.
Yes, AM as well.
I am not sure about Ford excursion IF you have single din , you need to make it double din as this system is double din , and it mostly fits any car , install wise I did through car stereo shop. It is not that tough but you need basic car electronics knowledge.
Nope
The screen protector does fully cover the front camera.
I have mini two so this feature is not available for that.
Technically speaking yes. But unless you are a real photog, you won't tell the difference in your pictures. The one thing I like about the a6000 over my a5000 is that it has a viewfinder.
No it's does not having any type of memory. You must purchase a microsd card. The biggest size and the fastest speed you can afford.
Seems to work fine with a 128GB Transcend card....
One of the things is that it won't chew through the phone's battery as fast. But I've been happy using the phone app, and it has served my every need.
Yes, it has a touchscreen to operate and configure the camcorder.
Yes, it comes included with the camera.
I prefer the SONY camera. I even have an Old one model ( 1 Megapixel ) with night vision, and even today I've gotten wonderfurl night videos
yes it is
No, the wide angle view is fine with the standard lense. Yes, it has a remote that works great.
Very good package.
hi, Face Detection with voice enhancement and noise reduction Sony's Face Detection technology can automatically distinguish between children and adults. Face Detection technology detects up to eight individual faces and adjusts flash, focus, exposure, and white balance to help deliver crisp, properly lit images of family and friends. it doesn't mention smiling face.
HI, THE BATTERY CHARGES THROUGH THE CAMERA. you can get an optional charger for the battery.
Memory for only few pictures. I always use a memory card.
There is no audio for this camera
It comes with a suction cup you attach on the windshield.
Hello. The GoSafe 110 uses a micro USB jack. We do not recommend using alternative power cords. We supply the cord and will not honor the warranty if using a cord while driving other than the one we supply just in case there are some major issues that arise. You can safely use a power bank to power up the device if you would like to take it out of the car. I hope this answers your questions. Kind Regards, ~Team PAPAGO!
1a. It comes with a controller board, or IR Remote, and the first time that you use it you can select the input (i.e. HDMI or VGA ) and adjust the brightness, contrast, etc. ..... Pull the control daughter board and ribbon out, and every time it will turn on and start with saved settings with a proper signal. 2a. Cig power, Fine. 3a. As long as you have VGA or HDMI output from the OS. I use Linux
Yes
No
Put the radio in a 1993 Ford f150 works great
i havn't had any problems with the headset
Yes, A Transciever is a combined transmitter and receiver. Each one can be used in either role (via selector switch on the side). I carry 5 of these in my lighting kit along with 3 Yongnuo speed lights and 1 Canon speed light. I can use any of them on any of the devices (camera or flash) and they work great. Keep in mind they do not support TTL. If you're a manual shooter, then you'll love these.
Yes it does
this unit will be already be preloaded with the operating system. We do not install office or word on these computers.
Sure will.
I have had no experience with the a77 But it works very well with my nex7 which uses the same hot shoe
I have a 5100 and it works fine the literature sys it will work with d3000 series so I do not see any problems
Yes it has a LAN 100 port next to the HDMI Out port. Good luck!
Amazon Prime works as an app on this TV for me. I had to perform a software update when I first received it in order to make it work, but it did eventually let me enter my credentials and watch Amazon Prime video.
Yes, this Sony KDL40W600B do have 1 HDMI ARC port. -Ely
yes it does
Yes, plus the 3200 costs more. I'm very happy with the BDPS1200. I had to buy an HDMI cable, but that did not cost much (it does not come with a cable).
Go to Audio/sound..Uncheck dolby digital and use normal audio. This WILL solve your problem, but you must do it for every movie you watch. I got a refund for this problem, but got to keep the blue ray. Small price for a good product :))
You may have to measure your headphones. The Approximate Dimensions of this case are H: 24 cm, W: 18 cm and D: 11.5cm.
Television, remote, stand shown in picture, hardware bits like screws
Nope
It is perfectly capable of long exposure photography with simply too reasons. First it has the slowest shutter speed of 60sec but with Bulb setting it can expose unto 30mins. More important is you can see the cumulative result of your long exposure in your viewfinder...
You need an adaptor. Fotodiox Lens Mount Adapter, Olympus OM Zuiko Lens to Micro 4/3 Olympus PEN and Panasonic Lumix Cameras. My lenses are primes and I use them full manual.
The camera comes with a usb charger which means as long as you carry the charging cord (not compatible with micro usb of standard android phone) you can charge it with any usb power source. The battery stays in the camera and not taken out during charging. Camera as shipped does not come with sd card. Right now on amazon you can buy a class 10 (fastest rating) 64gb usd for under 25 dollars.
Hi, this Sony Bravia KDL70W850B is a VESA compliant with a VESA hole pitch of 400 x 300 mm. -Ely
This camera came along with me to Ireland for eleven days, and I took over 1500 photographs. The battery had to be charged every night because I was not only taking photographs, but I was continuously viewing them which takes a lot of juice.
It performs admirably in low light, with minimal delay.
I have found that anything I can watch on my Android tablet, I can watch on this.
This model does not support water cooling. only reference model cards do. this car needs a 4-pin PWM fan connected to it at all times or the computer will not boot. I know by experience because when installing the Kraken g10 I had to buy a custom fan and modify it in order for the adapter and water cooling to work. water blocks will definitely not work with this model.
Yes it can. on YouTube there is a channel called tech of tomorrow and They always do 4k benchmarks on msi gtx 780 ti. This card can do 4k ultra but the game demanding games like battlefield 4 and far cry 3 are gonna run around 30 fps. If you are ok with that then yes&#128522; it can&#128522;
http://www.msi.com/page/warranty/#w-vga Check here, I think you have to contact them because the warrant is different for each region.
Play safe and get a 500 watt or more PSU
Yes, full Mac environment details can be found in the below link. http://shop.panasonic.com/docs/operating-instruction/2014/digital-camcorders/HCV550_Advanced.pdf#page=180
This camcorder comes packaged with: *VW-VBT190 Rechargeable Battery *Shoe Adapter *AC Adapter *Mini-HDMI Cable *USB Cable *Software *Instruction Manual
The camera comes with a USB charging cord, I've used it with "Poweradd Pilot E2 12000mAh Dual USB Portable Charger". It will even work without the camera battery in place.
We regret to inform you this model does not have a remote control but you can download the Panasonic Image app for your iOS or Android smart phone. Additional information can be found in the below link. http://panasonic.jp/support/global/cs/soft/image_app/e_cam/ios/index.html
No - with just the projector. However,t here are third party devices that can help you with this.
It is! I bought this camera for my trip to Europe and downloaded the app. It allows me to transfer all my pictures to my phone and allows for easy uploading. Also, if you buy a "selfie stick" it can connect to that and you can also use your phone As the remote to take the picture!
Yes.
No.
AA Alkaline or Lithium - two
Fast shutter speed at least 200 or more. High ISO for light so about 400 and open F stop 3.5 or so
Not sure about that with the Nikon Coolpix S6800. It comes with ViewNX2 imaging program, BUT.. it's not compatible with Windows XP so I don't know if it would upload directly. However, I can upload to Dropbox via a direct USB connection, or using a Card reader, if that helps.
In the direct sun, yes.....but the picture screen on the back can be moved or adjusted to compensate for that. The picture screen on the back telescopes and tilts....hope that helps
To get the best performance, get a high speed SanDisk Class 10 microSD card. A 32gb SanDisk card can usually be found on Amazon for under $25.
Did u try going to settings and checking that everything is set up right
Nikon states that the following interfaces are available on the Nikon L830 camera: HDMI Micro (Type D) DC Input AV Output
It dont have bluetooth and it want even keep charged.. But i dont know bout urs but my two boys have one and when they play a game it go dead
Idk about that model, I bought a longer rectangular version.
Not likely. It has good range but 200ft is pushing the limit by about 100 ft. Then concrete walls would make the signal weaker. I have a 1600 sqft house and it barely covers the property with a consistent strong signal.
Yes, this is exactly my primary use case. The router allows to select the hotel wifi, enter login/password, and then shares the internet via its own wifi connection. The only router'a MAC-address is visible by hotel.
Yes all the capacity is encrypted
I have two colleagues who attempted to use this same flash drive with Ubuntu and it did not work. This drive was issued to us given the need for encryption. Unfortunately, having a new mac and as I mentioned about my colleagues, it was of no use.
Hi, I'm Jewel with Kingston Technical Support. Short answer: No. The DTLPG3 is compatible with Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7 (SP1), Windows Vista (SP2), Mac OS v.10.6.x-10.9.x.

Hi Chris, The DT Locker Plus G3 flash drive is a personal level secure drive and uses basic AES with at least 128-bit level encryption. If you require a certain level of encryption it would be best to consider one of our business level encryption drives, described here: http://www.kingston.com/datasheets/Secure_Comparison_Chart_US.pdf Thank you for your interest in the DTLPG3! -Jewel, Kingston US Technical Support
I can really only get about 1 1/2 - 2 hours of playing music. But on the bright side, it only takes like 5 minutes to charge :)
No so sure about that .
Yes it has a feature to allow custom controllers in the menus
Hi, RM-X170 (Wireless Card Remote) is an optional accessories which means that it is not included on the package and it is sold separately. As for audio/video playback, it supports MP3, WMA, AAC music files and mp4 videos. -Ely
Windows 8, Wild Tangent Games, ASUS Sync Program and misc ASUS user tools - that's it
Dear frend, Thank you for yourmessage. If the amazon prime is a Android app, this TV box will play it. If not, this TV box will not work with it. More details please look at the listing. Best regards, Maria
Suggest you send your question to service@keedox.com They were very helpful on another question.
Ports: 2 SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Ports, 2 USB 2.0, VGA, HDMI, 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet This is in the description of the ports available. You can see the HDMI on the left side of the laptop.
Yes. The battery is very easily removed.
Yes. The battery is very easily removed.
I don't know what AWN is but the lens is FX and DX compatible. For DX you have to include the crop factor of 1.5, yielding 225-900mm.
YES! That's what I have and all is well!
Yes it will.
I've only tested on a Note 3 which is the phone that I have. It should work on any Android phone version 4.3 and up, but I haven't tested it personally. Hope this helps!
I've had NO problems moving files between this device and external sd card (gs5 running kitkat).
The system shows this usb drive as removable disk.
The drive is very beautiful and good design...very faster the other USB drive.
I run it on my PC running Windows 7. quick install... & runs fine. I use to store music (over 117, 000 songs & plenty of room for maybe another 100-thou more) that I play thru Zune software. no problems, quiet, fast. wish I could be more helpful...try LaCle directly. good luck
Yes, the Dell Inspiron 17R (5737) Laptop comes with a DVD drive.
Hello, no this item does NOT have office installed.
No, it doesn't. Maybe this link can help you http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Inspiron-15-6-Inch-Touchscreen-i15RVT-13333BLK/dp/B00HRO38KQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1394249639&sr=8-1&keywords=dell+core+i5+touchscreen That should work, but i personally think, based on my experience, that a touchscreen for a laptop it's not commonly used because you have the mouse and the keyboard, but that's up to you, this was just my humble opinion. Good luck with your shopping
The one I bought came with Win 8.1
Yes, you can upgrade a HDD in this machine
Seems like it said 16 gig was max. But I saw one that said you could have up to 32. Check the specs on Dell.com to get the absolute answer.
I did not like any part of Dell. I exchanged it for an HP, what a wonderful difference
Yes
For making additional profit during a time were people tend to buy nice gifts for their mother. Duh!!
No.
Yes, windows auto updates to latest and greatest on new systems.
No. I didn't get the touch screen.
Luckily I had an external drive, the online picture shows a drive door and the specification sheet said that there was one. I guess that I can inquire about it if it is not too late.
Yes, there is a year Dell computer support included in this price. I am discussing getting the laptop repaired with Dell and I am awaiting the end of the process before making any update to my previous review.
18 inches, base to top of screen.
It came with a trial version of McAfee and Office 360 from Microsoft.
No, it does not have a backlit keyboard feature. Thanks, PCrush
Its a swappable battery
It is about 1.0" high and I am not sure about the DVD vs. CD issue. Never had to use it yet, but I am thinking it will do both.
No it does not.
Yes it does.
Yes, very fast wireless AC Card with bluetooth 4.0
Yes. You can use the track pad, a mouse, or the touch screen.
Yes
yes you can
Most licenses do allow you to load on the desktop and laptop at the same time. Since you can't use both at the same time you're still using the single license. As for installing it appears to work fine.
Yes, you can there is the option for either youtube of facebook. I am sorry my previous answer said you could not and I was wrong yesterday. I just was editing a video and realized this. I usually tag all ov my videos before I upload them for extra seo purposes.
Nope it does not. Atx power supply is what you need. I recommend 600 watt or higher depending on build. Coolermaster evga rosewill and corsair make good ones.
Yes, easily..., take off the side covers and remove the screws, then the 5.25 bracket can be removed.
Of course. However I cannot find AAC with VBR. If there are settings for that somewhere, there are hidden. There is AAC with CBR of course, all bitrates up to 512 kbps, at standard 48000hz.
I don't know for sure buddy, sorry. But this is a really simple program to do basic stuffs, I was used to use Vegas Pro and became a little bit disappointed with this one.
Honestly, the RAM is plenty unless you're trying to game with this Chromebook. Remember, the Chrome OS has no "services" and all the STUFF running in the background that Windows has. 2GB with this processor, and this Chromebook, is not just quick, but fast.
Don't really know but I have a Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS5 and they are fine for that camera.
Yes, mine does
Yes,we can do this size now ,if you buy please contact us and tell me your Macbook size,thanks
yes it is for ipad mini 1, non retina display version
It has Windows 8.1. No, it does not come with Microsoft Office
Very easy to set up
Does NOT have it have a wi-fi card and Has 6 - USB 2.0 Ports and 2 - USB 3.0 Ports
Maybe, but I used 1vga and 1 HDMI. It works great but I had help. Good luck!
4600
It has both.
yes, it does
Video card does not require 2 displays. But you may connect up to 2 displays to this desktop. Thank you
It has a sample excel and word.
one slot. and above the slot reads sd/mmc-ms/pro. slot is approximatly 1 inch wide. i haven't used it yet.
No.
Yes, but you need a especific program
Yes it does. I'm using it for my MS Surface Pro 3 for watching movies
I have had no problems with it running OS 10.9, just plug and play. You do need a program that will play Bluray movies (if you want to do this), as Apple's programs don't support them.
Thank you for your interest in our products. Yes as long as you are running Mac OS X 10.6/10.7/10.8
yes,just order first and contact us immediately after purchasing about your size and order id,we will mark this in time and send as your write size
I have an Arris modem/router from Time Warner, and it works for me.
Yes, but too many of them with over lapping signals will play havoc on your devices when connecting. I tried doing this and ended up taking them out where not needed. I have one that I turned the wifi off and just use the ethernet ports.
No. One side is see through the other is not. The doors are removable though but I doubt the hinges would line up on opposite side.
Yes, I have a similarly sized Maximus Formula mobo. The only issue I ran into was the small wifi card that came with the mobo didn't fit unless I took off the tiny metal shield.
Aye, I'm actually using Photoshop now on it. Don't see any reason why it wouldn't be supported.
Pt-810
Nope.
That problem is just the beginning. get your money back asap&gt;
I have heard other people say that it does work with Bluetooth keyboards. If at all possible, I'd suggest you try to plug your keyboard into another device to make sure it is working properly. May I ask what brand your keyboard is? The more info, the better to assist! :D
They have a USB port you can charge it from there.
No, it is a stationary camera. It can be adjusted to whatever angle you want.
Go to the DJI website. There is a link to the PDF version of the manual. You will need to download the main manual and the battery manual.
There were very limited instructions in the package so I went online and downloaded the manual.
egarding HDD, an internal SATA 3.5" Consumer Electronics Grade one would be compatible with our system. We recommend that you only purchase Consumer Electronics Grade Hard Drives such as: Western Digital Audio Video Green Power (AV-GP), Seagate SV35 Series, Hitachi Cinema Star Series. You may go Amazon, search for "Western Digital AV-GP".
No it does not light up.
Yes, 2- USB 3.0 and 1- USB 2.0.
Linda here I had to return the one I purchased
You can buy a sim card with any carrier you choose to go with.
frequency is not important as knowing the class of processors. Sub $300 AMD E series / Intel Celerons = for browsing internet only Sub $400 AMD A4 series dual core/ Intel Pentiums Haswell= browsing, streaming shows $400 and above AMD A6 series QuadCore/ Intel i3 Haswell = everything else except, Video editing AMD A8 and A10 QuadCore/ Intel i5 Haswell= builds upon A6 processor, gaming, video editing, etc.
yes it does.
No no problems with the quick release
No it does not, sorry
no, that number is an iPad 2
It comes well packaged - no problems with mine.
This GPS has a slot for a micro SD card slot for a 16MB memory card. Record your music onto the SD card and insert it into the slot. There is an icon on the touch screen to select the music.
Yes, provides for vertical mounting with 2 screws (not included).
It sounds defective. Our button plays the BluRay.
Yes, and Its much better than the Baofeng one .
No...
MP4
More than likely China....If you are not buying all eight cameras know that Swan will not provide add-on's if you want more of their cameras later. You will have to reach out to another CCTV camera provider which isn't bad but had I known that I would not have purchased them in the first place.
Yes
Yes it does.
A QAM tuner enables you to receive digital cable channels without the need of a set top box. This TV will support Over-The-Air (OTA) and analog cable connections (such as the service you would get in rooms without a cable box when you pay for basic cable). Hope this helps!
I do not know the answer to that. I do know the sound on board is not very good. So I see why you want a sound bar.
I believe it will. I'm using the fire tv stick with it and have had no issues.
I believe it's total.
Haven't tried a hdd that big, but no reason it wouldn't work. The case fits the hdd and no software needed.
Yes, it works with 3.5 inch 4TB drives so should work fine with a Western Digital drive.
No! It hasn't! Extremely hot without a Fan, I must mod a Fan for him:( (it must be if you want your hdd working 24/7). Anyway It's almost beautiful on the tablet with an MacPC :)
No, USB or esata not both at the same time.
yes the camera has a flip screen
no the lens does not support the IS feature
Hello, I dont see why it would not work, since the FC40 does run on the 5.8ghz transmitter/receiver. I'm thinking of getting this later as well. You can also ask the geeks on YouTube as their VERY knowledged on this stuff!
YES IT IS BACKLIT
Three years warranty
It does accept an adaptor, in fact I installed one and am using it right now in Italy ! (Sierra Gobi).
No. You cannot. You cannot listen to music at all through the headphones.
Optical in
Mr. Parker, I can't provide the specs as I gave the camera as a gift. I'm sorry - FMC.
Sorry I can't be of any help, I ended up going with the Samsung Galaxy 10.1 2014 edition, by the time I received the the case, however I was very pleased with the exchange for the tablet case GeekBuying was very helpful and has a great exchange policy. . Good luck..
if you purchase the item from geekbuying,you can type 00000000 to pair,thanks
Yes, it does. Disappointing. Samsung dropped the ball on this one.
The "Tag and Go" feature only works with Android devices. All other wi-fi photo sharing functions are compatible with your iPhone.
Yes, an additional battery and car charger are pretty affordable
Yes...when you turn on the camera, on the left lower of the screen there is a finger pointer symbol. Touch it and then a menu comes up that lets you choose touch operation options. Nice.
I'm not a cable expert, but the supplied cable appears to be a standard type and not a proprietary one. The supplied cable is rather short. One that's two or three feet long would be far more convenient for charging. At least for me ... I'm not impressed with the charging set up. Those little plugs are too fragile in my opinion. For the price of this camera a wall charger should be included! I hear it's available separately .. additional charge of course.
Yes. There is switch that you press to switch between the LCD and the view finder. Only one is on at any given time.
Yes, you can use it outside of the U.S.
A quick glance at the downloadable user's manual says that the maximum is 64GB. However, this is often not the true limit and can change with software updates or may have only been the specified maximum size because that was the largest SD card size at the time. The GC2 just went through a major software update that fixed loads of major issues. I had almost given up on this camera until last month when the new software was installed.
Yes it does. Just hit the top of the wheel "Disp" until it appears.
Yes it does, there will be both the regular stop function and pause button to choose from when shooting video.
No
This camera is amazing! The zoom is fantastic! I can take pictures from across a large room, outdoors, or anywhere and be able to have all the zoom I need. It is great for school functions! It would be perfect for taking pictures of gymnasts and cheerleaders. The only thing is if they are moving a lot. Just like any camera the picture could turn out blurry if there's a lot of movement. There could be a setting on the camera for that, but I have not looked into that. It takes great pictures and video also.
Battery does not have to come out to charge. Mini USB.
the battery is build-in the keyboard. can not change it, it is chargable build-in design, no need to change, you can charge it when it is low battery.
Hello. It has Intel warranty. And no: this is 2820 model. Regards.
The description says it has "10/100/1000Mbps Ethernet port", which is wired ethernet
The direct answer from Audio Technica when I asked about using a V-Moda Boom Mic Pro with the headset. "The detachable cable for the new ATH-M50xBL headphones (and all of the new M-Series) are a proprietary locking 2.5mm cable. This means that the V-Mode BoomPro will not work with the new headphones." Hope this helps.
I had the original m50 white, and assuming they use pretty much the same material, the pad at the headband will get a bit dirty (discolored) over time. I had mine for a few months now, and it's a little dirty there. I haven't tried to clean it yet since it's not a big deal
I'm a trombonist playing both classical and jazz music so I know exactly what you're keen to listening to. I've owned the M100 for sometime before returning it. I can safely say the M100 is much more geared towards DJ/Bass Head platforms. It's abysmal for Jazz and Classical listening. The bass is seriously distracting since it's more forward compared to the midranges, making midrange-centric music sound quite off. I would definitely recommend the ATHM50x over the V-Moda series in this regard.
No, the following have detachable cables: ATH-M40x, ATH-M50x, ATH-M50x-R, ATH-M50x-BL, ATH-M50x-BL-R, ATH-M50x-WH, ATH-M50x-WH and ATH-M50mkII
Collapsible, handy tote bag included
They are snug but comfortable. They are a little tight with glasses on.
Over ear
It is not a noise-canceling headphone.
I lucked out, I had a bracket for a bike light and the speaker fit right in it. I would send the company an email to find out
Yes, via a male to male headphone cord....or micro usb......good product if it didn't talk back to ya
It does. For some reason, I don't know why, my computer does not recognize some devices via bluetooth (but my cellphone does well. Then, I'm fine) so, it works with the jack.
According to what I have found, the product dimensions are: 6.5 x 5 x 0.6 inches. It fits my Nook Glowlight perfectly and the dimensions for that are: 5 x 0.4 x 6.5 inches.
Write 60-90 mb sec Read i forget dear
It can be used as a boot drive for your computer.
Yes, you can, but you will need three Yongnuo triggers, one for the camera and one for each one of the 2 off speedligths
A tripod...hmmm....that's for the camera. Instead, use a light stand with a hot shoe adapter to mount.
If you mean can you trigger the original 603 trigger with the 603 II, than yes it will work, they are compatible. If you are talking about the camera remote function, the cable that worked with my D7000 also will trigger my D600 shutter. I think most of the camera cables are the same for the Dxxxx series. When you get into the pro line (D3 ect.) the camera cables change. Hope that helped.
Go to "Settings" menu, then "Sound and Warnings", then 'Voice Language". Select one of the voices labeled as "TTS Voice, street names announced". If you don't have any TTS Voice options listed then the TTS files are not installed on your unit. Ask the seller for them or search for them on one of the Internet forums, such as gpsunderground.
Sorry, you can't .
Are you using analog or digital sound out?
Yes
Yes. Mine came with: Windows 8.1 64 bit.
Yes
No, this drive will not work with iphone. There are several options like this for iphone, ipod, and ipad. Just search amazon for iphone flash drive.
This case will only fit the 2014 edition 10.1.
The Trident Kraken Case does have a built-in transparent screen protector that is not removable. Thank you for your inquiry.
Yes
Yes you can run dual monitors on it. It does not really have a dedicated video card, but it has one analog d-sub connector and one HDMI connector on the back panel supplied by the Intel Graphics chip on the main board. You can also get a HDMI to DVI cable if you have a monitor that has DVI but no HDMI.
Yes, there is a CD drive. I believe it takes DVDs also. It is on the front.
I doubt it. One the best ways to increase battery life is to reduce the intensity of the display. The Kira does have a power management option, but I've never tested its ability to extend the battery life.
Our extenders work with all standard Wi-Fi routers (IEEE and Wi-Fi certified). Unfortunately there are some rare cases where our extenders may not work with non-standard routers or routers with altered firmware such as those from 3rd party sources or proprietary firmware, such as those from certain ISPs. We would need to know the model of the modem. Please call our tech support line at 888-573-8820 and a technician can determine if the unit you have works.
No, our extenders do not have a MAC filtering capability. Only our routers and access points have that capability.
Yes as the unit has the configuration saved.
it is HDMI compatible, use an HDMI MHL 1.0/2.0 adapter to connect the tablet to an HDMI device.
this is a loaded question. it depends on what you use it for, i.e. if you're going to play games from 100% to 5% you'll get maybe 4 hours. reading e-books or PDFs will get you over 6. it all comes down to what apps are running in the background, if any, your brightness, volume, vibration if any, etc. there is no definite answer.
It should work i don't see why not cause in able to mirror movies from my tab to my Xbox one to see it on my tv..maybe there's an app you can download to make it work as one
netflix has its own app and works great on the tablet. amazon prime however does not have its own app and will need to be viewed on a browser. you'll need Dolphin Browser and Adobe Flash installed and correctly configured. works fine on my tablet. here is a link on how to get it all set up: the-digital-reader.com/nates-reviews/stream-amazon-instant-videos-android-tablet/ if the adobe flash player link in that article doesn't work for whatever reason, you can download it here as well: downloadandroidfiles.org/Files/Apps%20%28APK%29/KitKat.Adobe.Flash.Player.11.1.apk
In addition to the OTG solution mentioned, you can also use a Bluetooth keyboard without any cables or adapters. (edit: after I typed this, I noticed that C. Carmona already added that info to the original answer via a comment. I'm leaving this answer in case someone doesn't notice the comment and read it).
$100 more bucks for an extra 28~gigs? ouch. might as well just buy the 32gb edition and then pick up a Sandisk 128gb SD card that comes out soon (yes, it's compatible) and get more for your money. just my opinion though!
The update lollipop galaxy tab pro 10.1 is confirmed, the upgrade is coming up
No unfortunately not. It has a wordpad kind of like the ms word starter on windows 7 but it has way less features and is annoying to use. If you want to save money download apache OpenOffice for free. You can save your documents as word files or any type of file really. It has all the features of ms office too. (PowerPoint, excel, etc.)
Don't know specifically about those titles, but my wife plays candy crush and some other jewel game from facebook all the time on it.
No. Try rebooting. Or you may need to contact Samsung.
I bought this model specifically for it coming with Win 7. I'd heard enough bad things about Win 8. You have to pay for an upgrade. or find a similar Dell with Win 8 installed.
It was on my machine. I guess the key is that it is WIN7 Professional.
Yes you can. The Brix Pro 4770R is equipped with mSata Port and SATA Port. You can put mSATA SSD into the mSATA port and HDD/SDD into the SATA port. The Wireless card that comes with the Brix is un-touched.
I don't think so. There are better ones for the gym.
Better audio, higher price. Take a look at SoundBlaster Roar. You will not regret spending a few minutes on it.
The old ones had a remote. The new SLIII does not come with a remote. I noticed aftermarket remotes exclude the new III as well. But if you turn the volume up on the speaker and down on your smartphone you kind of don't need one except for turning on and off.
Yes, you get a 3.5mm male to male cable and a micro usb to charge
Yep, Eyefinity is highly configurable. I prefer three monitors (I use 3x1680x1050), but I believe this card supports more. See http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/MultimonitorFAQ.aspx
Hard to say. I wear 7 1/4 hat and they fit well
I don't believe so as I don't see a battery camber
Yes they stay very well on the head. They are small and comfortable. Quite small as it is.
I must say sound quality is quite good. I think it has something to do with the sound canceling. I noticed that the audio was quite good and clear.
Yes
Not enough room for 3.5 & another drive. You might be able to engineer 2 of 2.5" low profile drives.
No, it doesn't have a slot for it. Also, the power supply for this new case I bought from Sentey failed three weeks back and Sentey has not replied to my request for RMA or my post on their Facebook page. Caveat emptor!!!
Yeah
It's new and has the same warranty.
Yes, it will work with the Kindle Fire HD since this model Kindle has Bluetooth capabilities. Good luck, it's a great little product.
Hi Kristopher, I wanted to follow up with you on this because it seems like there is a company on Amazon that does sell relatively inexpensive Bluetooth transmitter/splitters that will allow you to plug that transmitter into the 3.5mm jack of your device and you can then use TWO headphones at the same time wirelessly. We have had a good experience with them in our house. I hope that helps. Jacquie
It is limited as opposed to other headphones used by adults. I tried putting it on the loudest just to see how it will be if my son accidentally taps on the volume (most unlikely), and it gives a clear sound but not too loud. What I do is set the volume of the gadget to about 70% and set the iPad much lower to 40% volume.
As with all Bluetooth devices, the ear phones can only be paired with one other device at a time. Each new device requires a re-sync. However, once initially sync'ed, the devices will remember each other and a sync will occur automatically.
Yes
You can use these headphones with or without WiFi. As long as you have a headphone jack and/or bluetooth you can use these headphones.
I haven't found a dimmer switch on the radio. It was way too distracting for me until I took the time to pick a color scheme and take it out of demo mode. I drive 100+ miles a week, and if I could dim the display, I probably would, on occasion. In my buick, the location is low enough that it doesn't bother me.
There's an option on the page where you can put in your car type and it will tell you. If you can't find it look at bestbuy.Com they have the same radio and you can check on their website if it'll fit in your car.
And it's hard to down load things
Yes it did
You don't want to adapt this lens to the a6000. Get the Sony Zeiss 55mm 1.8 or the Sony 50mm 1.8. You will lose all electronic control trying to adapt this lens to the a6000. I have all of these lenses and they are all awesome.
The video camera does have a live feed option through ustream. It would technically stream through the Internet to a computer. I'm sure there is an output cable to go from the camera to the computer, but I haven't done that, so I don't know for sure.
Read and follow the instructions that came with the sound bar. I had no problem getting it programmed by following the very simple instructions.
Yup!
There is no case for this model.
yes it does
Yes. You need to update this with a firmware.
No antenna for wifi
Yes
I wasn't able to overclocked mine.
The most current operating system for this model is KitKat 4.4.
Yes it does, up to 128GB MicroSD.
Also remember that from the looks of things the 2.8 zooms will be quite a bit larger than anything we've seen to date in the XF system.
It does not. It has a place that *looks* like it could be an optical drive, but it's a solid piece of plastic, and there is no way of opening it.
Its Intel HD Graphics 4600 only have two slots for monitor: DVI and old VGA version, I guess if you want to support more monitor you need to buy a card graphic for it, and I haven't seen any switch for that outside of the case.
The XT-2 is already being sold. However as usual there is a conspiracy to keep you specifically excluded from the potential buyer pool.
I got windows 7 up without a hitch and haven't had problems with it. If it's a problem with the USB 3, have you tried the back of the machine? I'm not 100% sure, but I thought the back ports were 2.0.
Hi, you would just need to plug in wifi adapter. Networking Type Integrated Ethernet Controller Realtek RTL8111GN Data Link Protocol Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet Features Wake on LAN (WoL)
yes, we have 2 monitors set up on this computer. We had to order cords for it I think.
12 hours at least ...they do shut down after 3 hours by default you just have to push the button again to activate the speaker
Hi, Yes. It comes with the suction cup mount.
1. Warranty for one year after the customer purchase the P3. 2. The Papago US office is locate in Walnut CA, the customer can reach us through service_us@papagoinc.com or toll-free line 1-844-972-7246 (1844-9PAPAGO) 3. Yes, it's including Chinese. Thanks! PAPAGO!
Yea it's does It's not bad for the price
Yes, of course.
no,it doesn't have bluetooth
It will still only operate at the 1x slots speed. 1x can handle 250 MB/sec vs 16x which can handle 4000 MB/sec. This is fine for mining coins because you don't need the bandwidth. For actual gaming though you'd probably want to put your card into the 16x slot and not the 1x slot.
Labor 90 days,Parts 1 yr
Just one. I ordered a second one and it has come in handy while on vacation.
It does not come with MS office.
Mr. Ammon, I believe that it's Windows 8.1 Home, as there is no indication of "Professional."
You could just tighten the middle rear screw on the bottom cover and that should resolve it, if it's not we can have the unit brought in to get it resolved for you. Here is the link to set up repairs online without ever having to call in, http://customercare.acer.com/customercare/Default.aspx#_ga=1.247907972.2022145094.1423086767, or you can chat online with a technician (available 24/7) - http://acer.custhelp.com/app/chat/chat_launch#_ga=1.247907972.2022145094.1423086767
At least 1 meter. I'm tall and the cord goes all the way into my shorts pocket when I'm running.
I have a Galaxy 4 and it works fine,
No
of course, pls be assured that it would be stable.
I use this bluetooth receiver as an bluetooth receiver for my bathroom and am running this device continiously on AC without any issue.
Hi, no custom software is needed. However, your media player software on your pc, mac, or media server must support dnla / upnp.
Yes you can, it is an auto action if your sound bar is Samsung, and your TV is also. But if not just hook up to your HDMI in on the TV and HDMI out on your sound bar. Or just as easy HDMI 1 or 2, to HDMI 1 or 2 on each device.
i have not, have you looked at the OCZ site for info? http://ocz.com/consumer/ssd-guide
The handlebar mount is one and there is a helment mount also so they are sepert from each other
It can take up to a 32gb micro sd card
Hi Unfortunately it doesn't appear to come with a chest harness or strap. Thank you for your inquire. please contact me if you have any more questions.
These units include a 90 day warranty from the authorized Samsung refurbish-er.Their contact and warranty information is included with your item.
I don't think it is upgradeable to 8gb of RAM.
The laptop has an RJ-45 hard wire port for traditional Ethernet, and of course can use a wireless connection as well.
it is hard to see on the last picture, but yes it does come with VGA port.
Yes, it fits great.
Probably not it is not very roomy
As purchased, the device comes with a 120v to DC transformer. One would need to obtain the appropriate DC transformer.
8-10 hours are expected. The charging time will not be halved compared to 1A charger. This is mainly because the receiving capability of battery cells will decay towards the end of charging circle due to the nature of lithium Ion Material. The 2.1A charger will help halve the charging time when the battery pack is charged from 0-50%, but not much when charge from 50% -100%.
english
yes, package contents with iRulu tablet, keyboard case stand, Stylus Pen, English User's Manual, OTG Cable, USB Cable,iRulu AC Charger. otg cable is for connecting the keyboard or mouse to the tablet., it transfer mini usb to standard usb. And the other usb cable if for connecting to computer to copy files or charging through usb cable.
No, the cradle is not compatible
You need to set your TV's setting advance resolution to off. Then you should be able to turn 240hz on.
I'm using a Lenovo wireless USB keyboard, which works well. Haven't tried a bluetooth.
It isn't a true 4k, it uses circuitry to simulate 4k resolution. It's called upscaling
No, you cannot, I contacted Youngnuo directly and they suggested I use a Windows computer. I returned the triggers unused that day.
Yes, it does.
Obviously, check all connections. Also, the power might have been cut so you would have to reenter pswd. If you look at face of camera at night you can see if it glows red. If it doesn't the camera(s) not working. Other than that, I would need more info....
This is not a wireless system, so no wifi is needed. And you can setup the system without internet, thanks.
We are so sorry that there is no mics, thanks.
read!..someone already asked? uh
I have used the Bolse Bluetooth with Windows 8.1
The bluetooth adaptor BU-30 for the printer looks to be proprietary. I doubt this would work if you plugged it into the printer port.
A lot of pop ups, malware and I think free security software for a period. We didn't use it because we use Norton. Be prepared to spend a few hours to clean it up before you can use it, unless they have changed since the first part of this year when we ordered it. I think (not sure) it also came with a wired keyboard and mouse (also didn't use), no monitor and no extra software. Power cable, but no other cables (like for a monitor, printer) Has wireless connectivity for Internet, printer etc.
Yes, I have a Mac Pro 4,1 ( 2x2.93GHz ) running Mavericks and it was plug and play. As I had said in my review on this card a while ago, an excellent value for the price!
I'm fairly certain you can only play through one speaker through bluetooth at a time. However, this speaker is equipped with Apple's Airplay so it's possible to play through several of them using Airplay on a desktop computer. Keep in mind it is only Apple's own iTunes software on the desktop that can output the same audio to multiple AirPlay enabled speakers at the same time.
Yes
Yes
I am using a Sandisk Extreme 32GB from Amazon. New apps and downloads all to card. Upgraded OS to KitKat, works fine reading card and apps downloaded from google Play or as included by Acer.
Hi L, Sony Walkman supports MP3, WMA, AAC or L-PCM music files. All files will be played in the order you copied the files on the folder except you press Shuffle option. -Vincent
No it does not.
Yes, this is a new model which has a Mini HDMI port.
If it has been dropped. even with no visible signs of damage. Warranty is best option. If not look up how to perform factory reset, before trying warranty option.
thanks
Just get the Phantom 2, and if you are going to do "good" photography get the Gimble mount. Do not get the Phantom vision.
You will have to buy your own memory card.
Unfortunately, this card is too big for that case at 8.5 inches maximum length. The Sapphire R7 265 (which isn't a big downgrade by any means) will fit though! Happy GPU hunting! :)
Looks and feel like it made aluminum alloy. It's not plastic.
about 50cm
not sure, if its available and on amazon but you may contact the company http://www.cowboystudio.com/Articles.asp?ID=144 This is a good product with good quality materials , i would also like the option of having extra mounting plates if i want to use with other cameras .
Yes if you want to turn it on. If used as a paper weight, no.
Whomever created the listing apparently didn't know what they were doing, I guess. The images are wrong but the device is an Antminer S1
No, it is connected to a hub via a cord.
I didn't need to order any additional cables. It had everything we needed to get started. Once we settle on a configuration, we may order some longer cables, but the ones that come with it seem sufficient for our room which is about 20x20.
It comes in 1080p,3200x1800 and 4k,check the description for the resolution before u buy
I have yet to experience any coil whine. The fan can be very loud when I'm pushing the CPU (I sometimes have After Effects, Premiere, Photoshop, and Illustrator all running at the same time) but it's fairly quite in normal use.
what kind of blackberry is it? (model)
I don't know about the iPhone but the bluetooth works fine for me
Yeah the case is too thick so I had to take it off to use headphones.
It is a matte screen.
Glossy, excellent for 1920 by 1080. Still crashes at 3840 despite numerous updates
Yes it's possible. Not sure about the refresh rate.. But if you want a 2560x1440 monitor then why not just buy one of those?
1 lb
Mine has 8GB of Ram but talk to the Seller they helped me - I needed the computer in a small form case and they set that up for me - this was an outstanding seller with quick responses and easy to work with.
The system comes preloaded with Windows 7. I suppose you could wipe it out and install XP, but why? As an alternative, why not get VMware player (for free) and install XP as an alternate choice OS within the Windows 7 environment?
Yes, it does. Love this laptop!!
I have no idea what minecraft is. It has a cd (?) drive that you can put a disk in. It has several different ports to attach appliances. It is fast, very fast. If mine craft is a game, I would think it to be possible.
there is a 115v/230v switch on the actual power supply which works on a standard 120v/240v outlet. Hope it helps...
yes
Yes
This model does not come with an internal optical drive. An user would have to use an external optical drive.
if heated much, and automatically shuts off until it cools, I do not like!
It comes with a 20mm and a 10mm eye piece that gives u 15x & 30x on magnification
No
I do not see headphone jack
That effect is common to LCD TVs. Manufacturers try to compensate for a blurring that occurs when there is a lot of motion in the picture especially in sports programming. The enhancements cause a smoothing of the picture but the picture (especially faces) look a little waxy. You can eliminate that effect by turning off some or all of the picture enhancements. This will cause the picture to be more natural looking.
This is not a 3d tv at all.
Yes basically, it was advertised being 120hz, but when i got it, its only a software upgrade that makes them able to say it's 120hz, but on the screen it says 60hz even in cinema mode
Yes. My iReceiver is using the same SSID as my other iDevices and works fine.
Windows 7 is touch screen compatible by default. However you may want to get a stylus as the menus and buttons are smaller due to them being intended for a mouse.
An Android device will not relay touch when I tested this with an Android tablet. A Windows tablet does, however, as it has the necessary touch drivers for displays.
The native resolution of this monitor is 1920x1080, it sounds like you are attempting to use a resolution that is not supported by the monitor.
I have tried answering a call or pushing the "accept" button and you cannot interrupt the message cycle. However, if the caller presses "O" the box rings with a discernible tone and you can pick up the call and you can accept it and add it to the white list at that time. If you know you will be getting a call you can turn the blocker off temporarily.
Yes it does. It has a VGA port and an HDMI port. So one monitor will connect via VGA and the other via HDMI.
This computer has a HDMI and VGA output. As long as your monitor has one of these inputs you will be fine.
this has window 7 on it not 8. and I don't know if that monitor will work on it...I would guess it would unless there is no driver for windows 7 ....
Yes, it has an HDMI out port.
No
Not very good. You either get 200 false alarms per day or you set the sensitivity so low it won't detect a human 5ft away.
It doesn't have the VGA port. But if you can always use the HDMI. Make sure your computer supports transmitting "sound" to the HDMI port.
Yes.
Yes, I watch my cameras all the time on my android, phone, android tablet, and my ipod.
Yes you can use ANY standard definition cameras with this DVR
Yes, it will work with 600 TVL level Cameras. as long as they CCTV.
The DVR has different video outputs. HDMI for HD TV or Composite video out for a standard old type monitor/tv..CCTV SUPPLY...Merchant
Yes. Mine came with a 50" adjustable photo video tripod. I haven't used it yet, in fact I haven't taken it out of the box. Therefore I can't tell you much about it but it does appear to be adequate and quite compact.
Yes it is. The rapid charger. This camera uses 4 AA batteries. It kit comes with 8 AA rechargeable batteries with charger and battery storage case.
According to Anandtech.com, there is a small fan on the inside towards the front to cool things. It seems to be very quite according to the reviews.
Yes, the camera comes with a full one year warranty from Nikon USA.
I wondered the same thing but when I got the camera, there is a single battery charger included in the standard camera box
No it won't, but there are plenty others on amazon and that will fit. Just search for your specific camera, lots to choose from. Hope this helps!
Yes. Since it is Dolby certified it will pass through audio over HDMI.
I can see no reason why it wouldn't. I have run across a beach to take a short cut, and around a trail in a State Park and they show up on Google Maps after the run. It has even shown the fact that I went out on one side of the road and came back on the other, and that I zig-zagged going up a very steep hill!
Yes, Best Buy has them.
I read it can stay up to 3 months. Has been a month with me now, still working perfectly.
Not sure how many gb. But this tablet stopped working on the first day.
Great
There is a 3.5 mm jack for charging. The other end of this jack is is USB connector to be charged by a home or car charger, or computer.
Yes
No sim card slot.
pull air from inside case and exhaust out..
I didn't have any problem, but I only used it once and it took about 30 to mirror the drive.
I believe any device that supports Bluetooth audio connect (including TV's).
yes
Hi&lt; yes fit not problem
I have the same ones and they fit fine.
It is an active shutter 3D and not passive. Any kind of active shutter glasses from Sharp, Samsung or Sony will work great. Also it has a LED lighting source combined with a LCD panel to create the image.
Yes, they'll be two different wiring sustems
Yes
No, the mic stoped on me about a week or so after i got it, its not very loud either
Yes
Hi David, thanks for your interest in our products. Yes, our monitors require AC power for several reasons. The first is our products all have two spare (powered) USB ports for other USB devices, and these ports require AC power. Next, our monitors also have HDMI input and this also requires AC power. Finally, our latest product, Monitor2Go FHD has speakers (for use with HDMI) which requires AC power too. I hope this is helpful. Please let us know if you have any other questions and feel free to email us directly at contact@mmt2.com. Thanks!
It comes with Windows 7 Professional pre-loaded and Windows 8 Pro 64-bit recovery media
Yes it did.
on each leg pull the clip out sideways and that you can raise ow lower the height . i am 5'8" and at it's highest is perfect for me to stand up to look through camera . i like the sturdy platform it provides my camera . right price , good sturdy product and what more can one ask for ?
Idk exactly weight but it is pretty light.
I'm not by my computer now, but I think I accessed it through my pictures or windows photo gallery.
Yes you can. The current stable build version of CHIRP is 4.1. 4.1 does not support the TH-9800 but the daily build (beta of the next update) does support the TH-9800. So use the daily build for now and the next stable build 4.2 will likely have support for TH-9800
Yes Q6600 CPU (that is in this PC) supports virtualization technology
Water depth: 25 m Lifetime waterproof.
My suggestion as a photographer is to skip out on the cheaper camera and spending more on a intuitive camera if you can. I use this camera for snap shots. I cannot really depend on it for quickness.
fantastic you will love it
Yes
SX700 does not have GPS, it has WiFi and NFC instead. I guess the designers' idea was - if you can easily connect to your smartphone via the NFC then it would be better to use the more sophisticated GPS from your smartphone.
It should. However, I would suggest you measure first before you buy it.
No. But you don't need to. Just plug it into the USB on the front.
Yes the link Val posted is correct. You can find a grounding block at lowes, Menards, .... here. http://smile.amazon.com/CableWholesale-Single-2-5GHz-Grounding-200-278/dp/B00CLFGH40/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1406687178&sr=1-1&keywords=rg6+grounding+block What you do is connect the RG6 cable to it run a copper wire to it then to a ground point. Some examples of grounds would be metal gas piping on outide of house (you can buy a pipe clamp to connect dont drill into pipe), grounding rod, or copper water lines to name a few. Also make sure you have your tv connected to a surge protector power strip that is UL rated.
ordered 2 outside antennas neither one performs as advertised claims 125 mile reception. I am 50 to m75 miles from 2 major cities, and I am lucky if I can receive 4 stations had a old indoor antenna in fla and had all major networks. had 40 stations. am very unhappy with the 2 I ordered from amazon.
Yes, our version is the only one that has a full size Backlit keyboard included. Regards, LGI Electronics. HP Authorized Reseller
No it does not have a back lit key board. Just purchased a week ago. But its a fast laptop. And i wasnt planning on working in the dark.
This is very poor quality laptop. Mine broke within several weeks.
Yes. On the front of the computer, just above the Dell decal to the left is a small black rectangle button with the "Eject" symbol. The tray is vertically oriented above that behind the tall vertical rectangle on the left, and pops out. The tall vertical rectangle on the right side also flips out to reveal USB ports and headphone/mic jacks.
You would have to cut it off. You don't need to do that though the built in screen protector is better than the stick on kind.
Any standard 5.25" drive (x2) fits.
yes
Yes
This is probably the best money ever spent on anything electronic. This card has no problem playing arma 3 and skyrim on ultra settings. This card will definitely play dc universe easily.
Hold button for 3 secs to turn on. Click once for pics. Hold til green light flashes 3 times for recording. Plug charging cord into USB port to review data.
If your asking is it strong enough for the weigh of the lights and or Umbrellas, the answer is yes... I have a roll of 8 different backdrops on mine and they weigh approx. 20 pounds and I have no sag in the bar at the 10 foot width... Just make sure that the outside poles are straight up and down... Set one of the tripod stands so that one leg is under or inline with the top pole for better support...
The smallest would be about 5 feet. There are 4 crossbars each a little under 3 feet. So in your case I would just connect the two crossbars that attach to the stand to get about 5 feet wide.
Yes
I dont know
Hi, this Sony Cybershot DSCWX350 do have a feature to transfer images to your iPhone or iPad via Wi-fi connection. This can be done by using the PlayMemories Mobile app and this must be installed on your iPad. -Ely
3.5 x 2.1 x 1
Hi Sudbury, yes, you can charge the battery outside the camera. We recommend using the travel charger BC-TRX. Thanks_Mitch
No software CD is included - not necessary - when you plug the camera included USB into your computer the first time, your plug & play will recognize the camera. Follow instructions to download software if needed, or just remove the SDHC memory card ( which is NOT included - you need to purchase one, 8 - 16 GB is good, about $8-$16) then insert it into your memory slot on most newer computers/laptops and then move the photos to your desired location.
It is an e-mount frame. So any lenses that are e-mount will be just fine. A-mount lenses will work too with an adapter.
This sony has a very fast focusing. Closest to a dslr that i have seen. Lens selection though isn't as good as the Nikon dslr line.
Hi H.E., this Sony Alpha a6000 is a good camera for low light situation. It has an ISO range of 100-25600 giving less noise due to its Exmor CMOS sensor and BIONZ X processor. As for the lens, any wide angle Sony lens will do. -Ely
Hi, Macro settings for this camera is under the Scene Recognition under the Intelligent Auto Mode and it is automatically assigned by the camera. -Ely
Yes, this is the successor to the NEX 6 and 7, at least for the time being. There is no A7000 or higher model currently publicly announced, and while there could be in the future, it is merely speculation at this point. If you are looking to upgrade your NEX 7 now, this is the model.
Yes, but you need upgrade your PS4 to latest firmware.
yes works well...no issues seen. follow the directions from sony hdd upgrade and get the larger file...think it was 500mb or so....for new drive install.....do hate how you cant back anything up on ps4 except game saves...so you have to redownload everything....i had a god 60+ gb
Hey Jeremy! We've found that we can go as far as 20 feet from our unit, and it works fine, but that's the limit. If we go further, it cuts in and out. A safe distance would be 15 feet. Good luck! :)
The mic is included.
No it does not.
The camera comes without this option.
No it will not fit. This case is tailor cut to the exact measurements of the phantom 2. It will work with the original landing gear and a gimbal with gopro mounted. Also, you would not be able to modify the packing to fit because the height. There isn't enough clearance to accommodate 40mm additional height. I am using this with retractable landing gear and that works extremely well because the footprint is the same as the original.
It should fit perfectly
Yes it does, because I have the Roku 3.
you don't have to mount it, i did it because i like things neat and organized, and i already have too many things on my entertainment system, and it's nice that this can be sort of 'hidden'
Hi Mary, Thanks for your question. The Apple remote works well with both TotalMount versions in rooms with regular-height ceilings. If your TV is in a room with a two-story ceiling, then I would recommend TotalMount Shelf (because TotalMount Shelf does not rely on the remote's signal bouncing off the ceiling). All the best, Innovelis Engineering
They're the same thing. Led is just the type of backlighting the TV has. It's still an LCD.
Librarylegend, Yes, Amazon Prime is compatible with this model. Thanks for your interest in Samsung televisions. --Mr. S
It is matte. The review on CNET says that the t.v. does a good job in bright rooms.
The swiveling "quad-stand" is 22" wide and 10 1/2"deep.
I have 4 ps4's and am a hardcore console gamer. I could notice the difference between game mode and non-game mode. The lag without game mode is 44 and I looked it up and found several different answer for when in game mode. One website claimed 18, another 27. Whatever it is it's really low, because I definitely have the upper hand now.
indeed you can! Also photos from your computer along with the music. That's often how I relax.
Yes
un55fh6030 if it is still available. 2013 model.
Yes, it has Windows 7 Professional installed; however, the back-up disc, should reinstallation be required, is Windows 8 "upgrade."
Yes, as advertised through Panasonic, the 4K video stills pull out as 8MB image files, basically a high res JPEG.
It is shiny and smooth. I use it for work and absolutely love it. =]
Yes
Mine came with Windows 7. That is exactly why I bought it. My only complaint is that the sound is not that great.
Yes
Yes, they do. Search for your laptop model and 'replacement screen".
Yes it comes with Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit. Thanks, PCrush
It's supposed to work with all the US carriers, but I'm not sure about sprint. I have only tested it with Verizon, however.
Yes it will..... but you will need a radio mounting kit cause the radio is a single din and the original factory radio is a double......... but yes your all in the clear :-)
No you have to purchase the wire harness adapter and dash mounting kit and antenna adapter separate cause each car requires different adapters and wiring harnesses
No, just one each. I was curious too, so I just double checked.
Yes. Lens retracts and is covered when powered down.
Yes
Yes, Russian is included.
No.....the latest model nikon 5300 hace built in Wi-fi...forma this modelo a nikon adapter is required
No warranty from Nikon. This is a grey market item, no seller wants to answer the question !
I don't know. Check their website. Not had any issues with their items.
Nope, not this model
Yes, it's the same! the p340 use micro USB, but you can only charge whit a NIKON cable.
The scene modes for the camera are as follows: Back Light, Beach, Black and White Copy, Close Up, Dusk/Dawn, Easy Panorama, Fireworks Show, Food, Landscape, Museum, Night Landscape, Night Portrait, Party/Indoor, Pet Portrait, Portrait, Scene Auto Selector, Snow, Sports, Sunset
Should be 25 to 750.
Yes you don't need GPS or WIFI turned on to use the camera. I always leave my GPS off as it can drain the battery faster. I also leave the WIFI off unless I am transferring pictures to my phone.
I have not taken pictures from a kayak but I have taken a lot at the beach and on boats in the sun and have never had an issue viewing the images.
The P-600 lens has 52mm threads for a filter, but the threads are not standard type lens threads. The threads are a segmented plastic. I have mounted different type filters on my lens and they all remained mounted, but the slightest bang or jarring will knock the filter off. This has happened to me three or four times already. I looked at the same model camera in Costco and it has the same type of filter thread. So just be careful with it. This lens arrangement is unlike all the other Nikon lenses I have for my D4.
The Coolpix p600 takes great pictures of birds!
60X zoom is the optical zoom while 42X zoom is the digital zoom.
The most important difference is the lense 34X. The rest, both cameras are fine. Ral
One year USA limited warranty.
The camera is about 4x2 x 1inch thick. It is a little thicker than my other Nikon cameras probably because of the waterproof casing.
I am using a 64GB
Yes, this has a touch screen as indicated by the "T" at the end of the ASUS part number (and the index finger touching the screen in the photograph).
No, but you can get a Bluetooth keyboard for it. I got a cover/keyboard combo.
ASUS sells a device called Miracast Dongle which plugs into your TV's HDMI port. You can then stream from your tablet to your TV.
You would need an invertor for it.
As far as I know you can use a blu-ray burner to burn non blue ray cds. Also in all probability you'll never need 32GB of memory.
Yes
It should. The player has a USB port and should play MP4 formats.
You will need a cord connection to your TV and a wired or wireless connection to the internet.
No. You have to buy a new base
No
The camera supports ddns and only requires a fixed IP address within your own intranet so that its identity isn't changed by the DHCP in your router every time you turn on your computer. No, Sharx does not have their own DDNS servers. Sharx has a very responsive tech service and would be happy to answer questions.
No - Does have a great field of vision
None.
There is no maximum SD memory you can use.
Yes. It has two, actually.
Actually it should work. ASUS Miracast also works with Samsung Note phones and tablets. Miracast is Miracast.
Don't bother, it doesn't work!! Windows doesn't have more compatibility with those devices
Hit the pro logic button on the remote.
Try this....turn both devices off and then back on. Enable Bluetooth on samsung first making sure to make it discoverable to unpaired devices. Then turn keyboard on and activate Bluetooth looking for it from Samsung. Try to activate them one after the other'
FN + volume + / -,thanks !
Unfortunatly there is a distortion...
Don't know exactly. It didn't have enough sound for me so I returned it.
The battery life is honestly 40 hours!! And its waterproof, sandproof, mudproof!! The one big downside was the volume is poor. Unless you are in a quiet room this might not be your speaker. I could not hear it on a boat or on a private plane very well. Volume felt low at the beach. Might have 6 drivers but max volume leaves a lot to be desired.
Sometimes. It depends. I noticed that when I walk away with my smartphone from the speaker it would automatically shuts off because it's not getting the bluetooth signal from the smartphone. The smartphone has to be within 30' range to rceive the signal. Personally, I wouldn't worry about it because the battery life is good up to 48 hours.
Yes it can! There is a setting for loud mode on the speaker that will up the volume by a considerable amount. This is the loudest and best speakers I have ever tried (eg. Soundlink mini) But if budget is not an issue. I recommend you purchasing the XL version.
30 feet is about the norm for most bluetooth speakers,I have found this to be the with my fugoo speaker.
No, you will have to contact the manufacturer or it will void the warranty of the device.
It has 3 usb ports
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=ca&dlc=en&docname=c04077065&lc=en&jumpid=reg_r1002_caen_c-001_title_r0004
No
I do not see the usual red, yellow, white rca ports on the back no.
yes you can open it with the remote.
Laptop and cord
you can but this will not run minecraft well. if you need help finding a better laptop, let me know. tomorrow they should have some good sales and you should be able to get a pretty good laptop at decent prices.
I do not know about which came first, a question better answered by the manufacturer. I bought this for my 12 year old and they have enjoyed it. I have tried to do a manual install of Google play and services and so far it has been unsuccessful. Amazon was on it however.
Yes, this battery comes with around 20 interchangeable connector tips. Best regards BiXNet
Yes, sure. It fits perfectly. Thanks!
don't know, I got rid of it because it doesn't support many of the apps I use
Headphone jack: 3.5 mm standard headphone jack. I just use a regular cheap set of ear bud earphones with mine.
Apparently I can, but have not tried, although the Amazon links do seem to be working for movies, Tv shows etc.
70xseven, The "voice" tracks for most movies is usually found in the center channel. You can adjust the volume for each speaker independently, so if you want more voices, turn up the center channel (or turn down the other channels), and you'll be able to get the mix you're looking for. Center channel is usually assigned to voices. Left and Right front speakers are usually reserved for sound effects and music. Left and Right rear speakers are not always used (at least as much as the front R/L speakers), and are for surround effects. Does that help? --Mr. S
Yes it has DVD drive: Multiformat DVDRW/CD-RW drive with double-layer support - Records up to 8.5GB of data using compatible DVD+R DL and DVD-R DL media.
Joel, Yes, this server has 6x 3.5 inch SAS/SATA hard drive bays. They will accept hard drive capacities up to 2TB each. The Certified Servers team appreciates your consideration.
Hey Josh, The 2950 II should be able to run ESXi5.1
No
Yes, the unit will run on the battery. If the unit is on continuous recording, the power last about 4 hours. If it is in stand-by, motion detection mode, you should be good for 10-12 hours.
Hi, Thank you for contacting us we are a small company so our customers are very important to us however the disk should work with any pc
It does not surprise me that you are having problems. Mine was non functional and I returned it.
I used the online video to help. Yes, the instructions are hard to read and understand... that's why the seller made a video. It's pretty easy to understand from there. Go to YouTube and search "Enko 4 in 1".
screen dimensions are 34" wide ..... 20 3/4" high dimensions mounted on base are 22 1/4" high ...... 9" deep from screen to back of base ...... 3" from screen to front of base .... base measures 19" x 8 1/4"
Yes
The screen is 38.5 inches..all tv***
Yenner, Try switching to the HDMI input, and input the following: MENU &gt; System &gt; General &gt; Game Mode Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Go CNET's tweak guide. Works good.
turki, Models sold in the U.S. region supports the 110V/60hz standard. Thanks for your interest in Samsung televisions. --Mr. S
It includes the One Connect port for future upgrades. Contrary to rumor, it does not include any external one connect devices, since this model already has the latest HDMI spec (2.0) built in.
Thank you for your inquiry. The 65HU8550 is indeed 240Hz Motion Flow and actually has 1200 Clear Motion with the enhanced video processor. We hope you will consider The High Definition Store.
Yes.... my TV fits on top of a Bureau that is only 39 inches wide. However, I have the 65" version. The TV stand is made such that the TV can sit on anything 3 feet (36 inches) or wider. I'm sure the 75" will fit on a surface 51" wide. It's a great TV! Fantastic Picture. Don't bother spending double on a 4K... no need.
what is BDI Arena 7790? you mean the TV bracket? I bought the TV bracket Samsung WMN4277SH.
Yes i have it on this one OLLO: UltraFlat-XL: 60-80" Heavy Duty Low Profile TV Wall Mount Bracket, 220 Pound Capacity, Auto-Lock Arms, Baked Enamel Finish
Yes it does, I have my custom built antenna hooked directly in to the back of the TV. Cant beat amazing HD quality for free!!!
Works fine. No issues.
I just received my UN55H7150 this morning.... imagine my surprise to find that the wall mount holes on the tv ARE NOT THREADED! The manual says to wall mount the tv, I will need to call Samsung and order a Wall Mount Adapter kit for this tv. There were NO ADAPTERS included in the box with the television. Adapters are only included on 65" televisions and larger... Very frustrating!
I have the Xbox, no lag at all. It looks great, the TV is the best
Anthony Baldwin, For 2014 models, only OLED models will support the Dual View feature as described above. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
No. Only on the menu page.
Depends on your specs, and what you currently have. CS:GO most likely it will, unless you have a 660, 760, or higher.
The 750 does not support SLI.
I took a quick look at your motherboard and as long as you have a PCI Express slot available you should be good. According to a couple of sites and the picture I saw you have 2 pci slots on this board. so, vacant slot and you should be good.
The cable is 6 feet long.
Dear Lance, The UN65H8000 has 1080p upscaling but not 4K upscaling. 4K is higher resolution. Eric C
I'll look and report back. I just opened it this past week after having it for some time.
Yes
I don't have the device anymore, but not that I can recall
no
Look at the model number, the last 4 numbers are 3xxx. the original titan is 2xxx
You are able to install 4 of the EVGA GTX Titan Black graphics cards on the ASUS Rampage IV Black Edition motherboard. The Rampage IV Black Edition supports 4-way nVidia SLI in a x16/x8/x8/x8 configuration and the Titan Black graphics cards have dual slot coolers the same as the GTX 780 so all four will fit.
Your card should not be shutting down on you unless you have it OC'd beyond your cases ability to cool the card, or if the card is defective. I recommend testing you card at stock settings, otherwise send it back.
I really don't know. However, after looking at it much closer it appears that the lens is either 'glued' or 'screwed' to the chip. The assembly is very fragile, i.e., one wire neede to be re-soldered...I don't want to mess with it anymore. If you would like I can send you a jpeg close-up for your perusal.
Yup, I use it to charge my cellphone while I'm working /surfing the Web. I can have my phone close by not have to take away outlet space from my power strip. Also the remotes that come with the screens can operate other Samsung TVs as well.
There is a button located beneath the screen above the pedestal. To increase volume you slide it right and left. For further options you press and a menu is available to turn off tv you must press and choose the button indicated for power.
No, you cannot play music through the speaker. Its only downfall. Overall, a great clock.
Yes. One.
Hi! I have not configured this router on a UNIX/Linux OS. System requirements on the box state that this router is UNIX and Linux compatible.
A 28" screen means that is the diagonal measurement of it. In other words, the measurement from the upper left corner of the screen down to the lower right corner of the screen. The 26" width would be the measurement from the lower left corner to the lower right corner of the monitor itself.
Darrell Holland, The VG-STC2000 will not be compatible with the UN40ES6100 - only the UNxxES6500 and up models for 2012 will support this keyboard. That said, you can still use a USB keyboard. Some wireless keyboards may also work, but we can't guarantee compatibility. For wired keyboards, we recommend a HID-compliant device. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Yes you can
According to reader reviews, which you should read by the way, it is not VESA compliant ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Display_Mounting_Interface ). One user reviewer wrote the he/she resorted to using Gorilla glue to attach a monitor holder with holes.
I believe it can but you have to buy a separate wall mount. I think the Amazon page links you to wall mounts for that particular display.
Yes, and WiFi router at that
I've had 6 connected. The network map page has a pagination widget but I've never had enough devices to start a second page. So I'm guessing it can support a lot more than 6.
If you click ignore you should be able to see what you've recorded. If after you click ignore it still will not allow you to access your file, you may need to plug in your GoPro device to your PC via a USB cable. sorry, I'm not familiar with a GoPro. Thank you
I have and I did. The problem I always ran into was when I tried to connect Bluetooth keyboard and mouse separately. It always caused extreme lag or "ghost typing"... For now this is the best option to have both keyboard and a mouse pad via one Bluetooth connection
AFAIK - The "Reseller Kit" includes: -Mini-DVD Driver / Utility Disk -Short, high-speed SATA Cable -Adapter Bracket to mount this drive into standard Desktop Drive Bays (Drive-Only probably does not include this stuff - but you can download the software and most modern PC Cases / drive cages have spots for mounting small drives like this one, as long as you can dig-up the screws that you'll need.) No idea about HK Warranty - check Intel's Global Website, they're pretty thorough...
It should not if it is a digital TV. That is what I used it on and it works just fine. If it is an old analog I think you will need a box.
Yes, it gets FM/VHF/UHF band.
No it doesn't.
Yes this stereo/receive is very easy to control both...
Thanks for your question. Search High Resolution music files and you will find many sites to purchase and download music files such as HDTracks. This is a fantastic sounding receiver. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Astell & Kern dealer.
Dear Zheng, Thanks so much for your inquiry. I have not seen anything to indicate that the AK240 limited edition gold version is available in the U.S. at this time. Please let me know if I can be of any additional assistance with your selection! Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo
The Anker 7-port hub works fine with mine.
I am a 5'7" male with small-average hands and this mouse is a little big for me. But I still love it.
I have and you can bind the two buttons to controls just go into controls and click them and then click one of the side buttons
It was not enough to cover a 17"...just a 15" laptop
Dear Sir or Madam, The footage limitations of this speaker is 10m under no obstacles. If it meets door or wall, the signal will get weak. Thanks. Best regards.
Yes
No they are not. In fact I am extremely disappointed with this purchase. They are hardly appropriate for any type of activities. Even simply sitting around causes them to fall from your ears.
I have an Xperia Z1 and it connects without any problems. I also had a Z1 previous to this one and it had problems connecting to WiFi that my current z1 does not have. Try fiddling with smart connect app p... Sorry I can't help you further than that.
My husband said it does have an internal battery but it probably won't save for more than a few minutes. Hope that was helpful.
Yes
There was no camera cutout on mine, but it doesn't interfere with the camera function at all.
Yes, works fine
Not sure what you mean... For one, the phone isn't waterproof, but it is water-resistant. The screen protector won't affect how well the phone resists water... It will protect the screen in the event of a drop tho.
In some cases depending on the layout of the home you may need more than one internal panel antenna. The Quint is probable the best booster in its class. If you have never installed one of these make sure to call the manufacturer for guidance, they are awesome and very helpful. They will actually help you through the design phase so that you get exactly what you need. They will also make sure that if you are too far from the tower you don't waste your money.
No
yes this device have to have wi-fi connection to work
Nothing just the tablet.
Yes it does. We have installed a USB mouse and 0 issues.
No
Actual dimensions are 34 and 3/4" inches wide for the screen and the stand is two feet on the bottom that are 32" to the center of the feet exactly. The outside edges of the feet measure 32 and 3/4". Hope this helps. It is a great TV by the way!!
Depends. Check the internal width of the caninet and the external width of the cabinet. Ours needed 35 inches and even then the door hinges create a problem. We have to slide the TV around to open and close the slide in doors.
Yup! That and about 10 more services. And Skype!
it's a multisystem
No headphone jack. Only a optical digital audio output to connect to an audio system or sound bar. By the way, I also have an older 47LN5700 which does have a headphone jack. That jack on the older TV is very similar to a connection on the 32LB5800, but is labeled "service only" on the newer one.
No, only one of these units is capable of holding and playing a DVD. The second unit is dependent on the main unit. I think there might be other models out there that have 2 units that can work either independently or in tandem, but this is not one of them.
I think so
It comes with it. Part of the remote control
No
I have bought at buydig.com with USA warranty. You have to ask the company you want to order from. As far as I know many sell grey market items, but to be sure ask them.
Turn the volume up on your iPhone and turn the volume up on the aquasound. To turn the volume up on the aqua sound press and hold down the fast-forward button.
Yes
AC 100 - 240 V ~ 50 / 60 Hz
Glossy but not extremely so -between matte and glossy but definitely on the glossy side. Very pleasant.
Sort of. I'm not sure what it is based on. I was trying to watch a streaming video on a web site, and the full screen button on the player wouldn't work.
I have not tested it "under water" as it clearly states not to submerge in water. It does work great in my shower though.
I bought the LG AN-VC500 and installation was a breeze. Works well with skype.
No. 38 inches apart.
Yes, it is 120Hz.
Yes
Of course.
Not bad as long as you put it on a solid surface. Would be better if it had velcro or something to keep it folded. It slips open occasionally and falls down with slightest bump. Like I said in my review, it is hard to fault it too much for the price!
Sorry but No it is not it's fixed focus. That's why it so cheap to buy. But it is still a great buy because you still get a good video or picture out of it.
yes, that should work fine.
It's pretty good. If just a few walls, it should be no, problem.
impossible. its big and heavy.
U can change them its clear and bass is powerful
yeah this model does have a CD/DVD drive
yes!
According to the specs listed on the HP site, this model has a 64 bit operating system. http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c04067860&cc=us&dlc=en&lc=en
No
Yes, but the connection is loose in the back and it doesn't stay plugged into unit. Had this on two different units so know it is a flaw in design.
Not a good value. Sound quality is very poor, selector switch detents are too close together, and of poor quality. You can scroll up and down the songs. Simple to operate.
It works with a wireless mouse and cell phone connected. However when I connected a hard drive as an added peripheral, the mouse stopped working. So it is fine but cannot support anything that pulls much power
It is not good enough.
Yes you can. Actually do it from cell phone.
Yes, that's what I've been using for recharging this.
No, it is a repeater. They are made to be away from the router to repeat the signal further.
No, only 110v.
Matte.
I called EVGA...customer service rep confirmed that the PSU has a 10 year warranty. Gl.
No, it does not.
No it does not.
This comes with ASUS warranty already.
This one comes with Windows 8.1-64bit.
Have not used on jogging stroller but used on a bicycle, works great, very well pleased with it! Great sound
It comes with the HRM-Run
Yes, you can
There is only one you can us. It's the big sim. The other slot is for a memory card or if the unit battery is low it will not work. I had that problem at first.
Yes
Yes it does and my kids love it.
No. It has only one position.
Yes, but not as expected. The sound quality is not so good
Sorry, I can't answer that question specifically...but I did want to say that the noise cancelation for talk is horrendous almost to the point of making the headset useless. The magnetic bluetooth connect on/off works about 50% of the time. I emailed Jabra about the noise cancelation with no response.
we purchased the 1905-02 for our Ipad Air, works like a charm. No camera viewing issues at all.

Dear Cav949, Thanks for your inquiry. The RX-V677 supports the 2.4 Ghz band only. Please let me know if I can be of any additional assistance. Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo
The remote uses IR to control the receiver. I would just make sure that your enclosure does not obstruct line of sight between remote and the IR-receiver (front of unit)... If you're connected through wi-fi, you could just use the android/iOs app and not worry about line of sight issues.
If your turntable does not have an internal preamp, then you will need an external phono preamp prior to input into one of the audio inputs on the receiver. Decent ones are available for about $50: http://www.amazon.com/ART-II-Preamplifier-Outputs-Switchable/dp/B000AJR482

15.6 Screen, PRO'S Fast boot, Cons. low contrast may be able to adjust, I haven't tried yet. Great computer. Hope that helps. Steve
Yes, it does.
No. There are some days I am unable to access the internet at all. Frequently when I am connected, service is turned off. Rarely can I see entire films or tv shows on Youtube or Netflix. A year ago there was unlimited access, but no more. Clear Internet is only concerned with making a profit and delivering poor service. I am seeking another internet provider.
Thanks for your interest in this camera. We only sell USA models. We do not sell any gray market units.
No benefits unless you're Australian.
The shell of MSI GE Apache is metal.
16GB DDR3L (8GB x 2)
You will want to contact MSI directly for the repair. They do include accidental damage on this model so it may be covered under that, but they do require that you registered for that within 30 days of its ship date.
Yes the screen is not like glass. So it does not reflex. I am currently running 1920x1080
Yes that should fit. I don't have anyway to personally test it, but from what I am seeing, it should fit.
It's has a fan turbo mode. And I also habe a small USB fan that I sit behind it as an exhaust. But no troubles with heat
It does if you get this exact model and they have not changed the specs.
Not sure, but this beast of a machine has plowed though everything I have thrown at it at max settings, so speed shouldn't be a problem for quite a long time to come.
No, it does not.
AC is also supported. The Amazon tech spec options have not been updated since this is a fairly new standard.
Not bad enough to not purchase this unit. It seems like the resolution is high and just need to adjust settings. Just search a bit via Google and you will see people complain about the touch pad. This is a great laptop - worth every bit of the cost.
Yes you will get both.
It has a one year DELL warranty against defects. I had a deal with DELL for a 48 month extended warranty when I built my Alienware. You can also buy a warranty that is backed by Amazon but sold thru a third party that would fit your needs. You may be able to get the extended manufacturer warranty offered thru DeLL even though you purchased it here. I would call DeLL first to get a definite answer.
The cord it comes with is for charging the external battery. I have a iPhone 5s that uses a lightning cable you have to use your own. &#128516; hope that helps.
Yes
It has a matte finish. Its not susceptible to glass glare coming from a light source.
Honestly i never tried it, but i think it should work!
The U.S. model is 110V only, but you can use it with batteries while you are outside the U.S.
It has a nail slot on the back. One nail holds it up!
Hello Arthur, Yes, the EX100 will work with your Droid Maxx. The EX100 uses a standard 3.5mm jack which is compatible with the standard audio port on the Droid Maxx. If you have any other questions please feel free to contact Alpatronix Customer Service and we will be more than happy to help. Alpatronix Customer Service may be reached by email at support@alpatronix.com, or by phone at 1-888-407-7515. Customer Service hours are Monday - Friday, 9am - 5pm.
No
1 year, the one I purchased seems to have a faulty graphics card so I am only getting a white screen. Get back your money.
Yes
Hello! Anthony. it not come with a international warranty. Its a excellent laptop. Thanks
Hi! Well this computer definitely has worked great for me, even though I just bought it. I use it mostly for programming and running heavy programs that use a lot of RAM and processor memory. The extras seem to be worth the $155, touch screen , 250gb more, 2 more cores and 3.5 mhz instead of the 2.7 of my Satelite one will make a lot of difference! I say, if you have the cash, go for it! You'll definitely love it and the touch screen will make it a lot easier to use. :)
Yes you can, matter of fact you can plug your Cell Phone in via USB and access your songs that are stored on your phone via SD Card
it is ready to play with 4k tv i don not have one so i can tell you for sure
Yup, its touchscreen
Yes, you can charge the keyboard with the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 power jack. It also came with a separate USB cord.
No
Yes it comes with a head sink so no need to find another one.
yeah! you can fit a water bottle in there really nicely, and you can make the pocket tighter as well. so i guess most sizes would fit
Nope. It did not have pen with it.
Yes and no. This specific card won't work because it's generic. For lenovo, intel builds special cards with a unique lenovo product number. It's called "bios lock whitelist" or something like that in some technical posts. Look for the same model number but where it specifically says "works with lenovo". Now, there is a second issue. Lenovo must sell your laptop with this card somewhere so your bios has a whitelist entry for this card. Lenovo only white lists wifi cards they put into their product.
Yes
Very good, 5 hours, come with cable
Provided you have a 240V USB charger, I don't see why not. This charges using a standard USB adapter.
Most apps and games that charge require user information and consent.
It came with a 1 year manufacturer warranty. We actually used it because one of my boys broke his. We have triplet 2 1/2 year old boys. So they can be really hard on things. We sent it in and they replaced it at no charge. Also, once you buy it, go to their website and register it. It will prompt you to write a product review online, and they will extend your warranty another 3 months. Pretty awesome!
yes, it is compatible but it runs slow. I don't know if it is a working memory issue. However, overall this is a GREAT product!!
110/240 volt compatible
Yes, there are 2 ports that are super chargers and do charge much Easter.
As far as I can see the drive is normal laptop type drive in an external case. The setting appear to allow for a region code set.
The wireless card is: Intel Dual Band AC 3160 802.11 A/AC/B/G/N 2.4/5.0GHz + Bluetooth 4.0 Up to 433Mbps (2x2) We will ask Amazon to update this listing.
The back of my sound bar has an "Opt In" for the optical cable, a LAN port (although it connects to Wi-Fi), and an HDMI out to run the same apps which come with the LG TV. We use the Optical cable through the Opt In port. The volume is controlled by the remote that came with the sound bar. We don't use the HDMI port out, there is no "In HDMI" port on the bar. I hope this helps, good luck!
You can't downgrade through Window itself. If you have a valid license you can install it. I upgraded mine to Win 8.1 Pro. It, like all Windows flavors is much better than the home versions. Win 8 does take some getting used and I dislike the home version. Unless you specificly need Win 7 I'd recommend upgrading to Win 8.1 Pro.
I purchased this computer 4 months ago. I am a gamer and play old school Everquest and can run multiple characters at one time. No overheating issues and no lag
No, not this model.
Not absolutely sure but I don't think its compatible. Check with manfrottos to make sure.
It is ABS Plastic hard keys. Please go ahead to buy one. Thanks
Yes, It is pretty amazing. We have to turn it way down sitting next to it and trying to talk. We have use it on our deck during a party and the volume work well.
Turn it off or stop not auto
No it is not. A/c powered with very small brick adapter.
No because it's soldered on
I don't have the BF-F8+ yet, but I'm using the Baofeng UV-5R+ (prior model) for 2m 1200AFSK packet operation with a Kantronics tnc. The Baofeng ht + Kantronics tnc combination works better for me then another radio with internal tnc.
Yes
This product has a one year limited warranty and is entitled to parts, labor and courier service. Service is available Monday-Sunda y, except holidays. Many parts can also be delivered to you using the Customer Replaceable Unit (CRU) method.
Yes they have a driver for vista available on their website.
This product does not work on a Mac. Not sure about Linux. There are other products made by Diamond Media that do work on a Mac.
Yes, it fits larger computers than that
any PSU that will fit in the case is a micro ITX or mini ITX . I have a mini ITX Motherboard which is the smaller of the two, and there is ample room for all your stuff in there. ENJOY. I put a 450 watt one in mine, with a ZOTAC MoBo and I am very happy with it.
Power Specs: AC Input: 115/230v Current 7A/4A Frequency: 50Hz/60Hz DC Output: -12v -5v +5v +12v +3.3v +5VSB Full Load: 0.5A 0.5A 13A 8A 8A 2A Connectors: (1) Motherboard 20+4Pin (1) CPU+12v 4Pin (2) SATA (3) Molex (1) Floppy
no
Yes
I doubt it.
I'm assuming there's a typo here... The MacBook Pro was not released until 2006. Prior to that, Apple made a similar laptop called the PowerBook G4... which would not be compatible with this drive. All MacBook Pros, excluding the "Retina" models, will work with this drive.
Yes, it will fit.
Yes, two screws were included. I took a picture of the drive and the packaging before I installed the mSATA drive. They were tiny, but they were the proper size for my motherboard.
did a bit of googling to verify that it's msata and yes from what i have found this would work
Yes. It works just great.
If you have the rca tablet, this is the only thing you'll need, as long as you could still see the regular screen underneath still working. There's a very good video on YouTube that shows exactly how to install this touch screen, I think it's called; RCA Tablet Glass Digitizer/Touchscreen Replacement, hope this helped
It will work perfectly and all you have to do is put that orange strap in that is attach to the screen
I would select the one at the lower price , be it the Crucial or Samsung. Both are good drives and I'll bet you couldn't tell the difference between the two unless you ran benchmark software that told you one was faster. I have several different brand/size/speed drives and on a day-to-day basis there is no observable change in performance. Once you get a SSD you will be happy.
Hi, Thank you for contacting us, yes this USB works with Androide OS Lollipop 5.1 and will work with Micromax. Best regards, Silvia Brosspc
At first, I had a problem with the lens coming off when I removed the lens cap. Now I have no problem. Yes the lens cap can be attached with the filter.
Yes
Why don't you read the specs on this and then you would not have any questions. UV filter (ultraviolet) for protection against dust, dirt, scratches, fingerprints and the sun's ultraviolet rays. Circular Polarizing Filter. Used to increase color saturation, like darkening blue skies so that white clouds stand out. FL-D filter (fluorescent) for taking pictures indoors under fluorescent lights. This filter removes the greenish tint given off by fluorescent lighting. Compact protective carrying case for transporting and storing your set of filters. 10 year warranty
Silver all.
I just received mine and it also only lights up on the 2.4A port.
Yes
Not sure. Mine wouldn't work at all
This adapter fits a normal usb cord. We use it for our S5, ipod, & kindle.
I use this on my Apple products. As I understand Samsung uses 1.0A and this boost has 2 ports one is 2.4 and the other is 2.0. You may want to look the max amp charge for your device on the internet using google. I am sure some one has posted it. Good luck.
On my two year old HTC amaze the mic works but not the volume controls or song skipping. Works with my iPad fine.
I have the kit and Netflix works fine for me.
Yes it comes out as easy as it went in, I do however recommend two people for placing it on the wall.
Lance Rubel, 400x400mm for the 65" model will be the correct hole placement. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Yes but I would have liked it to be an inch closer to wall. Not too bad, about 2".
These are still the GTX 765M models.
There are 2x 128GB mSATA SSD + 1TB HDD
You can send us a message with the specific upgrades you'd like, like how much more memory, storage requests, and any other requests. We can get you a price and list the configuration on Amazon for you to order.
yes it is
No. This is an add-on to an ASUS motherboard meant for a standard PC case. The Mac Pro's motherboard won't be compatible with it.
I believe that card only works on certain Asus motherboards so you need to verify that which ever Asus board you choose supports it.
I am using the ASUS Z-97-Deluxe motherboard and it comes with the TB-II card. I do not use Drobo, but I do use several different Seagate GoFlex Thunderbolt adapters and they work flawlessly. One minor hitch though; you must set the bios to permit the TB adapter to use any device connected (it asks permission to access the device, and this is not reliable for all devices). It is important that you pair either the TB-I or -II cards with a "certified" motherboard to guarantee that it will work; see the ASUS web site.
I took it to the pool and did some laps with it. It would work sporadically, it matters how deep your head goes underwater And how far the device is. I hung my phone in a bag midway thru the lap and that helped with distance. It worked well in jacuzzi after. So you can swim with them but not recommended. It's more of a selling point to stress the water durability of the product.
THe PUMP is a sealed unit and the battery cannot be replaced. The PUMP is designed to exceed 1.5 years of regular use.
DDR3 (PC3-12800) laptop memory
Yes, the U2 Miners support namecoin. The maximum overclock speed is 2.4 GH/s. There is support for cgminer. Hope this helps! ---FundaMiner Support
Yes
So how do you configure it in cgminer for linux
The USB 3.0 tray that I have stays on when plugged back in.
Yes
Yes I think it should work. Just make sure to get right kind of connectors on the end - the one that plugs into the dock is the small square like those used by printers.
No it this M.2 is not compatible with any of the mac machines.
Yes. It does
This drive only has a thubderbolt connection, so no it will not work with PS4 or Xbox One. You need a USB drive for either.
No
purple means its charging, red its not
3 years on Parts, Labor, and Backlight
Hello. This adapter can stay on even if the camera is shut off. Yes. We do have macro lenses for the P520. Thank you
Yes, the card requires a 6-pin power connector from the power supply. The system won't boot without it being connected. The video card ships with a short cable that is a 4-pin to 6-pin power adapter, in case your power supply doesn't have a dedicated 6-pin power line.
Go to menu, select apps , select move, it's where you can clear the cache, it's all on screen for the most part,
No it only comes with what is listed : 1 x Tablet PC, 1 x Charger, 1 x User's Manual, 1 x MicroUSB Cable. A Dock would have to be purchased separately .
This camera has a fixed lens (cannot be changed).
camera is compatible with apple system android i don't now I'm iPhone user
This camera has a built-in flash.
Yes, this kit contains two batteries (one Sony brand packaged inside the camera box, another generic brand battery packaged separately). The strap for the camera is also packaged inside the camera box, here's a list of what Sony includese with the HX400V: *NP-BX1/M8 Li-ion Battery *AC Adapter *Micro USB Cable *Shoulder Strap *Shoe Cap *Lens Cap *Instruction Manual
B is black v wi fi
I wouldn't recommend. The one I ordered didn't have anything it advertised. The software was more like a cellphone.
Yes
You can see all the connectors on users guide, but bluetooth connections sometimes do not work!
This won't work. There is only one hdmi on the sound bar. Its actually a dumb design on Philips part. You also have the option of rca from the tv to the sound bar.
It's the same one you'd get from Samsung if you ordered it from them
Yes it will work as per specification of the Tab 4, in accommodate 32gb max and this memory is fast.
yeah, it will work on any phone with a micro sd card slot
Yes
No
I had 2014 and work great, 2013 are similar too. But please verified with the seller.
Yes
Best way to do this is via Bluetooth
Yes, the microphone is built in the headphones. You need not purchase anything. While listening to music or streaming video content you can even answer.All through the bluetooth (and touch) and without the cable.
I don't know
The tablet it is a international version and it is unlocked and can be used anywhere in the world where the carriers use the 850/900/1800/1900 MHZ . Check with your wireless company if they use one of this band .
Item arrived damaged. I returned it and bought something else. I never used It
It uses an on-board DC to DC converter. Shuttle does not spec the converter in any way. See my review of the DS81.
Possibly a bad CPU but could also be a bad motherboard on the DS81. On my PC I use the HDMI output and when I hooked up the cable the video worked fine with no extra setup steps. I have not tested the DVI output.
Each camera (all 16) has its own cable. Having said that, some cables are longer than others so be careful which ones you use with what camera. The cameras that are further away from the DVR need the longer cables. We are happy with this system.
I bought http://www.amazon.com/TaoTronics-License-Backup-Waterproof-TT-CC17/dp/B0092YMZJY and it works great for me.
I upgraded to the 4000nex from the earlier 5500bhs. They both have resistive displays but the difference is absolutely night and day. In my opinion responsiveness is more about CPU speed than the technology of the display itself. It doesn't scroll as fluidly and effortlessly as an iPad's capacitive display, but it is terribly impressive compared to what I've seen before.
I hope about 4 years, but mine is a year old already.
Yes, this tablet comes with bluetooth. Thank you!
Go to my orders and find who ordered it from and email them
Check with Square Trade
Ashley: Not on a lenovo IdeaPad running Windows 8.1 I had to return the product (no hassle with the return). It would not play CD, DVD movies or allow software downlaods from DVD. I ordered Generic USB Exterenal CD-WR / DVD-WR Drive that been working great since March 2014.
To work out sure yes have a blast. Sweat, rain wont damage the headset. Dont drop it in the ocean lol.
They work with all smart phones
Honestly, the cords are cheap...I'd just buy a new one.
Yes, the SATA converter comes with a power supply so it won't work on just the USB interface.
Anything with Bluetooth. I use it with my iPhone 5, iPad Air and MacBook Air. Very easy to switch devices too
The TRX_HD is supproting bluetooth speaker. If Sonas 3 is a bluetooth wireless speaer, then, it will be OK. If not, then, it can not pair.
micro HDMI
Yes, It does but it doesn't matter, if you have any usb port.
You can purchase an external USB/AC Charger to charge an extra battery which is a good to have around.
No.
It comes with a cable/charger combination that charges the battery while in the camera. This can be inconvenient when one needs several batteries. In the latter situation, buy a set of additional batteries and external charger from Amazon, like I did
Yes
It's plenty. I run an older more power consuming socket, an amd r9 270 and 4 drives. I think you're good.
I was skeptical when I bought because it's so much cheaper (I got the 725w model) than other brands with equivalent power. But it's ounning in the desktop I'm using to answer this question, and has been for about two weeks with zero issues. I'm building my brother in law a PC next, and it's going to have this in it.
No
YES! It has it: they called it a network port. What it doesn't have is a phone line jack/port.
From what i saw the battery life is 4 hours. Degrades overtime on usage.
looking at specs for ranger m, it looks like it will be a very tight fit. the card is 302mm (a hair under 12 inches). I would worry about the bottom front fan being in the way. you should be able to swing it, but this is the biggest card I've ever seen. "seriously!" you will have less than 1 inch clearance.
It depends on the amperage of the 12v rail. 1 290x needs at least 48 amps. For the lightning, if you're planning on using the oc features, you should look at more. Most 750W should be sufficient.
Yes, i used it in Hawaii. Did snorkeling and deep sea diving. Worked perfect for me.
oh, dear. There is not a mount in the package, so sorry!! You can buy it from the ASIN B00KHF4T46. I hope this help.
To answer your question directly, yes, it will; but you will need an NMO to UHF (SO-239) adapter like this one http://www.protelecomsupply.com/larsen-nmo-uhf-f-mount-adapter?source=googleps&gclid=CJCqq4bq4r0CFc1cfgod0HcA3g. But I wouldn't bother with this magnet mount. It's $30, and you could spend $5 more, plus shipping, and get a MFJ-336S TRI-MAG Mount, with the SO-239 connector, that will hold your antenna on the roof at over 80 MPH. I know because I have this antenna and this mount together and they work great. You can buy the mount at http://www.mfjenterprises.com/Product.php?productid=MFJ-336S . Hope this helps. 73s and have a great day.
No
No, it does not, although, the laptop does not have the traditional touchpad, but a touchscreen mousepad that includes features such as YouTube, Twitter, Clock, Stopwatch, Facebook, and many more. You can even customize the touchpad for specific gaming, such as World Of Warcraft. Hope this helped answer your question.
i sent an email to amazon and they confimred that its shipping by june , but im hoping sooner since Razer give an estimate of 23rd may.
As far as I've been able to tell, it should start shipping the last week of April. The Pro has started shipping. At least according to the razer site, it no longer says pre-order for the pro version.
It does not have wireless capability, but can plug into DSL.
Yes it comes in two boxes and everything in the picture is included, the monitor is an LCD, the keyboard, mouse and speakers are off brand but work great
Technically NO. But I used one, since the 'click' is bit harder to use (have to press it hard). Logitech small mouse is wonderful. I use 2 monitor (total 3 including the laptop display) so, wireless keyboard and mouse is handy. But when I use it portable, I can live with the touchpad only....
It is currently in stock.
No, unfortunately the HDX does not support USB OTG devices.
quiet
The USB cable and charger are included.
Yes it it has a mini HDMI port.
Yes
open box means the box of the product has been opened. The product can still be new.
It's likely, but you'll need to explore to find. I'd go and ask at a RadioShack (bring the notebook with you to check on the jack sizing vs. what RadioShack has). They may not have correct fit, but they may give you a suggestion as to a likelier source. Also there may be Google-listed companies carrying an array of sizes. Good luck.
No
I was able to get the volume control working on this model with the DirecTV controller. You just have to follow the DirecTV instructions on MENU/Remote Control. I said I had a Sony but they did not list the model. So it began searching for codes (they said there were 95 codes they would test) and on Code 3 it worked.
Dear RevRick, Thanks for your inquiry. The STRDH750 has bluetooth, but it not wi-fi ready. The next model up in the Sony line, the STRDN850, is wi-fi ready. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo
Yes all those items are included
It records sound, but not as audio files, It records videos and can take snapshots. So you would be recording video files, and they would have audio. The longest videos you can record on a fully charged pen would be about 88 minutes. The videos are in .AVI format, and there are free Windows programs on the internet that can save the audio from the pen recordings to .MP3 or .Wav files if you just want the audio :)
quality reminds one of 320 x 240 .. not a clean 720 by any means. Comparable blur on lettering gives it away as below par of a 720p normal cam. Mine had poorly aligned lens to the hole in pen. That could be part of the problem. Quality control is nil on this and a thousand like it and my complaint got no reply. The ills of mass prod. imported gadgets I guess. Crapped out other spy devices too at &gt;100 bucks. All said, the quality for the price is not bad. It just wont excite ya.
I lived 20 miles from dallas, and the signal quality was not good. Also I tried to move the antenna around to find the right signal strength but still made no difference. I would try to look for an antenna that goes on top of an rv they seem to be better built for distance and signal strength.
yes, the removable keyboard is included. Thanks
through play store, like any other android device.
yep, it does.
Hi Lang, I did do some research on this prioduct before I had purchased it . From what I found this roduct is Apple certified , it is very good quality &'I'm sure that you will be happy with it :-)
It has Bluetooth 4.0, and the WiFi is 802.11ac.
Yes. 720p HD. In fact, Samsung's new Chromebooks are also the first to be "Google Hangout certified," getting the Google stamp of approval for certain features optimized for Google's video chat tool, like 720p webcams, dual-array mics for better sound with less ambient noise, and enhanced graphics processing (thanks to the new processors) for smoother video.
Yes. Bluetooth 4.0
Yes, it can be upgraded. There is a second SSD slot in my NP930. I added a 512GB M.2 SATA SSD.
James I share a similar concern. To be honest with you it is unlikely that a start-up will survive the vagaries of modern business. They probably will be gobbled up by some goliath and if we are lucky then they may backward support the software platform and if not then we would be $*#&*$. I bought this so that my 90 year old mother can see her only grand daughter's latest photographs on the same day that the photos are taken. This product meets that need nicely. There are no guarantees of permanence in this world.
No, you can upload/email up to 8 megs for each jpg photo. By choosing to optimize your photos, in mynixplay account settings, you can store more photos but quality will be less than the originals. If your photos are very large you can choose, fit to screen, in your frame settings, otherwise the very large photos will scroll if setting is set to, fill screen.
Afraid not, though I have been among many who have asked nixplay that jpegs and video files be able to be mixed. You have to put your videos in a separate slideshow.
Yes, it has a standard stereo mini jack (like most cell phones, headphones or electronics) for input. It even comes with a short connection cord. Also has a USB input for memory stick or similar device.
No.., and it's not so effective transmitter..
Yes that is how I use mine
Hi, I may be able to help you with remote viewing. Some apps seem to be more compatible than others. What kind of device and what operating system do you intend to use ?
Yes
Yes
I find that this lense is really fast. It does an amazing job. It has become my new favorite lense
you'll need 12 volts from a 5.5 x 2.5 - there are some available on e-bay look under the username "boldar" for the ones I have available.
Yes this can work with Multiminer and BFGMiner. Depends on if you want to use it in dual mode or single mode. After using multi and bfgminer. I perferred BGFminer of multi because multi seems to have a lot of issues connecting and staying connected. But could have been I did not spend enough time with the programm and just fell back to what I already knwe best and was working.
Yes, its only good for basic use though, if you want to hardcore game or overclock you need a more powerful fan
Remote control is included, doesn't work for me. NO auxiliary cable
No, all you need in your car is the radio, you can connect the phone the the transmitter to play the music
You have to select the frequency.
No. This pen is Only for Ugee brand tablets. There'll be some problems if we use it with other brand of tablets.
This P50S pen dose not work with Ugee 19 Inches Graphics Drawing Pen Tablet. The pen of 19 Inches Graphics Tablet is P51.
It does! It did with mine at least, much prefer it to the battery operated one- the charge lasts for a long time and the pen is so much lighter, easier to work with.
Doesn't look like it has conversion abilities
No
No comprende?
I can tell you that it works with the Kindle Fire and Kindle Fire HDX so I would assume that it works with other kindle products as well.
This should be fine. We use ours for two iPhones, a Kindle, and a Verizon hotspot. Very powerful, compact and NO PROBLEMS!
There are thumb screws on one side of each of the flag mounts. Tightening those should do the trick.
That's what I'm using it with. Don't take of the quick release though.
Sometimes if you pair with second .device you may need to re pair with this one in settings
The box itself is CLOSED CIRCUIT, you can only view live feed, you add the harddrive inside the box and it then will record
Wait a minute there! This board is NOT for your fm3+ CPU. You need the MSI 970 Gaming board. This one is for a fm2+
no. Yo9u must have a processor in your motherboard to use it.
I use mainly 300 ohm Sennheiser HD 650. I DO run it through an EQ and a tube headphone amp (Little Dot), but they sound good with punch and bass straight from the iBasso, although the satisfying volume is absent.
The SD specification (v3.01), "SDXC supports cards up to 2 TB (2048 GB), compared to a limit of 32 GB for SDHC cards in the SD 2.0 specification". So, maximum storage capacity for an sd HC card is 32Gb, maximum storage capacity for an sd XC card is 2Tb. When the technology is available to manufacture and sell the cards economically, the technical specifications will support it. Kind of like how 64bit memory addressing can theoretically allow for 16 Exabytes of memory; it's capable, but the tech just isn't there yet.

It is not compatible with Apple/IOS device control buttons.
I don't think you can. this NAV system is dedicated to iPhones so they really don't have much for us Android users as for phone meriting but I really don't think that you can do it but I'm not sure.
100% SATISFIED
Yes. Laptop comes with ONE 4 GB stick of DDR3 RAM and there is ONE available slot to add an additional 4 GB.
about 1.9 GHz per core

Don't know, ask Logitech. Remote will learn commands from TV remote.
Not sure however this product works with many configurations. Also found on Amazon StarTech.com Universal USB 3.0 Laptop Docking Station w/ Dual DVI Video - HDMI & VGA Adapters, 2x USB Fast Charge Ports, USB 3.0 Hub, GbE
No, but I do have a disclaimer. I have a Logitech keyboard that connects via USB dongle which initially did function when connected to the dock, however that was short lived. When I plug the dongle directly into the Macbook the keyboard does work while the Macbook is attached to the dock. I have not attempted to connect any other USB device to the dock to eliminate if it is a dock port issue.
This wall charger limits the output power to 20w, so i don't think it would be very hot.
It does not.
It doesn't announce street names, there are several voice choices but with each option it states directions only, no street names
Yes this RAM should be compatible with your motherboard. I am personally having a great experience with it! If you would like to learn more about your motherboard check http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/M5A78LM_LX_PLUS/specifications/ If you would like to learn more about High Density RAM check http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDR_SDRAM
Yes
Yes, that mobo accepts 1866mhz memory. Look under product specs. http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813128709
Yes you can use it but trying to add it to the existing 8GB on there might cause problems, that memory is 8GB 1600Mhz and this is a 8GB of 1866Mhz its not good mixing memory
Yes
Yes. With the Vision Plus, the camera's tilt control can be set for shooting straight down.
The reason for the 3-axis gimbal is exactly for the reason you expressed, it prevents the camera from a hard stop.
Suggest you get a ruggedized case and get a bright color so you can see it quickly at luggage pickup. I have one and it also allows for two TSA approved locks. However, you have to carry your batteries with your carry ons. If you wrap them in saran wrap and put them in a lipo safety charging bag, you shouldn't have any TSA problmes.
Dear, please do not worry, it is a universal car radio, you should be able to have all the necessary wiring connections with it.
Yes, it is worth it ;)
No
If the car has a double D.I.N. size radio in it from factory,it will fit . If it is single D.I.N. size,u will need a flip out version of it. All the wires are well marked, buy a bmw factory style wiring harness and installation will be a breeze
I bought this a few months back and it broke the first time we tried to use it.
No. Made in China, not Fidelity brand
Yeah it's "Eurekka" and it doesn't work
The big difference I see is that this one is made to fit an ipad or 13 inch laptop. If you don't need to carry those i would get the other one.
It Comes with a USB charging cable.
You could with an adapter but the sound quality on this device is horrible
If you plug the Vibe into your Sansa Player it will broadcast Bluetooth. You would also need a Blue Tooth headset that would be able to recieve it.
I have the 3 and 3+ and both work with this case.
Yes, the LCD Touch BacPac acts just like the LCD display on a camcorder. I just tried it on my Hero3 Black at 720P 120fps. Keep in mind that the LCD BacPac is powered by the camera battery, and precludes the use of a Battery BacPac. You may want to consider using an external USB power source if your situation requires the LCD to run for extended periods. Check the GoPro website for the latest PDF version of the user manual.
Yes
Yes. Both my wife and I use it.
If you use a SD card you can hear audio too. Make sure you adjust the speaker and mic on the unit
32g is the largest
Yes, both cameras seem to focus very well, but the rear-facing (selfie) camera needs more light to get good depth of field. The front-facing camera works fine in low-light conditions. Neither is as good as my Canon T3, but I didn't expect them to be.

I have no issues about speed. For $50 more though you can get the 3rd generation that just came out this week. Definitely a tablet that stands apart from any other. I love it!
I watch football through the Verizon FiOS app
Don't be impatient when you ask a question, use google and you can get an ans in less than 5 minutes. Here is the link: http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/7491/~/sandisk-products-transfer-speed 10-30 Mb/s Here is another link: http://www.sandisk.com/products/memory-cards/microsd/
No
Yikes! I didn't have this issue! Hope you figure it out!
Yes you need and extra SIM
Hi, I still have the packaging and it lists Windows Vista as a supported OS, it also lists Windows 7 (no mention of 32 or 64 bit) but I can confirm it works well with Windows 7 64-bit. Hope this helps you in taking the plunge. Listiel W.
yes works absolutely perfect
No, you cannot swap it with a denser battery.
There are definitely vents on the bottom. There also appear to be some kind of slit just under the left and right side near the front that might be vents as well, but the ones on the bottom definitely vent air when the computer is running a game or something intense. It does not get overly hot, however, in any case.
Yes, it has.
Probably not there is no input other than Bluetooth and only speaker wire connection for the output
Standard Refresh Rate: 60 Hz
Lisa, HP typically uses proprietary motherboards and power supplies.
Yes, it does. Also Bluetooth
Since Amazon is a U.S. company and the US uses (110V) 120V, I think not. The manual says. "On power sources * Before operating the receiver, check that the operating voltage is identical with your local power supply. The operating voltage is indicated on the nameplate on the back of the receiver." Mine says AC 120V ~ 60Hz. This model is available in other countries with the correct voltage.
Yes, there is a built in equalizer..
WP X7 only honors X6 and X5. The last version to go back to version 11 and up was X5.
Yes it does have "QuickCorrect" and a lot of other "Quick" features (fill, fonts, bullets, numbers, etc.).
Hi, It comes with everything you need to start mining. Including software and instructions.
Thank you for the question. The bulb is rated for 25 years. If something happens to the bulb during the warranty period you can return it.
Yes, this tablet supports microSD card up to 32GB.
4.4 kit kat
This tablet is garbage
You have the option to choose which one (average or current) to see on your watch: for example, my running metrics are distance, average pace and current heart rate. The metrics can be decided before the run and you can easily switch between different ones during the run. Hope this help.
Yes,you can charge it also with an USB plug adapter at 100-240V
Google the Fiio support center
There is no delete option. I hope they fix it, but for right now, the only delete is to do a factory reset via the computer.
It should charge it but won't sync... It is not a USB hub, just a charger.
5 hours of playtime
It should. Once you plug the receiver in to a USB plug it should work once it loads the software. It works with Android and Windows.
my friend my opinion is time to junk it ..i have spend lots of precious time on this box No More..
geekbuying offer one year warranty,thanks
Yes, it works. Didn't see a speed issue. Don't use the provided cable to charge (not quality) as it has a tendency to not keep a connection.
yes ,it's normal,Solstar could charging your iphone about 50% to 60% juice for emergency after being solar charged for 7 to 8hrs under normal sunlight.it's can not full charging the built-in battery,good choice for emergency purpose when outside ,but do not over count on it's solar charging,USB charging is highly recommend,thanks your question.
Yes there is a play store and works with google.
No. But there are apps that you can download that lock you in and can allow only certain apps for your child to have access to. It requires a code to exit back to the main screen outside of the app. There is also a kid friendly YouTube app (3.99) that you have to approve the videos that way your child isn't watching inappropriate videos.
Yes
Yes, it has a digital optical output that I use to connect to my sound bar. This is a great tv and you cannot beat the price, especially with the ROKU stick included. Enjoy!
Hi Sorry for late response. DVI-D (dual link) cable is included. But HDMI cable is not included. Thank you.
The Paradigm sound scape come with a very nice and sturdy wall mount which you can mount directly into the studs. Also, if you decide to mount directly into the drywall, you have to purchase special anchors for this product because paradigm doesn't supply them.
Only wireless
Artic Silver
There are distinct differences...as you mentioned size is one. A couple of differences are the footprint of the boards...wifi support...and network support. Go here to see pics, and there is a comparison chart at the bottom of that page.http://www.linksprite.com/?page_id=782
The Panorama will automatically start recording once the car is started and 12V cigarette lighter port powers the charger. Cyclic recording is the main feature of all DashCam products. Oldest file is deleted to make room for the newest file. You can set clip length to various sizes. For a complete information page check out the DashCamTalk FAQ page. As you can see the Panorama is the current "Best All Around" model and has a tremendous about of support behind it. dashcamtalk.com/powerucc-panoramaii/
Use a Full Size SD card (class 10 or faster) The camera will format up to 32GB max. You can use larger 64GB and 128GB cards, but they need to be manually formatted in your PC first. It's not recommended to use a microSD to SD adapter. (Full Size SD is best long term and with high heat) For more info see: dashcamtalk.com/powerucc-panoramaii/#Large_Capacity_Cards
You can use it for either. If you use it as a 'repeater' it shows up the exact same way as it would if you were hooking up to your existing WiFi network. If you use it as a 'bridge' it uses your existing WiFi to create a new WiFi network. Both ways work fine.
Ryan, No, you have to sacrifice extra battery life for the LCD screen. GoPro's can only have one Bacpac accessory attached at a time.
Yes it will recognize duplicates provided that they have the same name and meta data. If you save a picture with changes such as new contrast it will consider it a different picture. I short no risk of having duplicates if you have the same pic on your tablet, computer and phone
Yes you can from the web app from a computer
Yes, after setting up your Lyve Home and connecting your Facebook account, Lyve will collect all of the photos and videos you've been tagged in so they're also accessible from your Lyve account, across all of your devices and computers. You also have the option of importing the photos and videos that you've posted to your Facebook account - for instance, if you have posted some photos to Facebook that you don't have anywhere else. Just check the box to enable this feature as well.
I have two of these and haven't experienced any shutting off unexpectedly. Possibly a defective unit? You can try it on other devices to rule out if it's just the unit itself or your phone.
No
Sure thing! I didn't mention the dimensions in my review, but they were exactly the reason I bought it in the first place. Dimensions are: Height 3.75" x Depth 5.75" x Width (front to back) 5.5"
Yes. Just install the app called NuFengShiPin n u will see all live TV broadcasts from HKG, Taiwan, n China.
Audio yes and screen yes.
It's got no battery so there's nothing to charge. Yes, by design, it needs a direct power supply like a car's USB/cigarette lighter (provided of course that the car is running) or an iPhone charger or something similar. It's got a capacitor, which holds just enough power that the camera would use to auto-save the video if there's a loss of power at the moment of impact.
I didn't see anything in the documentation or technical specs that it directly supports the "USB Attached SCSI Protocol" (which is supported in Win8, but I don't think Win7). Keep in mind that the USB host controller also needs to support UASP. It should be able to natively support a 6TB drive. (Assuming the "Should" box was checked off on the engineering build sheet.) It's probably more a question of "Does your OS support 6TB in the way that you want to use it?"
Hi Dear Hoang,Yes this device can help you to clone a 80GB Drive to a 500GB Drive.However,This device support SATA Hard Drives ONLY,You will need to ensure yout 80GB Drive is a SATA Drive first.Or it won't work.If you have any further question,You can contact ORICO Customer Care Team for more support such as figure out if your drive a SATA Drive.
I have been pretty drenched running with these and I have not had an issue (yet). I tend to sweat heavily and I've worn them for several 6-8 mile runs without issue.
Yes, it charges through a USB cable, then stops working after 2 months for no reason.
1030 easily overclockable
Yes, it is normal. When temps go up you will see the color leds change to yellow and the other 2 fans turn on. Even if you increase the fan speed manually it will only effect the fans currently running. I believe there is a switch on the card to make all three run all the time. But its not necessary as my card LEDs are always blue unless a video is playing or anything more demanding.
It is magnetically attached to the case. Thanks!
The SSD drive would work on any laptop as an external drive. This one fits Macbook Pro mid 2012 model as an internal HD. Macbook Pro's have a special internal SSD drive connector.
F5 is the version ive seen on this board. There are a few revisions online.
No, only with the Note is there a stylus.
Yes
yes the gaming 7 mobo will fit right in, it is atx in size
Go with the Gigabyte. Asus used to be the best in my opinion, but I heard that a lot of their employees went to Gigabyte a few years ago. So it's no coincidence that Gigabyte's quality has improved. Of all the manufacturers of hardware out there, I would rate Gigabyte as number one, followed by Asus and EVGA.
It's PCI Express 3.0,..says right on the box in fine print. I think most platforms from the last 5 years or so have been 3.0.
Yes it is. Most Bluetooth speakers are compatible. Read the specs.
Yeah, lights can be customized to be any color, any combination of colors, and completely off. Checkout this link for more information on MSI steel series backlit keyboards. Cheers! http://event.msi.com/nb/faq/q7.html
No
Yes, you'll need to buy a micro-card. Recommend 32gb memory for about 4 hrs of video. Bestbuy cost about $30. You can read my posted review for more info. Rated 4 stars. Gamlv.
I first thought of a dash mount, but the camera is designed to use a windshield mount, and too much retrofit to change it. Once I tried the windshield mount provided and mounted it just in front of the rear view mirror, I've been satisfied. Give it a try. If it's not what you want or like, you can return it for something else.
You plug the antenna into the connector on your mediasonic converter that say RF In and then you connect audio/video cables from the converter to your tv (yellow,red,white) match color to color and then turn on your tv, and you may have to move the antenna around to get a good signal as well as move your tv if the signal is weak.
I can receive at total of 17 local channels. I can not pick up. Channel 10 Fox at all. Changing locations does not help. Except for Fox, I am very pleased.
Cheaper and lighter, but slower at the long end of the zoom when compared to the older Nikon 18-300. Lighter than my old Nikon 18-200 VR. A well worthwhile upgrade, for me that is.
No. And that's why I returned it.
yes & very good from across the room
I have a Note 4. It will fit in the front external pocket but not the pocket on each end. The external pockets are pretty small.
yes it is..make sure you select Cadence sensor only OR you can use both Cadence and Speed sensor. works well.
Yes. You can set up Bike 1 and Bike in your Edge 500 and assign the proper cadence sensor to each.
Yes
Yes, 128 GB microSDHC card was supported. However, it is not recommended to use along with Sandisk brand. Once you plugin your usb cable to PC, it will be your new drive in my computer and you can do the file transfer.
up to 128GB Micro SD card (Class 10)
Ambarella CMOS sensor
Hard to say from the information you have. Is there any way you can use a different monitor to see if it also shows the symptoms? Or if your goal is to keep the old monitor, is there a different source device you can try?
Upgraded motors & controller, can do 16 waypoints, camera tilt uses a dial on the remote controller are the big ones that I see. I'm not sure about the cost but would bet it's a couple of 100 more. I got the vision plus V3 and have had great luck with it.
Yes
You will need to upgrade your power supply to have stable performance with this card. I recommend at least a 500 watt.
No computer tech needed. But if you are transferring files from an old computer, you might ask for help at that point.
40-44 cm long
Yes
Yes. I tried this cover with both my new 13 in MacbookPro (Retina) and my older 13 in MacbookPro (with disk drive) and it does fit both. The older 13 in MacbookPro is a little snug but it does fit.
no, it doesn't fit for 13.3 inch macbook pro, it is fit for 13.3 inch macbook pro retina and macbook air
Not the laptop sleeve but your purchase comes with an extra grey felt bag for the charger
Yes. When you install it, go into corsair link and toggle off multi-rail mode for the ports you plug it into (this is extremely important since the HX1000i uses multi-rail by default and this card will not like that very much). I ran it with an 850W PSU, and while it worked I wouldn't recommend it (at load, the card goes over the 500 TDP rating). 1000W should be more than fine though and the PSU you have has a dedicated 12v rail option. Don't expect to tri-fire/quad-fire with it though.
With this generation, crossfire bridge is not needed. Crossfire is running via PCIe lanes.
I had no problems adding an ONVIF 2.0 specification camera (I forgot the brand, Dahua or another generic brand.) You just go into the Camera Management section, choose Connect Mode - Manual, and select ONVIF as the Protocol. Once the protocol was set, and the rest of the device information was set, it was very easy to get everything up and running. Video appeared shortly after setting everything up (about 20-30 seconds.) Quality of the video depends on the camera, of course.
Yes, it does. It doesn't have dvd driver. I bought a external dvd driver for $30.
110v
The 838 would operate in 5.1 channel plus one pair ceiling or height speakers when operating in Atmos. I have 9 speakers connected, upgraded to Atmos, and threw on the latest Transformers bluray recorded in Atmos....absolutely blew me away, made a decent movie amazing. Everyone who has heard the Atmos has been amazed, certainly seems to use all available speakers. Google onkyodolbyatmos.com for more info. I absolutely love this receiver, though I do not fully understand how it works....it really works.
Hello J. Burke; like the TX-NR 727- digital audio sources (e.g HDMI and digital optical/ digital coaxial) are not supported for ZONES 2/3 broadcasting. The only audio sources supported for ZONE 2/3 broadcasting are - AM/FM radio, NET sources (Sirius, Pandora, TuneIn, etc.), USB, Bluetooth, and of course RCA Analog audio connections.
I have used this lens about 2 months with about 2500 shutter releases and have never experienced this problem.
No,can't sync to iPad or iPhone , I do love my 15 though
Yes
The watch is a bit thick, but not too much where it is a bother. I'm 6' medium build and it fits perfectly. The screen is big where the numbers pop up nicely and is easy to read while the strap fits just right. It doesnt really weigh much. I've truly enjoyed this watch and have had it for only 3 weeks. I think it will be just fine for you....
Yes, it does - the hard, round, disc-y kind.
It doesn't require power. As long your bose console powers up, connect this adapter to the console and you are good to go
yes - mine did
No
I just tested it with my ps4 it connected easily. Everything works and it makes chatting or looking up new youtube videos easier.
Nathan, You can play any song from a compatible bluetooth device (cellphone, tablet, laptop etc) using Denon AVR-S500, as long as you mean to play it through the wired speakers, which must be wired to Denon. The receiver picks up the Bluetooth signal and sends out through the speakers NOT through the TV set speakers.
Hello Ben. Your question asks if an HDMI cable can support his resolution. I'm not sure what you mean by "this resolution", but if you mean 2560x1080, yes it does. I plugged in an HDMI cable to the monitor and it automatically set my Windows screen resolution to 2560x1080. Hope that helps.
An actual DVI cable. That should be all you need.
Thank you for your interest in our package deal! The Nikon part number for this lens is # 2216. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact our sales department at 800-991-3350 EST. We thank you for your time and consideration!
Thank you for your interest in our package deal! In regards to your inquiry, this lens is compatible with both camera models - the Nikon D90 and D5000. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact our sales department at 800-991-3350 EST. We thank you for your time and consideration!
It's not really an issue, the keys are a bit recessed and are deactivated when in tablet mode. Lenovo's case is designed to protect the kb in this situation as well if you are worried about it.
No
The yoga 2 fits I have it
Yes.
I have not tried using the built in Pandora, but yes.....you can watch TV and have the audio stream from a wireless device using the bluetooth feature. I did it using an ipad while having the football game on.
No, soundbars are made to be plugged into the TV and do not use a receiver. The surround receiver outputs to speaker wire. The opticals are inputs
Push the TV Sound button on the remote control
Got mine yesterday (not from Amazon but a "stock" version) and it foes have 16GB system RAM and 3GB DDR5 on the 870m GPU.
Yeah, mine came with one.
Vertical.
About 5'.
Oh also traded up from my epson to get the led projector. I was changing bulbs on my epson once a year but use it as a tv and for everything not just a home theatre
No, you only need a active 3d glasses and a computer, laptop, tablet, etc. That play a side by side 3d movie with a 120 hz. Graphic card. You cannot view a 3d directly from a DVD. This is a 3D ready projector.not a full 3D.
I wondered the same thing and ended up purchasing this speaker because the manufacturer e-mailed me saying that it was replaceable. And there were instructions for replacing the battery included in the instructions when I received the speaker.
The TDK "Life on Record" has VERY dynamic, rock solid sound...not tinny at all and doesn't lose audio quality at max volume. Before buying, I went into my local Best Buy and listened to both this unit and the Bose. The TDK (in my opinion) sounds just as good as, if not better than, the Bose. I have owned the TDK since August 2014 and use it all the time. It really does sound great. Go find it at Best Buy and take a listen if you can. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
When I played them together it wasn't really close. The UE Boom had ok sound, but it sounded like a lot of the other bluetooth speakers out there, kind of tinny and flat. The only two that I felt were good was the bose unit and this unit. I wanted something I could take to the beach, potentially get wet, etc. So I got this. I had them next to each other at the store and would go back and forth. I'm very happy with the tdk unit.
Yes it does. The thermal compound is pre-applied to the heatsink.
No it can not if u want an overclockable cpu it needs to be K series look for the k at the end of the 4 digit number
I didn't weigh it but that seems about right.
windows 8
It has an ethernet port on the back, I think it is only 10/100 though, pretty standard.
It is not worth rolling the dice on. Bad reviews all over for this product.
Because its a knock off piece of #^%&lt;. It records for all of 30 seconnds then its full!
It says 64gb but I only got to use almost 8gb before it crapped out
Yes
I always charge the battery in the night time. It usually takes eight hours to get fully charged.
Hello, no I am sorry. We have only tested on Garmi devices and I do not think it will work on the Garmin Viago as it uses Garmin in house maps. Thank you.
Dear soumik: you have to replace the generic ram and it would be able to upgrade up to 8Gb 1333 Mhz ( http://support.toshiba.com/support/staticContentDetail?contentId=4005071&isFromTOCLink=false). Second to tear apart is relative what is easy or hard for you, anyways here a link with a small tutorial (http://www.laptopscreen.com/English/model/Toshiba/SATELLITE~C55-A5105/) I hope this would help.
Yes
Not sure, I bought it as a gift.
Yes it does fit.
No. The camera runs on 12V.
Use is explorer or Firefox. They have in a software for Mac I believe on their web site.
Yes they are.
Yes but it isn't included.
I would have to think the power-supply supplied with the enclosure would be rated for the maximum number of drives that could be used in the enclosure. The unit we have (2 bay) came with 12 Volt, 4A DC supply and barely breaks a sweat, just warm to the touch.
I have 2 units In 2 locations. One is used with a WD Mycloud 6tb drive. The other with a 4tb Seagate cloud drive. I copy to them and back them up us a NAS. I stream from them using the built in DLNA server. They work great for me.
Yes it does. I had to leave the latest Transformers movie as an ISO and it played fine. I usually use MakeMKV to convert my blurays to MKV but I had to leave it as ISO until MakeMKV got updated to support the new Atmos audio track format found in Transformers Age Of Extinction and a couple other new ones Anyway, that's the long way of saying your ISO's will play fine
Nope only USB 2.0
The maximum memory for this model is 8GB. Thank you, Jasmine iCompNY
I just ordered and received this radio from this vendor. My radio came with V1.04 firmware which, yes, includes the 2.5 kHz step.
Yes.
Yes, paired right up
Bluetooth firmware: 3.0.11 P32
Yes you could, what you need to know....... The drive inside is a std length (~2"/50mm) long w/ the M2 interface. If you are going to clone the original drive you will need to get a M2 to SATA adapter to make it easy.
Hi JP, transferring those images to your smartphone will not be geotagged using the phone's GPS. -Ely
Yes you can do either or wireless or Ethernet
Yes. There is a U,S. One-year Limited Warranty. It is the standard warranty which covers defects in materials and workmanship, with the agreement to repair or replace any sub-standard set of headphones at no charge. They are the ones who choose whether to repair or replace, so you must send them back for this to occur. Because it is not specified who would pay for shipping, be assured that the buyer would have to pocket this expense.
I would try to go through Amazon's customer service first and if both them, the company that makes the tablet should send a replacement unit. Especially if it's only 2 months old.
Yes, the charger comes with it.
Hello. The included Power Adapter is a 110v charger. It will not work with 220V power supply. To use the Charger with 220v you would need to get a 220 to 110 Adapter Converter. (Be sure that the Adapter converts the power and doesn't just pass it through, or that will damage the Tablet.) Thank you
No, it is not a touch screen. You could get the Acer C720p if you are looking for a touch screen chromebook.
Netflix, Hula, Amazon. But I believe you have to connect it to a smart TV in order to get full support.
No, unfortunately this model has less features then the higher priced models and there is no web browser app standard with the system. When I purchased the unit, I went to the app screen and tried to find one for download, but there were none available.
Any ATX... You'll have more room off in a full atx case rather than the mediums...maybe I was unlucky but this Mb I got was used... Good luck!
? The name of this motherboard, according the the MSI Website (http://us.msi.com/product/mb/Z97_GAMING_7.html#overview), is MSI Z97 Gaming 7. A quick Google search will yield plenty of results with some nice third-party reviews. Hope that helps.
Yes.
No it does not. However it is equipped with a mPCIe slot that a wifi card can be installed in.
I am assuming you are referring to the heatsink between the I/O ports and the CPU. Any CPU cooler powered by fans will block them from my experience except for water cooling methods. Also, please refer to pcpartpicker.com to make sure the cpu cooler fits in your case. Cooler Master V8 is a lot bigger than it looks and may not fit in your case due to size.

With theZ97 xxx Motherboard you have to Add at I/O card in one Slot go to ASUS web Site for more information
The 2600 refers to maximum overclock frequency of the memory that can be used with the board. The unit is GHz. Z97-A is itself a version of MB using Intel z97 chipset. There are other offerings like z97-C and RAMPAGE models etc. The different versions of MB differs in features on the motherboard.
This is the 1080 OC version. I have 2 from Amazon so no uncertainty.
It's only a few millimeters of clearance for my windforce gigabyte 970. Hope that helps.
Channel A. I have two 8gb sticks in slot 1 and 3.
I've never found sound cards necessary with most headsets. It should be fine with integrated.
This model comes with the wifi card build into the actual motherboard. You could always buy a separate wifi card if you went with a different model though. If you are looking to get this specific wifi card as a separate item, I don't think you can. At least not specifically.
Yes
Yeah, I am currently using this MOBO with my i7 4790k. It should work with the GTX 970, that's what I'm planning to upgrade to. Check out pcpartpicker.com, you select all your computer parts and it tells you if there are compatibility issues. I believe there are only 3 fan headers so you'd have to use a splitter, and I'm not so sure of any good ones. Sorry! Hope this helps.
The one I bought came with a cable that allows for dual monitors. I haven't tried it with this machine, however, so I can't say how well it works. In general, running dual monitors shouldn't be a big deal with Windows,
The Left and Right markings are practically invisible raised letters on the plastic sleeve right next to the fabric cord. To save you some squinting, the Left side is the side with the mic.
I just got his laptop and yes it does have a back-lit keyboard. The back light is red on black keys with white lettering. Looks pretty awesome.
I as a tech savvy and game developer, have noticed the blurness of the screen, giving my eyes a hard time to readjust. This laptop's color are at most okay, but they aren't what the company States with UHD quality, even Windows doesn't adjust to it. The text and images look rather awful and I refrain from anyone having it, this is a gaming laptop which is better suited for those instead of media. That's only my opinion but I've owned two versions of this laptop.
Yeah it does
That I do not know. I would recommend referring to the HP website. The computer works much better now after removing all of the antivirus software that it came with and installing webroot. Webroot removed several programs that it came with that were deemed malware.
Works great on my HTC One. I get an email notification and pull the video up on the phone
You need to run power to the spot. The camera quality sucks, I returned it
Yes
Yes, 1TB hard drive installed and configured.
No.
I really don't know exactly but it seems to be a part of the model number or when or where manufactured by my experience, but it has nothing important to do with you like the product or not. The only part the Dell company needs to understand it needs to make a better mouse and clicker system.
Yes
goes up to 8gb RAM i believe
Yes
Its loud, but nought it for riding my motorcycle, and over 50 mhp it gets tough to hear. I still like it though...
This card has Displayport 1.2 apart from two dual-link DVI connectors and HDMI. And I can tell you that I'm really satisfied with this graphic card, its performance is great.
When you order the graphic card from Amazon they will send you a email with the activation code and instructions about how to activate and download the game
It actually can. I have been running games that are more harsh on the Graphics like arma 3 and dayz and still get about 60-40 fps.
This is for the Retina display model only. If yours is not the Retina display get the 128 gig size cards. the PNY is good
Yes, but get low-profile RAM and a case with a cutout for the CPU backplate.
there is no on board wifi. It can be added through a seperate purchase.
No. It will work in Paris and other european places that use a type C plug. For the UK you need a type G plug or converter.
Maybe In low settings
This supports all microSD cards. I have a 128gb class 10 in mine.
that is actually not crashes, that is a glitch in the capacitive start button that would make if act like it is being pressed. update your BIOS and it is confirmed to fix the issue.
Yes, It was specifically designed to work on Canon's crop sensor cameras like yours. All of Canon's EF and EF-S lens should work on your camera.
4
Correct, one is Atheros and one is Intel. I had trouble installing the Intel driver on Windows Server 2012, but finally found a way. The Atheros one worked just fine.
Yes, it is safe to keep it connected to the router all the time. You can check the list of tested USB hard drives on this link, http://kb.linksys.com/Linksys/ukp.aspx?vw=1&docid=5dee65386ed848d3b174757922b19c6d_List_of_tested_USB_hard_drives_and_printers_for_the_Linksys_.xml&pid=80&respid=0&snid=2&dispid=0&cpage=search.
Chris. I have lots of experience with all kinds of ccd and ip cameras. This camera gave me fits. At one point I finally got video from it; however , it stopped shortly after. Might save yourself some trouble and go ahead and return it. I did. Hope this helps. William
It is upgraded to A23 processor.
I think so. Its a very good tablet
If you have a wireless router, yes!
I sent it back. Did not keep it. Couldn't. Get it to work. Please stop asking questions.
Mine was broke from the first day! I went to the local fixing place, I was told this tablet is cheap, there is no part to replace it. I didn't have chance to use it. Sorry :-(
It's clear
No stand, but there are jacks for the supplied headphones and microphone.
No, it does not
not too loud and sound quality isnt the best, but its ok for the price
Yes
Yes, it pulls out. It was stiff and l was nervous as well. But l have adjusted it for angle many times since
Yes
you can root the system and install xfce which is ubuntu,lite. It however yells at you every startup that you are in developer mode. it was also a little buggy, i had issues getting printers working etc. The chrome OS is awesome though, I love my Chromebook.
It uses laptop form factor SO-DIMM RAM. It can be upgraded to 8GB, but you would have to removed the 4GB module and replace it with an 8GB. There is no second slot.
4GB memory
No
No not with this iteration of the DCB Plus. However you can block the 800 area code and then use Code 52 to invite a Number within that 800 area code, like program Code 52 800 555 1212 * and this will allow that number through with every other 800 number blocked.
YES you can just enter the area code 800 or 877 to be blocked. You can also enter the entire number you want blocked like 800-555-1212. You can enter wildcard strings like 800-555-#### to block specifically all calls fom the 555 exchange.
YES pls.
Indeed I did not see any MX500 on Crucial's website. There is the M500, the M550, and the latest MX100. The are subtle differences between them, and even in the same model, for example, writing speeds vary according to capacity... With so many subtle "differences", it's hard to say which is best. There is also the matter of the price to take into account. I suggest you read this review by TechReport, which also has reviews for the other two SSDs. Loads of tech info to weave through. http://techreport.com/review/26532/crucial-mx100-solid-state-drive-reviewed
3 years http://www.crucial.com/usa/en/company-warranty But SSD can last for very long time and memory blocks can do upto 100k program and erase cycles plus wear leveling and on the fly repairs. Basically they are assumed to last for 10 years of continuous use. Well you're not using it continuously so it should last so much longer.
I am sure it will work. It is suppose to work with most touch screens. But be prepared to get use to slower response and awareness in drawing and writing.
Yes it will work -- be sure to get the Standard edition. You will also need to get the upgraded board and install it in order to get the Gimbal to work properly.
Will work on any TV that can be mounted. Absolutely love it. Very easy to install. Extremely stable. Personally I have it on a Vizio 4k 50". Base was way too low and solved my problem with my center speaker blocking the bottom of the TV.
In order to use a 64 GB Micro SD card, you have to format it to FAT32. Foscam has a link to third party software that accomplished the formatting in seconds. Micro SD cards less than 32 GB usually are already formatted to FAT32 but you'll want the biggest card for best recording results.
Avoid this item. Mine does not record audio. When I called the teck support for help, they told me that two different versions were shipped to Amazon consumers, one that works and one that requires an upgrade, in order to record video. It was very nice of them to tell so........... after they already got my payment. It's also not compatible with Android tablets and can only be programed with "Windows".
Yes, this will surely work with apple devices and Nexus 5.
Yes I was able to use my tablet while in use. It is as same as plugging in to the wall charger.
I'm not sure but I believe it does. the 1 I have charged a android tablet and a iPhone so I'm assuming it wouldn't be a problem for a Nokia phone.
The S2 comes with a standard ATX power supply that supports 230v as well as 120v. You may need to buy an adapter for the power cable, however.
We currently do not have the 10ft charging cable at this time.
Yes it will
How old, My grand children are using with iPhones 4 and 5
You have to turn it on every time, but it's as easy as holding down the main button for just a couple seconds. It also remembers the device it was paired with previously and begins searching for that device automatically. If the mpow is plugged into USB, the device powers up and pairs within 2-3 seconds. If unplugged and running on its battery, it takes about 3-5 seconds.
Matt, While your motherboard does have the PCI Express graphics slot required for this card, your 300 watt power supply in the Inspiron 570 desktop will not work. You will need a power supply of at least 400 watts with a 6-pin PCI-E power connector and a minimum of 20 Amp on the +12 volt rail.
Yes, it has a wide variety of different forms of Spanish from Argentina, to Chile, to Nicaragua, to the US.
Yes, 240volt ac
Amazon is about to release an amazon android app soon. When that arrives, it will work 100%.
Yes
Yes, it supports.
The video resolutions can be changed. The settings are: 640X480 (default), 800x600, 1024x768,1280x1024, 1600x1200
No
Yes you can, i set up mines in the living room and and can see it from my iphone anywhere i go. You can also speak through it and it has night vision which turns on automatic when the you turn off your lights.
I only Pre-ordered because Amazon had it listed 5 days sooner than NewE**. Now they have changed their tune. I have to pay tax as well... Why not just walk into BB or some other brick and mortar and pick it up on launch day....
I would wait personally. The price drop will be there shortly. It will also allow you to read some reviews about core clocks and overclocks.
Yes, one can press "F12" just after powering on to show a BIOS boot screen and choose the USB to boot from. (one has to press "F12" a couple of times quickly!"
Yes, memory and hard drive. You'll need an operating system too.
I am not an expert, but here is what I have learned since buying my UHD TV. There are 4x as many pixels, but there still are few programs broadcast in the ultra high definition format. Those of us who are early owners of UHD TVs will have to wait a couple of years until content providers complete their transition to UHD equipment (cameras etc.). Meanwhile, try playing a UHD video disk movie to experience maximum picture quality.
it should. I have travelled to UK and Europe and it was fine.
This product is only compatible with US/EU/AU/UK plugs.
I am not sure. Normally you can not plug the device into the wrong voltage. That is why they make so many configurations. The surge part is normally for abnormal occur ancestors from the power company or lightening.
You can use windows backup to backup your entire harddrive including the hidden recovery partition to a 16gb flash drive. Then use that drive to boot and recover your hdd in the event of a total hdd failure. No need to buy a new OS or send in to Asus
Mine is in the living room next to my tv and I don't notice the fan. I use it for an HTPC and it works well on streaming and stored video playback.
Yes it does.
Yes
"I am disappointed that there is no CD/DVD drive.
Yep, it doesn't have a cd rom though.
Yes but it would take a professional to do it
Nope, you can go VGA, or go home with a Toshiba Satellite. This is your run of the mill, bare minimum system.
No
