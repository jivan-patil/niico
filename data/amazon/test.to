yes
We are only using it for normal video projector. Has not been used for a pro retina. So far it has worked well. Thanks.
There is no internal light source in the Nook Simple Touch so the answer is no unless a light is on near it. This product was specifically designed to work well with artificial lights, daylight and especially in direct sunlight and it works just beautifully in direct sun, my main reason for purchasing it.
The read screen itself (without the glowlight surround) is 3-5/8" wide by 4-7/8" high.
Very dark grey
Yes mine has the android type-it's very small and compatable with some phones.
It not slow. It is your internet that's slow.
Very much. Both my 9&4yr old csn use it
Do not buy this e-reader. It is very, very outdated. I have had many e-readers since I bought this one, and they all had longer battery life, better contrast, and a lighter weight. It was okay for it's time, but really, a modern ebook reader is very cheap. And so is a low-end tablet, which is the best device for internet and e-mails
There are two ways to do this: 1. Once you install Google Play you can get the Kindle App for Tablets, and read them on that. 2. The Calibre eBook app for computers has plugins available which allow you to convert books you've bought between different formats to use on different devices.
I have the Kindle & my daughter has the Nook. We share by loading books on to our computer on a free program called Calibre. Calibre has a "convert" feature that converts back & forth from Mobi to epub or epub to Mobi since they require different formats (or pdf, etc...) then we load to the other person's reader. Works fabulously!
You must buy a Nobel gift card. iTunes gift card only work on apple products
No, for classic 6g models you will need a 80 or 160gb hard drive. 30gb is not compatible
LOL, just as I read this, I received an e-mail not more than three minutes ago from Amazon. Delivery date of 29 November. Edit: delivered yesterday.
The one I received is matte, which seems to be the same that others I've read online (from other vendors than Amazon) have gotten.
18 and 1/2 inches high, 27 and 1/4 wide. the stand adds 2 and 1/4 inches to the height. The bezel on 3 sides is 1 inch thick. the bottom is about 2 inches thick.
The camera is a color camera. It produces color video as long as there's light. The camera doesn't work under complete darkness as it doesn't carry any infrared LEDs.
When I bought this external drive my PC was on XP. I have not tried it with Win 7 or Win 8. However, it should work just fine and if not the driver for Win 8 should be easy to find at either MS website or the manufacturer's website.
It does, but it wont play dvds, only cds which kind of sucks : (
Yes-Used them in a surefire led tactical light. One drawback- when its out, it's OUT. Keep the charged spares in glove case on belt or do a weekly ( or more frequent) 'swap out'.
Some of my batteries work better than others, but they all suddenly quit giving a very dimm light. These batteries have a voltage regulator that cuts bellow certain voltage (3.2 v). Their regular voltage is not 3 volts but more than 3.6 up to 4.1 v. What kind of voltage regulator they have? Just to cut below certain voltage. I don't think these are good batteries for electronic devices. At least those that require 3 volts. Bad bad.
Yes... This will work all over the globe.
It work perfectly thanks
I would think so, as long as it has a micro SD port.
yes it work very well
You need to check the spec sheet for your unit. You can find it on the Garmin web site. If it accepts a MicroSD card then this storage device should work on your unit. The biggest issue is what size to get since that will depend on the maps you want to download to your Garmin. I installed a 4GB storage device and it was just large enough to hold the maps for the lower 48 states. If you want to download more maps, (i.e. Canada, etc.) than that you will need a larger storage device.
Yes it does
I don't know the answer to that. Sorry
No, that's what I bought it for and it didn't do anything.
This is an AC power cord that plugs into a 120V AC wall socket. If your DirectTV receiver box has the same connector and power spec, you can use the AC power cord for the DirectTV.
The package includes the drive, USB cable and power Adapter. As you may know this is a legacy item and the original CD package does not have drivers for newer Operating Systems. We have the latest Iomega driver (Released in 2008) that we can email you. If you have a new computer with newer operating System, you may consider a Zip 100 USB powered that works well in Win XP and Win 7. Thanks, Comet Enterprises, Inc. (801) 436-0000
I have not done it, but the back of the charger does list 100-240 volt.
Yep.
No!
Well, I think so. The small left click button I believe will turn it on and off. I never did use it to scroll while I had mine hooked up. I don't think it is worth the price it is fetching now, but I will say it is the very best mouse I have ever used, for comfort and precision and speed. I am using the Logitech Marble and it is ok but not as good as the FX.
It is not a radio - it is only a headset.
"Anything"? Well, not everything, I guess, but they plug into my Motorola T5000 radios. Up there in the description, it says, "Compatible with Spirit GT Series and TalkAbout FR50/60; TA280/289; T5000 and T6000 series radios." To see if it's compatible with your radio, you might Search for your brand and model with the word "headset" after it. If you see a headset that says it's compatible with YOUR radios AND, say, the Motorola T5000, that means THIS headset "should" work for you.
I have motorola flip phone and don't want to work
If it has the single pin for the headset then yes it will work.
I'm not quite sure what you're asking, but I have used the drive numerous times to copy floppy disks created on Windows XP to my computer's hard drive running Windows 7. However not all XP programs will work in the Windows 7 operating system. All of the files like excel, winword, etc. created on a floppy and transferred to the 7 hard drive were usable by the programs. Hope this helps.
Excellent. It read the floppy and was able to save and transfer files
Hi, sony DCR-TRV310 is high end and plays any tapes (8mm, Hi8 as well as digital8). Take care, Norman. 310-968 0555 east coast
According to their webiste (https://www.brother-usa.com/Labeling_Solutions/ModelDetail/7/PT80/supp#.U0bnSfldV8E), yes the M231 Black-On-White Label Tape will work with the Brother PT-80 Labeler.
No. I have another machine that takes TZ tapes and the cartridges are different.
It should since safety glass has plastic layers. Check with the mfg.
I am not sure. I have not been able to use it yet. But am looking to get back into it when time allows. Sorry :-(
Yes
As long as it's equiped with mini jack!
Mine is connected to a Sony 4 speaker system. However my Optimus 20 band EQ is hooked up to a 5.1 sound system. It may be possible.
Of course you can. Well, I could at least.
It's a coiled cord. These are very decent headphones, imo, probably one of the best bangs for the buck. My son is pretty particular when it comes to tech devices, and this is one of the only items that he owns, where he's completely satisfied, and doesn't feel the need to upgrade, even when offered. But I digress, again, the cord is coiled. :)
No
No, there is no external antenna jack. The offers you are seeing probably have the wire antenna attached to the radio's antenna. This is a good system that works. However, there may be interference on FM. You can unhook the antenna for FM listening.
For the radio it fits no. The radio has to be a more powerful reciever then a dia pole antena would work.
I have one the I put on our soap dispenser and it's still there from last year. This container gets wet frequently and it is still holding. I assume because plastic does not attract moisture than paper. Make sure you wipe the surface first before puting the label. You can also put a magic tape on top after sticking the label to avoid moisture if you want to finish the paper label first.
I myself have not used them outdoors, but my husband said that it doesn't work on wood, but it does on plastic. Make sure that the plastic stakes are clean, use a little alcohol rub on it first & wipe clean. Hope this helps.
I believe it will because its says Letratag (LT), but to be such you may need to visit Dymo.com or contact them. I looked at one of their newer LT models and it's cartridge looks of the same size and design. :)
Yes it is. Personally, I used to use this in my room to split my sole cat5 into multiple ones for my computer and gaming consoles.
Yes it can. I have used it from one of the Caribbean islands. Unfortunately it's method of communication is by dialing a regular telephone number not via the internet and those telephone numbers are all in the US, Puerto Rico and I believe the US Virgin Islands. So you would have to dial a number in one of those locations to send or receive emails. On the positive side it is a very short call. It dials in, sends email that you have written offline, downloads email sent to you and hangs up.
Yes. Email service is provided by Landel Telecom. Call them once you get the MailBug to establish service, and pick your own email address at that time. _Landel Support
Email Service is only $12.95 per month with no strings, contracts, or hassles. _Landel Support
mine did - however, I could NOT get the device to sync with a new version of Windows XP PC. I had to use my 'old' Windows XP PC in order to sync it up. I tried several converters - from the 9 pin to a USB - none worked for me. If I had to purchase a PDA today, I would NOT buy one of these. The screen is an odd color and is hard to read in some lighting. Truthfully, I'm waiting for it to die so I can buy something newer.
Yes, and there are other options as well. I use this resource to check on camera/film options for my Polaroids: http://en.polaroid-passion.com/polaroid-image-spectra-cameras.php?id=37
Yes... The binaculars can be mounted on a tripod. I use mine for bird watching and work great. A special adapter needs to be purchased for some tripods.
For the price, I'm thinking probably 2 layers; the instructional material that came with them did not give any information.
I don't know the answer, but this question should be directed to someone at Amazon, hopefully to make its way to someone who could actually address and fix this problem (I find it annoying too--unless reviewers list all the details and specs in their reviews, it's impossible to know which magnification or model they are telling about). I think these questions and answers are simply for the customers to ask and help each other, so no one from Amazon would see your question.
Length of mine is 4 inches and width is 3inches. Have no idea where the 7 comes from.
Hi Reen. We'll verify this with the relevant team and will let you know as soon as we have an update.
yes 200 asa gold Kodak Discontinued try Fugi 200 same quality and not expired
Expired film that's all Color films could have color shift issues or be just fine if you scan it you can fix the problem in Photoshop most pro photo labs will adjust the prints color shift and you will not notice anything.
I was able to use this with my electric weed eater. The only issue I had was that the cord was too short to get to any distance in my yard. I found that a 75-100 foot cord worked better. Hope this helps.
Got them July or August 2012, and 20+ hours a week since I got them. I got them instead of computer speakers.
It's a direct pull-up.
Yes you can.
Yes as long as you have a 3.5 mm stereo jack port which as I just checked the kindle fire has
These have no volume control. Control the volume from the device they are connected to.
Yes
The only Canon camera listed in the 510 group is the SX510 HS, It has only one lens used on this camea. I have not found any other lens usable on this camera. Please check and confirm the exact model that you need info about. If you are looking for info about a xs510hr, you will have to check with a Canon camera dealer as I have no info on that particular model. Good luck
I bought a pair directly from Canon repair department. But the REASON was not to replace them, but to get something that fits better.... new 10x30 cups. I had to do surgery on the new ones, but, ahhhh, cups that fit my eyes! Canon apparently thinks that people who want higher power have different shaped heads, go figure....
Yes. All EF lenses are compatible with all the DSLRs.
It works great on my Cannon t3. Don't know about the t3i.
yes. the 2000 can use any EF lens
Sorry I don't know the seller should know.
I believe it can be used for both Nikon and Canon. I use it for my Nikons and an Olympus.
gib - I really don't know - is that something you could google?
Not from the image I see. I have that on an older etrex hc. I went to the Garmin website and found this part number 010-11023-00. Do a search on Amazon for that part.
No, unfortunately it won't. I had to mount it to another mount that fits on a thicker handlebar.
Can't say for sure. Mine was a Etrex Hcx Legend, and this was not compatable with it. Good luck.
I had thought about using screws myself, but it is a bit difficult to try and keep the "flap" open while trying to drill holes and putting screws in. If you try it, I'd use very very flat head screws. I just used thin wood .... I believe even popsicle sticks would do....pre-drill small holes in them, use little tacks to minimize damage to walls....then use the tape again the popsicle sticks, avoiding the adhesive on your drywall.
Hi Gary, I am familiar with the RC-5, which is the same as the RC-6. The difference being that the RC-6 has two settings for shutter release. That said, I am not familiar with your camera model. I did look on the web a bit and could not find enough information for me to be able to say one way or the other. If you camera owners manual does not mention IR shutter release control, then it may not have that feature. I suggest contacting Canon and asking them. Sorry I could not be more helpful.
I haven't had any issues with the strap. The curved part on the top of strap should be placed such that it curves toward the neck. It does not "stick" but rather is rough to use friction of clothing. I don't wear slick shirts so it stays in place with realative ease.
I am a part-time reporter for a weekly newspaper, so I have a lot of extras. I carry my main camera, a Canon Rebel EOS, in a small case that I can grab on a moment's notice. I also bought this bag to house my video camera, all my lenses and other gadgets, even 2 expandable tripods. It holds everything neatly and safely. I looked at many bags before deciding on this one, and I feel this one is the best by far. It's well constructed - Canon quality. I would recommend this bag to anyone, professional or hobbyist.
This is the correct remote for the 60D. The 40D uses an RS-80N3.
Yes
I just came back from a vacation and shot over 1000 photographs using a G9 and the 220ex. I did not notice any red eyes in my photographs during evening photographs. I used the flash on all my shots, to fill in and they all came out great.
I wear sunglasses with these, and usually I do the same thing you do. I pull them down to look through better. This is just a replacement for the standards eye cup, so it will not solve your issue.
I now own the T2i, and I believe the eye cup from the RebelXT will fit it. I sold the RebelXT, so I can't do a comparison side-by-side.
It fit my canon 60d perfectly.
Hi, yes, it does have the fire wire connection. Sony calls this the iLink, but it is actually a fire wire connection. Let me know if you have any additional questions! Thanks so much! - Josh
The one I bought here on Amazon does. Simple to call or email Canon here in the USA and confirm it.
Not sure but for what I've found, it really doesn't weigh much. I don't think it's all that necessary. It isn't like a large zoom lens that far outweighs the camera body. It is a great lens and I absolutely love it.
Yes, as long as the 5th button is activated... but also you have to be careful of not exceeding ohms and watts, instructions tell you the limits.
Speaker impedance limits are really determined by your amplifier / receiver. The switch should not care whether your speakers are 4, 6, or 8 ohms. However, you may notice, if mixing speakers with different impedances, that when played simultaneously, one pair is louder than the other.
Height 2 1/4 in, width 11 in, depth is 4 3/4 from button to speaker jacks in the back
Yes it do!!! The 60D is EFmount. Buy this ! &#128077;&#127999;
Don't have. http://m.dpreview.com/products/canon/lenses/canon_28-200_3p5-5p6_usm
It's works. Because it is an EF lens. And tath lens is awesome.
This may be the most absurd question related to this analog camera. And the answer is "no"!!!
Not a digital camera, only records images on film.
I use it on my 40D. It works well for me but I do not know how to calibrate.
Yes.
I believe one grounds you so that is all you need.
Hi Daniel. Yes, the package includes the Anti-Static Wristband itself and the instructions for use paper/manual.
it has the standard shielding of any cat 5 cable
Hello Akshata. The Hi-Speed USB 2.0 Cable should work with the HP Photosmart 6520 printer since they have the same-shaped USB cable ends.
Actual size of picture is 3"X3"; total size of each film including the border is 3 1/2" by 4 1/4"
I don't think Poloroid film is being made any more. The only Polaroid film available, is expired. Isn't this true?
I actually changed the jack plug to the smaller one so that I don't need an adaptor. You won't blow your eardrums but you will get a good volume.
No
These filters are threaded Male by female, so one end has 52mm male threads (camera lens side), and the other end is 52mm female threads ( so you can stack another filter in front for special effects)
52mm is the thread size. Just simply look on the end of your lens, there should be a circle with a dash through it, that's the filter diameter measurement.
Hello. I'm not sure what you're referring to with the "extinction ratio" of the filter. If you are perhaps referring to the filter factor - i.e. the amount of f-stop exposure compensation when using the filter with a manual exposure camera or light meter - I believe for this particular filter that value is 1. Tiffen has a small section on Filter Factors you may find helpful here: http://www.tiffen.com/tiffen_edu_camera_filters.html Please let us know if there is anything else we can assist with. Deven Morgan Event Cameras
Let me quote Tiffen (go to their website's FAQ section): "The Tiffen Circular Polarizer is not multicoated at all. We used to carry TMC (Tiffen multicoated) filters but found no significant difference in their light transmission and also that the coating could be easily damaged, resulting in poorer performance. In any case, multicoating is a proprietary process, and we seriously doubt that any lens or filter manufacturer will tell you the exact nature and composition of their coating layers."
No compensation on this filter
10 inserts for 20 pages
No
Metal &#128077;
More than likely not (depending upon the color). But try the color filter out and determine if you need the other one.
These filters are threaded Male by female, so one end has 52mm male threads (camera lens side), and the other end is 52mm female threads ( so you can stack another filter in front for special effects)
I would think that a graduated neutral density filter would be better for sunsets.
Check the lens to see what size filter they require!
MADE IN USA
Yes you can...
It depends on the diameter of the lens where the threads are for attaching filters. I'd guess that a zoom of that size has a larger diameter than the 58mm filter. You could measure the diameter, but the most foolproof way is to take it to a store and find a filter that fits.
Yes, it is. Good quality, too.

don't buy this uncoated filter. ghosts. I bought it, never used it, never bother to return to amazon.
Of course. yes.

Nicola- I would not think it should take that long. I don't see this order in my system so you must have ordered from someone else. Hope this helps. Lori at Polygraphics Products
if its a cannon mount it should but read the tech info for that lens before buying
Yes, The T3i can use any lens with an EF or EF-S mount.
don't buy this uncoated filter. ghosts. I bought it, never used it, never bother to return to amazon.
Yes sir. http://www.tiffen.com/canon_lens_to_filter_chart.html

I believe so. Mine is 62 (Tarman) & 67 (canon) they all fit perfectly. it is an industry standard.
I really can't help with this. I did take a picture of the moon with my "point and shoot" camera by just pointing it through the eyepiece and it was quite successful. I think it is possible to buy attachments that will allow one to attach a DSLR in place of the eyepiece and take pictures, but I have never tried that - would need some research.
Not sure, but it should. I have an A65 and it works very well. Some people complain bc the zoom is in the opposite direction. I don't find this a problem. Minimum focal distance is like a foot which is also nice.
Yes
OH HELL YES THIS CAM DOES IT ALL
It uses minidv. To me it had been a major shortcoming as it has "eaten" some vital footage 3rd time using it due to time coding issues on the tape when stopping and starting frequently
No, there is no strong odor that I can detect.
The sockets are just under 1.5" edge to edge, or 2.5" from the center of each socket to the center of the next socket. They are closer together than they appear from the stock photo.
I would say yes. I am using a short ext cord on a scanner and everything is working fine. Make sure the ext cord is the right size to handle the load.
Remove m power, plug tv directly into wall and see if tv turns off. If it doesn't turn off, your m power is over heating and possibly shorting out. It's very possible that your tv is over heating as well. Remember these conditioners only clean and stabilize power. Hope this was helpful
The outlets are spaced far enough apart that bricks should not block adjacent outlets. I've never had any trouble plugging in bricks and other power cords into it.
The cable you see in the picture. Your power supply (inside the computer) should have some extra plugs.
Approx. 12 feet.
These ones don not change positions. It is what you in the picture.
It's rated for 1200 watts, so I'm guessing ... yeah, it will.
On the back of the unit there are holes that enable mounting with screws. That's what I did with mine too. You'll need to supply your own screws. Cheers
That is a tough question to answer...If they are turning themselves on because you are getting a spurious signal through your building wiring then the answer is "MAYBE". You wouldn't know until you tried it. I suppose you could buy one and if it didn't work you could return it for a refund. That's about the best answer anybody is going to be able to give you...
It comes with installed IOS
I bought mine for a scanner. They plug into my laptop. They also come with an adapter to fit the big stereo jack. I have an old tube style TV. I don't know if either of those jacks will fit yours. I'm sure that you can find an adapter that will fit your TV. I Hope this helps .........
Yes
I'm sure they are durable enough, however they are somewhat bulky. Compact 'backpacking' binoculars might be a better choice for your saddlebags.
FYI: I've never bought a lens that didn't come with a front & rear lens cap, and I believe every lens made ships with both. Oddly enough, some Canon lenses do not come with hoods, though this one does.
Yes.
Yes, you should be able to use it in Denmark. The ESP 950 should come with both 120v.and European 220v. adapters. Check with Koss just to be safe.
Yes, the KOSS ESP 950 comes with the E-90 amp, and can only be driven by that amp, unless you re-terminate the cans' cable, or at least the extension cable (a second extension can be purchased from Koss) to fit a pro-bias Stax (or other similar e-stat) amp/transformer.
I only use it for vegetables, so really can't say. The bottom of the steamer basket is 6" across, if that helps.
Haven't tried it, but I'm confident that it would. A handle pushes the wire up against a spinning wheel which causes it to wind, so really any wire/cable should be able to be wound.
I received 2 standard mounts in the box. You can undock and quickly connect to a 2nd location.
Pentax K5iis has 1.5 crop so it would be 42mm on it.
No, but you DO need to purchase one, as the front element is very exposed and image-quality suffers w/o one. I got a rubber, collapsable one
no. you can only use "M" type lenses.
yes.
26 double sided pages with 4 slots on each side (208 total). Also inside the front cover has 16 slots.
Mine never did work. I had already put all my info into it so I didn't dare send it back. I had no way to get it out of the palm so I took a hammer to it and chalked it up to a loss.
Does not come with tripod adaptor but will adapt to one
The weight and stability would be fine. I used them for hunting and holding them for extended periods of time. The viewing area I don't think would be great for the fast action of football. Depending on the stadium the 300 level would be the only area I would attempt using these binos.
Internal memory is built into the camera. Not all digital cameras have any internal memory. Additional memory may be added to some cameras in the form of "chips." But such memory can be in one of several forms. You must check the camera's specifications to determine what type of memory it takes, if any, and how much memory it can use. Whether additional memory comes with the camera is up to the vendor. Typically it does not, but some vendors might include it in a "package."
only a guess since I had purchased this for my nephew not myself. but I would think it means to tell you it's charging and probably will change to a solid color when done charging.
Yes . A full function remote is included which can also be used to program the order you want the discs , and tracks to play in and can also be used to program songs into another usb type mp3 player.
It has single disc shuffle and multi disc shuffle. Here is a link to an online manual. https://docs.sony.com/release/CDPCE375.pdf You may have to copy this address into your address bar to view the manual. I
yes, you can play them with this camera. I recently used it to transfer my old 'Hi8' tapes to digital.
Doesn't need batteries to operate (well the meter does, common watch 1.5's you can get anywhere). They last for years.
I think its made in Pittsburgh ;&lt;" :&gt;) "&gt;/
Likely not, as it's not self-powered. The T2i requires self-powered microphones.
Yes, you can. I bought this camera for that sole purpose. I have many old tapes and they all played well.
Yes. Only depends on what kind of adapter ring you're using. The ones without glass would only do macro.
I am pretty sure it will not autofocus on the D80.......does the D80 have a built in motor? so I would say only in manual mode
Probably not, it did not work for AF on my D5000, I got this lens with my N70 years ago, still a good lens though.
It is not compatible with the camera but will flash off when shutter button is pressed. The SB50 DX would flash but not sync with latest Nikon cameras.
Manual only. Will be 21mm full frame eqivilant. Go with Tokina 11-16. New model out now. . Best bang for buck.
Yes
Yes, it will work but you will have to consider the cropping factor.
Yes it should work fine. I have the same setup on my D7100 and the results are great. Slightly more difficult to focus on small distant objects with the teleconverter attached.
f4.0. The DX format does not affect the aperture, only the effective field of view and focal length. That lens on a DX is the equivalent of a 450mm on an FX format camera.
absolutely yes.
No
Id say pick the 17-35 if you intend to stay on DX size for another 5yrs... the 50mm covers the middle of the 24-70 so moving your feet will cover that distance, but the 17-35 will allow for group shots and landscapes/buildings... the 24 will limit that somewhat.... my2cents!
Whenever it says "AF" it is Auto Focus.
Yes, this lens covers a full frame, which includes 35mm film.
yes, it will work with D70.
Yes, it fully works with nikon d7000.
It can only be focused manually on the Nikon D40x I believe... according to this website (http://www.nikonians.org/reviews?alias=nikon-slr-camera-and-lens-compatibility). I usually use it to check body compatibility with lenses. This lens will work with your camera manually, but the auto focus will not work. Hopefully this helps!
Yes, I couldn't imagine a better lens for it.
No
Very Well. Enjoy.
I bought it for speech to text and it works just great.
I would say no, the antenna is only about 1/8 thick.
I would do it two ways drill a hole in the middle of the roof run the coax thru that way or I would put the antenna to the back run the coax thru the hatch thru the paneling to the front run it down to under the rug to the cb
Walgreens usually carries these for $9.99 on sale, $11.99 regular price. I just checked two weeks ago they had a couple of pairs in stock. I bought my last ones at Target for $10.00. This seller is smoking crack! $94.99 would be a decent price for a pack of 10 if you could forgo shipping costs. Check Walgreens.
Sony discontinued these, which caused a severe shortage of a popular design and sound. Simple supply and demand. Sellers are forced to pay super high prices and thus have to charge super high prices because they are so hard to find and so expensive. Sonxtronic xdr-8000 or xdr-8001 is a similar product that has more supply at this time.
Just reduces white noise. My opinion.
Unfortunately, no. The OS system is outdated.
Yes
It sounds like you may have a bad unit. These buttons act like old radio buttons, push one in and the others pop out. Only one button can be pressed in at a time.
It is a simple manual s-video/composite (rca) switch. It will work with anything that has those outputs...
Measure in millimeters across the inside diameter of the outer front ring of the lens.
Does not use so card, only minidv
The one I got from Amazon is a piece of junk. Not in good shape. Does not have USB/mp3 potential. I would not buy this - especially from this provider.
Mine did not come with head phones.
Yes, it should.
hellono like most appliances it doesn't just go to your local hardware store like home depot pick up some rechargeable batteries for it as it comes with the cord for recharging in the truck and your mouth to buy any batteries for ever. I hope this helps. we use ours for the time trials at Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah and it works great.
Yes if you are in range of there Cb Radio.
I use my CB for communicating while off roading; I never timed it but I would say a couple of hours depending on what rechargeable battery you purchase. I typically plug mine in the night before I use it or if I forget the night before I plug it while I am driving to the off road location.
No ,it is quiet.
Should use full... Does on my 2004 jetta
It works with the double cube speaker so as long as the single cube speaker has a female threaded mount on the rear of the speaker, it should.
No
I use them for my stereo and they work fine.
Hi Jeff, NP-FM50 Battery is a legitimate Sony battery model. -Vincent
The NP-FM50 I ordered is the real thing. They say Sony right on the battery.
Yes
Yes but if you register product with tripp lite , you can have a replacement rather quick . I have had two units hit and replaced get product
No problems, no interference, good product
They appear to be the same, but 806 is marketed as the "new" model. I couldn't find any difference between them, either should be fine. I have been using a Logitech marble mouse for more than 5 years, and highly recommend it as a person who works with computers all the time. It does have a short time adjustment for non-tech people, but I believe it is an easy transition with lots of benefits. You can set the buttons as shortcut keys too.
I have mine hooked up to the TEAC AG-790A Stereo Receiver (bought on Amazon and very happy) and then from the receiver to the Sony SSF-5000 Floor Standing 3-way Speaker (Pair). Great sound and can't beat the price. I also went to Best Buy and bought a cable to plug my Iphone into the receiver for $10. Over all a great system for under $350.TEAC AG-790A Stereo ReceiverSony SSF-5000 Floor Standing 3-way Speaker (Pair)
Hi Greg, since the Sony V825CLH Cassette Head Cleaner is not a product that you use regularly, this will defintely last for a long time not unless you break it physically. -Vincent
It definitely helped our situation. Our camcorder playback was rough and uneven (after several years on no-use), both video and audio. It did take quite a few times running the cleaning tape--but eventually it made both the audio and video both function quite well.
I have never experienced that event. However, I never got the machine to block numbers that were a nuisance. I found that having ID Caller on my phone to identify the caller. If it is someone/thing I do not know, I do not answer. Works every time!
Yes, I have used this drive on both Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.
No, what are you smoking? This is from the 90's. Use a USB stick.
I don't know. All my pc's I've used it with are not Mac's.
Manual
What is MS8? Do you mean Microsoft 8? I know it syncs fine with Microsoft Word and Excel. I think it would do fine no matter what the systems and programs. These things seem to be able to download or use whatever it takes to make them work. I dread the day when there will be no more Palms. It is still the coolest thing invented that one can enjoy without the cyberspace clutter. Good Luck!
You will not get the same results.regular black white is cheaper
Search "HomeSpot NFC-enabled Bluetooth Audio Receiver for Sound System" in amazon. There is also the Logitech one which works well as that was the first one I bought but they are a little more expensive. I think I bought the Belkin one and returned it.
No, there is no difference. Best Buy is the only one of our retailers that sells this system.
Hi David, You will use the A/V connecting cable for this camcorder to be connected to your VCR. Thanks. &gt;Joffrey
No, and I had to return (in less than 24hs) the item because it did not work with my tapes. Besides, they charged me additional (+/-) 40% for handling.
No. It did not come with a remote.
It should work as it's a MiniDV Handycam.
It's about 14 gauge, enough for any normal use especially if your speaker runs are 50 feet or less.
isn't catv cable? i know sat is at a higher freg. and some cable componets dont work as well as ones made for sat. if for some reason you have spliced 2 pieces of coax together using a 'regular' male-male connector it restricts flow and can burn-out. the coax from the dish isn't even the same type cable uses.
Hi, Below is the Product Description from Your Website, which has it in mm: From the Manufacturer Monster Cable Retro Logo OD Size XP CI = 7mm +/- 0.2mm Product Description Patented Magnetic Flux Tube construction for natural music reproduction : Linear Polyethylene (LPE) insulation reduces dielectric signal loss for greater clarity : Unique round shape and smooth, flexible jacket for easy installation : Packaged on a convenient 100 foot spool
I sure thought it did, but after looking my camera over thoroughly I do not think it does, but wish it did.
I ordered mine on line from radio shack. Radio Shack is cheaper if you order on line from my experience. Be sure to get the correct cord. I had to re-order, but you can go to the Sony web site to find the correct item & description.
This would be great. It doesn't rattle at all and the bass is "just enough" in my opinion.
Hi Carlos, this tripod is not compatible with the camera. You can only connect this to camcorders that have LANC ports. Thanks_Mitch
I'm typing this from the Microsoft Natural Elite plugged into a regular Macbook. It also works fine on other Macs I've used. The 'Windows' key becomes the Command (Apple) key.
You can purchase maps of Utah from the U.S. Forest Service.It accepts downloaded maps from Mapsource.
Go to radio shack ask for patch cord it works for computer at need adapter for mp3. Ask radio shack or best buy geeks would kniw
Check the specs on your scope. It will tell you the diameter of the lenses and other inserts. i do not know the specifics of your scope but as long as the diameter is the same, then this item should work.
Yes, it should. Your camera has an E-mount (the part where the lens attaches to the camera). You will require an E-mount to T-ring adapter, so this piece can screw in. I think this piece is appropriate, but you should research it first. I also didn't look at prices, I just picked the first result that looked correct when searching "E-mount T-ring adapter". http://www.amazon.com/Opteka-T-Mount-Adapter-NEX-VG10-NEX-VG20/dp/B00DOAPX0A/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1414467146&sr=1-2&keywords=E-mount+t-ring+adapter
Just one (1) bracket.
I'm not sure. I had to return the ones I orded because the wouldn't mount to my speakers.
No it does not need to be plugged in. For more see my Amazon review of it.
Yes it will, however, this unit is so old. I'd consider newer models.
I had them installed in my 1996 extended cab S-10 without issue, if that's any help to you.
I'm not sure. I've never had the problem with blurriness. It does take the glare off the screen so that might help.
I have not owned a gold one but if you adjust your brightness on the black one it is very hard to see. Plus you have the shiny and matte finish to the black one so you could flip it and play with it to see what works.
Not really. I did not have problems with fogging but it does nto say they were waterproof and I try to keep them dry.
Sorry bought them for my husband. I have no idea. He works a lot and hasn't had much time to use them. I use them to look at animals in the back yard and I can see the mountains but I really don't know how far that is.
Yes
The device should not have any problems with the Sidewinder 3D Pro. But to make sure, I suggest you check the compatibility of your device with the Windows 7 OS.
I did not use on the 8.1 Windows, so unfortunately I am not able to answer this questions
Not that I know of. try the Vendor
just got my white 10FT, item # 27163. It got "TYPE CMG 24AWG 4PR 75C (UL) E126126-DG CSA LL58663 FT4 ETL VERIFIED TIA/EIA-568-B.2 CAT.6 PATCH CABLE UTP 500MHZ" on it. I ordered it directly from Amazon.
I assume the question is "will this KVM switch work with a wireless mouse". Although I have not used it with a wireless mouse, I see no reason to believe that it would not work. However, it may be necessary to connect your wireless mouse to each of the two systems directly first so that any software that needs to be downloaded from the USB device can be downloaded. Once that is accomplished, everyting should work fine.
Straight plug, i.e. the cord does not hang flat against the wall but sticks out perpendicular from the outlet (the usual orientation for most plugs).
Yes, it is absolutely safe!
Honestly, I do not know.
I'm sorry I don't know. It doesn't fit the sweater shaver I bought so I gave it away
45 (L) x 37 (W) x .76 (T) mm.
This cable is about 3 feet long and can be split as far down as you like. Just by pulling apart the two wires, you could really turn this into two cables if you like.
the plug is rca to 1/4 and is standard RCA and 1/4, so if your stuff use this kind of plug it should be okay.
Yes. I used it to combine a couple of RCA cables I had laying around instead of buying a new longer one.
Your friend is right i bought by accident thinking both ends were stereo but the big end is not so if you use like you say you are losing half your sound from your source
shouldn't be a problem as long as the case doesn't extend too far from the tab.....if a standard set of earbuds or headphones will fit this will also..
sorry , i really dont know
As long as the mikes have 3.5mm connectors it should work fine...signals don't care what direction they travel in...
The led tv needs to be way cool and off when you clean it.
Short answer, yes. But you won't be able to split the channels (L/R) on your interface. As you are going into a mono input this shouldn't be an issue.
It's what ever side you hook it to is the side you get(if you hook it to the right side your only going to get right side effects. I have one on my electronic drum kit to add an extra cymbal, but whatever I set me module to that's what both cymbals sound like. Hope this helps
No - This is a mono connection, which splits in to two mono connections. you can tell by the little black line on the male end of the cable in the picture. If it were a stereo cable, there would be two lines there instead of one. For a stereo version of this cable, take a look at http://www.amazon.com/Hosa-YPP117-inch-Dual-Cable/dp/B000068O54
No, you do not need a center channel speaker to hear voices. If listening in stereo or mono you will hear all the audio there is to hear.
Both are plug in
Found that the antenna does an excellent job of pulling in stations that I could not get before I purchased the antenna. Not sure I had any buzzing, just a lot of static that went away when I placed the antenna on top of my radio. I'm now pulling in an AM station that is over 100 miles away. Get it loud and clear now. Couldn't get it at all before I got the antenna.
Yes it comes as a complete assembly attaching to the binoculars.
it charged both my iphone 5 and my Ipad 2 Did not try with an ipad air. :)
Yes they will fit a xbox 360 headset. I purchased these a while back and they fit perfectly. They also seem to be of better quality than the Microsoft version cushions.
I'm not 100% sure but I think the computer's mic port is for input only. There is a separate port for audio output. This connector is made for headset ports which have both. So unless your computer has a specific headset port, I don't think this would work.
Tripp Lite's website specs say: "UL1449 let through rating 400, 500, 500", so if my understanding of surge protector-related stuff is accurate, this little unit is probably not the best choice for sensitive and/or expensive electronics like computers, TVs, etc... I use mine for cordless phone charging bases and microwave ovens.
Surge protector are designed to stop the flow of current to your electrical device. This product is no different. It would either have to be reset or replaced depending on how heavy of a surge it received.
Hi Cheryl O'Hea. I'm not sure, my usage for the device was for online computer classes needs. But I never got to use it because it needed USB connection not phone. Sorry I can't help
No, it doesn't.
No it does not I ordered it as a replacement for my Plantronics phone T10 the connection is wired through a modem. Hope that answers your question have a good day.
yes
Compre the dimensions B 4 U make the purchase
I am not sure of the correct answer. I moved Word documents written on a Windows ME old computer to an old floppy disk. Then using the LaCie external.drive I downloaded them to my iMac computer operating on the Snow Leopard system. I used a Share-Ware pogrgron called Neo-Office to convert the Word files to the version of Word on my Apple computer. I also transferred Geneology files in the Gedcom format using the LeCie external drive. It worked well also. I did this with the help of the instructors at the Apple Retail Store in Monterey CA.
Unfortunately not this is for wired connections only
NO!!!
I use a Netcom GN8000. I don't know about Plantronics. The jack is modular like a phone jack.
Not sure, we are using Toshiba
Hi. That is intended for mounting the Belkin Surgemaster; it stabilizes the unit.
Yes, it will still supply power.
No, it does not include the CD.
it depends on which calculator you are trying to connect. from comments, the common TI calculators seem to work just fine. I know with my TI 86 i had to make a WinXP virtual machine because the TI connect software (wich ran fine on win8) wouldn't let me edit TI86 programs and the TI graphlink software for TI 86 wouldn't run on win8. if you are not using an obscure/discontinued calculator, you should be fine
I believe so, it comes with a controller.
Try NEWEGG http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16882999163
I do not have a Canon XF100 Video Camcorder. If it has a 58mm lens with threads on lens so you can screw on a filter than yes this would work. I did a Google search for filters for the XF100 Camcorder and it looks like it should work.
Yes
From the wall...6in to the back of the trail and 17 1/2 in the front of the tray
It has a standard IDE & Molex connector...if your power supply only has SATA you can buy the converters for about $5...I found them on newegg.com - if your motherboard doesn't have an IDE port, I'm sure you could find an IDE to SATA converter too.
I've used it at board meeting at times but the mike I've used and is incredibly good is the Olympus ME-51S Stereo Microphone. Yes it cost more but at a board meeting with someone sitting almost 30 feet away I still get a good recording, I just turn the volume up a bit.
No clip-on. It's meant to go in the mic/hdphn port of some device, say iphone.
Yes, I currently have two sections of this on my carpet. Not sticky taped though, just covering the cord and stretched out. But it under a bed mattress for a day or two to almost completely eliminate the coiling.
It lays really flat if you put it very hot water and then lay it on a flat surface. The product is less then 3/8 inch
Could you please explain in more detail. Are you trying to say you would like to use this item to connect via Wi-Fi? If so, then no, you cannot do that with this item, this item is just a switch. What you need is a Wireless Router.
Yes it will. It is the PC2700 type of 333Mhx memory stick.
sync with an iPad? If you mean play via AirPlay, you'll need a receiver that's capable. but yes, that's what I do.
Yes. Two speakers.
Bose 161 speakers are designed for back surround sound for home theater systems or to use them as book shelf speakers. Do not know if the Bose system 111 has speaker outlets or enough power to produce good sound for 161. 161 Speakers are compatible with amplifiers or receivers rated 10-100 watts per channel.
The User's manual is at http://worldwide.bose.com/productsupport/assets/pdf/guides/speakers/151/en/owg_en_151.pdf Copy and paste doesn't work because Bose "secured" their PDF document.
I've been using it on my T3 for a few months now. I don't see why it wouldn't work on a T3i.
Just rotate the hood counterclockwise
This lens fits perfect on tne 60d.
Yes it works perfectly but doesn't come with the lenses
yes
SB400/700/and 910 from the chart on Nikons site.
My Nikon FM-10 body was made in Japan.
Kimberly, I believe it would work but would not auto focus, I don't know why you would want to use this lens on your camera the focal length would be close to 200 mm a bit too long for portrait work which is what the lens is intended for. Mark
If you mean the Nikon 18-105, this lens cap will not fit. That lens requires a 67mm cap which should also be available from Amazon.
No, this lens cap is for the DSLR cameras that have removable lenses. What you want is the Nikon LC-CP28. See this link: http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-LC-CP28-COOLPIX-Digital-Camera/dp/B00BAZV85A
yes it does, it is MiniDV. Take care, Norman. 310-968 0555 east coast
No, the mega changer needs to be connected to an amplifier. Mine is connected to my Sony Tuner. If you have a problem, phone me at 386-299-7280.
It is the best
I really am not sure, as I purchased for the set time to go off if I fell asleep. The RCA folder said it should work on your Dynex and you would have to program it in. Best read instructions. Sorry....I could not be of more help. This is the best I can tell you from the folder.
YES. On the back of the unit itself, left-hand side, top half, it is stated quite clearly that the SONY ICF-SW7600GR AM/FM is "Made In Japan."
I think the Internet is the best choice.You can listen to these programs on a PC, a smart phone or a WIFI radio. A short wave radio can only receive BBC World Service and BBC maybe doesn't broadcast programs to US by short wave now.You can search frequencies of short wave on this website www.short-wave.info.
Think it's a year, should last you through the warranty. It's built very well.
Probably not. You would need some kind of attachment on your iPad for it to lock into the tripod.
Simply adding two more speakers to your system does not make it a 7.1. You risk burning up the amplifier by having speakers with mismatched impendences. Upgrading your speakers is great but speaker impedances have to match and your amp has to say it can handle that load. Far more bad scenarios then good for what you are looking to do.
You will need the serial cable and software if it is still supported.
yes that is what I have
Looking at the model specifications, it seems the only free slot you have available is a pci-e (express) slot. That's no problem though, here's an example of one with the correct interface: http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833166019&Tpk=rosewill%20rc%20411
It uses compact flash memory card
usa
That depends a lot on the tv. If it's a newer HD with 40 in or larger screen, I doubt thatyou'll see an advantage without the bookshelf speakers Most new tv have decen audio. I use the BIC as a center fill on a high end receiver based system
If you connect the output of the cable box to one of the inputs, then connect the two remote TVs to the outputs, you will be able to view the cable system on the remote TVs. BUT, you will only get one channel at a time; both TVs will see the same channel; you will have to go to the cable box to change channels (unless you have the model with the remote input and get the receiver / transmitter).
I assume you mean handheld walkies, your walkie has to be designed to work on CB frequencies. The cheap handhelds found in most stores almost always work on FRS frequencies.
The 25 is narrower than the 29 and the 148 is the widest, in my opinion the Ltd 29 is the best all around
Yes it does. Great Radio
it is for coax so it is 1 center pin and a shield.
Yes
yes
you can use big wire strippers or one sided razor blade. you need a good set of strippers thats all.. this is the best wire, i have it on my mactonish speakers they were very $$$$. true blue wire, monster.....
yes
Yes, I use these as front left and right speakers in a home theater. They are really good speakers. They are very clear and loud. Good range of sound...highs, lows, mids. I also have bic center speaker and smaller surrounds. You get a lot for the money with bic. I highly recommend them.
The question is for the tripod which answer is yes. However the part you asked about is the attachment that goes on the tripod not the tripod
Hi, you would have to get model gvd800e, I may know someone who has it
Yes, this mount can support your 4.5 pounds jbl n24 speakers, and the standard 1/4"- 20 thread (screw) also fits the speakers mounting sockets
Yes they will.
Not sure. I use it to read/write to a PCMCIA memory card.
No is the short answer.
I'm not quite clear about your question but if you're asking about linear dimensions, they are 8"H 13 and 3/4"W and 8 and 5/8"D.
Nope. This is an optical (digital) audio cable. Your sound bar is an analog input.
No it does not. What you see is what you get.
It is always better to keep the filter to the closest point from your eye. In this case, immediately below the eyepiece. Combining multiple filters may be useful to watch bright phases of moon and venus. For order sake, i would say Barlow, Filter, Eyepiece and Your Eye in order. The filters have thread which can help u screw and pile up. So Enjoy!!
I own 2 pair, 8x25 and 10x50, and love both. My son in law, who wears glasses uses mine and is amazed. "How do they do that?" Is what I always hear.
They are binoculars and yes.
Yes....have used at a few concerts and were excellent
For the price, it's the best sound I've heard. Good clean bass, good midrange and highs. I bought three sets.
Yes if your tv have a plug of 3,5 mm
I've used these earphones with my W7 laptop, android phone and android tablet. No setting to deal with. Just plug it in. If your devise has a 3.5mm earphone jack, it should work.
No its not
Not sure, didn't even notice that, but they work fine.
All end caps for Canon lenses for EOS and EF are standard.
You can use this item for any rechargeable AA or AAA batteries that needs recharging, whether there are fully discharged or otherwise. Does it quickly as well.
Radio Popper makes a module that fits this meter.
yes it dose.
Yes. The loops are designed to fit all standard cameras with straps
No, you can only listen to music
I removed the hard plastic part (I didn't need it) and it fits snug on my Plantronics CS55. the mount for the ear piece is 1.5 inches in diameter. I guess the plastic part is for a different headset.
I'm sorry, I'm unable to answer your question, as I've never used the HT820.
I just checked the manual which I downloaded onto a CD-ROM and apparently you can print from AlphaWord, the resident word processing program, using the Dana's USB port. And if you have a printer that accepts date via an infrared port, you can do it that way, too. I haven't done it personally, since I've used the SD memory card to transfer the documents to my computer for the variety of fonts and formatting choices offered. Hope this helps.
Yes and the range is more like 160-540 this is an awesome lens
Yes I did. I believe my shots are in the customer photos. I did not use an extender, just maxed out at 400mm though I didn't calibrate the sweet spot for the aperture for maximum clarity. I shot both handheld and tripod and I was very amazed by the handheld quality. I was very happy with the results.
Hi this canon 100-400 is f4.5-5.6 while the 70-200 is f2.8. These two lenses are totally different.
Yes; I have both and use them frequently.
It will work with any Canon DSLR body
US and Canada only Does not cover other countries
Short answer: No. Long answer: You need some sort of print server to connect a non-networked printer to a LAN, be it another computer using printer sharing, a specialized device meant for the purpose, or a low-power hobby device that requires a bit of technical know-how such as a Pi, and the latter two options are not guaranteed to work with all printers. That said, you could use this device as a network adapter for a computer lacking one and plug the printer into that computer as well.
Comes with a CD but every google search will tell you the drivers are out of date for the current OS. My computer would not even recognize the adapter. Tried it on an iMac and Macbook.
Both sides are black. The label is mostly black with a bit of space for green label area for writing. They could have changed the label color, as it has been awhile, but I have bought several stacks of this product. The media side is black for better tracking. Seriously. I've found that the black tracks better with the laser as it lets less laser light escape from the media while spinning. WOW, the price has skyrocketed in past years.. Office Depot used to sell this 50 pack for $8!!!! $30 for this??? Expensive.
You'll have to go to Cisco and look for a software patch that will work with Windows 98
Yes it should. i had an sony vaio vgn-a130 and it worked with wpa2 my windows xp pro and all the latest service packed installed.
It depends on the Operating System and if your tower has a PCI slot. It works with the following Operating Systems: *Windows 98SE, Millennium, 2000, and XP
I've used this AP in two different setups. An open warehouse and in my apartment. In the warehouse I could connect reliably at 40 yards. In my apartment I can connect reliably up to 15 feet with only one wall in between my devices and the AP. Any further or any additional walls create an unreliable connection. I should also note that in my building, every channel has at least 1 other wireless network broadcasting on it. Not great in an apartment setup. Excellent in open and less congested spaces.
You may bet that this is a 5.x or later version which runs that slimmed down Vxworks firmware. For the real thing (which once built WRT54G's reputation as a reliable product) look for a WRT54GL (L as in Linux). And look for DD-WRT firmware for your WRT54GL ( http://dd-wrt.com ). That combo really rocks.
DDWRT is a linux router firmware that supports most routers. Whats awesome about it is that it will make ANY router supported by it as a relay station for another router. No cabling required. http://www.dd-wrt.com You'll have to make sure your routers are listed as supported though if you are looking to buy new devices.
Yes, it works on batteries, four AA's. One thing I like about this radio is that the aux power cord is removable, no need to tuck into the case.
It plugs into the all remotes, but not the actual base station.
does not work on my t100
The paper is the thick type, but the rubber band that was tightly wrapped around the sleeves ruined most of them. Do not buy.
it has to be COMPATIBLE ... it works on Fujifilm NP40 Rechargeable Battery for Fuji F402 , F460, F470, F480, F650, F700, F810, V10, Z1, Z3 & Z5fd Digital Cameras
I have always liked Maxell recording tapes.Used them off and on for past 38 years!
It means the battery is completely worn out and incapable of taking a charge.
Could you please explain in more detail. Are you trying to say you would like to use this item to connect via Wi-Fi? If so, then no, you cannot do that with this item, this item is just a switch. What you need is a Wireless Router.
From what I've read, it does not work with xbox, laptops or pc. Just cd and DVD players only
No, not with this model.
As far as I know it is not
We've not had any trouble re-using these discs in the past.
Yes it has a built in speaker, ear phone jack that could also be used for an outside speaker
there seems to be a speaker on the back as well as earphone jack
I don't know what ALT function you are looking for, but in Num Lock off mode the keypad arrow keys work in conjunction with the ALT key to activate pull-down menus.
It has one built in. However, it is probably around 4-5 feet, so in my case I had to add an extension (have gobs of the stuff laying around from years of accumulation).
No it's not
The model that I ordered does not have that feature. And yes it was shipped with the cartridge. This printer does connect to your computer via a USB cable and I used Kodak's software to build an online picture album. Then you can select pic's to email. Hope this helps. Wayne C.
Yes but read up the requirements on google
Gail's reply does not make sense to me. I used a router (SMC 3605T) excellently for over 3 years, and some weeks ago it suddently started buzzing intermittently- NEVER had a problem w. connectivity. Over the past weekend I went out and bought the Netgear. Soon after it started doing the same thing. Called Netgear, and they told me to change to another power plug - only. Really deep.
it had no case but it did have a strap the cameral works very good I used it at my granddaughter's wedding and my pictures turn out better than the man that they paid to do the pictures I love my cameral best buy that I have done Linda
I'm afraid not. I'm assuming that the remote releases only work for digital cameras.
ry this - http://www.jabra.com/headsets-and-speakerphones/compatibilityguide
It uses two lithium camera batteries that can be found at any major retailer such as Wal-Mart. They are short mid-sized batteries.
The cameral I bought does not have any digital storage or USB but this I can tell you I love the pictures it takes I'm well satisfied with it
Yes it will work wigh your bose system.
No, and never buy their products
No, it only maintains the voume at a steady level at the volume you set your TV or amplifier.
NO!!! This unit is made to keep the volume at a relatively constant level. When commercials com on the volume level generally goes up. This is controlled at the transmitter. IT IS SUPPOSED TO GET YOUR ATTENTION! If he has the remote control on his hand, he can change channels all day, but that is all. Good luck, Ronda, and try to have a great visit! Hal Stout
Hi Susan K. Chelune, The recorder uses Standard Audio cassette, 2.5 in or 64mm High and 3.96 in or 100.5mm Length. Hope this helps! Vincent
It sounds like you are looking to use the coax input on the modulator, and output rca cables to your tv. I've never tried this, but it could work. The modulator has an antenna in coax input, and an rf out coax input. I would give it a try, and if it doesn't work, return it.
Yes, I've been using this remote on Linux for about 15 years now, on all kinds of distros. I'm currently using it on openelec.
I have used this one on many P/S2 Keyboards, works well,best of any available.
Remote is not included. Deal includes only DVD Player(Display lite on DVD player is not working) and Subwoofer (Panasonic SA-HT900 5Disc Changer/Subwoofer SB-WA350). Thank you for interest.
no!
almost all cameras have a small thread in the bottom that universally fits a tripod screw. Even my Canon Rebel (which is large) worked with this tripod and so will your camera!
Yes it does.
You would have to see if both the tracks that it slides on matches. Sony will answer any questions you have

no , but amazon has one that will.
Each speaker weighs 12 pounds according to specs in the owners manual. 2 are in the box.
No. If you want to record anything serious, or even semi-serious, you need an interface - like an Mbox - and a condenser microphone. There are good ones to be had for like 50 bucks; the Behringer C1 works really well for any basic recording needs. Assuming you have an interface, just plug the stuff in and it records really simply and well. Good luck
Yes, it does.
Working somewhat for me on 10.10.3 with a 2013 Mac Pro. The basic functions work fine, but the custom button assignments don't always. I have to keep opening system prefs, click on TrackballWorks, change an assignment, and change it back. A few times a day. I think I'll give up and go with a magic trackpad.
For Nikon 17-55 you need 77 mm filter. You can use the same filter for 28-300 as well.
This IS most likely a VRII lens. It does picture the original VR lens but I tried to get a VR I from them a few months ago and they sent me a VRII. I let Amazon and Electronics Basket know about the error but it seems not much was done about it. Here is a link to my review....
Hi You will need an adapter. I think it is the LA 7. I just bought the Fz 70 and it works on there but i needed to buy the LA 8 adapter for it. Otherwise it works great with the fz 200
No
Yes. As far as I can match part numbers, that's the combination I've been using for years. Hope this helps and doesn't cost me.
I needed some modification to get these installed, but it's not that hard to get them installed.
It is actually not discontinued to my knowledge. We just received some from Pioneer a few weeks ago, and they are currently reporting a backorder for us on it.
YES, but the one they sent me es NOT the original. It's a FAKE Chinese imitation. IT IS NOT THE ORIGINAL Control. I have another 2 of this (the photo is ok) but the one they sent is not this one.
I used velcro to mount them in between the rollbars,on the fender wells of a cj5. Hope that helps
I took my stock tweeters and used them as a pattern to make a flat piece of steel and drilled a hole the size of the new tweeter in the piece of steel to mount the pioneer tweeters. Was very happy with the install.
You have to have output from the speaker ourtputs off the radio or audio source you are connecting to these speakers what are you hooking these speakers too I've have many pairs of these and am running 400 watts from my sports car radio too but don't run the 250 or 125 bass controls from equalizer too high if you are running over 400 watts or you will blow the woofer speaker section out of these speakers
It has one stud which is 3/8" in diameter. If you push down on just the outside of that stud, a 1/4" stud is exposed. The 1/4" stud is stationary, with a 3/8" spring-loaded retractable sleeve.
Hello, This monopod has a 22lb load capacity. It will handle the 70-200mm2.8 lens without a problem. Regards, Roozbeh OC camera 949-347-1276
For sure. I have one of these filters on that same lens right now!
Hello Al -- I have successfully used a micro-fiber cloth. In an emergency, a dry cotton t shirt will do and a breath to fog. These lens coatings are stable, but be careful about using liquids. This is a good site to check: http://www.bhphotovideo.com/indepth/photography/tips-solutions/how-clean-your-lens-and-filters-properly. Patrick
Is this the lens you are asking about? http://www.amazon.com/Canon-EF-S-18-55mm-3-5-5-6-II/dp/B000V5K3FG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1384631932&sr=8-1&keywords=Canon+is+18-55 If so you would need a 58mm filter. This one will not fit.
You have to remove both pieces from the camera and then install the 2 new pieces good luck.
Should with no problem because all of the compartments are Velcro and rearrangeable.
62mm is 62mm. I don't see why not. THe threads should be standard.
I bought this lense a few months ago. The picture is of the lens.
Don't spray directly on slide; dampen wipe with cleaner and clean the slide with wipe.
It will attach with a filter on, as it doesn't screw into threads in lense.I haven't had the vignetting problem with it.
I only hear the beep at full press.
Yes it is, I love my 17-40, I just wish it was f/2.8 but other than that is my go to lens. If I need to use only one lens for my camera is always this one. One difference is that I have a full frame camera (6D) so for a crop sensor camera like yours I will also look into the 10-22 one, if you ever plan to go for full frame camera then get this one. Hope this helps.
Yes it does! It comes with a canon lens hood and lens bag. I love this lens.
I've found that this lens is more valuable as a wide-angle lens on a full frame camera. On a crop camera, it feels more like a portrait lens. That being said, it's an amazing lens. I'd like to add that Sigma has released a very worthy and cost effective alternative, which you may want to consider. I happen to own the Canon version, but I've read great reviews of the Sigma.
I've only used it on my small portable dobson. So i haven't been able to test that. But i can tell you that it fits that 1.25" very well so if you have an adapter that centers and aligns well then i don't see why it would not work.
I found this one on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/SafeWatts-cable-Nikon-UC-E12-Coolpix/dp/B00L9KQ06I/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1405274725&sr=1-1&keywords=nikon+cables+uc+e12 It does not look like the cable uc-e4. I would therefore assume you should buy the UC-E12 cable.
yes, it will work for a D80.
I have the Canon 7D. The Canon 28mm f/1.8 is not IS but I wanted it for low light. The Canon 28mm IS f/2.8 would be a good lens for your needs. (This is my opinion). But for portraits I use the Canon 85mm f/1.8. Hope this helps.
Yes it will An f4 will become a f5.6
Hi, I had a 70-200 2.8 MK1 and now have a 70-200 2.8 MK2 and it works well with both. No idea about the 80-200. I don't think it will fit but you need to try.
Treat s any high quality lens. Would suggest putting a b and w uv filter for protection
From having tried the Medium and Large versions of this vest, I would say the sizes that Domke uses is the same as typical size metrics. I wear a medium shirt, and the medium vest fits me well. Given what it is, it still has plenty of room to fit over jackets and whatnot, but if I wear just the vest, it has the same looseness as a medium shirt in the chest region (the lower portion is baggier of course). Large was larger than I felt was necessary. The medium works for me even over a winter coat.
Hello, we do not stock that quantity, but we can get them in 3 to 5 days. To coordinate purchase through Amazon please contact us at 1-800-900-6676. Thanks.
Well, I usually use a medium in shirts, jackets, etc., but I bought one of these in medium a year ago, and it is just too baggy. Yes, it does have a lot more room that way, I suppose, but I'm now in the market for a small. So, the short answer to your question is, I think they run a bit big. By the way, I'm 5'7", 160 lbs.
The size says large.
Assuming I've understood you, there are no epaulettes on this item. The shoulders are undecorated.
Yes, my friend, is perfectly round. It may has a stroke or manufacturing defect.
Yes
I'm going to say no. When closed, the 5 frame sleeves fit fine. I think the wider sleeves are likely to get pushed by the rings and deform.
It is portrait. 24" from top to bottom.
I believe it has 24 pages with insert cards so you can view 48 pieces. Hope this helps. I was really impressed with the book. My son and I g to a lot of concerts and this seems like a perfect solution for poster storage. definitely saves on framing cost and wall space.
It comes with a huge plastic case, not able to fit easily in a pocket or anything. Good for storage at home only.
Not having this zoom lens, I cannot answer. If Sigma claims it needs an 85mm thread, it ought to work.
Michael, I do not believe your camera is capable of accepting screw on filters. You should be able to tell when you look at the front of the lens if there are threads or not. It's possible that some company makes a bayonet or push on-type filter, however, I am not aware of any. Hope this helps.
I cannot answer this question. The filter fits SONY lenses and these are the only lenses I have. I would hope that all lenses have the same screw threads, but have no information on this.
Yes! The Nikon website lists the ES-1 52 mm Slide Copying Adapter as one of the accessories for the 55 mm Micro Nikkor f 2.8 lens. I have been using the slide adapter quite a lot recently - it is quick and easy, though some experimentation with exposure may be necessary to obtain optimum results. I have the D800 with a 60 mm lens and shoot the slides in the RAW format. Sometimes I'll enter the single file into Photomatix and am amazed at what the camera/software bring out of my old slides.
By performing a Google Shopping search of 'nex7 uv filter' the items returning are almost all 49mm in diameter and you're inquiring about a 77mm filter. I'm going to GUESS and say no but 'your mileage may differ'. Hope this helps!
Compatibility isnt measured by the camera model but instead the lens, http://support.nikonusa.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13987/~/using-nikon-filters-with-nikon-dslrs if you type in the lens size and model that you have on Nikon's website it will tell you which filters will fit on it. The information is usually also listed on the package that the lens came inside of.
No
The filter ring size (i.e. 77mm) must match the lens ring size. So this could be a rhetorical question, if you already have the lens in your possession. If not, 'mouse over' the on-line lens picture and look for the ring size. Good Luck - My Hoya filters have never failed.
The one I bought was a 77mm and it was a "C". I'm pleased with the performance and if you Google around you can find test data where it scored quite nicely. http://www.lenstip.com/113.4-article-UV_filters_test_Description_of_the_results_and_summary.html
Same thing. Actually the ND8 reduces 3 stops of light, and it's the most common ND filter purchased.
No
I had the 52mm it is 5/16" thick. Oh ! it made in Japan. I did had a few 77mm but not Hoya. Hoya made a good filter but not the best one.
I believe the uv (c) is a slim filter.

I am not quite sure what you mean. Can you clarify your question? Do you mean to ask if this is a good lens for low light conditions?
I don't believe that the D3100 has a non-cpu setup for AI/AIS lenses, so it probably will only work in manual mode and all the metering done by the user.
Hoya Standard filters have one layer of anti-reflectant coating to each surface of the glass to suppress reflection and increase light transmission. HMC (Hoya Multi-Coated) have 3 layers of anti-reflectant coatings on each surface to reduce average reflection down to 3.0% or less. Hoya S-HMC (Super HMC) also have 6 layers of anti-reflectant coatings. Finally, the Super HMC PRO 1 is made of thinner glass (only 1mm thick), also with 6 layers of anti-reflectant coatings bonded to each surface of the glass.
No! the filter has threads to attach it to the camera and threads tho screw another filteron top but nothing rotates
No
Yes it will work on the airplane audio jacks

No it doesn't
No
No
No, it's passive. Take your left and right speaker wires from receiver to the sub, then go from the sub to your left and right speakers. Hope that helps!
Absolutely. The Sunpak 620-080 has multiple adjustments and shooting positions including vertically up or straight down.
YES
NO, it will not support the weight of a VIXIA. Already tried and the leg extension handle locks broke.
Roughly 3.2 cm x 4.2 cm. It fits my VPT-240, though it only goes in one way.
Yes
Honestly I picked the Davis because i liked the quick release latches on the tripod legs, and the handles on the Davis for the fluid head looked longer. Weight wise I have not run into any problems with it handling my rig. It looks of better quality to me than the ravelli. There is a YouTube video that compares the Davis to other tripods which helped me make a decision
Yes it is an universal bracket. I have had great success.
Absolutely it will work wit 70D, in fact because of the crop sensor it will give a virtual 1.6X more zoom. All the best.
This works with traditional 35 mm slides. I have no other experience.
No. It makes the camera too tall.
Probably.
Try www.TripodQuickRelease.com They stock a 41mm and a 45mm plate that may fit your tripod.
According to this chart.... under the tripod section.... no, the QB5L will not work on the Velbon 5000... it needs a QB4LC. http://www.tripodquickrelease.com/Velbon_Quick_Releases.htm#Old%20Velbon%20Reference
Standard hole for 1/4 inch thread.
Um, I know that this is an old post, but no, this isn't fiber. It's glossy, smooth.
Not quite certain understand your question - just be certain you order the correct memory. My HP is an older model and maxes out at 2gb - I gig in each memory slot and I checked the specs to get the correct type and clock speed. As far as operation and my satisfaction, the boards were exactly what I needed and make the computer operate quite a bit faster with NO problems. Hope this helps - - -
Yes it holds well. Actually why I bought it was to get the quick releases in order to get the strap off when I shoot 360 panoramas and my Canon 5D Mk III is on a panohead. I did let a shoemaker cut the leather off and sew the releases into the Canon %D Mk III strap.
I have the same model. Unfortunately, it's not wireless. But, I will say that it is a very nice sounding subwoofer with plenty of thump. I've had mine for almost three years now and haven't had any problems with it and it's been put through some pretty rough abuse from my electronic drum set.
I haven't heard the Klipsch sub-woofer you are referring to, but at any rate I would expect the Klipsch to cost at least twice as much. This Yamaha Sub is designed for music listening. If you are looking for a sub with punch for a Home Theater, check Out the Definitive Technology ProSub 1000, which you can get at crutchfield.com. You can also better compare the subs at crutchfiled.com.
Not unless you also have a receiver to hooklt up to also.
These are not powered speakers. You need an amplifier. So these are definitely not meant to be hooked up to a computer.
They are able to hold banana plugs so the speaker wire you uss will be completely up to you. I use Monster Ultra Series THX 1000 Speaker Cable with Monster Tips 15 ft. pair Speaker Cable (ULT S1000MT-15/15) and the sound is very clear and precise.
NO. It doesn't do anything to the existing drive. It only images (copies) the contents of the old drive to a new drive (that you have to purchase seperately). Zvika
The detailed write-up says EZ Gig II. I love this hardware and software for backing up all my Laptop (PATA) computers. I have used Win 7 Backups to Upgrade Win XP computers to Win 7 ! Then call Microsoft and get a New Product Code for the updated computer. Allegedly costs $99; but Microsoft has failed to bill me numerous times. BTW You can download EZ-Gig III software off the Inet. Hope this helps.
I don't know but I would say yes. MP3 was a compression algorithm for movies, and I've watched movies on these. Also mp3 is a much lower data rate than cd music recordings; seems impossible they couldn't do mp3. Hope this helps.
I had no problems with these CDs being burned I use Mac and windows, so to answer your question 100%.
It allows you to do the following: - Get the exposure right in camera using off-camera non-TTL flashes. This will save you time in Photoshop and ensure you lose less image quality when you do have to use Photoshop. - Get the correct exposure when using multiple flashes. - Accurately spot-expose any part of your subject.
The celestron deluxe tele-extender is designed to be used on Schmidt Cassegrain Telescopes, This adapter slides over the visual back of the scope. It will not work in the focuser of a Newtonian Telescope.
I am not sure but I do love them. They have great range and the lighted compass has come in handy at night. Super value. carol m April 30
If the scope has the ability to remove it's eyepiece and accepts 1.25 inch diameter eyepieces then this will fit into the scope. However, you would still need an adapter for the camera that this piece will screw into. http://www.amazon.com/Opteka-T-Mount-Adapter-Digital-Cameras/dp/B000KNCB7C/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1363211567&sr=8-4&keywords=canon+adapter+for+telescope
not out of the box
It has standard 2in. thread for T-Ring and 2in. Swivel for optical back of 'scope.
There is no magnification with this T-Adapter is good for prime focus....where your camera is receiving light directly from the telescope...the "magnification" will be from the scope itself and no eyepieces...if you want magnification...you need a T adapter that will allow for use with a barlow lens...which is mainly used for planets...as deep sky objects are far too big
I think you will need one of these Orion Mak-Cass Adapter Ring for Schmidt-Cass Accessories. Orion offers this on there website and has excellent support that could help you too. hope this helps
No
I know that it works with the 5D-Mark2, but I'm not sure about the 6D. Have you tried contacting Canon about compatibility? They should be able to answer your question. Don F.
Probably not just because the magnitude of how close this lens needs to be to the subject and the physical position of the flash on top of the camera. Your best bet if you want to shoot hand held with this lens is using it with a macro ring flash and shooting with plenty of ambient light (ie. outside or in a studio).
What type of scope were you using it on? My DSLR comes into perfect focus. You really do not want to use this to image Jupiter anyway - you should use a 4X barlow, to make it bigger, not a focal reducer to make it smaller.
Any lens can be used for landscape as long as you have the proper distance. Last night I just shot a landscape with 70mm using a 70-200. I also shot landscapes with 300mm with 70-300. But definitely the 50mm can be used for landscapes but its strength really is taking photos in street and low-light. It's a good lens that allows you to be creative.
The lens was included with mine -- and was represented in the ad I answered. I don't know the specifications. Mine also came with an operator's manual, but rather than giving specifications, it offers alternative thoughts on lenses depending on focal length (short focal length = greater brightness, for example). You might see if other offers for the ektagraphic give you more information. Sorry I can't be more specific.
carousel only. There was a separate product called a "stack Loader" that allows quick viewing; unfortunately I do not know where to find one today.
The gentleman who runs the site is the most helpful I've ever found on Amazon. Ask him. He'll get right back to you. He's the best!
N0, it did not come with a carousel.
Diane, neither my wife (she's the birder), nor I noticed any particular smell when I purchased them about 4 years ago. I checked them last night & there is no discernible smell now. So I guess the answer would be a cautious, "I imagine it will subside." We never had a pair of Audobon, but we have been extremely happy with the Swift. They are crystal clear and images almost appear to be 3-D.
2 year limited warranty
The model WITHOUT the compass. There is only one I think...137501
Yes, but they require a very steady hand and just the right eye-distance from the eyepieces to avoid total darkness or seeing your eyelashes. My 5-yo struggled with them but my 10-yo did OK.
The same thing happened to mine!
Yes it will.
No it doesn't. At 75mm (where you would get the most camera shake), it is possible to hand-hold at 1/75th sec. With a little bit of work (leaning against a wall, something like that) you can hand-hold at 1/60th. Since you wouldn't want to hand-hold at anything slower than that anyway, there's really no need for IS
Yes, follow this link for verification... http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Cables-Computer/25604/UC-E6-USB-Cable.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-CompatibleWith
yep
No, I,m sorry
Well you don't need to strong arm it into using it. Just a little bit of added pressure to the pen and you'll hear it "click" (similar to a button on a mouse). It's about as thick as a magic marker. And there is a button near the tip to right click if needed. Hope this helps
Yes, it will work with all versions of OSX.
Yes. I use this on the EF-S 55-250mm IS II. I had exactly the same question you did when I ordered this. I figured I would send it back if it was not exactly the right hood, but it was.
Yes it does
Just the one and depending on chosen frame size, it's either 12 or 16 exposures.
Yes.
yes it does
It is the same thickness as a regular frame's glass.
6ft long cord with 6 sockets (says that in product info page - but it's good you double checked! Any other questions?
It's a 125v-15A 60Hz, with a 14AWG (gauge) (2.08mm2) cord. Ok?
The fan is continuous.
Auto type fuse plugss in right above line cord strain relief.
This was a gift for my father who is an avid photographer. I passed your question along to him and he said: A lens filter fits on a lens not on a particular camera (the T3i is a camera). This will fit on any lens that is threaded to accept a 52mm lens filter. Does not matter what camera the filter is on.
No
Sorry, I have no idea. I was only interested in running some Christmas Tree lights in a parade. However at this price point I rather dough it.
Yes, this is stackable with a similar sized filter. Keep an eye out for reduction in Image Quality.
Sure it comes.
As near as I can tell there isn't. There is a spacer that's available that lifts the Telrad a couple of inches (approximately) above and parallel to the tube.
Yes it will, a snug fit
I don't see any reason why it wouldn't.
I plan to use with my Canon DSLR. I am not sure if is good enough for studio voice over recordings.
No. You have to remove it from the car if you don't want it up
Yes
most radios will fit. I don't know the dimensions but of the dousing but I put several different radios in it and all fit as long as you have the cover/ dash mount plates for the radio
Differences are inside and outside. More copper inside Centennial for better reception,outside Centenial finish won't fray with age. Centenial is one step above Here an very instructive video: http://youtu.be/kAfzAzQAG-s
I think you can receive wifi with any antenna. This antenna is not especially designed for this and would probably require you to adapt the coaxial cable to connect to whatever device you are wanting to receive on. This company makes a wi fi antenna and you should research what might be best for you. This antenna is designed primarily for the maximum transmission range of the VHF signal from a marine radio.
6db
I have a CAT 6 home network and used this tool on all connections...both jacks and plugs. Well made and very satisfied..
Its compatible but works very good
I dont know. Google has compatability sites, im just a user. Sorry i cant help.
Many are 77 and many are not. Google the specs.
Yes but on manual focus only. Lens does not have motor drive.
Without knowing the size of filter it is hard to say. The cap will fit a lens that uses 67mm filters. There should be a mm size somewhere on the front of the lens that will tell you the size.
Yes it works well the laptop still is warm when running programs
I put the male side of the cord though one of the holes that has the second small hole on each side and kind of "clipped" it there. If it wouldn't stay then I would hold that end of the cord there and just start winding it around. Hope that helps.
Not necessarily. Older model TV's do not support composite video.
I have been using it in a standard PCI slot of an older Dell Optiplex 210L desktop since I bought it some time ago. It has worked fine and did not require any special set-up. I'm not sure, but I believe the 5v is just a standard full size 32 bit PCI slot. Hope this helps.
http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Camera-Lenses/AF-S-DX-VR-Zoom-Nikkor-55-200mm-f%252F4-5.6G-IF-ED.html The filter size notes 52mm in the tech specs. So, yes. It should fit.
Juan, you are mistaken. Manufacturers set the wholesale prices for their products at different levels depending on the country in which the item is being sold. The very same B & W filter made by Schneider Optics in Germany is sold at wholesale at a much lower price in Europe, for example, than it sold for here by the Schneider distributor.
No
I have been using B & W filters for years, and have seen nothing to support the vignetting that this question poses.
Mine was in a plastic case inside of a B+W box. However, the seal on th box was broken, and the filter appeared to have been used. The next time I purchase something like this, it will be from a local dealer.
No, it won't. The Panasonic 14-42mm II Lens takes a 46 mm filter.
I have no idea on using this filter with a soft focus at the same time; but yes, if it fits, you will have 1.5 stops at least to compensate.
Is this the one? http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Standard-Medium-Telephoto-Cameras/dp/B00009XVCZ It's 58mm
I have it at 48 but it'll go longer, perhaps 52 as you suggest.
Sheldon, Good news and bad. The B & W 58mm filter will not fit on the Canon Power Shot SX50 HS. However, according to DPREVIEW you can purchase a Canon Filter adapter (FA-DC67A). Which when attached to the lens you'll be able to use any commercially available 67mm filter including those made by B & W. Happy photography!
Hi, as i understand the L820 has no lens thread and therefore no "official" way of adapting neither a hood nor a filter. I found a company that created a set for this: KIWIFOTOS LA-62L820T. It is in ebay though.
Yes
It will work on any scope loaded on a CG-4 equatorial mount. If your mount is a CG-4, it will work; if not, it won't.
Yes, I have the Polaroid 300 cameras and this film is literally the same thing. I buy instax because the film is cheaper than the polaroid brand, but I bought the polaroid camera because it's cheaper than the Fuji one. lol plus they have more variety of frames so it's mega fun. Hope this helps you.
Because it has Two cartridges, each containing Ten films
Yes 210 is wide instax
Yes this camera accepts the "EF" series of lenses that fits all canon digital cameras. Batteries can be found on amazon for about $15.00 per pair. I use my cameras on a daily basis and could buy any make or model I choose. I have this one and the 8.3 megapixle version. Unless you are blowing your prints up to poster size, There is no need for monster mega-pixle cameras.
It depends on if you get the "body only" or the "kit". The body only model, while a working camera, doesn't have a lens, so unless you have a Canon Lens lying around to attach to the body, you won't be taking any pictures. The "kit" comes with a 35-58mm lens if I remember correctly, and you can take great shots with it.

Unless you are blowing your prints up to poster size, There is no need for monster mega-pixle cameras.
No. It's also extremely outdated with image quality.
I've always used Scadisk
Hello for 16-35mm f / 2.8 USM II model is Canon hood EW-88, you have to return it.
Nope you need the EW-83J
I thought it was just me! I got my pair in summer '07, and they failed less than a year later. I had them replaced via Shure, and now the replacements have failed again. I don't use them excessively - they just seem to wear out. Other than the high probability of failure, these headphones are awesome.
It should be fine. I have a similar, quite old (&gt; 5 years old), keyboard that works perfectly with a late 2012 iMac.
Yes it comes with some but I bought another package to install all the accessories
on the plug I have when its plugged into the lower outlet the top one is still usable for a standard plug, as for protection a dishwasher not sure about that.
I have this and don't see any outputs at all.
Yup it sure does
With the unit turned off , unplug the base unit power plug for one minute . It helped mine reset itself .
I use it with a 7D and few different lenses but most commonly with the 28-135 kit lens. I have had no problems and it is perfectly compatible with every combination I have used with my camera. Ultimately, I did purchase a nice macro lens as the extender only as good as the lens that it is mated to and I wanted a bit mroe from my system. No complaints with the tube, but I wanted a nicer lens.
I do not have a full frame camera sensor. My Zoom goes to 35mm equivalent of 375 mm however. At full zoom, I still have a reasonable focal length (for macro that is) of a half inch or so. I have to shoot about 40 inches away from a subject to be able to focus (which is actually good for living things that might scare getting in too close). The EF 25 might have a very narrow FOV, so I chose the 12 mm extension tube instead and am happy with it.
Purple, pink, yellow, green and blue. Ten of each.
The CD didn't freeze your computer. It's possible you have a bad one, but not a whole pack of them. First thing I do when my computer freezes, which my home one doesn't really do because I use Apple, is turn it off and then reboot. My work computer freezes from time to time and it's usually because I've put in too many commands without giving it time to keep up.
No. It could sit on a shelf on the wall.
only if they are the same size as a dvd case
No! the filter has threads to attach it to the camera and threads tho screw another filteron top but nothing rotates
Yes
Yes, I have and it works great but only in bright light situations. It essentially doubles all aspects of the attached lens. But using this device in low light situations reduces light through the lens and the auto focus may not work properly in low light situations. I photographed a house across the canyon which was about 1/3 mile away and it looked close and the picture was bright and clear.
Returned item
It might be laggy.i tried but for reason it didn't work.
It comes with a storage bag, but not a hardback case.
Chris I cannot attest to the fit but I can't attest to the sound it is beautiful! You will have to adjust your HPF like instruction states but other than that it is crisp and clear! Al
I don't know about fitting in a stock place, but if you get a profesional to wire it or someone that knows what they're doing, you can mount these virtually anywhere. I mounted them on the rear pillar of my regular cab 2000 gmc Sierra.
These are not meant to be used with microphones. These are headphone splitters. All they do is split a headphone impedance signal into two smaller signals.
I am not sure if you can or not. I'm sure it would work if the plug would work in the headphone plug. I can't imagine it not working if the size is right. Figure if the size of ipad head phone plug is the same size as the one you would use on a pc then it will work. I used mine off a pc and headphone plug was what I used it on. Hope that helps...
We have two units and they work great. We are using them with TAPP 1.6 protocol.
Have not tried it with a Mac. However, it may fail if one attempts to use simultaneously with one or more other USB devices in some laptops or desktop systems.
I'm not selling any such speakers. Do you see this for sale somewhere?
I wouldn't. I would home run them all back to the amp/receiver. But there is a good discussion on parallel vs. serial wiring here including amp considerations for different types of wiring. http://www.avsforum.com/t/1109592/pro-and-cons-of-wiring-speakers-in-series
You should have no problems hooking them up in series. They are 8 ohms so they will be 4 ohms in series. Check you specks to make sure but I am sure that will be fine. We had 2 RC6s hooked up to a Sonos Amp in our master bathroom and it was just fine.
I don't do terrestrial viewing other than to align the guide scope, so I can't say what qualifies for good. The image does look nice though. Magnification is great on this thing; on truly clear days I can get 250x. The images are upright.
As shipped the image will be upside down
Yes you can but for astrography a motorized mount is almost a necessity. Manual tracking for long exposures is quite a daunting task.
This right angle finder scope is great, it is worth it.
No
Go to www.telescope.com, the Orion site, and browse or use their live chat feature. That's where I bought my case.
Metal very nice quality .
If your scope came with the 3 different eyepieces it will fit on the middle one. The 1.25 inch eyepiece.
It's really not critical to have a Barlow lens but it's nice. When I first got my telescope, I just used the lens take came with it. Later on, I purchased a Barlow lens and some filters. With these items, I was able to see better details. Now I wish I had a bigger telescope. I guess just like any other hobby it depends on how much can you afford to spend. You might want to try to hook up with a astronomy group some night and see for yourself before you decide.
Yes they need to be connected with standard speaker wire.
8 ohms Power 10-125 watts
Don't know. On biz travel thing at moment. I do, however, recommend it highly. Sorry to not be very helpful....
Yes
So far this inverter does not cause any interference or buzzing. This unit is easily able to power all of our power tools and area work lights. Our total load is 2850 at running watts or 21.5 amps. We are also able to run our Hilti jack hammer which draws 19 amps/2280 watts with no issues.
It was not that way when I ordered. It may be a backlog from Olympus
No ... I use it with fx nikon Df and it is excellent
Yes but the autofocus won't work because the d3100 doesnt have a build in motor .
On the lens, set the aperture ring to f/22. Then, use the aperture control on the camera to control the aperture. That is how it's supposed to work on newer cameras. Setting it to f/22 on the lens enables the communication between lens and camera.
Outside roughly 2-3/4" x 2- 3/8". Inside even more roughly 2-3/8" x 1-3/4". Easily holds 2 SDHC cards in small plastic holders. Can hold 2 CF cards. I have them and do not use them because they keep sliding down the strap.
If you convert the phone plugs to a single stereo plug, I don't see why it wouldn't work. You can pick up a converter at Radio Shack. You'd need a double female phone plug to a single male stereo plug that fits your laptop.
First of all, the following only describes what I did to make it work on my TV. It is NOT a direction, nor a recommendation. 1. Use a transformer (not included) of voltage needed (read user manual to find out power input needed, I think it is 12V) to supply power to transmitter (I just used black vinyl electrical tape to tape + to red and - to black). 2. Affix transmitter within line of sight at where headsets will be used. 3. Connect transmitter audio input to TV audio output. 4. Power on the transmitter and headsets. Voila!
Make sure led on headphones are on and transmitters 4 lights are on when switch on transmitter is on. check the volume. nothing should b blinking!
it worked with my CXT275 I don't know past that
I'd recommend Polk Audio Rti A1's. Might be a little more than 200.00 though and you'll need an amp. 200.00 budget for what you want is difficult. Unless you go with something used on e-prey. I've seen the Polk A1's here on amazon priced at 215.00. Get a low cost receiver/amp from Radio Shack or here on amazon and you're in business.
No, you don't. Just plug it in to your mixer or instrument's phone output jack, and you're good to go. Make sure it has an output intended for headphones. Will have to use an adapter for stereo output. Hope this helps....
I understand that your HX50V measures 4.25 x 2.52 x 1.5&#8243; According to Lowepro, the inside of this case is 4.7 x 2.8 x 1.4" I'm sure your camera would fit based on comments from owners of Sony RX100 M3 which measures 4.02 x 2.28 x 1.61". Since the case is flexible & has extra room in length & width, it will surely "give" a little to allow the slightly greater depth of your camera and even greater depth of the RX100 M3. I hope this helps.
The one I bought in March 2013 did.
All stereos come with their own harness to plug into itself, you need to buy a harness to attach to the radio's one. Look up on amazon "2004 Nissan Altima Stereo Wire Harness" and you'll find a few. Metra is a brand I've used before and it was well put together. I would solder them together and cover with heat shrink, but you can use solder-less connectors if you wish.
I can confirm 16 gb works. I have not tried larger, as it becomes a moot point. This unit does not support search/browse by folder from flash drive. So if you plan on using more than a couple of folders (which I would presume you would for a drive that size) move on and get a better unit. I very much regret choosing this one.
It's been several years since I used these, but I used to take them to our local Walmart. I don't know if they're still accepting them.
No beeping or ringing sound comes through the headset, only through the phone itself.
May research says it is copper clad steel main conductor. Hard to find solid copper core at this price point.
mine charges while in the camera
you are right it does not have the 4.1wh marking on it and no seal , and is marked nikon corp. , but i have used this battery a lot with no problem at all, i can not tell the differance between this battery, and the orginal that came with the camera ! they both perform perfect !
Yes
My owners manual says that the EH-62A is the AC adapter for the P90. The only problem that I have is I can't find where to plug it in on the camera.
The fish eye feature built in is not the same as having a dedicated lens. The lens captures information while the camera merely distorts information(the capture) to look like a fish eye.
This lens works on full frame but I am not sure how the electronics would work with a converter
Go to the Sigma website to see sample pictures. It looks like the lens has slight pincushion distortion. You may be confusing distortion with exaggerated perspective. Of course, this lens does make near objects seem very large compared to distant objects. That should not be considered distortion. You, as the photographer can use the perspective to your advantage for creative effect. If you do want distortion, apparent bending of straight lines, you should consider a fisheye lens.
don't know, sorry
Yes it is a lithium ion battery. If you are looking for a spare, make sure it is exactly what you have. This did not match mine, mine has a indent in the top and fits in the battery slot only with the slit.
Yes it does.
This is an extension that goes between the base and the antenna. Giving you an extra 50FT between them. It has a booster built it so no signal loss. You use the antenna that came with the original unit.
I do not know.
The filter has worked well for me to reduce glare on windows, water, etc, so I assume it will work well on paintings. (I've not shot paintings with the filter, however.) I'm always amazed at how the view changes as I turn the filter. The results you get will rest somewhat on your lighting scheme--I assume you'll shoot with two diffused light sources, set at 45 degrees on either side of the painting. You can return the filter within 30 days of delivery if it doesn't work as well as you hope.
I'm not much a camera tech so I can't authoritatively answer your question, but I have my polarizing filter on top of a regular daylight filter on my Nikon D40.
no, direct sunlight may still enter the lens/
I am not able to identify what lens you have. I can't find a 55mm f/1.8 lens. The polarizer I reviewed was a 52mm dia which is kind of the old standard for Nikon. The quick answer should be that if your lens has a 52mm thread diameter at the front of the lens it should work. The easy way to find out the thread diameter is to look at the lens cap. It will say the size of the cap which should be the same size as the polarizer filter you will need.
no, direct sunlight may still enter the lens/
They can't control the user's ability not to scratch the mirror. If you slip you might scratch the delicate surface. Worse, you may be emboldened to dust the sensor. A sudden move and there's an expensive proposition. That's their way of saying: "if you wreck your camera, don't turn around and sue us." I've used it to clean every part of my cameras. I haven't screwed anything up yet. Make of that what may. Caveat duster.
With each squeeze you get a strong poof of air. Strong enough to blow dust out of a camera, but I just tried it on my keyboard and all it did was blow away a few specks of surface dust. It doesn't have enough oomph to blow anything up and out of the keyboard. And each poof is just a split second in duration.
No all, but it is a very good speaker and beatiful finished
No, they do not. They are actually too big to hang, I think.
They are made in Ireland. They will even have it written on the inside of the headband.
yes
Yes it's fully compatible
Go to the Sigma website to see sample pictures. It looks like the lens has slight pincushion distortion. You may be confusing distortion with exaggerated perspective.

You, as the photographer can use the perspective to your advantage for creative effect. If you do want distortion, apparent bending of straight lines, you should consider a fisheye lens.
I think it wont work because a tipical set up for that would be 20 to 30 secs, iso 3200, f 2.8. It may work if your camera goes to iso 6400 without noise. Or if you wait 60 sec but probably some stars will look like lines instead of dots. I suggest to go with a 2.8. On the other side for architecture or landscape is excelent!!! Quality is really nice for the price well not from f4.5 to 8 but from 8 to 18 is great!!
Moving the switch to "On" seems to work in my case with the SB-800 and D600. Perhaps your unit is defective?
No rewinding necessary. Just take them for photo processing...
Based on what I see on the web site, the GC632UW6 is packaged with manuals in multiple languages. Both appear to be operable from the keyboard.
Not sure. Hope someone else can answer this.
Yes it will work. I am using it between Windows Vista and Windows 8.1.
I've had that happen a few times, it hasn't done a thing to mine... they seem to remain unaffected with the Nikon brand..
I am using it for a Vixia HG20 with plenty of room plus adjustable dividers. I am not familiar with the HF-G30.
Is good case
plug them into the speakers and the green sound out at the back of the computer. the volume control is on a speaker.
I use it with Pro Tools, Sony Acid, Vegas Pro.....it will work with any program that allows " keyboard short cuts "
Almost 6 feet
Yes
I would try it because I'm using it to switch between an Apple and home built computer that has external speakers and headphones... I don't hear static and it rocks pretty good... Read the return policy and go for it!!! It works for my needs
Yes
Yes!
Yes, you can either mute the tv or turn rhe volume all the way down on the tv and control the volume on the head phones.
Yes, it was delivered and my husband put it together with no problems and used it that night. Blessing for both of us.
The definition of 5.1 is five satellite speakers and 1 subwoofer. If you will take note these headphones have 2 sides. It does not support Dolby Digital 5.1. HOWEVER, you can use a sound card or amplifier to combine the 5.1 sound to headphones. These cans sound superb when used with music of all genre. If you want them to watch movies, I suggest you look elsewhere. These have a very detailed sound, but movies usually call for very high points and very low rumbling bass.
No mic :/
I've just checked the box. It says that they are made in China but that the "acoustics" where made in Europe...?? It also says that it was designed in Germany. I hope this helps.
An indoor antenna probably won't work due to aluminum siding. Might have to consider a roof top antenna.
You might. It depends on hills, large buildings etc. but this antenna is little better than standard rabbit ears, so it's not going to work miracles.
yes
I bought this camera used with about 50,000 actuations for $400.00 last year.
It's a good camera,if I brought it you must have a L-Lens to have sharper pics.
I have used it for portraits...with and without flash/lights. The key is to use a tripod and a remote "trigger." I have used both the Canon 85mm f/1.8 and Canon 70-200 F/2.8 L lenses. As long as you are not creating a poster-sized photo - don't let the 8.2 MP scare you.
Firstly it is an older 1D. It is a second generation APS-H SLR. Right now they are on Mark IV in that range. One of the best advantages of this camera for me is the 8fps burst mode. Very good for a camera in this category and price range. I own one that I bought used. Best investment I ever made so far. You can see the differences in the 1D's at the bottom of the following page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_EOS-1D_Mark_II
If your printer will not picking up the paper to print, try a cue tip dipped in alcohol and clean the roller or rollers on the printer. Fan the paper out to keep it from sticking to each other in the tray. I hope this will help you.
Have you tried to download the drivers from Kodak support? Try this link - have your model number (maybe serial number) handy. See - http://support.en.kodak.com/app/home/selected/true or Google "Kodak Easyshare Support"
No, you need to buy a charger and rechargeable batteries separately.
Yes, it seems to work fine. The lens is slow opening, this is how my old one started to not work, then it would not open at all.
Its hard to tell you where to find it. I had the same item. Software dint work in my computer and I had to return it. Sorry I cannot answer your question. Thank s.
No. They are not Bluetooth.
Good question. I bought them for my wife who is an avid bird watcher and is also a little rough with handling delicate things. The optics are great and they are easy to use. Most important they have held up very well after a few months of use and banging about.
No
This is an older model of the D70. There is no mention of infrared in the manual.
some but not all Try www.kenrockwell.com for compatibility lists
seems very unlikely
I don't know of any binoculars that are comfortable with eyeglasses. I take mine off when using binoculars. If you hold the binoculars to your glasses, you reduce your field of view to a peephole. You don't need glasses as the binoculars can be adjusted for clear focus.
For both sides (front, back and side) 10.75" x 7.25"
i havent found any myself, although ive packed the one i purchased with blurays , and with the sleeves its already bulky, i would just purchase another caselogic case or see if theres one with more capacity
Hi Rosemary this unit is not possible to be wireless. Check out the Plantronics cs55 or cs540 for a wireless headset.
Think of it as a replacement handset. If two people could be on the same line were the headset not installed through using an extension or conference calling; then yes, otherwise no. The unit has no capability to add another person to the call.
Hi Rosemary this unit is not possible to be wireless. Check out the Plantronics cs55 or cs540 for a wireless headset.
I could answer and dialing out would have to be from an actual telephone. People could not hear me but I could hear them.
The headsets with the "H" in the model # have the QD (Quick Disconnect) feature as shown in the picture. Not an rj11
Yes. Mounting hard wear is included. Great speakers. You won't go wrong.
No these are just speakers that must be plugged into a tuner. If your tuner accepts the blue tooth signal from your phone or device then sends it along the wired connection that could work but these are just speakers.
just put mine up but I plan on keeping them up all year. Im in PA so it will get crappy outside but they are "outdoor" speakers so if you can mount them under something for alittle protection they should be ok. They sound great for the $$ by the way.
yes I would think so
Yes
Im not sure. Sorry. I use it with a full frame camera.
Yes it does
Nikon has a large modern factory in Thailand. I have the HB-32 but it is so short as to be useless in my opinion.
The speakers are 180 watts
I made some home-made speaker boxes for these.. dimensions were 8 in. X 8 in. Width, and a 6 inch depth.. I believe the hole for the speaker measured 6 inches. My first speaker boxes that I built, works fine for me for now. I'm waiting on the Pyle 400 watt amp that was around 50 dollars to see if they get louder. Good luck man.
Hi, thanks question. This lens can work autofocus for D3300 and D3200. Thanks in advance.
This card is for SATA I/II drives only. It will work with newer drives as well, but won't provide a 6 Gbps speed. For faster drives you might need StarTech.com PEXSAT34RH card, but note different interface types - PCI vs. PCI Express. HTH
Yes. Configuring the drives as RAID0 or JBOD will give you combined size of all drives with no redundancy presented to Windows as a single logical drive.
NO
Yes! FM comes in terrific and the extendible antenna gives added clarity/reception quality...you do not need headphones/earbuds to listen to AM or FM on this radio; the sound output for both bands is very clear and signal pick-up strength great.
no
You plug the wire into a audio output. Then there are 4 audio outputs that are amplified.
According to data sheet, it's 40mW per channel into 16 ohm headphones, 30mW per channel into 32 ohm headphones
Yes
the canon mount is compatible with that camera
Good question. I've just set it up to match the settings of my Netgear WGR514 v9, but can't tell if my laptop is using the Netgear or the Linksys Range Extender...
YES - I just installed a used WRE54G with 1.0 firmware (no ethernet port) and it had to be configured FIRST with WEP but then allowed WPA (Not WPA2)
yes
no it does not. my wife loves using this laptop case tho!
Yes it does. this is the section that was reinforced by the addition of rivets. The only disadvantage of in the reinforcement is that it made the opening of the strap/flap is slightly restricted. I have a full-sized Hartman roller, and the handle barely fits. takes a bit of effort to get it in. But my other bags fit easily.
Yes surround speakers through the receiver and the rest through the selecter but your receiver must be a dual zone receiver
it's about 11 inches wide.
Yes. It gets the power from the phone company line, ie no external power adapter. Unless the phone company is down, ie rare, it should continue to work in case of a power outage. I specifically bought it for that purpose as well.
Well I bought the 6", but no you'll have to clip the plug end off the wire and get some crimp on terminal end that match the speaker male terminals.
They do not glow. The blue is just the color of the speaker cone and wouldn't be seen any ways once speaker cover is installed.
sorry but I did not buy the 6x9 I bought the 6.5 round speakers. This is the one I reviewed Pyle PL63BL 6.5-Inch 360-Watt 3-Way Speakers
It can be noisy; you can manually set the speed via the speed control knob on the back of the unit. When set at max yes, it is VERY loud. At its lowest it does create a low hum. Temps only decreased maybe 1-3C, during heavy system load it kept my GTX 670 reference card at a nice 57-60C.
Leds are blue and No you can't turn them off.
On the bottom seam to work best but really did not see much different in the temp. If the card is enclosed on the top the then bottom because the air pushed on the card would just bounce off.
if you can get them all plugged in
I not sure, it has been installed and works just fine.
Frank, I am surprised your W7 Ult. did not recognise the card. I just had to install it in to the PCIE slot on the motherboard and after rebooting the system just installed the driver. Alternatively go to the Trendnet site and download the right driver. You will need the exact model number to have the right driver . Cheers, Les
A/C units draw more Amps than this cable is set up for I wouldn't it could cause it to heat up and cause a fire or burn threw exposing wires causing a shock hazards .
It's configured for USA 120v power applications...being 18 AWG limits it to 10 amps...and I wouldn't do that for long or if the cord gets too warm..
if you can get them all plugged in
I tried multiple splitters and unfortunately none of them worked. I ended up getting a tv that had more than one HDMI inputs and used one optical output to my sound bar.
These went into Chevy Cobalt into the side doors. I would guess that it would fit a Durango. I always tell everyone to consult their manual or just goggle the info. My son loves them they have a great sound in a small space.
It looks like the same connector, but I had a Dell laptop, so I'm not sure if they're exactly the same.
better dont buy it.I have bought a month back it stopped working already.It was meant for my dell charger.
Mine does--t should work for You too
No jack.
Yes. I use one that plugs into the handsfree handset. One of the reason I purchased it.
No, it is NOT odor free. It smells like paint - or a craft store. It drys fast - does the trick for my photos so they don't stick to the glass. I spray it in the garage so I don't have to smell it.
We are using them on comcast but all they do is convert an IR signal to RF. The box is irreverent. It should work with anything IR(infrared)
Height 10.0 inches Width 6.0 inches Depth 7.8 inches
If you have a "point & shoot" camera or a smaller camcorder type - yes this will work very well if attaching to the windshield glass or side window glass or even very clean and smooth paint. Clean and smooth is the trick. And these will also work using the "sand bag" type of dash plate for GPS mount suction cups like you get at Kmart stores.
My camera was that small too. I wouldn't use this product with that. If you are going to put it on the windshield it just puts the camera too close to windshield to position the camera.
I think it has to do with the fact that there is a drop down box for FOUR separate products on one page....
No you would need a cb much more powerful with range and a strong sourced antenna
yes, there is a zipper on the front of the bag
yes
No
though i have never connected this to any computer i would guess you can. you would need a 3.5 mm headphone jack on one end and a RCA double head on the other end.
You can hook it up to anything with a red and white connection. Or if you get the rca to 3.5mm jack then you can hook it up to anything with an input slot. I used this on my realistic lab 440 which doesn't have a preamp. Once I connected the ground from my turntable into the ground slot on this amp, my music sounded loud and clear.
it perfect , u control it
it is UL stickered.
12X is the speed that these CD's will accept new information i.e. the speed it will allow your computer to write.
No
It will fill the hole but won't handle the same wattage. ..
compaq presario v5000/v5305wm will support DDR PC3200/2700 memory modules
no you can't use a ddr2 on a ddr ,However you probably will be able to use a 1gb ddr pc2700 like the one in picture .
it is Non-ECC but not sure if it is buffered or Unbuffered.
Goto www.crucial.com and do their memory selector. It will tell you if this is correct memory for your laptop.
Keys are easy...and display with just a touch....I don't know what a flash card is.......
No
Wish I could help, but the screen's closed up in a basement storeroom, and I'm temporarily laid-up and can't manage the stairs. Maybe you could Google the name and model number and check that way, or see if you can find the information on the Da-Light corporate website. However, my guess is that with it's 5-foot high screen, and open tripod stand, the overall height would be somewhere between 7-8 feet.
It's some sort of rigid foam. Maybe polyurethane? Not sure.
I checked the label, and the very small print at the bottom states that it was made in Taiwan.
Hi the jeep wrangler sahara is the same as my jeep 2001. The metra 99-600 will fit perfectly with some plastic cuts to be performed manually( very simple with a simple knife) kind regards
Yes
Yes
It should.
the best way to find out is to call hummingbird at 1-800-633-1468.
I would say yes because it is only a switch.
I do not have connected to any video streaming just audio. I would say yes if you have a pure gigabit router and Internet pipe. The switch lights show yellow if you do not have the gig pipe and green if you do. HTH
If your LG and computer has a VGA portals, this should work, however, you will not have sound. Ideally, if you have HDMI portals on both, that would be the best way to go as HDMI cables deliver the audio and the video.
I wouldn't run 15a as a continual load but for jacking up a vehicle then you should be ok.
I have obe that thumbs but it's normal , I guess it depends on how bad it's doing it., make sure there's no load on it when your turning it off
No, sorry they would not be recommended.
Yes, I used it to replace the front and rear door speakers in a 2008 JDM Corolla Axio. Plugged them into the stock connector and the speakers to the adapter. Couldn't be simpler.
Just one. Expensive but sturdy
Unlikely, they did not exactly fit my 2004 TJ. I think they are actually designed for the 97-2003 TJs. Since I need to go ahead and get my speakers in, I cut the factory connector off and the black connector on these and used crimp connectors to attache to the vehicle and then used the spade connectors (pink in the image) to connect to the speakers.
They come two to a pack to do one set of speakers. I had to order two to do both my front and rear speakers.
No, you only need one. Please check out this video for more detail. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fs6v3rvuuk
Worked on my gm vehicle. Should work on all gm
If you have the Monsoon audio system, yes, this is the right harness. If you do NOT have Monsoon, then you would need a different harness, the 70-7301. Double check which audio system you have. Or, order both and return the one you end up not needing. Please note, Amazon has been shipping two different harnesses for the 70-2003. The one in a Metra red bag does not have the AMP power-on wire. The one in the generic clear plastic bag does have it.
John, I cannot tell you if they do or not. I do not own a Nissan. These were cross referenced to be used in my 2009 car that have similar connectors. Crutchfield says yes they do cross reference them with all Nissan vehicles. Hope this helps.
Hello, Amazon.com has a filter which can validate car parts according to your model. It will require you to have an account at Amazon and enter your car model. The rest is easy. If you are in the hurry Autozone and other car part stores will have the harness for trice of the amount you would pay here. Good Luck!
It says its supposed to but didn't fit my 03 sierra good luck I didn't use
I don't think so. It did NOT work on my 1999 Chevy Express woin a 1.5 din radio.
Yes
can't say for sure. I used it in my 2004 frontier with some modifications to the kit. It did not work as i expected though.
Just looked this car up and yes this unit will work with your car.
included power supply-- (9-15 VDC)
While this particular unit is not designed for this, you COULD do it if you used the headphone output (one of them) to send the signal out to the main mixer. If you do this, you would NOT want to use any inputs from the main mixer into the Rolls, just an input from your mic and input from your keyboard. Not ideal, and the main mixer would be getting a "headphone level" signal sent to it. Could introduce unwanted noise because that would be an unbalanced signal.
i suggest going to metra's website and verify the wire codes --- that is what i did before i purchased mine.
Yes, I think this harness should work on the 2003 Honda Element. You can also double check on the Crutfield.com site. Hope that helps
Yes
Never tried to use the mouse wheel as scroll lock, but it does let you scroll and it works pretty smooth. As far as right/left click is concerned, it is not configured by default to work as copy/paste, it will work as any other mouse. I am not aware if there is a way to configure the mouse to do copy paste in one click.
No, it is a one piece unit.
It's 1 3/4" long, 1 1/4" wide, and 1/2" high.
yup, it works with any desktop pc and mac as long as there is a USB port
Not sure - but I'd like to say it will, however, if it doesn't just return it.
Yes always on
As it looks in the picture. About twice the size of an USB male connector in every direction. The cable is still working strong, couldn't be happier with it.
It's also not returnable. I didn't find that out until I got it and attempted to return it and they said it couldn't because it was a "hazardous material" BS
I have only installed them with Plantronics cordless headsets. There is a connection on the base for this device.
According to their website, this is compatible with Vista. http://www.dlink.com/products/vista-support/
Yes, I use it all the time in my house as well as my camper in a remote area with next to nothing for cell service.
It doesn't "wear out." You put a little bit on the top of the CPU and when you install the fan, it spreads it around the top. One application should cover it all. Amount: about a small pea. If the unit keeps overheating, take off the cooler and apply a little more.
4 feet 5 inches
Yes, in the tone settings with remote
Yes -in fact there is one control lever for pointing camera up/down, and a second to rotate camera along lens axis for portrait/landscape orientation. There are also two built-in bubble levels for reference.
Yes. Each receiver only has one RCA plug capability. Not sure about extra TV's unless you can buy an extra receiver.
Not sure exactly but I have 4 working from one transmitter.
You have to check if your connections match the antennae connections. I am not familar with your router. One time I fitted a Linksys router with these antennae, flashed the router with DD-WRT, then plugged the Linksys router into the Quest Router (a crappy OEM router, maybe similar to your Verizon router) and used the new router as the main wireless router since it had the upgraded antennae. So there is the long way to get these antennae "attached" to a crappy OEM router that doesn't actually accept the antennae.
If the ear buds are small ( iPhone compatible ear buds) they fit snugly with Vic firths head phones. That's a great idea!! Hope this helps.
It's been a long time since I owned mine but I would guess the cord was in the 10 foot area. Use to sit right along side the RV so its hard to tell. Great unit though. Only took 10 to 15 min to hook it up.
Its supposed to work but to be honest it barely works on the player it was meant for. I am still searching for a good replacement
It has one large (4") vertical loop in the back.
I bought this several months ago for a gift. I don't have it to look at now. As I recall, I wouldn't consider it a water-proof case.
Yes. The 77 mm will cover most lenses. It only takes a second to white balance your camera with this, so there is no need to attach it to a lens. You just hold it with one hand and hold your camera with the other. While in Pre your press the shutter button. The camera will blink good. Wala you just set your white balance
You can call 1-888-883-3277, just don't trust them with your credit card number.
we haven't needed them yet after two years of use
No, It has no night vision, in fact , at night you see nothing, though its exellent at day light . There are options in ntework cameras with infrared leds ... Try That . Its better !
Yes I can , buy lately have come many better remote video cameras out . Try any 1.3 MegaPixel Network Camera with a NVR.
No this is the wrong device. The C2G 40019 converts a Digital Optical input (from a device like a Blu Ray Player) and converts it to a Coaxial Digital Output to be used as the input on a device like a receiver. The device you need is the C2G 40018 Coaxial to Optical Digital Audio Converter. This will take the Coaxial Digital signal from your DVD player and convert it to a Digital Optical signal to be used as the input to your sound bar.
type this into the search box.coaxial digital audio to optical digital audio converter.if this comes up, the coaxial digital cable should come out of the tv and into the first part of the converter.then the optical digital cable should come out of the other end and into the yamaha.
The power supply lists the input at 0.2 amps at 100-240VAC. At 110V, that would be 22 watts. The output of the power supply is 250mA at 6V, which is 1.5 watts. The power supply is not warm when the device is not being used, which suggests that the input is less that 22watts when in "standby".
I'm not sure what the difference is internally, but I've never had any luck with any other cable besides the OEM sirius brand ones. There is a guy on ebay that sells just the cable. He wants $25 for one with free shipping. They ship out of Israel for whatever reason.. so it takes about 10 days or so to arrive.
Yes it can easily. I put it in my din pocket after i cut it.
As it mentions under the product details: Product Dimensions: 7 x 0.2 x 4.5 inches ; 0.5 ounces
No
No it is not. I wish it were.
Hi - Yes, they should be very good. I already had our 8-year old granddaughter wear these and they're very comfortable, nice and cushy and they stay in place. And they're adjustable as well and they keep the sound inside the ear piece better than more costly ones I've used, so others won't hear much.
Noise leakage is minimal. This set of headphones is exceptional for the price.
1/8"
Yes
Included is a metal tripod-attaching frame that screws into the center pivot post (once you remove it) of the binocs. Then that frame has two choices for where your tripod quick-release platform screw can be inserted and tightened. I have NOT yet assembled the binocs to my tripod so can't comment on the overall quality and balance of the two put together...but my guess is it could be a bit top heavy.
That doesn't sound like a problem with Amazon's description, that sounds like a problem with "DB Roth". I would take it up with "DB Roth". (of course this advice is probably arriving 6 months too late to be of any value).
Well, I don't know, but it seems to me like the problem is the opposite. I.e. it turns itself off when one battery is charged, but there are three that are not.
Yes. That is exactly what the remote wire was designed to do. You can use either front or rear out. If you are only hooking up a subwoofer, I personally would hook it up to the front outputs because I usually keep my rear speakers faded down a bit to use as fill.
Yup, in fact, that's what I did. I busted open the plastic housing and pulled out the circuitry, then drilled out a hole in the glovebox and mounted the knob. That way, I opened the glovebox and adjusted the levels if needed.
I have it installed in an '04 suburban & no, it does not work with the steering wheel controls. It was annoying at first but I have adapted!
If you have to connect to both the ebrake and the regular brake yes.
7.5 inches. Great miniature tripod.
yes. i have a nikon and a canon. both attach to the tripod.
It would support a point and shoot just fine as long as there is a place to screw the tripod onto the bottom of the camera, as it is the only way to attach the camera to the tripod.
Sounds like what you need. My application required going from the orange RCA coax type on the TV and converting to the fiber optic type on the soundbar. It all works fine, but the converter does not come with either the coax cable or the fiber optic cable.
It won't work ... Since the 3.5 is for toslink not aux... What exactly are you trying to do? Maybe I can help you...
No. The orange cable is not an optical/fiber optic cable cable (Toslink). The Toslink cable has to connect to a Toslink connection at each end. The Orange receptacle has to use a matching orange receptacle on both ends (it is basically a copper wire connection, digital output from the Blu-Ray to digital input at the AV receiver). The Blue Ray Player probably also has an HDMI 'out' connection. If your AV receiver has an HDMI 'in' connection, this is the best way to go. Cheers,
You could not use it on Bose Wave radio, radio does not have an additional description like SPDIF optical port. It is regular audio jack only.

Yes. I am sharing a printer with two separate computers, one running Win7 and one running XP.
Yep
I actually bought mine directly from Amazon.com with Prime. It no longer comes in this mint green color but an orange color. When I received it, I called Panasonic directly questioning the color and they assured me I received the correct battery. I purchased it on May 13th and it's still working great. It holds the charge and I can talk for hours on the phone again. Lol
I replaced mine after approximately 5 years of normal use and regulAr recharging.
Yes, it works OK with mine. I may have had to download the newer driver - ACB10US1 Driver for Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8 - I can't remember.
The jack is "L" shaped.
Bruce, I'm sorry I can't measure it for you. We moved into a retirement home two years ago and no longer own this device. It did work well up until the time of our move though.
no, well you'll have to mount them on an insulated material and then modify the enclosure. the wires mount on the shaft to the solder terminals
This is a 30amp relay so it depends hoy you wire it, mine is hooked up to a electronic car fan and thermostat
No is made for 12 v dc
Depends on what is controlling the actuator. This is the part that does the work but you still need something to control the actuator. For me it is an alarm system which does not have the functionality that you are inquiring about. It is both or none for me.
It should work, maybe not a direct bolt in, but with some minor modifications you should be able to make it work fine. It's function is to act as a simple solenoid and move the lock bar up or down, or forward and back, depending on the style of your locks. It is very adaptable and should work fine.
I used an adapter, I'm not sure it would work correctly if you only plugged into the left side. Adapters and other cables are extremely cheap online, so I would just grab what's needed and do it the right way.
Yes it will work! Run a component wire (RCA) cable from subwoofer out on ur Yamaha to red rca plug in on subwoofer! In fact u could have 2 seperate subwoofers with ur stereo if like!
There are only a right and left audio plugin on back of unit. I had to order the one that has one Plug on one end and splits to aid to plug right and left because my Yamaha receiver has one output but this sub woofer has a right and a left
The subwoofer would be a great addition,just don't turn up the bass too much it may over power your pioneer speakers.
Hello. All of the items offered by Norex Group are shipped from the US.
That's not really enough info. Chances are if it was made after 2010, probably, but I'd need to know the model of te drive or your computer.
Absolutely...
You can try to connect it to your sound card with compatible ends or connect directly to speakers with speaker wire. I just use the RCA jack for my surround sound system.
No. This is for supplying power and data to a POE device. I use it for POE cameras.
Not sure what the dimensions are of the rs120 but this connector is standard square push in type.
it is compatible. Just be sure to remove the little plastic protectors from the ends of the cable first.
came with one piece in my order.
Too many unknowns, but in general, yes.
It was non ECC

I looked on the back of mine and SKR-4200U is listed as the the MODEL. Here are the other numbers on the back. CODE: 903U71210101 FCC ID: GJJSKR-4200U P/N: GTU-0033 S/N: 0DRY463985 KR2. Hope this helps! :-)
I am sorry all I know as a periodontist it works great with close up introral photographs.
Not available from us
Yes, the nikon mount version works with all nikon models
The lens works with both crop and full-frame sensors, hence the DG label. It is a fantastically sharp lens, you will love it!
Yes
Yes
Posts are 1/4", 3/8" ring terminal will work OK
I have used the 100 - 200 amp fuses with no problem I would think all the fuses would work for the design the holder is fairly big to make accomidations for different sizes
it works fine with 8.1. you do have to install it in control panel-audio
No it can't. The connection for this is the audio and sound jacks found on a desktop tower
I used the headset on my HP laptop. It worked great. I have not tried these on a Lenovo PC.
The HT10DBS's clamping voltage is 140V. Thank you for your interest in the HT10DBS!
Yes
No the mounting screw is fixed yet, you can buy any head which can be mounted onto a fixed mount. See: http://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-323-Connect-Adapter-200PL-14/dp/B001ASU1QO/ref=pd_sim_p_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=1S74QE608X4NMFPS1KDZ Or this one:
It's a mono pod.
Have you tried to switch the satellites to see if that is the problem? I had the same problem and found out it was something with the remote. I tried the satellites in the opposite jacks and the one that didn't work now worked. When I bought a second set, I tried the remote with the old one and all worked fine. Now I am having the same problem with that second set.
Hi, this Sony CD Walkman do have a settings for repeating music. It is under P MODE. -Ely
Yes, the rack-mount brackets are included.
Hi Acousticstrings, There is no input/output jack to a cd player or other device. - Jerome
Yes, you can - it has a manual VOR switch with setting H, L and Off. Have loved this recorder, though I use it mostly for playing tapes. It's very sturdy, still working after several drops, as I carry it around in a pocket while I'm working around.
No, a regular tape
Outside is about 7x10x3 inches (smaller than a sheet of paper). Inside is about 1 1/2inches deep...lots of foam in top portion eats up the space. (Maybe remove it if need more room inside.)
Minimum 4 gauge.
Yes otherwise you will not get the best of them. They are big speakers and need extra power. I have an amplifier on my boat but not sure how big it is. I have the smaller speakers not connected to the amp and works well this way but will be also connecting them to the amp.
No. Only NiMh
It is made for 9.6 NiMh volt batteries and charges them very well. I'm not sure if it will work with the same desired results for Lithium batteries. You may need a charger just for Lithiums.
There is a tab on the TC that prevents mating it to the 18-300.
Needs to be plugged into a lighter outlet in a vehicle
I've been wonder this very same thing and thought I would provide a link to the article regarding not using the subwoofer port. I'm not sure if I understand it, but here it is : http://www.polkaudio.com/education/article.php?id=19
I don't think so. The most I've tried is 30 degrees and it works at that angle. The instructions say it won't work at 45 degrees but I haven't tried.
This particular model is made for PCI legacy also known as 32-bit. In this pic is is the 5th one down http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PCIExpress.jpg There are other models which will fit the PCI express 1 which is a much smaller slot. Mostly the PCI express 16 is for larger video cards.
Yes it does depending your application your using it for. If you have problems you can roll it back to legacy driver which is included with Windows 7. You can do that in the device manager. It should work with out problems for most applications except for audio interfaces which seem to need the legacy driver. I hope that answers your question.
I'd say about 2.5 inches.
27 inches.
If your Canon is capable of being mounted on a tripod (screw hole in the bottom), yes. Matched up perfetly with my Sony A230.
Yes, it's really tall, but it's not made for lights. Use a hot shoe adapter on your camera to add lighting.
You will need the cable from Quantum for linking the battery pack to the Canon 580ex flash.
Yes, there's a manual exposure mode and the lens has a switch to turn auto-focus on or off.
The T2 is a film camera and does not take video.
Yes 70-300m Telephoto Lens fit in this bag. Personally I am using this bag for my Canon Rebel T5i camera with 18-55m + 75-300mm lens and also some filters. I am satisfied with this bag.
No. I have the same lens and I had to break the camera down to store it.
I can only tell you it seemed to be a sturdy bag. The velcro section dividers can be rearranged to hold your camera and other items in place. We bought this case for work to move a fingerprint machine from different locations. The buckle straps seemed real sturdy. Hope this helps
Yes it's an official Sony battery.
I bought the Canon 10-22mm because it was a little bit faster (3.5/4.5 vs 4.0/5.6) and gave me a little more range on the zoom. I tend to trust Canon glass over Sigma personally especially with the technical components. I've shot on the Sigma and the Canon and as far as picture quality goes, I give the edge to the Canon lens.
6 feet
Yes, it will work just fine. It has the EF-S mount which is compatible with all Canon APS-C (non full frame) cameras. Be sure to learn to use Canon DPP software so you can clean up the images. It's a nice lens but distortion at 17mm is noticable, can be mostly fixed with DPP.
USA warranty
This sub is terrible. Hit decently for a little while (couple months) at 400watts rms from my viper before smoking up a storm.
I'm not sure but two POUND in my Obcon dual 10th with the 1 or 1 1/2 in. slotted vent port down the center.
Tripod mounts are standard. Any tripod or monopod will fit any camera with a tripod mount. If your camera has a 1/4 - 20 threaded hole on the bottom, any tripod or monopod will fit. The Nikon D300 has such a mount.
I have found that it goes on easily in the correct position, but seems to get stuck on the lens when reversed. It has been stuck so bad, that I thought I was going to damage the lens getting it off.
Not sure. Goto canon.com, type in the lense model, and look at the specs....which will include the lense hood. Canon OEM hoods work with filters on and will not impede the lense function.
Yes, the battery IS compatible with both the XT body AND the CB-2LW charger.
About 500 pictures but less if you use flash or spend a lot of time viewing your photos on the screen.
Here is my two cents, Klipsch RF82 might has deeper bass performance due to its larger driver (dual 8") to handle the lower end, but Polk has a more even performance cross whole sound range and it handled the bass very well as well. Polk M-70 has a very similar SPEC and performance as their current running model of TSI500 which cost about $800/pair (which I am using). Polk M-70 ($400/pair) is a much better value (Cost/Performance) compare to Klipsch RF82 which cost about $1200/pair.
Yes, they both use the PS0913B power supply.
I can't tell you, not having a GNX2. I see Amazon sells the "Digitech PSS3-120 Power Supply for GNX2, GNX3, GNX3000, GNX4, J-Station" power supply separately, so it sounds like there is a difference. Amazon doesn't give any specs on either.
ONLY Sony MUSIC CD's (with the purple label) will work on my stand-alone Audio CD Recorders (made by Phillips, Teac, Kenwood, Crosley, [non-computer based]) as they have a bluish-green tint and have a special encoding to tell the recorder that they have they have paid a 'royalty fee' to record music. Standard CD's and many bogus Imation/Maxell/Verbatum/Memorex "Music CD's" do NOT have the proper encoding anymore to work in these stand-alone Audio CD recorders. So be careful with what you choose. Purple wrapper Sony's are the ONLY brand that work in my (non-computer-based) Music CD recorders anymore.
I have not tried to make a copy from the original cd that I have made.... Yet. I do not see why you could not unless your recording system has the copyright protection and automatically writes that on the "master" cd. One thought though, if you are copying CDs the original cd may have the copyright protection. If that is the case, then you probably would not be able to copy it to begin with. I used these for vinyl album recordings and vinyl albums never had copyright protection. I hope this helps
Probably depends more on the amp. But I wouldn't be using it for much over 200, I see some use filters to block the higher frequencies but I split my low frequency signal
I use these at home in my couch. With that said an amp that is 50w with a low pass filter will work. It doesn't have to be super high end because you probably won't play any frequencies 500hz tops.
Tube...it's about 16 inches with the ends on it
The item came with an operating manual, so I never had to download one. It was a gift for my sister, so I do not recall the Warranty, but believe it was more than 90 days. She still has it and uses it, I think I bought it back in 07 or 09.
Should be smooth with no obvious change to edges.
I used it to capture with Wirecast. In Wirecast you can choose the file format. I am not aware of the proprietary software that may come with it and the file formats it can provide, but anyway with MPEG Streamclip (http://www.squared5.com) you can cross convert video files from virtually any format without compromising quality and it is a free application. This Canopus is a very fine piece of hardware as long as you are capturing standard definition video. If HD video is available, i would suggest moving up to a Blackmagic MiniRecorder for HDMI or SDI.
Excellent Question. The Units made by PCCABLES.COM and 2 Pairs Twisted and 2 Pairs Straight thru So POE will work with these. Pin - Out Diagram listed user this Link. http://pccables.com/02236.html
I have used mine to cross over cat 5e with no problems.
Yes, it works with the redline.
doesn't work at all....save your money
It uses a signal that should not affect anything on a plane. I think you'd be ok.
Should. It IS a Universal keyboard, after all.
Does it have blu-tooth ability? If yes, it should.
ho, it wont Nokia N86 doesn't have an infrared port
not sure , also HD DVD players no longer are selling,unless you have an old one, Blue ray is the best choice, however the HD DVD player will play regular DVD' s
I found 2" covers here [pkg of 4] from a vendor in Florida. http://www.scansound.com/Headphone-Foam-Earpads-F30.htm
Yes, it came with a black plastic bag for travel.
It's about 6ft long
Technical specifications on Bose products are not published. Testing conditions and means of measurement can vary from one manufacture to another, and specifications may not present the optimal way for understanding a product's audio quality. Thank you.
They are for fiber connections
Standard One Year.
Doubtful - I bought a few of these about three years ago and that doesn't appear to be the same model I bought - which was GS748TNA. Fwiw, they're still working.
The center of each socket is just under 2 inches from the next socket. If you look at the photo--showing that the grounding pin of a three-prong plug goes perpendicular to the length of the device--you should be able to measure your plugs and know whether they'' fit. Just put two of your plugs adjacent to each other, the way they'd fit on this extension strip, and see whether there's more than just under 2 inches between the center of the two adjacent plugs (halfway between the two main prongs of your plugs).
Yes. It also works well with 120-240 volt 50-60 cycle transformers.
There's a switch to turn power to the outlets on or off.
I use it with Wind 7 and it works great!!!! the USB interface is universal, and the effects it comes with work with any program that uses the VST protocol.
yes indeed!
Have a RCA personal CD player that slips into the pouch easily. Don't know your Walkman. Carrier is made from stretchy material. Has flap that folds down and secures with Velcro.
The entire system connects thru a single 3.5mm plug , just like a set of headphones
I don't think it will work. It is made for strobe firing not constant running.
If it is not for Pentax, you can not use. Since new Added for Pentax, please consider
If it is not for Pentax, you can not use. Since new Added for Pentax, please consider
Yes you will have a problem. You need the correct model of flash. The connections to the cameras are different
I don't think it will work. It is made for strobe firing not constant running.
My unit came with a nice padded carry case and a variety of adapter rings. I would ask the vendor if this is included in their package.
An external flash must "communicate" with the camera to which it is attached to fire properly. One of these is configured to operate with certain Canon cameras, and the other is configured to operate with certain Nikon cameras.
It will work only on a tripod, it is manual and to get it into focus is a lot of struggling. It is very front heavy and this is why you need the tripod. Other than that is will work for taking distance if you are not in a hurry.
Yes
Yes no issue at all
Yes, it does. I own a: Canon Digital Rebel XT 8MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 Lens (Black) and bought a "SanDisk ULTRA II HIGH PERFORMANCE 4GB (SDCFH-4096-901" for it, and so far it has worked great. Bought both, the camera and card, back in October of 2007. I have been able take many pics at the highest resolution. Regarding your second questions, the 2GB would be enough, but I think it's better to have the extra capacity.
Just make sure that your card fits the slot in the reader. Take your card to the store with you or rely on the card reader specifics to identify compatibility.
I'm no camera expert but my son-in-law is a semi-professional photographer and uses a Canon (not sure its a rebel) but if your camera calls for using compact flash memory, you should be able to use any size capacity (GB rating) card. The physical size of the card is no different if 1 GB or 64GB. The only limitation would be if there is a maximum size card -- in terms of its GB capacity -- that might be recommended by Canon for your particular model.
Yes
Hmm...I can't see the original question, though the link asked if I could answer it. :) I'm *guessing* you own an audio component that records music....I have a Sony machine and it requires CD-R "music" discs, and will not work with "regular" CD-Rs. The ones I have found that DO work are either Sony CD-R Music discs OR Staples CD-Rs (I think "audio" on the package, but it is not on the disc itself, I just checked). So far, those are the only two brands that work in my CD-R recorder. Best of luck....
I wouldn't buy it. It's not even worth $10.. Not at all what I expected.
for am the antenna does not have to be extended
Yes
I can't speak for current availability, but I got my first 1102 in black. Looks nice too.
Me Interesa saber si este modelo tiene buena recepcion en onda corta o debo tomar otra opcion gracias
YES, works with mine :)
Yes it is 12V
if you're talking about the SATA speed ports, I have mine plugged into a SATA 6GB port and not a problem
The one I received was new.
Nope, sure won't. It plugs into the headphone jack, not the dock connector. I know because I have this model and an iPod touch. Any other model of iPod is also going to work the same way.
yes, I use it with my Vision M and it works great. I thought it was an excellent buy.
Impedance 8 ohms: Sensitivity 85 +- 3db: Power Handling 20 - 100 watts: Frequency Response 130Hz to 20,000Hz
It does not. But speaker wire is relatively inexpensive.
Hi Barry -- I am not sure. I got it as a gift for someone, sorry! When it arrived, it was a very nice camera though.

Hi, apparently this Sony High Definition Camcorder is an NTSC system-based camcorder. It doesn't shoot PAL video system. -Ely
At a guess a male to male adapter. I got one at radio shack
no need to. The sabrent has a built in dvr to record tv shows.
There is a template in the box.
Yoy would be fine, if memory serves youd have away good inch and a half to mount too.
This crossover is the best thing that you can use clarion is the way to go.
Looks like that one is for Nikon mounts, so I would say no. Try this one instead: http://www.amazon.com/Sigma-55-200mm-Telephoto-Digital-Cameras/dp/B0001VQ12Y/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1392059621&sr=1-1&keywords=sigma+55-200+canon
This product is as "bootleg" as they come. :)
this set does not, as it is not mentioned or pictured, that is why the price is less than normal. i will be listing a brand new set soon that is complete with equalizer just as if you ordered straight from bose in a few days though, for a few hundred less than normal.
again, this product is compatible with ALL MAJOR ALARM COMPANIES. I don't think I'm allowed to mention specific names, but the answer is yes.
The Ademco 5816 transmitter has a Transmit Frequency of 345MHz Look at the older Ademco wireless for a 315mhz transmitter.
Absolutely! I hooked it up to a motion sensor light. However you need two things: 1. get a toggle switch to shut off the alarm because it will turn on until the motion sensor warms up. 2. you need to get a dc/ac adaptor so you can plug it into the house current. I made two and they work great.
No. The 9V battery does not have the ability to drive the sounder.
i don't even understand the question , if indeed it's a question.
If Firewire works on your computer already, then adding this hub should be fine. I've used it with Mac OS X and Windows XP on the Mac. I have multiple chained together connecting my Hard Drives, D-VCR, Cable Box and TV... all at the same time.
You need to order it with Ethernet i/f. Interface Built-in USB interface + serial, or Ethernet only interface
They are stereo. (Just make sure you're listening to a stereo mix.)
No. It's "TV-B-Gone," not "Everything-That-Displays-Images-B-Gone."
There are TVs on EVERYWHERE at this point, and most of the time they're just carrying advertising and crap that nobody is watching. I don't know when we got to the point where people can't be in a room without some kind of screen in their face, but I'm glad there's a way to stop it.
No
I tried #450 on my radio and it does not pull that number.
It is a kit and it will need to put together and the parts soldered into place. It is pretty easy just pay attention when you put the mic's on they have to go on a certain way. There are one tab on the side of the case. I hope this will answer your question
thats what i bought it for. don't buy it, i threw it in the garbage.
warranty direct from HP. it is brand new in seal. will not accept return or exchange if open and used.
For 10lto tapes going to Toulouges, France 66350 it would be about $190 UPS World Wide Expedited $200 UPS World Wide Saver $75 FedEx International Economy $80 FedEx International Priority This excludes all taxes and duties required by country of import.
AC. You would need a rectifier to convert ac to dc.
Yes. Check four-thirds.org for info on lenses and bodies in the standard four-thirds group.
Again 100khz to 30 mhz only. You will need a computer or external decoder which you could link to line out on the radio. OK for casual use not for situations where your life or the lives of others might depend on it.
Yes, you can use it with a treadmill as long as the treadmill will meet the power rating of the surge protector.
That's normal, no problem.
ebay
Yes these are very durable. My 7year old uses them all the time
No.
I believe the Bose pieces are compatible with each other.
Hi. There is not an optical port on this model.
Yes it would work with the one headphone jack. They are mainly for computer speakers which consist of three speakers, meaning three outputs. You have the option to use one, two, or all three outputs.
I have the older model which uses a wide connector. The newer ones use a smaller one. You'd best take your IPod to a store and try it out
What is the question? All I see is "Wilson both sides sma connectors". The picture and Part # 971107 is an n male to an FME male, which I think is the same as an SMA.
I am not completely sure Christine. I would see what type of microphone jack the Pearlcorder takes and match it up to this one. I would like to think it would fit, but maybe not....Some have those "skinnier" plugs....Good luck, sorry I could not be of more help!
the Timers menu has an entry delay setting that I believe applies to all sensors, minimum is 30 secs
I used 14 and it was very tight. 16 seems to be a good gauge.
Yes if it has an automated distributor,it will.
You must have asked a question about the wrong item, this is a pair of binoculars, not a camera. No megapixels, no memory or memory cards no batteries.
No, there is no stabilizing mechanism. These are small and light binoculars, and the downside to the smaller size is a smaller field of vision and the need to adjust the width to an absolutely precise distance between your eyes, otherwise you won't be able to see through both lenses at once. If steadiness is a problem, it might be better to purchase full sized binoculars, as there is more tolerance for motion in the bigger ones, even if they're heavier.
Have not noticed any interference. However, my audio is balanced or digital.
Flat, 45 degree angled plug.
The dome is about 4" diameter across. The base in which the dome mounts to is about 6". Mounting plate is about 2.5" across. From top of knuckle to bottom of dome is about 7 to 8". I have these mounted at the top of two story buildings so measurements are not exact. Hope this helps.
Tinted and you can't see through it.
You'll have to ask a lawyer about that one - I'm sure there is 'expectation of privacy' issues, even where a fake camera in involved. Of all places, Amazon isn't the place to ask for legal advice :)
No, case must be off for it to fit.
It locks in pretty tight, my 9 year old takes it around the house and it stays put.
yes either that or DVI-HDMI adapter if you already have a DVI-D cable lying around (not DVI-I single link). You can purchase one here, just search for tripp-lite DVI HDMI adapter.
Yes. they dropped right in. Even screws lined up.
Yes
Wow! I bought that for gift and I don't know, sorry.
I don't think so...
Yup. Sometimes I see them in thrift stores! (Goodwill, Salvation Army)
Yes, mine did. I believe all digital cameras come ready to take pictures
THANK YOU!!! I was looking and looking and couldn't find if it would fit the 430EX.
You have to calibrate the R frequency from you DVD to you headphones , they have two settings A/B . Turn them on and change the selector.. that should do it.
The one that I purchased came with one.
Regrets that I can't answer your question. They didn't fit my Plantonics headphone set because they were too small & it was too late for me to return them to the company. I just threw them away... I would call the company if I were you....
Sorry, no idea. Maybe you should ask the seller.
According to
They have a sound frequency crossover installed. I connected across from the main speaker terminals. I don't know about the ohm resistance but they work great on my 5 ch. System.
I'm not familiar with the terminology you're using but I hooked mine up to be in parallel with the assoc. output BUT I installed a .22ufd capacitor on the positive input of the tweeter speaker to protect it from the lower frequencies. I hooked these up to the front and rear outputs of the sound system. It give the effect of having a different sound out of each speaker even if 2 were connected to the same output line.
Yes. They are very good as well. A great buy.
Don't buy these speakers, they are cheap and blows very easily
Yeah I mean they look good and they sound alright for it being what it is but I'd reccomend getting some kickers or digital designs
I would think that they would yes. Double check on the depth of them. Good luck.
No
All you will need is a Phillips screw driver and a box cutter to cut the circle holes in the ceiling and all peicies fur the speaker are in the box. It's a very simple installation me and my father did mine in a few hours.
I used a paper clip and made a small bend enough to get in the grill, do not poke the actual speaker, I unsure if the tweeter cover is removable
Probably needs to be 6 inches. I already had holes for my speakers. I just had to make them a little bigger.
This happened to me too- it actually melted to the windshield and when I finally got it off there was a black rubber circle on the windshield. Now the suction doesn't work anymore. Be careful leaving it in the sun for long periods of time.
The only difference is that the c530 has a high sensitivity "surf" receiver. Keep in mind though, both units will come with the older v8 mapping because they do not have the internal memory to load the new 2008 maps. The units will become regionalized which means you will have to choose between loading the lower 48 states, or Canada and the border states.
Sigma makes several models of their 70-300mm lens. Without the specific model, I am unable to determine which filter is needed. The couple of models that I reviewed on Amazon indicate the they use the 58mm filter NOT 52mm filter.
Do you mean "Do I need labels"? Labels are nice, of course, but you can also write on the top of the disc with a permanent marker, with some caveats. There are now thoughts that even marker ink will eventually bleed through the top surface and degrade your recording. Here is a good article on the subject, including info on newer markers deemed safer: http://www.tapeonline.com/articles/using-permanent-ink-markers-on-cds-dvds Amazon currently has some of these "safer" markers for sale. I haven't tried them myself - just look for "Sharpie CD/DVD Twin Tip Permanent Markers" here.
i know your concern and all I can say is that I received the authentic 95101 AZO Taiwan made discs for DVD-r (The +R were/are 95098 AZO from Taiwan as well) DVD-r is ID'd as Manufacturer ID: MCC 03RG20 DVD+r is ID'd as MID: MCC-004-00
I am about 90% sure that it will work on a Dell Zino computer
Hi Dr. K, Yes, this is definitely Mac compatible, for versions 10.1.5 on up, according to their product specs. Hope this helps - I plan to buy one of these myself, and I'm strictly a Mac person. -sasha
You asked of the Nikon ATB 10x25 has a 25 year warranty, but I bought the Nikon ATB 8x25. They turned out to be a bad choice. I suggest the person asking this question go read the 9 reviews of the 8x25 Nikons, which specifically address the warranty and (lack of) service.
Yep. Soft case
the bit rate of this cable is 6Gbit
I use the Terk on my garage television and I get almost every channel of the basic cable which I have inside the house. It works very well, I do recommend it.
yes.
In short, this is a radio transmitter, which sends a signal like "turn on light #3" or "turn off light #3" you need a receiver to hear that signal and you need a switch (or switches) to do something about it. (You might use 3 of these, one receiver, and 3 switches.)
these are not powered and lack the oomph in my opinion. Depends on the application. IF you are going to use a powered amplifier they are fine but for something like an iPad or mobile device they are NOT loud.
The cord length is 12 ft. And they are good but the sound quality sucks on anything but t.V's and boom box.
I have a HDR-HC9 and I am in the market for a video light. According to Sony on their web page this light: HVL-HL1 is compatible to the camcorder. Other compatible lighta are: HVL-HFL1 Combination Video Light and Flash, and HVL-HIRL Combination Video and Infrared Light.
If your cam has a video light chuck it will surely fit. Google it first to be sure. sony say if it will be compatible by giving your Model no. CX430V
Hi, The Sony AC-L200 AC Adapter is the compatible charger for the battery of your Sony HDR-CX380 Camcorder. Vincent
No, it does not.
Absolutely NOT!! That is too much voltage.
No, they look similar but are made by a different manufacturer for Sony. The Costco units were made by a Sony exclusive factory and coded "Sony 16D1" while the new ones are made by MBI in India and coded "01RG40". Not one of my 3 Sony RDR-HX900 recorders could use any of these discs, and reported them as "dirty disc". Sony changed because the original factory went out of business. They may be fine with other recorders, but I'd check compatibility before buying a lot of them. I hope this helps.
mine are 2.0
Works on our Paper white.
The cord is approximately 4' long.
No it won't. Not even close. I believe you need a BP-511 for the 30D. But look it up.
Mike, Do you have your owner manual. If not try typing in your camcorder make/model under accessories "Battery and check too see if the model of your battery matches your old on. G. Ferguson
Sorry I cannot help. I used this battery on my old RCA model CC416.
Probably not. When I bought mine a few years ago, I had a 15.6" HP Pavilion dv6. I couldn't fit the laptop in the correct pocket without a small part of the laptop sticking out. Instead I bought a simple HP sleeve to store my laptop and put it in the opening next to the laptop pocket. I filled the laptop pocket with books, notebooks, etc instead. My laptop dimensions: 14.9" (L) x 10.15" (D) x 1.33" (min H)/1.61" (max H)
Yes, it will.
Take a look at the picture and description of this Toslink cable to see if it will work... http://www.amazon.com/D3-Digital-Converter-Optical-Toslink/dp/B005K2TXMO/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top If you are not sure, you can call Senheisser's 800#, they are extremely knowledgeable and helpful when I had questions about the 140's, one in particular was a cable question that I didn't even know existed and it fixed my connection issue. Here is their USA number: Toll Free: 1-(877)-736-6434. Hope this helps. ~M
You will need to buy one. My camera (I bought the kit with the basic lens) arrived in the mail today, but I had shopped around for the best deal on the memory card and that won't arrive for another two days, so I can't use it yet.
Todd- I've talked to a few professional photographers and semi-professionals and they've all said the same thing...the XT is an excellent camera and the differences between the two are not worth the extra money. Buy the XT and invest in a good lens. Those with "is usm" have autofocus and image stabilization. By chance, have you ever ordered a camera through Amazon before? I'm wondering if it will contain the original USA Warranty. Thanks and Good Luck!
The best way is to route your TV's audio output to your A/V receiver, and use the outputs on the receiver to drive the headphones, switching the speakers off. If going straight from the TV, you have to have the volume turned up high enough to drive headphones. Not all TVs have enough output.
Yes
No
Yes, it works with anything that has a headphone jack.
We have six of these in our backyard! We love the surround sound and love the sound of these! We highly recommend a third!
Bose is way overpriced and the sound was comparable
Yeah, I have that same problem. Rockband really screwed up a good thing. I won't buy 4 or anymore they come out with.
Yes, it can attach to a tripod
Yes it does.
It will be easier with this this lens than with a lens thats not as wide, but people tend to look more natural around 50-85mm
This is the older version. The newest version is much sharper, focuses more accurately, and is definitely the lens you want to purchase.
Yes, just did mine last night. The focus was off 12mm !!! The lens was working fine on my old 350d, totally shocked.
Mine can't take wireless access list and keeps losing connection/rebooting several times a night. When I called them they said I don't need the wireless access list - well, why did they make it available??? Horrible support. DON'T BUY THIS ROUTER.
You have to make sure that the eyepiece is in right and full seated so the mirror will focus on the eyepiece mirror and the focus adjust on the eyepiece can focus the image the big mirror sees
Yes. You will need at least one pair of eyepieces of the same type to use the binos.
Hello Patty, Honestly I dont know. It might have to do with the total focal lenght, I ran into a problem with attaching a reducer then the diagonal then the bifocal then the eyepiece, and i could not focus properly. You best bet is to call Celestron on Monday, sorry I could not help more, Jim
There is no aperture listed. The one I purchased is model # 93691... I would go with what Celestron claims. It fits into the 1.25" eyepiece holder with no problems.
Not familiar with the L330 but it didn't work with my L110.
No it doesn't,
Yes if you know what your doing. For the price, a nice binocular for sure!
No
The sound is decent. But like anything else, if you spend more you get more. I have a Yamaha 350 watt power amp. I am going to up grade back to Yamaha, Carver, Kenwood.. The pyramid is just a get me buy until you get your money up. I hope this helps.
Its designed for car audio but it may work. I don't where to install for video. Consult a car installation place about the issue, you can't be the first person to have that issue.
I have the home version of Windows 7 on my laptop. I've been successful syncing my Tungsten E2 on it. My 3rd party program Documents To Go, also works, but MS Outlook 2010 doesn't sync the e-mail messages. (That isn't because of Windows 7.)
I think you can but an email to Palm Technical Suppport may helo.
Yes... It's 60! When you see a single number they are primes!
I don't remember if the cable is analog, but it does connect to a digital TV. All the cords you need are included. I love this recorder, it is a great machine. Dubbing from video to DVD is supereasy.
works with my Aplha 320. Should work with the A200.
i have found it an excellent, affordable, all-purpose lens; manageable size, broad range of zoom ... major down side is that the camera takes a fair amount of time to focus in
Yes.
It told me on the site if it fit my camera or not! Enter your camera in the area to see if it fits your camera!
The Red Switch Does NOT Light Up.
I don't know.
If it says passive then yes. I will tell you that I love mine.
Yes
It appears to have a different microphone casing and now comes in a fancy box like the higher-end in-ear monitor products.
Yes, you can keep Nikon D7000 with 18-140 lens,
just take a jpeg image with the d2x and open the file with a program that is capable of reading all of the relevant ebedded data, such as photoshop cs5/6...go to file/file info/raw data...then look down the list for 'image number' and there you are!!
From the look of the pictures provided, it seems that if you attach the battery back to the back of the iPod Touch with the provided clip/attachment, the headphone jack would be blocked. BUT, I would think that you could connect the battery pack simply with the 16-pin connector, and not using the piggy-back adaptor, which would allow use of the headphone jack.
the tone sounds good to me. i am going by the unit being in a mid sized bath room all the time. i bought it for my wife.
No....it only has a jack for headphones.
The plug fits into your laptop (and my tablet). There's no need for an adapter. As a matter of fact, they send a larger adapter that allows you to plug into a traditional stereo.
I wear them all day at work. Pretty light and cozy they are.
as long as the unit is reasonably near the FM antenna of your stereo it will work fine..if you have a rooftop mounted antenna then it will likely have poor performance..
I'm sorry but I have no idea . I bought it to enhance my signal and it didn't do the job. I sent it back
It didn't for us. I couldn't tell that it did anything. We gave up on clear and got cable.
Briefly, yes. The quality of the lens is good and therefore it can yield a good image. As you know, the telephoto lens will draw the background closer and that aspect can promote an interesting perspective (relationship between foreground and background). Ideally, you are best disposed to go into the field with both a telephoto and a wide angle lens. Enjoy the lens. While not an 'L' series lens this "glass" will give you pleasing and sharp images. Hope this helps.
hold the &lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt; down for a bit and it rewinds/fast forwards, you release when you are to the point you want to be at. a quick tap will go back and forward by track. hope this helps!
Not sure if this helps but I got my 6-year-old 1st generation(!) ipod to work with Vista with no problems. If I can get that old dinosaur to be Vista compatible I'm sure the nano should work just fine. You might have to fool around with the itunes security properties, but other than that, I don't see a reason why it shouldn't work.
Why not just try to reset it? 1. Toggle the Hold switch on and off. 2. Press and hold the Menu and Center (Select) buttons simultaneously until the Apple logo appears, about 6 to 8 seconds. You may need to repeat this step.
The headphone port on this thing is the standard, super common 1/8" or 3.5mm you'd find on cheapie headphones in the local drugstore.
1 GB of storage space should hold about 70 hours of audible audio in format 4 (highest quality). So, a 1 GB nano would hold 70, 2GB about 140, and 4 GB about 280 hours. That's a lot of listening :-). I based this calculation on actual audiobooks downloaded from audible and the size and time numbers that iTunes gives me for those files.
Pressure stylus, you can order from HP still. Good luck.
As long as the threading is 3/8, rather than 1/4, you're good.
Because demand has gone up. This mouse is no longer made. This mouse has a huge presence in many gaming communities.
sorry, don't know anything about an EF-S 18-55 mm.... but from my limited experience with my Nikon and Olympus lenses, the critical thing is the size of the lens...58mm vs 62mm vs 72mm....My Canon 500d works on every 58mm and smaller diameter lenses as long as i have an appropriate step-up ring... good luck...If unsure, try it... Amazon has been very good at returns if there was a problem
Yes, if that lens is threaded for 58mm filters. It should do very well for you.
Yes, you CAN use it on XP.
If the d3200 has a drive screw. the Sigma 24-70 is a great lens, but has no own motor drive. Check your camera manual or a camera review if the 3200 does....
It works with the 5D. It has to do with the fluoride treatment on the lens.
Yes it will work
If the d3200 has a drive screw. the Sigma 24-70 is a great lens, but has no own motor drive. Check your camera manual or a camera review if the 3200 does....
screwdriver could easily take it off. I've modded mine with sugru for less vibration transfer into my case.
This is a great fan: It's one of the few that have a rheostat to control fan speed. It is basically a CPU fan from a computer and I had the same initial concern about its ability to move air, however the area where I work has no air movement and this does a great job in keeping me cool. Several of my co-workers have purchased the same item and are equally impressed.
I do not have my camera at this location. I'll answer next week when I have possession of it.
The Nyrius SW100 has 3 inputs and 1 output. Connect the output to your speakers. The three inputs can connect to whatever units you want. The three inputs I have are a PC, a Bluray player, and Directv unit. After getting good sound from the three inputs, try to avoid touching the Nyrius. It is very sensitive and touching it can cause the sound to sputter. Of course, when switching to a different input you must move the switch on the top of the Nyrius to whatever you are watching.
-r alot dvd players play only those,+r they better then r but as i said you need look dvd they might take +r i just know my old dvd player or some the new ones wont play them two rw mean u rewrite those discs alot but those very expensive
2 years
Either. Just remove the plug from the side you want to hook up. My unit came with a 3-way PVC "T" connector with a spring loaded gasketed cap to use as the utility port. Have to assemble yourself but slips right on. No PVC cement necessary. I'm pretty happy with my unit. Stronger, cleaner, and quieter than the one I replaced.
No it doesn't
It working like clone. Same video 2 monitors. I use 1 monitor and computer in bedroom and Tv in living room. It's ok.
Hi Nailah, the fully automatic work with your radio Switch, you turn on the radio and the antenna go up, wen you turn off the car or the radio the antenna go down.
Yes, they fit inside the Lenmar Adapter perfectly.
I need a link for it
Unfortunately, I'm not a good contact for this player as mine only worked for about 1/2 of a CD. Hope you have better luck should you decide to buy!
Bottom dimensions: 2" x 1.75" Top dimensions: 2.35" x 2"
The QB-5LC will fit the S-4000 Tripod.
This plate fits only Velbon Tripod models. It has a 1/4 screw that fits most cameras as well as video cameras.
Mine came with the original package. Fresh till 2018.
Yes it is. I purchased one and it's working fine.
You will have to look on the Amazon site to see if it is in the list. You may even be able to see if it fits using the APC site. I know it works with RS 1500 as that is the model I have.

Thanks for your question. We currently do not ship internationally. We offer free standard shipping to the contiguous 48 states and have shipping options available for Alaska and Hawaii, but we do not offer international shipping at this time. I'm very sorry. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Klipsch dealer.
I mounted mine vertically so I could angle them the way I need in my backyard. If mounted horizontally there is no Sid to aside movement .
No it doesnt you hace to buy the disc Or the key XD
My husband says he wouldn't install in that type of ceiling.
It has 2
i'm trying to figure out the same thing.
No, it will not autofocus with a D3100 or D5100.
yes it does
This lens is designed for Canon EF-S mount APS-C size sensor camera and Rebel T5i is also same spec. So it should fit and work perfectly. Thank you
what do you mean? I used it on my motorcycle on an L bracket, I cant remember if the mast pivots. Very happy
Yes
Yes, the lens will work with the D80. It is not a particularly fast lens, so you would need lots of light for sporting shots. Daytime it would probably be fine, but even under stadium lights at night, you are likely to get some soft shots.
I recently bought an Amazon Basics camera backpack and I carry my Sony Alpha A77V, the Sigma 50-500 mm a HVL-F42 flash unit and a Sony 18-200 lens and cables and my Pentax 8x43 birding binoculars. I thoroughly recommend it.
Charles, I cannot speak to the ability for this lens to work with your Nikon as I am shoot with a Canon camera. It performed very well for me when I used it. I would still be shooting with it if the rear lens screws didn't come loose. Still trying to locate someone to repair the lens.
If it is a canon mount then yes.
I prefer the D50 which uses countless AF lenses. The D40-60 must have a motorized lens to AF. I got two D50s and a D60 for under $250 used, body only. Two were refurbished the other one was pristine. Many AF lenses work on the D50 and can be had for $50 or so.
Most likely it will work if it says it can work with any Nikon camera.
Yes
Nope. I have The speaker for the Bluetooth coming out by the cigarette lighter compartment and people hear me clearly. Still loving this stereo
The length of this lens fully extended is 3 and 3/8 inches long, not including the mount or a filter.
I would go with the D70s over the D50. I manage a camera shop and i can tell you from expierence. First of all the D70 will have better body construction, a faster frame rate of shots per second, better autofocus system, and most importantly comes kit with a extremely nice $400 18-70mm lens. The lens has a metal mount compared to the D50's 18-55's plastic mount, has a Silent Wave Motor which makes autofocusing extremely silent. Overall its a better quality camera for the money.
Nope. This is an older (obsolete) model. Check out nikonusa.com for the current lineup.
Yes, it is both the power cord and the AC adapter.
This part has been discontinued and unavailable for the past few years.
With my PS3 I get stereo sound in my headphones. Hope that helps!
This works great for my Xbox when I want to play games without disturbing anyone sleeping.
Check out Crucial.com and browse to Dell &gt; Dimension &gt; 4600 and you'll find exactly what type of memory you need. Check Amazon's price though, they may be better than crucial.
Yes it very adjustable, but I recommend that you keep it at factory setting because it would go off for the slightest movements, even a strong wind blow
It should work. The two verticals adjust to match studs. Once on the mount you do not have access to any plugs behind the TV because it is too tight.
It's a 12VDC motor, powered by a standard PC power supply - you plug it into your motherboard. As long as you've got a PC power supply/motherboard combo that's happy with 220V, then the answer is "yes".
I am not familiar with Time Warner. Based on my previous experiences I would say yes BUT I would encourage you to see if any others have had success utilizing this modem instead of the issued TWM. If it does, or does not work, please add your results to this thread. It would be appreciated. Best of luck my friend.
Greetings, no it does not come with Pre installed maps.You can buy from amazon, an sd card with the maps you need.I enjoy my Etrex vista, and it is a life line for my Washington state hiking trips.You will love it&gt;GR, Leavenworth Wa
no it does not have an external anttena but the waas and the 10 or so satellites do not drop signal at all its made for the forest and deep canyons. well i have used my eterx vista hcx for 7 months now and no dropped coverage at all or frezzing up its good get it
Yes we have them in FBA Centers. Place your order now.
I have one in hand - it does have 4.
No. This booster is designed to increase the wifi signal from a wifi router, not a phone signal.
Your router needs to have a detachable antenna. That is the place where the Hawking signal booster hooks in. If it has this it should work. This is a wifi signal booster .
They have the DVD and Memorex stamped on them
Yes you can. I like these discs better than any other. I have had little to no bad discs in these packs.
Yes it does...my grandson uses it for his!
TiVo compatible
You still an ISP.
I have the same problem. I just received Canon lens adapter for Canon S3IS. It doesn't fit. There isn't any way to attach it.
Joey, I have the H20 and I just received my VCL-DH1758. I also have the VCL-DH0758 (wide angle) you WILL need the adaptor VAD-HA. The adaptor works well and is actually pretty cool. It slides right over the built in lens and an 1/8 of a turn causes it to click and lock into place. The camera looks like a small DSLR, the photos are great and I've even received compliments on the look of the setup. If you haven't already done so, pick up the VAD-HA and have fun with your new setup!
Yes, it is. Works great. Of course you have to bring both if you want to be within 3 feet, but I like it a lot for mid-range shots.
Hair Straightners product too much heat.
It converts 220 volt alternating current to 110 volt alternating current (what we have in the US). If you have an ipad charger that is designed to plug in to the wall in the US then yes, it can be used. READ and UNDERSTAND the instructions.
Your machine takes PC3200 RAM and need to have them in patched pairs so It looks like this RAM is compatible.
I don't know, but, in my experience this charger works very good in USA and when I went to South America (where the electric power is 220V) and Taiwan (Asia, their electric power is 110V) it works perfectly too, hope my answer can be helpful to you!
No it is not, I bought one about a month ago and had to return it because it only had the side fan.
AMD ADA4800DAA6CD, Tray/ Bulk pack including AMD Original fan. AMD authorized dealer. Most orders shipped same day
AMD quad core is going for $154, how you can sell old Athlon dual for 250. i am looking for one, but for not more than $50, with $250 i can buy Quadcore and motherboard and replace both.
I never have, but I heard that you can put music on it or data too,but these are not rewritable disc.
I don't know but I only listen to music
Yes! Mine latches fine, the backside of the lid does come un hooked though if the front is not latched, all closed up you should be good as long as your not swinging and throwing it.
30 would fit but it would be tight
This case is for LP's. It is pretty heavy duty and will protect your records while traveling. We haven't tried it yet, but the last time I was on a plane, I measured the under seat storage area, and this case should fit easily under window or middle seats. Now my hubby can confidently buy records at festivals and such.
I learned the hard way that RAM is very system dependent. I really don't know if it will work with your computer or not, so I would suggest before buying, check with the vendor you'll be purchasing from. They'll be happy to tell you if will work or not because it saves both you and them the hassle of returning. My particular order was from a company called "NEMIX RAM" and there was absolutely no additional charge and the refund was very quick and courteous.
Yes it is.
It's a cable that carries both the HD video and audio from a video source to a digital TV. Look up "HDMI" at wikipedia, it will provide a wealth of info. Also, the i & p in 1080i and 1080p refer to "interlaced" and "progressive". I won't attempt to explain them here, just look up "HDTV" (over at wikipedia again) for a much better explanation than I could ever hope to provide. Hope this helps.
Hi Ronald, thank you for your interest in Cables To Go products. I am a Cables To Go employee and have checked with my techincal services team to confirm that our 2m Velocity HDMI cable will support 1080p at 120Hz refresh rate.

This is a universal door lock that has two wires, it works by reversing the polarity of the wires. If you can find the wires on your vehicle that will do this then it is a matter of setting it up on the lock linkage to lock and unlock. You can try this link to fix yours http://www.rav4world.com/forums/96-4-3-general/82750-power-door-lock-actuator-repair-fix-your-door-locks-free-3.html It maybe better to stick with OEM this is really setup for manual locks to convert to power.
I purchased the Valet remote as my expedition has the valet system, and I am very pleased with the replcement remotes. If your chevy has the Valet security system then this is a good investment as they come with full installation instructions and with my system I didn't need to buy anything else. hope this helps.
Find your valet button in your car, Turn the ignition on & within 5 seconds press the valet button once then press and hold it. (LED should flash 1 to let you know you are in channel 1) Now press the * button on the remote. That should do it. Just let go of the valet button wait until it exits program mode and turn the ignition off. Give it a try.
Just 4...
did you ever get an answer as where to buy one? i am also looking for one. thanks! vicky
Yes, it spins down after being unused for around 10 minutes (maybe less).
Your keyboard should have shipped with a USB receiver that looks like a small thumb drive. Plug that into one of the computer's USB ports. If your keyboard is charged/has battery life, your keyboard should communicate with the USB receiver without the need for you to install drivers. If you can't find the USB receiver, check the package contents that you threw out, it could be there.
I haven't heard side by side by my next door neighbor has the Bose and I can tell you in my opinion the Altec blows his away. I would have gotten a Bose if I thought his sounded that good- but I went looking elsewhere. Turns out best is not only better but a heck of a lot less money!
yes
We suggest calling Other World Computing at 1-800-275-4576.
I am now using my IKEYS USB keyboard with 10.10.
Yes, it is very compatible with the Apple Mac. Swift and precise plug and play.
Yes you can , it will sound good & In future if you decide to upgrade to a better & more powerful amp the LSi9's will reward you with even better sound.

I have not used the 18-250,but if it functions as well as the 28-300mm I think you will be well satisfied. For A APS-C bodies Sigma makes a great lens.
as far as I know, the mounts are nikon and canon..
Yes
it will work so long as you get the Nikon mount
looking on the back of my radio I found the answer to several questions. There is a DC plugin place which my electrician husband told me is interchangeable with the AC wall plug. You should be able to use the DC plug instead of the ac wall plug. I also saw the color coded plugins for what I presume is computer plugins. Have not researched it to find out what they are actually for. I'm happy with the wall plug and wire antenna placed by a window for reception, way out here in the country.
The Nikon Version of this lens will work fine with a D7100... keep in mind the crop factor actually makes this lens a little longer than 70 - 300mm This will have more reach than the Nikon 55-200mm but not necessarily any more image quality, but not necessarily any less either. I hope this answers your question. I have this lens in Canon and I like it very well. Here is an image on my website that was taken with this lens. notice below the image is the EXIF info from the image, take a glance. http://1shutterbug.com/who-are-you-what-are-you-doing/
no
There are 5 settings.
The Raynox DCR-250 will fit most cameras, as you have to squeeze the clips to attach it to the front of the lens.
You need a step up ring 49mm to 52mm if you want to use the universal size ring that comes with the Raynox DCR-250. That universal size ring can handle 52m to 67 mm. However, if you do not want to use the universal size ring, the DCR-250 lens has a 43mm screw diameter on the end that goes towards the camera lens. It may be possible to find a step-down ring, in your case, maybe 49mm to 43 mm.
Check the technical data sheet available from the Peerless website about this model. It has drawings with dimensions in various configurations. Folded flat it is 3.44 inches from the wall.
This voice recorder does not seem to work very well with those Windows versions beyond XP. It did not work with Vista (at least when I tried to use it, a long while ago), and it may not work with Windows 8.

No, I don't think that it does that.
No
Nano and Shuffle use solid-state memory. These are more forgiving than a hard-drive mechanical drive on 30Gig and higher devices. You will need to be more careful with hard-drive memory devices, and they are bigger and heavier....plus more memory than you will ever use for music.
The 30 GB iPod is physically slimmer--a nice feature. It has identical function as the 60 GB and it is cheaper. It comes down to deciding how much of your music you need with you at any time--30 GB is a lot (enough to listen 24 hours a day for about 3 weeks before repeating). If you prefer to have your entire collection with you always and can't live without that, then choose the 60. Otherwise the 30 GB makes more sense.
I wear them a lot at work, bout 8 hours a day 5 days a week. They are horrible. They hurt really bad after about an hour. I now have red parts on the ears because of the irritation they cause. I would suggest using them for a limited time or buy some in the ear earbuds.
No. There is only 1 button. On my system it is right click by default but you may be able to change it through your systems drivers.
Yes, this Stylus will work with any Penabled device. The LE1600 uses Wacom's Penabled technology.
Dear customer: If your lens is 77mm, you will need a 77mm/82mm ring adapter. ($3.00 - $5.00). Please shipping details for rates if available for your location.
It's OK, but right button is very sensitive.
NO! You need the Fuji Film Instax Wide. Made sure the film box is labeled "WIDE" before purchasing.
the expiration date is printed on the side of each packet. If its new film, it shouldn't be expiring for a year or more.
I believe that the camera needs to have the auto focus lens, for it to work with this camera. I have been told this by people at Ritz's camera supply.
When I bought my digital camera, I had several lenses that would attach to the camera but not all of them functioned properly. I think manual focus lenses may be confusing since a lot of the camera's capability won't work.
Read about the Nikon specs and you'll see that the D5200 does not have an internal AF motor. http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d5200.htm
My didn't work. I have a 1993 es300
I haven't had to force it. It fits just fine.
No, this cable was used for a video camera to a thunder bolt to a Mac.
So long as it has DV out, you'll be good. If not then no.
Dutch cycling websites say that the Rider can be mounted on bicycles, but that it is not marketed for bikes because of problems with routing. In the Netherlands and other north European countries, cyclists can ride against traffic on one-way streets, can take shortcuts through car-free zones, and often have separate routes between cities. There are many motorized-traffic-only bridges, tunnels, etc, with alternate routes for cyclists and pedestrians. TomTom's routing software is designed only for the motorized routes, so cyclists would (and do) find it very annoying. In the U.S., this might not be a problem.
Hi Gina: These headphones are comfortable and light - because the cup the ear tightly they tend to get warm after a few hours but they almost have a noise canceling effect without being that type of headphone. Best DG
They are not as small as on ear cans but if you have large ears these headphones might be uncomfortable. They are not massive by any means, folded for travel they are 5x5x3 inches, each ear cup is 3x4x1.5 inches.
yes
Nelson, The filters's diameter I am unsure of; they fit a rather inexpensive back light which I find useful. The filters screw onto the strobe I purchased by a company called Cowboy. I hope this information helps you. Happy clicking...
No. You have to purchase it separately.
I would guess if you are looking at a switch like this your problem is elsewhere. A simple switch like this should pass audio through with out effecting it and I believe this switch does. In my situation this switch has no influence over volume levels. I would be surprised if anyone said it did unless the switch was defective.
This wall mount does not swivel, it can only adjust vertically.
YES very strong,,,no problem with newer lighter Flat screens
If your Pana has a LANC control, the tripod will work. The shoe is universal
Absolutely, In fact I didn't know it would work on no Wi-Fi System. The whole point of this box is to view TV on your laptop!
No. This only reads regular audio discs recorded in minutes. A later model that came in silver did read mp3 files on discs.
Name brand is Panasonic, and this lens fit the Panasonic Lumix FZ-200. There is a useful page for you on Panasonic.jp. It is written in Japanese, but you can confirm the product number.
I'd swear that when I got the Ultra Pod II back in November that the "Digital" model was bigger and heavier. Now, even the Pedco website describes the 2 as identical, but the Digital is $3.00 more than the II. I just saw someone at Dpreview mention he had all "3" sizes. B&H describes the Digital as a "slightly modified" UltraPod II. I can't tell what the difference is and I have the UltraPod II.
Yea, I would think so, as long as the lens isn't too long. You would have to adjust the ball joint to off-set center, to act as a counter weight. I use it with my Toshiba Camileo X100 Full-HD Camcorder.
I think it will. It is a sweet little tri-pod.
i couldn't speak for that specific machine, however i can say that the plug is smaller than headphones and fits most business phones.
Not tight or heavy at all. I find that I end up stretching the headpiece, but the material is very flexible and easy to reshape when I do. I basically live with this on my head when I'm awake and usually forget I have it on.
I have no idea; it works with my Panasonic cordless. I doubt that Panasonic has changed their parameters for input impedance between models.
Fifty inches
the MiniVee will work very well for you in a room that size. I have used it in rooms smaller than that, and up to 16x20 and larger, and it dials in fine. Be careful with your placement (distance from the wall, and from corners), and it will work perfectly. I love this sub, it works perfect for small rooms.
I know this is a while later, but of course this keyboard will work with a Dell PC. I am actually using it on my Dell OptiPlex 745 and it works perfectly.
The BOSS TW12's come with mounts that allow surface mount with adjustable angle and flush or below surface mounting. If your 2008 Silverado has the round grilles in the windshield pillars, you can cut out the plastic and mount the tweeters there.
I do not know. I did not like the way it mounted, I could not get to stay stable and it did not work consist. I returned it. Merle
I do not know. That said - if the mini-usb connector fits into your Galaxy 8.0 then it probably will not hurt to try it. The "pin-out" on nearly all USB cables (USB 1 & USB 2) is standardized. In my case the only thing I have That fits the Kodak AV-8 is my old KODAK C913 digital camera. If you incur any damage trying this - I never heard of you - you are on your own - sorry.
Mine doesn't work either. It runs the CAB but doesn't seem to install anything but an icon that doesn't start anything up.
I believe that there is an adapter for the video iPod, but the unit that I just ordered did not come with an iPod video adapter, just a nano adapter. However, I have a 30gb iPod Photo that fits like a glove into this. As long as the video iPod is not lengthier than the iPod Photo, you should be fine even if it doesn't come with an adapter specifically for your model. All things considered though...call the manufacturer before you purchase.
It works with 1st and 2nd GENERATION Nanos, Gigs don't matter.
Hello, Eddie, you know I never even thought about that. It's so small and light, I simply toss it in on top of the rest of the gear in the camera bag! It rides across the tops of the dividers and seems plenty happy there. I'm pretty sure you would be able to find a bag for it ... with some searching but I don't know of any per se. Good luck.
you could, not sure why you would want to though
Yes you can
Put camera on Disk mode (choice pops up on Aiptek screen when connected by USB) Aiptek shows up as a disk on the desktop, files can be dragged and copied from media folder in Camera Memory. The .ASF files aren't easy to edit or convert, but they should play on many types of software. I use VLC (VideoLan Client) to play them. Photos are uploaded to iPhoto automatically and easily.
yes it will work
I can't see why not, as long as the wattage is within the limit.
I would NOT recommend that. You would be potentially overloading it's designed protection capacity and could damage your electronics.
1) There is a view finder just above the LCD. You can always use that, even in bright sun light. 2) You may not have turned on your display. On the back of the camera are four little buttons (and one big one). The little button at the lower left is marked display. Push that to turn it on.
What format are the pictures saved (.raw, .jpg, .png)? The .raw format takes up the most space, the long takes up significantly less. Check can your manual for how to set the format on your camera, or you can Change the format of the pictures in whatever program you use on your computer for editing your pictures. If you don't have the manual you can very likely download it from the Canon website.
the truth is no, but the quality is good to excellent.
Si yo tengo 2 uno en Puebla y otro en Villahermosa. Pero me recomendaron que hasta los telefonos los comprara all si estas hablando de los que vienen Panasonic de 4 hilos. Saludos.

It uses a standard 3.5mm stereo jack. The result is an MP3 file whose bitrate I don't recall. See page 23 of the user guide http://attila.kinali.ch/iAUDIOX5_English.pdf
The one I received in the mail was an actual Sharp brand bulb and was noticeably better than the other off-brands; however, I've seen comments here by others saying the bulb they received was not OEM, so I don't know what's up with that.
Yes! These discs can be written and re-written numerous times. If you are going to use it for an installation disc you should burn the program to it and set it aside. I wouldn't take the chance of burning an installation application to a disc that had been previously written on. So, put your burned Ubuntu disc in a separate jewel case and label it.
I use them on my Latitude Laptop as a backup disc.
Depends if the camera has a pop up flash like the nikon
Yes, you have to use the WIS09AGBN adapter. The WIS09AGBNX/XA will not work.
Nicole I am not certain. I believe the specs say it will but I am not familiar with Mac applications. It does work in my PC but I am not using it any longer. Will be happy to ship it to you for $20 if you would like to have it.
no won't sorry, dan
No, it allows you to play your Ipod on your car radio--BUT DO NOT get any I-trip product!
I can go usps and ask the cost of shipping of this item to Australia ,then i will tell you the price if you will be OK with it i can update the price of item base on new shipping cost then you can go to buy it after that i will be able to ship it to you. Thank you.
At 9 ft from the projector it filled a screen about 12' x 6' It filled the room with a projection of the video. It is fantastic!!
I haven't used it for that purpose, but I imagine it would pass red light and block the majority of green. It's a very deep, dense red.
Thin like paper but only plastic, easily cut like with scissors or a sharp knife, flexible like a sheet of paper and withstands a decent amount of heat.
Perhaps the following is not applicable to your situation. I use the referenced product to cover a LED light bar illuminating a close object photographed by a high speed line scan camera. It is used in conjunction with "Tiffen 49mm Linear Polarizer" on the camera lens to eliminate glare. The linear polarizer on the light bar only does not work.
The thickness is the same as two sheets of paper.
All the pages are already included.
Yes-Paintable Grills are included
yes, it has autofocus... Image Stabilizer (2 modes) and i have a standard T3 Rebel Camera. About the compatibility, here's and offer from Canon with your camera and this lens, so obvioulsy it is compatible http://shop.usa.canon.com/shop/en/catalog/cameras/eos-camera-bundles/eos-60d-body-with-ef-70-300mm-f-4-56-is-usm
Well, I'm assuming you're using the eos camera. So yeah, it's good for both and an all around excellent lense that I've been extremely pleased with.
Not sure how big a wuggle pet is but the device is pretty small. Slightly bigger than a milk cap around (1 3/4") and it would be like stacking 2-3 milk caps in height.
It uses a standard RJ11 telephone line, and other than the really cool motion sensor, it pulls regular dial tone when it goes. "off hook" and looks and acts exactly like a regular phone. If the questionis - will it work over an IP network , the answer is yes , provided you've gotten it back to an analog RJ11 phone line. I used mine with Magic Jack and that other provider. It does not have a CAT 5 or RJ45 jack. Phone is killer though , does exactly what it claims.
Yes
Bluetooth is a standard and should work with either Mac or PC.
if you use this model you will need to instal the sensor + the magnet, i would recomend you to use the new garmin sensor http://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-12102-00-Bike-Cadence-Sensor/dp/B00JLMRXCQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1404416677&sr=8-4&keywords=cadence+sensor+garmin cause it doesnt need the magnet (its a gyroscope)
Yes. I have this combo and works great together
Yes it is. https://buy.garmin.com/en-US/US/shop-by-accessories/fitness-sensors/speed-cadence-bike-sensor/prod1266.html
Yes. The "pros" will tell you that any additional layer of glass can add distortion and reflection, but I leave a filter on all the time to protect that expensive lens from dirt, dings, fingerprints, etc. Many of today's filters are so well made with multi-coating and high tolerances that I doubt even the experts can tell a difference in 99% of photos. Years ago, so called UV filters added a hint of pink to fight UV. That is no longer the case.
I use DateBk6 for my calendar/toDo, mobileTimer, and checkbook. Slap is another interesting piece of software. I also use eBible.
Go to Renewelectronics.com -- you should have paid the extra and purchased from them because they're the only people who can help you with sync'ing your Zire with Windows 7. Same thing happened to me and they've been super.
Issues similar to this arose with Logitech's Streampoint music system. They did one poor SW release, not even Beta quality and that plus poorly designed hardware cost me a couple hundred bucks for a crappy product. Their now typical lack of support post initial release for their new products has made me ban them forever as a vendor.
Yes, it works fine with Vista
It works great with Vista
No, This is a PDA. Several generations behind today's current technology.
Yes. VGA is actually the ONLY port on it.
sorry, I have no idea
I was wondering the same thing. Then I found the page in the Users Guide which helped (p.49). I put the cradle on the edge of a table, with the hollow side pointing up, then put the ball into the cradle and pushed down hard. Went right in with no problem.
Never had one, but just found a motorcycle mount on Ebay for a buy-it-now price of about $25 plus s/h. Search for "Garmin nuvi 660 motorcycle." Perhaps seller will vouch for accuracy.
yes, one input and one out put to a TV
Dear friend. Yes you need cable. It is a very complicate installation because, that particular TV Turner was discontinue.
Yes, you can send the same audio input to 4 separate sound systems.
No. You have to burn your Itunes songs to a CD, rip them into the Creative Platform and then load them on to the player.
I would suggest this one. The Vision M is a lot bigger. I didnt think it was by the measurements until I saw one at Best Buy and the thing is huge. Bigger than a 30gig iPod
yes
That depends on the alarm system you own and weather you connect an external speaker or not. It has nothing to do with the sensors.
Yes
this glass break sensor will work for simon xt, xti and concord 4 and i also think for other ge panel lines
No, it will not show song lyrics. It will show the artist and song. If you attached a pic then it will show the CD cover, song and artist. Hope this helped.
yes...this is what you use to connect your garmin to your computer. and amazon is the cheapest place to buy the thing. at another place it was twice as much cause you had to buy something else with it you didn't need.
My girl's I-pod classic"s lithium battery will no longer hold a charge after 4 years. It will play music from the charging station but will not play movies.
Yes
It took a few months, but I got my rebate money from Amazon on my iMac.
Thete is no manufacturere's name on the battery. It still is working fine.
This is excellent lens. I have Nikon mount version, not Canon, so I have no other info.
It is compatible with Netlibrary. Make sure you can play the audio file on your computer before you transfer the audio though. Netlibrary waits to send you the license file until after you try to play it.
No. I have not figured it it yet. Do you have a solution?
They might im not sure I put them in my boat and never looked to see
You can use Lowes Item #: 136010 | Model #: 770310 You crimp it to the speaker wire and then push it onto the speaker terminal
Back when I bought mine brand new it did come with the 3.5mm phono jack cord to plug into an MP3 Player.
plug from headphone jack on shuffle to input Male to male plug Same as you would use in a car aux input
I don't know what 7.1 is - I stopped at stereo. But you're right, you can simply pull the cable apart to make 2 single cables - I did in fact pull mine slightly more apart at the ends to facilitate plugging them in - they pull apart very easily.
The unit doesn't have a pass-thru so you can't charge while using this. It doesn't seem to reduce battery life so for me it's a minor inconvenience.
Should be fine. Epson 2030 appears to have three mounting bracket holes. The ATDEC comes with a large variety of nuts, bolts, and adjustable arms to fit a wide variety of projectors.
My ceiling is 10 feet and I was very concerned. The projector (Epson 8350) automatically adjusts to the angle and it looks fine. Also nice being able to walk in front of the screen w/o heads showing up in the picture.
Fully assembled it is approximately 11'-12' in length and 7'-8' at the widest part.
Whether or not the keyboard works depends on how it communicates with the computer. The purpose of this adapter is only to be able to connect the keyboard to the newer computers that only use USB ports to connect with accessories.
No. You need a Faraday cage for that.
Yes. I have 5e run through this and it's great.
I bought mine 2 years ago, so things might have changed, but mine DID include the USB cable
Main thing is that the stuff it is plugged into has to provide power... but I have not had that be a problem.
Reflective light readings are a push the button, the meter take the reading and display it until you push the button again. It's displayed until you either take another reading or shut the unit off. It does not read constantly, as analog light meters used to.
Excellent. Its worth a brat for 1&gt;--1,000 lbsers!!!
It's the flat one.
Chief has a website where you can enter the make and model of your projector to see if this bracket is compatible. I recommend you verify your projector's compatibility there.
Yup! http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Eyepieces/4793/DK-17M-Magnifying-Eyepiece.html#tab-ProductDetail-ProductTabs-CompatibleWith
There is no battery life since there is no battery. A little warning about this unit. The last time I went to use my life time update I got a message that my 7200 did NOT have enough memory to completely update. I sent an E-Mail to Garmin about that and they never responded.
Yes - one must be VGA and the other digital. You can also run one monitor of either input type.
This is not USB - it has the standard &#8539; inch (3.5mm) mini-plug - same size as most headphone jacks - it is color-coded pink to match the microphone input jack on most motherboards.
Yes
I bought one of these, and it does not fit the D3100 properly. The D3100 uses a DK-20 rubber eyecup.
It appears to be and was in a Nikon bag but suppose it could be counterfeit. It fits well and works good and I am happy with it.
I can't answer your question directly as I am not familiar with your tripod. However, you may find what I did helpful: I attached the tripod adapter to a quick-release mounting plate I use with my camera. This allows me to interchange my binoculars and camera on the same tripo rather quickly. Using a quick-release plate, if you have one, may help you. Good luck.
not sure,you might need adapter for camera.but it is a heavy duty tripod works great for my very heavy[nose heavy] spotting scope.hope this helps
M could be M60..M100...M180mm. Higher # can zoom in closer to object...
Assuming that the lens you are using fits one of the filter sizes supported by the kit, I am sure it will work with those cameras. I use it with a d5300.
I have never had an eyepiece come off inadvertently, but I can say the DK-21M seemed very tightly adherring when I installed it. I have since given the camera to my son and have not heard of any problems from him eitherr.
No, we use it for our Mitel 3300 VOIP phone system and it rings at our desks - thanks -
i think the 299 is refurb?
Very unlikely unless mentioned categorically. BTW, to me accessories and warranty are two totally different things. While one is a tangible thing and can last forever while the other is an intangible time-bound agreement to assure against malfunction due to manufacturing defect etc.
I'm sorry you have had problems with your other keyboards. My first "Keys U See" lasted three years. I replaced it with a second one which is still going strong after two years. I don't use it every day, but when I take it to my adult education classes, sometimes three in a week, I am often typing for 1 1/2 hours straight. I recommend downloading frequently to avoid losing documents in case there is any problem. I'm glad I have this keyboard and recommend it to anyone. If you have any more questions, please let me know.
We bought one for our son several years ago and it still works fine. He spends a lot of time on the computer.
For Night Sky viewing you want a 50 mm lens or better.. like a 8X50 or so.. need bright lens to view stars or planets.. get the best you can afford. Tasco makes a good night vision binocular at a good price
Truthfully, I don't remember because I sent it back so quickly and it was quite a few months ago. It was extremely poorly constructed and skipped at the slightest movement.
Mine tilts forward too, slightly. No big deal for me.
The one i received was a genuine lowepro and its absolutely tough.
Yes
I'm having the same problem with mine. I use my XBOX360 as a media center extender, and some of the functions I want to access are by pressing the (X) button. Well, even though (X) is mapped to (X) in Logitech's software setup, Media Center is interpreting that button as something like a PageDown. Very annoying, because now I need to have my controller and my remote to do everything I want.
I do not think this will work. The CS50 is a wireless system and it does not look like it will accept a wired headset. I suggest looking for a replacement for that headset or replacing the whole system. Good luck.
No
Yes.....it's for telephones (like a desk telephone) with that type of connection.....
I don't know and my earlier point was that, apparently, Amazon doesn't know even though Sigma data clearly spelled out compatibility. So it is up to you to research the Sigma web site to determine the compatibility your self.
This is a new one. And the following is old model. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NIHBSCG/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me= Old model is called TC-1401, this new model is called with APO, EX DG. The difference is clear. Please refer to the following pages. https://www.sigma-photo.co.jp/english/flash_and_accessory/accessory/#/tele_converter The function of Optical Stabilizer depends on the performance of each lens. Please refer to the following compatible tables. https://www.sigma-photo.co.jp/english/flash_and_accessory/accessory/tele_converter_match.html Also, please refer to the following compatible tables of older TC-1401. https://www.sigma-photo.co.jp/english/flash_and_accessory/accessory/tele_converter_tc_match.html About the red circle mark, both are written in the column of "Exposure" under the table. This description is important.
I'm using a mid sized Samsonite video camera bag with an adjustable divider. Plenty of room for the camera, filters, cables and extra batteries. A bit of overkill but the larger bag gives easier access to the camera than a smaller tight fit case.
Yes.
Using Sigma's compatibility chart for Nikon mounts, your lens is NOT included. The prime 500 mm lens is included, but not your 170-500mm zoom lens. Since this is a DEDICATED converter you will probably have poor results with your lens.
Felix best I can tell the 110 Advanced is exactly the same unit and box contents, just cost $10 more. I think it may have been an earlier packaging promotion or something like that. My first order was an "Advanced" and it died after 30 minutes. Amazon promptly refunded my money and I then ordered the ADVC-110 and it looks exactly the same, only difference is box does not say "Advanced" on the outside.
I am pretty sure that it will. I have read, however that it's not a good idea to go direct from turntable to card, but instead connect the turntable to a receiver or integrated amp in the usual manner and use the AUX OUT connection to plug into the card. Here is an excellent tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqdJewnS7kE
If they are going to be used with Bluetooth, they would have to be connected to a power source/receiver/system with Bluetooth capability. These are speakers only and are not a self contained system that you could make a Bluetooth connection to directly. The same applies to non Bluetooth applications - they need to be connected to something to power them/push the sound through them. Mine are connected to my sound system that is part of my main audio/video setup
Fair. They don't sound bad, but you are gonna pay ALOT more to get a better sound. All matters what your using them for.
Yeah, you have to install in the ceiling. I guess you could build a box to house them but at that point you should just get regular mounting speakers.
They just need speaker wire hooked to them. No power required.
Yes, it will work. Since adding this to my system I haven't had any problems with starting the vehicle. Prior I could only run system for a short period or I would get stuttering on start. I recommend any system that draws a lot of power to add this to their system.
Not exactly. The Bit Writer is just an interface to the system so that you don't have to click a button 20 times to program a feature. You can use it to access that menu quicker, but you still have to push the buttons on the transmitters to pair them to the alarm.
Yes! I have purchased one and verified that it attaches to my HVL-F43AM. The label in the package says "Designed for Canon 430EX & 430EXII, Sony HVL-F43AM."
yes
I'm not familiar with that brand or model (Neewer TT560). Canon makes a 430 EX II and a 580 EX II speedlite. The Stofen Omni-Bounce fits my 430 EX II. I don't know if the deminsions are similar on Canon's 560 EX II model. Maybe Stofen's web site can give you more info.
yes it is the large bud that the boom mic attaches too.
I am using the D7100. With the tokina 100 pro auto focus works well. I recall when researching the lens that the auto focus works with D7000 also. It has proven to be an impressive lens.
Unfortunately, the earpads on that model cannot be removed. I ended up replacing it with a AD900X, which does have replaceable earpads.
Hello Mark, I like to use these working out or doing outdoor work. They have decent bass. I like think chunky bass, and these provided good quality. My only gripe is that headphones ( after a while ) stop working. I have tried Beats by Dre ear buds and they provide better base. The price is key factor in that equation. If you need them for travel, or around the house, either Bose or Beats (Over the Ear) are the best ones on the market. But for outdoor needs, these are the right price.
Cokin Filter Holder I Think The Largest Holder Is 3x3 A 4-Inch Square Filter Can Still Be Seen In The Photo A 58 To 77mm Step up Can Still Be Seen In Front--- Just The Ring I Think This Lens Was Not Design For Added Filters It Is A Great Lens On Its Own!! John
Distortion is more prominent in the camera-object distance. minimum distortion beyond 12 feet
Dude, don't ever...I mean ever post a review on a product you haven't touched...people will flame your reviews...shame on you.
No, it runs a totally different operating system: Windows Mobile 5.0, a Windows CE-based system released in 2000, 14 years ago. Windows Phone operating system was first released in late 2010 and shares a lot of functionalities with Windows 8, including the Metro user intrface.
If (1) the space in the dashboad for a radio is double-DIN, and (2) the radio you want to install is single DIN, then you should be good to go.
It should work with most double din radio's.
No it definitely will not. Not a class 2 radio and sirgm1 only fits select 2003 and newer. Just to make sure I checked the wiring diagram and the connectors are also different.
I don't see why not, but I have not used this for many years.
2 and 7/8 inches.
It does come with a cloth pouch to carry the headphones but it's not made of leather.
I have 10.6 installed and the version of the software I have is really buggy. It hangs when you try to scan a disc to determine its contents. I have no idea if they made any fixes or have released anything newer.
The one I received says 16AWG. The full text on the cable is UL CSA SJT 3/C 16AWG(1.31MM2) VW-1 75C 300V. The attached tag says UL LISTED CORD SET BY-23,738 13A 125V 1625W E210037 A415489I1.
Yes
It's a standard grounded socket. It really is a 1 foot extension cable. They are great to have around if you have a lot of devices that use wall transformers. I've ordered them a couple of times.
I dont thing you can do that... you could try though... just get some 3.5mm to 3.5mm cable sold at radio shack and youre set
I've used it for 7-8 hours and it still was running. (just video)
It's a fake lamp,copy, we are returning the one we ordered. IT is NOT A Factory sony Lamp Installed in a Brand New Housing And the Manufacturer: is NOT Philips... It has NO nAme that they try to pass it as it's made by Philips lamp...it's the same lamp as the $12.99 lamp.just marked up by adding some white lie to get more sales....
Yes.
Yes. It comes with a variety of adapters.
Honestly it all depends on what type of headphones/speakers you'll be using as to whether you'll get more out of better sound quality. My personal cutoff is 192kbps for the lowest I'll listen to, but I try to rip everything lossless and download everything I can at lossless quality because you really notice a difference at 900+kbps. But of course I'm using 500 dollar Sennheiser headphones to listen to the music, so if you're using 10 dollar Sony's you might not need anything near that high.
I've loaded the unbox and it works fine. I have purchased several movies and TV shows and they are loaded on my ZEN. It plays perfectly. I did have to raise a "stink" with amazon to get my $20 credit. They said that they were having problems with the promotion and that it would be fixed soon. It never got fixed so I "made" them credit my visa $20. The phone number is 1-888-802-3080.
depends on which bull dog system.if it covers yours it will work on any car
Hi, I purchased the Creative Zen Vision: M and received it yesterday. I did NOT receive an AC wall charger. Even though it is a pain, charging through the USB port takes 2-3 hours (and it charges when you are docked, I leave it plugged in between transfers). Hope that helps.
Creative has a a program called zencast. You paste all your feeds into it and it will put all your podcast in one folder. If your interested in vidcasts(video podcasts) it gets more complicated. The majority of these are in Ipod format(m4v) and need to be converted. Zencast does this but really slowly. More vidcasts are starting to make more formats available, and I think in a short time this should not be a problem.
Mine has a yellow sticker on the back specifying 104V to 127V @ 60Hz, no switch. Mine is also several years old though; they may have changed since then.
Looks like they fixed. But be careful because some sellers (like Office Depot) look like they use same product name w/ picture of headphone jack version.
Yes, all Garmins have "current time" as a display option. I wouldn't double the 205 as a watch though because of its size. The 110/210/410 or 405 series would be better.
Hi, If you have an Ipod Nano you can try the very cheap, in comparison with GPS, Nike+ Sportkit. Once you calibrate it, it is very accurate. All my runs (same route) about 8km only vary on +/- 100m. Hope that helps a little bit.
Took mine to to the Caribbean and it worked great so believe it will work fine in Mexico, just make sure you have the map card for the area you will be traveling.
It calculates calories based primarily on weight and distance (with an age adjustment, I believe). It uses relatively simple formulas just like a treadmill. That's fine for running and walking. It's not going to do much for you in most other workouts.
This motherboard is for DDR2 and up to 533 MHz with LGA775 Socket for old processors so you should look at Intel for compatibility list (RAM and Processor specs).

It is designed for the second generation Nano. All swithes and ports are accessible.
Yes, the strap has velcro
No
Yes it does 110-240
Yep
I own a HDR-HC1; yes, it works well with my old Maxwell SD tapes. HC3 is a dumbed down version of HC1; but hc1 is hard to get - they are all sold out.
This can be sent with camera for sure...It would be downloaded form Sony website....

Hi, your Sony Alpha 3500 is an A-mouth body type camera in which it is compatible with any Sony A-mouth lens such as SAL75300. It will work perfectly. -Ely
The Sony 50mm 1.4 is an A mount (the A7 is an E mount) so will fit on it only with an adapter (LA-EA3 or LA-EA4). So just get an adapter and you're golden! I'd recommend the LA-EA4 as it has a built-in AF motor, aperture-drive mechanism and Translucent Mirror Technology to enable continuous phase-detection AF. Enjoy!
If it says camera body only, then it does not come with a lens.I bought a used A100 and it came as body only, camera card, battery and charger. No lens. Still a good deal!
in the program that brings the camera you can. But, not on the camera.
Be sure to fully discharge anf recharcge the battery a couple of times before you retun the camera. I have this camera, and am able to take about 100 pictures, some with and some without the flash, on pne charge.
It comes with an AC adapter that you plug into the camera to charge the battery. I can't comment of the longevity of the battery, but lithium batteries usually last a while.
Buy a Playstation 3!!!
Hi Lawanna, yes the camcorder is compatible with the Windows 8. Thanks_Mitch
NTSC
Two Speakers Total (1) Tweeter @ Top & (1) Sub-Woofer @ Bottom with (2) Air Vents @ Top.
You may check 3rd party vendor for a water resistance housing. Apparently for Sony, we don't have any water resistance housing for this camera. -Ely
No, Mine were made in china and look 100% real but they are fakes as the real ones are not make in china. they sound decent for the price even if they are fake. the metal band is off center and the band and plastic and already separating from each other. Deals on Wheels is not a Sennheiser Authorized Dealer. you should read my review about these. I decided not to go cheap after a bought these and purchased the Monster Turbine High Performance In-Ear Speakers http://www.amazon.com/Monster-Turbine-High-Performance-In-Ear-Speakers/dp/B001LNO722 Direct from Amazon.com and not from a reseller.
Yes. And on any other camera with a standard ISO hotshoe.
No, but zebras are easier to detect with their stripes! Come on, this is a backup camera. What you are asking for a night-vision / heat sensing device that Merc-Benz and other expensive cars may have.
I'm not sure but most of these movies are either 1080p or 480p, so since it doesn't have 720p it progresses down to 480p.
No I do not
The XA1 is bulky heavy elegant look back lit remote and it has a motorize face that hide away the disc tray, can stream multi-channel Dolby TrueHD with latest firmware update. pros. better looking, backlit remote, anti-vibration feet and good up-conversion dvd player. con. no 1080p, slow loading, no dts-HD (dts core only). The XA2 is slimmer, lighter, HQV Reon chip and can stream multi channel Dolby TrueHD & DTS-HD out of the box. pros. lighter, faster loading, excellent for up-conversion dvd player. con. none
Yes you can and you can set up recording just like a DVR. The recoded feature only works when it is in a docking station. I love the Inno, it also can record a song even in mid song, it will record the whole song. Also it has tune select. You can mark any song or artist, when that song or artist comes on any station you will be notified.
Not sure what 4 zone is... but my Pyle stopped working after 3 weeks! Had to return it!
No
It comes put together mine did
According to the box, the cable/cord length is 2.5 meters.
No it does not have port for adapter either. Batteries only
No, it will not fit. Too wide for the 210
I just received a pair, and wrote about it here before I saw this. Your story sounds just like mine. Sound is terrible. I wrote Amazon about it. I guess I'll see what they (Amazon) are made of. As what to do. Send them an email. Look for "Contact Us" on one of the help pages.
Yes, the two wires from the buds (as opposed to the mated wires) transmit any sound resulting from movement directly to the buds and your ears. I like the sounds of these but I find them not well suited for listening while moving e.g., exercising, walking. Not sure if there is a way to improve the isolation.
Just wash them in warm water. You can use a little soft-soap if you like, but don't use any harsh solvents or cleaners.
I've read numerous times on many reviews that this TV has no motion blur and is completely useful for fast movies and video games.
This an indoor antenna(no magnetic base for the car). Look for the XM antenna with the magnetic base. This antenna will work but it will not stick to the roof of the car. I've used this antenna on the dash of my car, not on the car roof. DTF
category 5 (e=enhanced).
Apple makes an adapter but you won't be able to close the door with your iPod in the dock.
Ours used to pick up analog TV transmissions but not the newer digital signals.
The ones that came with mine were from Creative and yes they are good
preferred 1-gb, and not generic brand. however, 2 gb cards are the highest.
I also want to know this before I buy....anybody?
Yes it does include an AC power pack.
They are open-backed meaning some sound will go out the backside.
No - they are designed in Austria but manufactured in China
Yes. Mine did. At a minimum the charger will be there.
My FZ-7 was $198 at Circuit City. The model has been replaced by the FZ-8 so the FZ-7 should be found with steep discounts now.
Yes you can. Wife and I each have our own headphones sharing the same charger. Alternate days charging and all is good.
The base of this unit has 2 wires that connect to the back of the TV. I have cable TV but I'm sure you will be able to use this.
Absolutely - Yes
Plays CD, CDR and at least Sony brand CDRW without problems. You do need a TV connected to change the output level of the player, but the TV connection is not needed after this.
It worked fine in our 2200
Yes
These headphones will work on all keyboards because the plug has an adapter to make it either 1/8 or 1/4 connection. These headphones sound great too.
I would like to know the same thing... please answer!
It is 14 " end to end on its travel bag.
Yes...it can be used with sony cx 220
I had the same problem and I found a fix on a different site, so I thought I'd put it up here, too. It seems the "access" message happens because the lens doesn't open all the way; not sure why that is. However, when my camera opens and says "access," all I have to do is get it all the way out. So: very VERY GENTLY pull on the end of the lens (away from the camera body). You can't even feel it move, really, but then it starts working again! Hope this helps.
Indeed !! It works perfectly. I'm quite satisfied. Thanks
I would like to know the same.
nope!! you can go to audible's website to confirm but I have tried repeatedly - not able to convert... unless you copy it to a cd and then copy to the player
Does not come with a belt clip or case. I found a very nice case thru Amazon that includes a belt clip and armband. I've been using it to workout with my gigabeat and have been extremely satisfied. Search for "gigabeat neoprene case" on amazon and it should come up.
Melody, This model does not have an ATSC tuner included. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Most likely because the Sony player is an older model that does not play DVD-R or DVD-RW disks. I have a Sony DVP-S7000 (first Sony DVD player) and it does not play DVD-R or DVD-RW, but my Sony Playstation 2 does. Check your manual if it says anything about it being able to play the writable formats. This information will also usually be indicated on the face plate of the unit, if it can play the additional formats in addition to the standard DVD format.
Yes, it's 4 single lines in, 6 out for each line. It's meant for paired lines, like a phone, but I don't see why it wouldn't work with multiple pairs. I use it just for a regular single phone connection, though.
not big at all, going from memory, not measuring, about 18in square...
According to Plantronics web site the correct Ear Cushions are, Foam Ear Cushion Kit for SupraPlus headsets P/N: 40709-02.
Jerry: According to the Plantronics web site these will work just fine.
The 37x knives are made in China. The #301 and 303 knives are USA made!
I will say the rang is around 30 miles. Depending on the land around you it is possible to go out farther. It is important to point it correctly. That is explained it the instructions. We are very pleased with ours.
true you don't any subwoofer
I take 20-50 photos a day outside in the elements. i drop the camera at least 2-3 times a month on the ground (usually concrete) and it still works like a charm. TBonicus 619
I don't think there is a place to hook up the antenna on that unit.
That's normal. It's the same sensor, but the sensor is in different modes for preview and capture. It'll get the best photo it can, regardless of what the preview shows.
"Yes," you can see the corners of the photograph through the translucent photo-corner mounts. And "yes," although translucent, the photo-corner mounts are visible through a glass frame, but you'd have to look closely.
I only see one Samsung app in the Google play store, I don't know if they have different apps for different models. I will say that the remotes for all 3 of my Samsung TVs are interchangeable, they all work for all 3 tvs, so any app that works for one Samsung should work for any Samsung.
I got this tv back in 06, you would be hard pressed to find one much newer. If you got a warranty from a used seller I would guess that it wouldn't be much. 30 days? You'd be better off at this point seeking out an LCD model. You would spend less and get more. I love plasma, but it is a bit old.
Easy, just get a head phone jack to RCA cable. Amazon carries them, as do most local retailers. they are usually &lt;$8.00 or so, and you just plug it into your headphone out jack and the other end has two plugs that go into the aux inputs on your home stereo. Turn the audio out up to 22-25, and adjust your stereo volume and you're there.
There's no need to go to so much trouble. You can get a regular headphone jack to dual RCA cable at any radio shack or walgreens for a few bucks, plug it into the headphone output on the player, and plug the RCA connectors into the inputs on the dj's equipment. chances are, the DJ already has a handful of those cables anyway, just ask him.
HDMI gives you the ability to display high definition video and digital surround audio in a single cable. Conventional coax cables are actually analog, therefore signal degredation is inherent and especially bad as cable length increases. Traditional analog audio cables, where you have only a left and right signal source, are not capable of carrying a surround signal, so unless you have a receiver that can reproduce your rear and center channels, such as Dolby 5.1, you will not get the true surround experience. I hope that helps.
Do you have HD cables for those systems? Because if you don't then it's going to look just about the same. No TV will magically turn a garbage picture with old hookups into High-Definition. I did a quick search and I'm not even sure if HD cables are available for SNES. Good luck though.
I can't read German so I can't check: just to make sure, you checked http://www.canon.de/ ?
The PowerShot S3is comes with a fixed lens. It does not have in interchangable lens, however, there is an option, with use of an adapter, to add a telephoto lens 1.5X, a wide angle lens and close-up lens. In addition, you can used various filters as well but not in conjunction with the adaptive lens.
It IS metal, with a good solid yet lightweight feel to it.
For further inquiries you may send us a letter at bis.product.support@am.sony.com, give us your contact details and your concern. Thank you.-Ely
DV tape for Video, SD Card for Photos
The SD630 can use only SD (not SDHC, or SDXC) memory, which maxes out at 2GB since it is formatted as a FAT disk.
Yes. There is a channel selector on the head set and you just both need to select the same channell, but you will only have one charge stand.
Headphone will not charge unless it is turned off
Yes, this projector mount has a lot of ways to be configured. You can add multiple arms to the base, in varying lengths. My projector had 4 mounts as well and it met up just fine with this mount.
Yes you use it and so for one of the best in market Ian very satisfied.
Seems like it does - as one Amazon marketplace seller has bundled this very same SD6 card for Kindle here (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0018QUSRA/?tag=stylefeeder-20&creative=380337&creativeASIN=B0018QUSRA&linkCode=asn) I hope he has tested it. As regards capacity - officially supported capapcity is 2GB but users claim that 4GB also works.
NO. Sorry but the kingston SD is to big for the slot on your phone. You need a microSD card for that phone. Type in Sandisk 2GB microSD card on google shopping the first option is what your looking for.It is smaller.A microSd(Which is the one you need) should have a micrSD logo on it.
Power is supplied at all times but the screen will turn on when an A/V signal is supplied or it can be turned on and off manually, also when the A/V signal is cut off the screen shuts off after 10 sec,s as well
Dear Lee Rand Hi.., Snowball Microphone has not adjustable or Mute button, so you should adjust it by windows software during recording process.
I love this lens for portraits. The focus may be a little slower than a dedicated 105mm being that its macro but there's a switch you can hit to keep the lens from searching for focus in the macro regions. That allows it to focus a little faster for portraits and other non macro work.
This TV is 720p.
I don't think they would make such "mistake" by accident. millions of ppl are looking forward to buy this shuffle. I think amazon got the word from apple, but apple did not deliver their promise to amazon for marketing purposes.
It's a computer not a monitor
You won't be able to play movies purchased through iTunes on your Zune. The DRM schemes aren't compatible.
Well you are dealing with less then one percent out of millions of ipod buyers. I think that your ipod will be just fine. But if you were really daring you could open it on your computer and check it for a virus. But i highly doubt that it would.
According to the Apple website, it does. Often times, digital audio outputs share a port with the typical 1/8-inch "headphone" adapters. You can tell (once the box is open) by looking for a red light inside the speaker or headphone port on the back.
I don't think they would make such "mistake" by accident. millions of ppl are looking forward to buy this shuffle. I think amazon got the word from apple, but apple did not deliver their promise to amazon for marketing purposes.
Marian, this statement is completely wrong. I Am a long time member of Audible and can download books onto my iPod. In fact Audible offer a large discount off an Apple player as a promotion to get you to join. Audible works seamlessly with iTunes.
Yes. Suggest you visit the maker's website for detail: http://opteka.com/slidecopier.aspx
I would have have to say yes. I am using it for all my digital photos. Seems to work fine.
Is this still the case? The Device Center at Audible suggests that the Sansa e200v2 series is compatible. I'm looking at buying a player that will run Audible files and prefer this one if it is compatible. Thanks!
when a song is playing, scroll the wheel. You get a volume bar which has a full range of settings like on an ipod or car stereo
The built-in battery should last a couple years, like most lithium-ion batteries. A replacement battery from Sandisk costs $20 MSRP, and you can easily replace the battery yourself, all you have to do is unscrew the 4 screws on the back and switch the batteries.
what do you exactly mean? you can put on it any divx, avi, mpeg, quictime movie, mpeg 4 or any kind of movie on the special software it brings and then it transformers it to the kind it can be seen on the device, look at the pictures i'll upload on amazon on 13/02/07
I called Crosley and was told light was not replaceable. I pressed the issue and was told the radio would have to be completely dismantled. So that ended that. Very disappointing, as that old fashioned feature was a big plus in my decision to purchase to begin with. As far as the rest of the radio's performance.....it's fine. The radio is played daily for many hours. The light went out after a year. I use a tiny flashlight to see in order to tune in different stations because you just can't read the dial without it's light.
I think the Tasco has more options for parts and service locations available.
Yes, and the base is adjustable so it clamps to it. You may want to go with something a bit smaller and specifically designed for notebooks though... would probably be easier.
It only took one minute to locate and download the lastest drivers. Yes it works with Windows 7.
According to Canon, the Powershot S110 uses an NB-5L battery. Be careful, though, of counterfeit batteries even sold here on Amazon. http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/digital_cameras/powershot_s110#SuppliesAndAccessories
It's made by Canon, yes.
Ir has a "fold away" male plug.
no. we have a same camera. we tried and they are too heavy
Sorry, I'm unable to answer your question because I do not use a boom pole. (See ALE answer; ALE seems to have experience with this.)
yes, it comes with a lenshood and a cap
I have the Rebel XTI and I've taken some great close up pictures with the Canon 100mm f2.8 macro. I also have the 70-200mm f/4, 17-55mm f2.8, 85mm f1.8 and the 17-40 f/4, but my favorite is the 100mm macro with the 70-200mm f/4 a very close second.
Lovely Japan:)
Yes. It does.
This really isn't a reply to your post but a question. I have been looking into getting a Garmin Nuvi 350. Does anyone know what the differences are with that one and the C550? I know there is a big difference in price and wondered if the Nuvi would be a good choice for basic GPS. I really want the voice with street names.
maybe, but this is not a good Hard Drive
It runs in the Safari web browser, not a separate app so it shouldn't be a problem.
I don't think so. From HP website. Only "HP Aultraslim Docking Station" is compatible with Zbook seire. D9Y32AA is part number. This docking required a bottom of the laptop to have a special "port" to connect/dock. Look at the bottom of the "zbook" to see if there is a port.
Yes, it will. I use that combo all the time.
Yes
No
Yes
No, not any longer. They used to, but it was discontinued a while back.

So, is there a "special" DVD player just to play region 7 DVDs? What a bout the multiregion DVD players?
To get the best image quality, make sure to get a DVI to HDMI cable or adapter. These are almost always MUCH cheaper from amazon than at a local store. HDMI is digital (like DVI-D), while VGA is analog (like DVI-A and "component video"). VGA is likely to look a little blurry and have image ghosting compared to digital. More information at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVI-D
I'm experiencing the same problem...
My guess is it is the bulb if it is a couple of years old. Mine did that and would cut itself off and I would turn it on and it would do like yours is doing.
Probably the bulb
The one I bought in March 2013 did.
Yes. I use a two inch belt when I wear jeans and it works very well. I think you will appreciate this product.
Yes, it fits my new RX100M3 just fine and it does have the velcro belt loop and snap.
You can set the mode either way. I use it set to "All Disk" + "Random" + "Repeat" to keep music going in the office all day
We have never had a problem with ours-so sorry no good answer.
Yes, but not mp3's that are on cd. It will only play copies of a digital cd and not a rip to mp3.
Yes...as long as the Sandisk has a standard 1/8 inch stereo plug for an output (standard small headphone output)
This is a great TV, every reviewer gives it top notch reviews, especially for the price, so yes, I'd advise the same TV. I bought it & Ihave a little pause when tuning to a new channel, Panasonic asked me to try a new cable, which I will do. I bought from Amazon.com, the delivery man made sure the TV at least looked in good shape when it was delivered...he took the box off, etc. We are very, very happy with it. Linda
Type 2 is for DX sensor. D5200's sensor is DX size. Type 3 is for Full frame. So you should use Type2. Type 3 is flimsy. You can use Type 2 for Full frame machine too, like D700/D800, just follow my review, not the way it claims.
Yes. It should work.
I do know it has Bluetooth capabilities. It is a very old pocket camera, but the color is almost perfect Kodak at that time, had the best. For a 6 MP camera, it is as good, as the cameras of today. Sill love it
No, this is not a feature of this camera.
I have garmin navigation - suction cup worked for me.
How to hook up my cinevision dvr 1000 to record from my digital tv?
No, it does not but its a great, solid computer. High quality material and craftsmanship
with the legs completely retracted its 19 1/2 inches tall it opens to 53 inches with the handle part cranked all the way out.hope this helps i use mine alot for videos and such.
These speakers have their own independent volume control. TV speakers can be turned down, or completely silent if so desired without affecting the volume of the earphones.
I have an extended warranty on this detector and have never been notified of any firmware updates. I did have the unit serviced once and Beltronics support is top of the line.
I haven't used the solo, but I have zero complaints with the 940. Definitely paid for itself
i use mine as a home recording studio, so you should be able to play this no problem. (SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS MINIMUM PC REQUIREMENTS Minimum CPU Type: 486DX Minimum CPU Speed: 33 MHz Minimum RAM Required: 8 MB Minimum Hard Disk Space: 6 MB Minimum OS Version: 5.0 Graphics Type: SVGA Color Depth: 256 Colors Free Conventional Required: 470 KB) heres the specs if you need them, hope this helps.
I think that it depends on whether you use the MS operating system or not. I use *nix on all my computers, so no video games.
Most cruise ship has 3 prong plug.
Yes it does.
It has plug-ins for DC but I don't remember it coming with an adapter. If it did, I cannot find it. I use it in the garage, so it's plugged into the AC outlets. Sorry I cannot help you.
Most cruise ship has 3 prong plug.
This product comes with screws. I see that you can buy a screwpost set separately. I think they are replacement parts or perhaps longer screws in case you have a larger amount of items to present. However, keep in mind you do need to buy Archival Adhesive Hinge Strips to attach to whatever you are presenting with your portfolio book. That is a separate purchase. Pay attention that you are getting the right size as there are many to choose from. Hope that is helpful.
It can only be connected to the power supply in your computer via a 3 pin connector. With the 3 pin connection from the psu its plenty long to reach to the lower side of my case. Spec says 8 x 1.9 x 1 in.
Yes, but only two will have 12v power.
Well , since you are recording in real time i.e. you play the lp hooked to the computer, it plays the computer records and yes , you must wait while the whole record plays , 12 cuts at 3-6 min/track ,it will take from 45 min to a little over an hour to record and digitize each album. Hope this helps,
This just happened to my unit that is about 3 years old unit. Called APC and they are going to send another one. One thing you can try is unplugging everything, hold the unit about 6" above a solid surface and drop it. The shock can unstick the relay. I tried and it did work on mine.
Mounts come in box
Yes, the D5100 has a F lens mount. The Sigma for Nikon fits this mount.
Two major metal parts. One for the TV/Monitor, one for the wall or swivel mount. Knob on top moves left or right to release. Nice item.
A Gumdrop mount ----&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Radio-GumDrop-Beehive-Antenna-Surface/dp/B00JNC6R8K
Yes.
Yes I have windows 8 and this works flawlessly with it
NCR 997375 NCR Point-of-Sale Thermal Paper Rolls, 3 1/8" x 230', 10 Rolls
You would connect the cash drawer cable to the back of this receipt printer. When the printer prints a receipt, the cash drawer automatically opens.
it is right around 16 feet
Yes
It's real leather, and it is holding up well after a year of almost daily use.
yes - as long as you have the factory double din provision in the dash.
Yes
Yes. You can easily record old VHS home movies. The machine won't let you record coded DVD's or coded VHS stuff.
Yes
This drive is probably formatted for a PC only. I purchased one that would not work on a Mac and returned it. Look closely at the descriptio and see that it work on the Mac OS.
You can also use it with Media Monkey, which is a much better program, including having support for ogg vorbis playback. However, you do need to have WMP11 installed in order to be able to recharge the battery in the Clix.
Yep...The same thing happened to me. I sent it back, bought another one and it happened again. The last one I ordered from Amazon which I never received from Amazon so I took that as a sign to find another player. Any suggestions?
If you used the headphone jack then I'm sure it would. But mine wouldn't wouldn't work with any iPod using the sync jack.
I purchased these for "older" camera that cannot format/use the newer HD or SD cards. It has worked fine on my DSLR camera.
I had to return the memory disc. It didn't work in my camera. If you can plug your camera into your computer with the loaded disc in the camera with the camera turned on, you may be successful
Both, no problems with either.
The country of origin is Hong Kong. Customer Service Team
no......this is not that type of heat shrink.......
Yes it will fit. But be warned it might be a very tight fit. I suggest you get a larger messenger case. You need a fit thats not too tight or lose. Hope this helps.
I mailed it all in and received a postcard that says, "Purchase was made outside the qualifying period." I called, and they told me that the offer ended on 6/30, but I remember it saying it was good until the end of July. I figured d-link was reputable, so I didn't make a copy of the form and have no real proof who made the mistake. I did find another form good through the end of August, but I no longer have the UPC barcode.
if you dont mind some latency on your network you can - tell all other connected devices to use your 'monitoring pc' IP as the gateway IP - set your 'monitoring pc' to use the real gateway IP - enable IP forwarding on your 'monitoring pc'
No, it has a manual on/off button in the back. You won't hear it if the Yamaha receiver is off, since there is no input, but the power stays on unless you manually turn it off.
Are you saying that the "plug" which is a 3.5mm is too big...and that the ipod hole is too small...I don't know much about different brands od ipods but Radio Shack did at one time carry an adapter that would let you use 3.5 mm headphones... Rick
Mine did... Bought it a few years back now. Still working great.
It has just one plug. I have seen some marketed that included a separate adapter to convert the plug to a 3.5mm which fits most android and iphones
You asked about the red button, and the switch? I think the switch is on the cord. Since I bought these several years ago, and amazon just emailed me now to try to answer. These small devices often break after a month to a few months at most. If I remember correctly, the button on the earpiece is just a label, and it does nothing. In fact when mine were delivered it said Verizon, and not Plantronics on it. The switch on the cord reduces the volume, or mutes the earpiece.
Yes. It does but not on every cordless. On the panasonic 6.0 it was clear. On the older models, not so much.
It's separate headphone and mic jacks
no it does not.
Hello, yes with and analog phone, and any VOIP provider that allows you to bring your own box not for VONAGE, hope this answers your question, have nice day, I ship fast and units are all tested... Frank
I don't have it handy. It is about 14" or so. You could probably bend it, as it doesn't have to rotate much.
I have also tried this with no luck. A side from this it's a great remote.
Yes, it is compatible with Comcast remote. The learning mode can duplicate any IR remote. I even copy my lighting remote. Now I can control the TV, cable box and room lighting while sitting on my Lazyboy. Now all I need is a remote to get beer out of the fridge!
Yes, These speakers don't require a lot of power. I'm sure your receiver will do fine.
Yes, I have only Windows 7 and I have been using this Small Wonder since I had xp. Wonderful little gadget.
No, it doesn't.
Very short. Less than a foot or so.
Hi Heather, Only the basic operations are accessible without the remote control. -Anthony
I think I'm not very demanding, but I would say it's acceptable (I don't want my kids using it too laud anyway). The volumen nob it's a little hard to find on the side, and not accesible using the remote control, which is a little annoying.
Yes. Your preamp needs a switchable input, though. Or a preamp specifically designed for MC.
no, only reular CDs
In my experience, this only works if the 3.5mm jack is also optical audio as well. For example: I used this with the Apple Airport Express for audio.
In my set up, yes. If you are connecting straight from the cable modem, I don't think so. A cable modem is most likely only going to give out one IP address. However, I have a wireless router connected to the cable modem, so the router handles IP address assignment. I then have a 100' ethernet cable running form the router to this switch. I can have up to four devices connected to the switch at the same time and all will have internet access. Right now I have two connected. Hope that helps to clarify.
I bought one, a couple months back- i ran the line from my modem to the upstairs, then branched off 3 lines to different pcs. You need an electrical outlet to plug it into (110 v AC), but it handles all three PCs at full speed. If I needed to do it again, I'd buy this same unit
Outer Diameter (one side to the other)
The pans are very standard and fit my range with no problems. If your current drip pans are 6" and 8" they should fit.
If you are asking about OTA, then the HR-20 has an OTA tuner. Any other HR-2x, then you need the AM21 ATSC tuner. If you're talking about an RF remote instead of IR, it should be capable.
No word processing software was included. I have the usual microsoft accessories wordpad and notepad. Some windows media programs were included Windows messenger, windows moviemaker, windows media player, and power link DVD. Otherwise the basic windows operating software was installed too. Thank you for asking.
I tried it on the rear deck the dash and outside the vehicle, all with poor results.
Yes, just make sure you put it at the top of your windshield. Also make sure you run the power and ground otherwise it won't work.
No longer available. Company out of business
Good question. The answer is no, there is not a battery back up on the receiver.
While I dont believe this is a problem and the RESA plate should fit nicely . I would check whith the mount manufacture if you are really concerned.
This is okay to use for a MacBook 2006.
Best way to be sure is going to Crucial's website. Find your MacBook model and it'll give you all compatible options.
It only works with Honda vehicles.
I do not know if it will , my car was a honda and it fit that car
It can use Coax cable in and out like the older style VCR's. Not sure if it has RCA connectors. I am using a universal remote for it in my case no remote was provided.
For me a hits a little too low, but I have a small frame. I think you would be okay with it without the extension. :)
Everything is included
I am a medium sized woman and there is plenty of room. I have it strapped to the smallest size.
The Nikon P80 is the only thing I can think of...sorry for the way late response.
When using the auxiliary cord, the 4s works perfectly. I used to have an iPhone 4s and when I would connect through bluetooth you could hear static, which is the same case with the galaxy s4 that I currently have. So yes it does work with the iPhone 4s and your best bet is to use the auxiliary cable that comes with the GOgroove.
My 2012 Chevy Impala does not shut off power to accessories so I purchased a 12-volt Power Adapter with on/off switch at Radio Shack. Plug my GOgroove into that and can keep my GOgroove in place at all times. Just switch off when I'm finished.
It is somewhat, however, you will have to tweak it to find all the channels you want. There are a few weak stations that can only be received when I turn the antenna toward their towers. It is a balancing act to be able to pick up all the stations I want without having to move the antenna. Mine is in my attic.
Depends on your TV if you have a newer one that has a digital receiver you do not need a converter. If you TV is older and has a analog receiver you will need a converter.
I didnt put mine in the attic but, in order to safely get it on my roof I "folded" it up. If you loosen the screws you can collapse it fairly flat and it will fit through most attic stairways. R//Joe
It comes with just the antenna as you see. It will need a mounting kit with a mast and a mount which will vary depending upon how you intend to mount it. Just search on "Antenna Mounts". I'm using an old DISH mount. Please NOTE: this antenna is highly directional so unless all your stations align in the same direction, you will also need an antenna rotor. To see where your stations are located, go to Antennaweb.org. Good Luck, Jim
To be 100% honest ...I used it once and put it back in my accesssory box. I took it out and there is a cord attached. I beleive it came with it but not 100% sure ...sorry
Standing in the same position, you'll capture a wider image with this lens than without. I'm not convinced that it's 50% more, though. There is some noticeable blurring around the edges and even the center of the image is not quite as sharp as without this lens attached, if you zoom in to the picture in post-processing.
zoom in a little bit. At the low end of your 18-55 in a small space (indoors) you most likely won't see a lot of difference- take it outside and turn it up to 55 and I promise you'll notice something!
Your rear speakers don't necessarily have to match your fronts, so with that theory in mind, these should serve you well. As long as your center matches your front left and right, you're good.
No discomfort at all. The material that holds the binoculars is very "stretchy." Also, depending on how you have the straps, it's easy to change the position of where the binoculars sit on your chest area. The only thing that you have to get used to is what you do with multiple layers of clothing. In very cold weather I would have my binoculars under my outermost layer, and then you can sometimes fumble a little to get them to your eyes quickly, depending on how tight/zipped you have your jacket/outer-layer.
They do have two snap clips that attach to rings on the binoculars, so if you had similar rings on your camera it would be a quick change. This harness is fantastic for my binoculars!
Cover works like they do on regular strap.
it does have an HDMI port. If you actually stop the DVD or take it out it does not remember the place. But it does if you pause it.I do not think that it takes long to load.
No clock with this (or most others) DVD player. The place is for displaying the track information (Track #, time elasped/remaining etc.)
Can anyone with this DVD player answer Keith's question? I'm interested in buying it but only if it upscales with component cables and not just HDMI
Yes...There is a 1/4" output jack in the back of the unit.....
No you would need to purchase a phono preamp.
As far as i can tell yes. I have only used the usb connection a couple times however.
No you need a receiver, you might be able to play it thru your computer do to the fact that you can record an album and put it on a mp 3 disc. I haven't tried to play it on my computer though
Yes, it comes with (should come with) a wall plug.
THIS ONE HAS NO SPEAKER. BUY THE Sangean DT-200X FM-Stereo AM/FM Digital Tuning model.
No, it does not. It does have a strap holder on the top back of the radio. It takes the kind of strap that small digital cameras have to hold on your wrist. Other than that, it is a great pocket radio. If your looking for one with a clip, check out the Sangean DT200X. It also has a built in speaker besides headphone jack.
AAA
4593 on 5/8/13 when I received the camera. Body was in mint- condition.
We sell this both with box and without, they are priced differently please check. Thanks
No
yes it will work on a crop frame camera but will lack the power to focus because your camera must have a built-in af motor
My Tokina 80-400 is compatible with my Canon 7d so mine would not be compatible but as Tokina are a 3rd party manufacturer, I do not know whether they do a Nikon compatible version...I suspect they do!
The software worked with my win 7 64 bit laptop just fine
It would depend on how far you are from it. It's about 30 feet from my bedroom and I had to put duct tape over the speaker. It still wakes me when opened.
It will not get hot if it is in contact with the metal plate if it isn't contacting the plate it may get hot and burn out. Yes it can stay on indefinitely but it will shorten the life span of the magnet.
Yes, as long as you give the magnet 12v DC, it will work.
7'' x 7'' x 9''
The battery compartment is under front part of the mouse which detachs. Hope this helps!
I bought a reconditioned one from Apple for $99, added additonal 2 yr warranty for $39, best deal I could find.
The hardware does, but you may need to update the software that is shipped with it.
I had the same problem. The photos were blurry and discolored. I did not send it back as I should have. It was no better than the one I replaced it with. I could get no assistance from HP
Just Print regular pics. Keep it simple..
Yes, it does. Have to make sure you push the connection in firmly, though: when I first tried it I didn't do that and had no joy.
If the FZ200 has a bulb mode, then yes, you will be able to. But as far as I know, the FZ200 DOES NOT have a bulb mode. As such, the best this will be able to do is take advantage of a 60-second exposure.
The cable that comes with the unit will plug into the earphone jack on your TV. It can also be plugged into your audio system but will require an adapter. Once plugged in turn the base and headset, will automatically pick up the signal. Hope this helps.
Yes, you can select 1080p on your 360 and it will work fine. I have both and did it.
No. It's sewn on.
Spare Ear Tip Kit P/N 72913-01 fits CS70N headsets.
Shouldn't be a problem
Yea sure
Yes. The power supply is furnished with the CM7777 when purchased new. With refurbished units, they should come with the supply as well. The new design amp has a smaller transformer with a (F) connector for 75 ohm coax and plugs straight into the wall or power strip. Older P/S units were bigger and had a power cord. It appears that the older design may possibly had a higher power rating. I am powering two amps with a power pass combiner from one supply and it works fine.
Hello, This case is able to be submerged under 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes in accordance with IP67 testing parameters
Yes your mobo does support this cpu. You may have to update your BIOS.
Yes, I took video of my grand daughter's youth pagent. Using zoom, about 45 feet from the stage, I was delighted with the performance of this camera. Is it a video camera - no. But it does a very respectable job AND the audio came through loud and clear, with no external microphone. I'm satisfied. By the way, it's great as a still camera.
Yes.
No it does not run on batteries. It could be utilized in a car but you would need a 12V converter. This could work for your various room setup, but you would need to find a DVR that supports RCA cables. Most surveilance systems I have seen only support BNC. All the cameras would plug into your DVR which is the brain of the system. Then there is an output on the DVR that plugs into your monitor to view your camera(s).
It clamped easily to the mast(a pipe/pole approx. 1.25" diameter) holding my old antenna, on chimney, pointed to the signal. connected with coax cable to my TV.
Yes. You should be okay provided the drywall is that thick. I would recommend hilti toggle bolts instead of regular anchors though.
I have a 63" plasma. It will rotate about 80 degrees both ways but takes some work as the extension arm has to be straightened out before getting maximum rotation. Also you have to be sure your cables are long enough to reach. A 60" with a narrower bezel will turn farther as my bezel is 2 1/2" on the sides so you will closer to 90 degrees probably. Not sure if they make a unit with more extension but if so will cost more.
It says in the electronic manual that it is compatible with windows xp but I wouldn't know I have windows 7 and yes you can use gimp that is what I am using.
This device you have to connect via usb on or computer. But it does come with programs on the cd it comes with, to edit, write, and yes emails. So you can send personalised mails or sign for a document.
Mine did the same when I used the free shipping. My order went to one of their many centers - this center had none in stock. I had to call Amazon and they redirected my order to a warehouse(?) that had them. I should receive mine by 17 Oct. You might try calling them.
1. I see no reason why it would not work with a Nikon D7100. 2. True, there is no aperture ring on the lens with a Nikon mount. The aperture may be manually set by the camera itself in the Aperture or Manual modes.
Yes, since it is an EX lens it comes with a 48 month warranty. Sigma should make this easier to find. I had to call them to find out.
It does use the camera body motor to focus. It is not the quietest but it's very accurate and quick. One of my favorite lenses!
I believe it is. The Sigma can be had with either Sony A & E mounts. I use the lens with a NEX7, E mount. The lens with an A mount and used with a LA2 adapter for auto focus & exposure. To set the aperture go to your camera setting. Aperture. Set what you want & the shutter speed sets automatically.
This is only a computer case, not the actual computer itself.
Yes, it comes with standoffs and all kinds of screws and such in the goodie bag.
It is Cisco, although Linksys is also a Cisco product.
Someone else already posted a link to this board's manual, and your question is answered there: "Four 240-pin Double Data Rate 2 (DDR2) SDRAM Dual Inline Memory Module" single or dual channel. Up to 8GB supported.
The board will run any DDR 2 800 for 1600 speed RAM s timing of 5 5 5 or5 56. it will fit into any full size ATX case
If you mean the USB from the cradle to a PC, it's just a regular USB cable with one of the standard mini connections at the cradle end. Take the cradle to any store that sells USB cables and they should be able to find one. I don't use the cradle except for charging - just put the memory card in a regular SD card reader.
Yes, both reels are in there.
LFE - one single black cable to the receiver. My receiver even pops up with an indicator to remind me it's acknowledging LFE is present.
Yes. Never could get it to work. Returned it.
Yes you need some kind of receiver am/fm stereo or anything you can plug white and red audio input cables into
I advise you to go to the Sky & Telescope website. They offer a course in amateur astrophotography.
I guess you could do that but it wouldn't be very stable. It depends what you are trying to do. if you want to point it to the moon or bright objects then I guess it would work. Deep space and astrophotography would require you to put it on the tripod. The tripod that it comes with is very good quality and very stable.
It runs on batteries. You can plug in a 12V power source of your choosing. I use a universal power adapter that came with several plugs and found one that fits nicely.
Yes as long as you have 12 volts going to horn.
I don't see why not...... All you need is a 12v battery and a place to put the alarm.
yes it does, in your owner's manual, this process is discribed in very simple terms. put a dvd in press record, or, set timer to record later.
No it won't.
If it's in your room, it's loud enough to wake you if you are sleeping, but I don't find it very loud.
A 12v DC 7 amp hour battery
Yes, it will work with all the latest Ademco keypads. It is a great system. I bought two of them. Highly recommend.
Yes
There's only 1 playlist on the shuffle.
Yes that is the number of the remote. The only difference is the original was made in Mexico and the replacement is made in China. Works great though. This is the dish replacement. If your old one works you can program remote to remote.
Yes, but you have to get an adapter. This is optional.
If the old atari has a standard coaxial wire connection that would fit any tv it should work to switch back and forth between it and a tv or monitor.
Not the latest 1.3, so I guess it's 1.2. This can be confirmed from sony's website
I have never experienced that condition. Have you checked to be sure you have not inadvertently changed your input selection. The set has several inputs and selecting the wrong one would give a black screen.
This one does not charge your player. I've had an older Monster on that did. It got old and abused and broke over time. This one won't charge it.
did you check for hidden files?
I just checked the inserts and it looks like there's just enough room for an 18 X 24. Whatever you do, don't get the Itoya ring binder - it falls apart. Get the Prat Premium Multi-Ring Mini Refillable Binder and inserts (sold on Amazon). It comes in 18 X 24 and is made extremely well.
Should be, if you have the right software.
Actually, the newer Tomtom One's come with the maps preloaded - no SD card needed/required.
Just plug it into your USB port and leave the computer on. There will be a green indicator light on the Tom Tom (next to the power button) showing that the unit is charging.
Same thought I had. No. The extra landscape doesn't show you more than the TT1 in the way of what is around. You won't be looking at it, rather you will likely just listen most times. Excellent notifications should carry you. However, if you want a 40% larger screen, then only the XL will do. I am pleased with the TT1, though, and thankfull I didn't pay the extra 100. Good luck. James
Onkyo uses discrete codes for 'on' and 'off', it is not a 'toggle' code like those used by other receiver manufacturers (Sony for example). So you can program the AUX button on the FiOS remote to turn the receiver on or off but not both. I use a universal remote with macros programmed to turn all the home theater equipment on and one to turn everything off.
This one only supports 1.1 -- you need to consider the TX-SR605 model which supports 1.3
This battery fits the Kodak Z812IS camera and is a 3.7V lithium Ion battery. They will not charge on the crv3 charger. It requires a KLIC8000 or compatible charger.
On Antec's website it is 3.5 H - 5.8 W - 5.5 D. I put this in another persons computer so do not have it to measure myself.
I don't know. But it did work well for my purpose.
Actually I have SD4500,I think SD4500IS has same functions as SD4000IS Here is the Way to use Color accent and color swap.. color Accent: Choose color accent mode. Hold menu key for few secs and release(do not just press). At the bottom color selector will appear-- Focus camera on object.Adjust the rectangular color selected(BOX) on color you want to be accented. press left navigation key on wheel....Now color to be accented is selected...U r ready to capture the image. Color Swap. In the same way you can find out color SWAP. Its really easy.
Most of the time, photos taken by compact digicams will be either blurry or grainy (noisy), when using the AUTO setting and not using a tripod. To take good pics with my A630, I carry an Ultrapod II, use the camera in semi-automatic mode (Program AE), select the lowest ISO, and use a 2-second timer. If you need to take great pics without a tripod, you should consider a camera with Image Stabilization, like the Canon S3 IS, or, better yet, a pro camera (Digital SLR) with IS lens.
I feel the same way. What may help is to go to Canon's website and select the camera that you have (i.e. SD800). When the page comes up, there are a few tabs; select the one labeled Support and Service. It lists frequently asked questions and it also allows you to type in a question. It also offers technical support via email or telephone. I hope this helps.
You might not care yet as a beginner, but the Digic II processor (but NOT the Digic III) can be modified with the third-party CHDK firmware. This means that, down the line, you can turn on all sorts of advanced features in the 710is (live histogram, RAW format, intervalometer, etc, etc, etc) but not in the 720. I have a 710 and absolutely love it.
Funny you should ask, Bryan. I just noticed a slight lifting on the back side of the zoom ring today. I've shot a couple thousand frames so far and I carry my camera in a bag where it rubs up against other gear. The knob on the front of the ring is wearing a hole in the bag divider against which it sits. So I've been a little rough with my camera. IMO the loose ring is probably normal. Unless our cameras are both defective. Everything works as it should.
If 100% humidity is fatal to Canon Powershot cameras then I would think the same would apply to all digital cameras regardless of manufacture or cost. Maybe the Olympus E-1 which is extremely well sealed against water could be an exception .
It fits a 3" diagonal screen. The x and y dimensions are usually proportional between camera screen manufacturers. The Delkin fits Panaasonic, canon and Nikon 3" screens for sure. You need to check that your Pentax has the same dimensions of one of these.
12 GA minimum. I used 10 GA with mine.
These speakers are sold as individuals. You are still getting a speaker that it worth 7 times as much for the price. I purchased 2 of these for my jeep and couldn't be happier.
This will work, did on my T3i. The low price Is indicative of the LOW quality images you will capture using this cheap glass. The build quality of the unit I was sent was sloppy and dirty. Mud like substance on the lenses. Shipping it back for a refund was some where in the neighborhood of 1/4 to 1/3 of the cost. This lens is not worth the aggravation. Definitely don't buy it if 47th street photo is selling it.
It works with my T2i nicely... cheap but worth the $$ you paid for. Make sure to get the adapter mount for Canon
It fits the Yongnuo 468 II perfectly.
No, this fits the SB600 Nikon Flash. You must order the specific one that will fit the Nissin Di 466. If amazon does not stock it, go to the STO-FEN site and order it direct. They do make a model that will fit this flash perfectly. Good Luck!!
No
Not 100% sure but I can only get my 1TB inside the case so anything slightly larger would be no.
Sorry I have no idea. I putt the card in a dell Inspiron 570 for a camera that I bought I works great. Hope this helps
It only works with one, the Duo. Total waste of money.
This adapter works ONLY with the Sony sticks not with SD cards Hope this helps you. There are other readers that work with many different memory sticks - they usually say something like 6 in 1 reader.
I wrote Tamron tech support about being compat with the D5000 and here is their reply: "Yes Sir, complete compatibility with any digital Nikon - Rob Moody Tamron USA" Larry Van Horn
Mine is USB, only. - Frank
Sorry, HMC UVC
I checked my filter, I got a UV C.
I got 58mm. But you should ask amazon first, it says it's 77mm on the picture...
In same boat, Bob. I'm buying the D80. Cheaper, and less weight/bulk. I test drove a 30D and did not like the ergonomics. Have been waiting for a D70s replacement, and it's here!
Hi Peter, no the cable card slot means you can put a cable card in there. Some cable companies will allow you to insert a card (they supply) instead of having a set-top box. The other connections are worth the money if you plan on using them. The FireWire and USB would be great if you plan on hooking a media reader or DV camera to the television to look at pictures or movies. Remember, these can be used as computer monitors as well so computers ports or becoming much more common.
Did you ever get a reply...I have the same problem... ravizza@nctv.com
Thanks for all your input. Trying to decide whether it is worth 260.00 to repair or just chock up as a loss. A little disappointed to see Nikon charging so much when it appears this is manufacturing defect. Oh well.
Yes, I recently added a center channel speaker to my existing 2 front speaker set up. I was running through RCA cables initially, but with the added channel, these are incompatible. I got the optical audio cable, hooked it to my receiver, but have been unable to get any sound whatsoever out of it.
They do not function simultaneously. The camera operates off of the battery on the right. Once it is depleted, the battery on the left takes over. In order to get maximum life out of my batteries, I rotate them through the right slot. When one is fully depleted, it is charged and then is installed on the left. I hope this helps.
I believe the 5100 is compatible with DX lenses. As far as quality, I use my with a D90 and shot thousnads of photos with it and been more than happy with the results I've gotten from it.
The local channels have all gone to digital, and if you have a digital tv, this antenna picks up the local stations. It will NOT convert an older tv (analog) to a digital. You still need a digital converter for that.
I honestly cant remember, I'd say it's about 3-4ft max, BUT, this TV Antenna is literally the Best antenna you can buy for the price. My family has owned 4 of these because the signal is Superior to any other antenna, especially them so-called "hd antennas" you always find in stores priced at $50-$80.oo.. I say you purchase this antenna, get an extension (more cable wire), a connector, and there you have it, enjoy..
Where to look? All I do is scan all the channel and look up the channels in my area. Then if I don't see the channel, I just tweak and move it around until I see something. That's all.
Yes I have it and use hdmi
Yes
yes
Its not compatible with Win8
I can't say definitively if there is no all-in-one eyetv-like product with built-in dual cable input, but I'd really doubt it. Why not put a A/B switch like this [ http://www.amazon.com/PHILIPS-PH61007-A-B-Switch/dp/B0001GGXMW ] before the eyetv hybrid? Still allowing only one or the other input...would have to manually flip the A/B switch. Were you hoping to record a program off the air and off of cable at the same time (or close to the same time, when you wouldn't be around, or have to remember, to flip the A/B switch)?
I would like to know about this as well.
Don't know returned it . It didn't work
I imagine it will work on any receiver which has a "CD Player" input. Works great with our Carver Receiver.
it works like a circuit breaker. when overloaded it switches off. After that, then switch it back on.
The cord is 9' 7". The base is 12.5"
Folks: They are marked. Remove the cable dressing plastic device and the markings are right below it. Now, why anyone in their right mind would cover them is a different question. Incidentally, the phone jack furthest from the coaxials is the "In"The other two are the ut" and the coaxial closest to the phone jack is the "In".
The cord is 9' 7". The base is 12.5"
It is its own case. The hard sides protect the screen, and the stand folds up into the back. So it's a case and screen all in one. Super portable!
This is the unit that can do it all, works great and easy to formatt.
The viewable resolution is 680 x 480, so you could always do that. The sample album pics are 688 x 488, but I would imagine that its a 4 pixel buffer around the edge.
Did you get yours yet? I just ordered mine after much research. I don't plan to use the software that comes with it. Instead, I'm going to transfer pics to an SD card. If I'm happy with the frame, I'd like to get one for my parents for Christmas.
worked fine with both of my color TVs.
yes-use mini cable to the head phone output jack on the tv
Pardon my spelling but Hermann Kardon speakers definitely compare. I have the 2nd generation 2.1 speaker system.
They already come with just the one audio cable that goes into your audio jack on your laptop or headphones jack..
Every camera is different. It should tell you somewhere in the discription. If it doesn't ask the seller.
There are 27 exposures!
FAT32 can create files 4GB or smaller. NTFS became standard with Windows 2000 and is used by XP and I'm sure Vista will use it. So unless you don't need to store files that are 4gb or more in size you probably dont need to worry about it. Personally I do a lot with video creation and saving uncompressed videos can get huge with only minutes of footage, so its useful for me.
Yes. Plug and play. Installs its own drivers and works with Vista.
I don't have any cables sorry.
Only 1
No
Yes it should be compatable as long as its from the headphones jack lookin slot to dvr or whatever
It says oem/tray, which means cpu only. Best, iCompNY
If you have a high zoom camera like the 10X S10, why not just zoom in to "crop" the photo in the first place? Or, crop off-line using your image management software? That is what I usually do because I like to save the original non-cropped image anyway. I think it is a matter of personal preference. I am considering getting an S-10, so I don't know if it handles LCD in-camera cropping per se.
You can set the camera to take snaps in intervals. 30s 1m 5m 10m 30m 60m
At this point, I'd say the 30D really doesn't have a lot of discernable advantages over the prosumer XTI model, besides availability. Historically, the higher end cameras have had sturdier chassis (which I would assume is still the case) as well as more configurable features and functions. Oh and resolution. Duh. Now that the XTI has been significantly improved, it seems only logical that the 30D is next in line for upgrades, probably before the actual release of the XTI. Or maybe the 30D will be killed entirely. I'm waiting for the XTI.
The camera has no internal memory so you do need a CF card installed to record images for review. You might look into connecting the camera to a PC with the USB cable and running the EOS Utility using the "Camera Settings/Remote Shooting" option which might not need the a memory card installed to function.
I got 50 :(
IF you have a satelite or cable box, you hook up to that. If the sound bar is blue tooth only them you have to have a blue tooth ready TV or some kind of adapter. Of you have any type of wire hookup you can always find an adapter so you can hook up to some other kind of wire.
Yes. I think so. I don't see any problem interconnecting it. TV outputs on this L-R Audio channels, which this adapter converts/combines to 3.5mm compatible adapter. Connect Bose head-phose just as you are connecting your headphones to any Aux. I'll try this with my Bose QC-15 and let you know.
RAM compatibility is dependent on the motherboard. As long as your motherboard supports DDR2, non-ECC, this will work. The only play the OS has on RAM is that 32bit Windows can ONLY run a max of 4GB of RAM. Putting more than that in won't hurt it, but it won't help at all.
I don't know what kind of GPS you have, but i do know that these Garmin updates will direct you to low bridges and logging trails, which was a lot of fun when I was hauling a fifth wheel.
No, this will not work with the XM Onyx. The XM Home Kit DH2 (Model: XADH2) will work with the Onyx and even comes with a remote control.
No. It is regular Black & White development process. If you want the chromogenic B&W (C41 process) from Kodak, this is it: http://www.amazon.com/Kodak-Professional-BW400CN-Negative-Exposure/dp/B00066WXQM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1396544381&sr=8-1&keywords=kodak+chromogenic+B%26W+film. There is also one from Ilford: http://www.amazon.com/Ilford-Super-135-36-Black-White/dp/B00008R9MM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1396544465&sr=8-1&keywords=ilford+xp2+35mm
Hello, thank you for your question. The limit is just the amount the system allows you to add when putting the item in the cart. You are able to change the quantity you want once you have added the item to your cart. After adding to cart click the "proceed" to checkout button. Enter the amount you want in the quantity tab (next to the price) and click the "update" button. I hope this helps!
I got one but can't access it on my Mac. I know the Mac can "see" it sitting on the USB port, but it doesn't mount it as a volume or do anything else which would let me access its files. Looking for a workaround.
Yes, it comes with a battery and a charger. Canon makes good batteries. Do not buy a generic to get an extra. Spend the $25 more to buy a Canon if you need an extra. However, the one that comes with it should do you fine. It can take several hundred (sometimes 500+) pictures even with the flash before you need to recharge. Recharge takes about 45 minutes once you plug into the wall. A little light turns from red to green once charged.
When the dimm has chips on both sides it is high density RAM. Chips on only one side is low density RAM. Normaly you should replace the RAM with what was already in the computer but many times a motherboard will take both high and low density RAM. The best thing for you to do is go to your manufacturers web site and look up the specs on your computer or go to Crucial's web site and download and install their program for RAM upgrades and that will tell you if it will work or not.
No echo but I get so much static through my Galaxy S4 that it is useless.
Yes, it is compatible with Windows 7. That's the operating system I have.
I have had no problems with my Plantronic head set. Maybe you do not have it situated in your ear just right. I know I had that problem at first, then I realized I needed to swivel the little torpedo shaped ear piece and point it into my ear.
Yes, two on top.
That depends more upon your selected motherboard than the case. This case has plenty of room inside and cooling fans to serve as a NAS server.
I haven't had any issues with it so far and I keep and use a headset plugged in there on a daily basis. My friend also has this same case and hasn't had an issue either. If I remember right, the last case had the ground in an area that caused interference. I'm not sure if this is in the same place or not.
There is a set screw and there is about and inch to play with. I've had two of these. OneI had to cut about and 1/8 inch off and the other tuned about in the middle without cutting. Hope this helps.
Mine was 13' feet
Potentially you could do this, however the sound would be "odd". The only way would be to route it via the "Zone2" option for a Bose system I guess.
No, each port is proprietary. They are not compatible. You can use some accessories that are "iPod Compatible" provided they plug into the earphone port on top.
It has an Aux In that you can plug an auxiliary audio cable in to so you can listen to your iPod, iPad, iPhone, etc through this boombox.
They no longer sell the unit that plugs into this box, therefore I have never used. And was a bad purchase on my part. If you have the unit that plugs into this box can have for free the one I purchased
Dont know what a Starmate 8 is but this Boombox you can import digital audio And you the system amplifier through the speakers. Suggest reading the manual online from Sirius and calling them direct and ask them 888-438-7474
This AVR does.
The Kindle book on tips for troubleshooting suggests making sure your outlet works and that your adapter is completely plugged in. also check adapter tip is plugged into correct jack on kindle. I would replace the battery anyway if it has not been used for a year.
It looks to me that you can use this to connect the two males into your stereo receiver and the male at the Y into either the turntable or CD player, then using standard connector cables, connect the female end at the Y to the female on the other (turntable or CD player). I see no reason why this would not work. If you can find a Y with all males, that would work better.
that is correct, 3.5 to 3.5
No. This product is not a DAC. You need a DAC. This product converts fiber optic digital toslink to a rca style coaxial digital connection.
This is for optical to coax. You need the opposite, coax to optical. There should be a similar product available on here that works in the opposite direction.
I've bought this cable twice. Both times it worked great with two sources for 3-4 months. After that one of the sides would completely stop working. I have no idea why.
This adapter is to be connected to the audio output only. It will not work with a microphone. I use my adapter to connect 2 computers to one amplifier. Works great!
Yes. I bought it because I needed 6pin.
No but It does have vibration control so I purchased this lens when I was 65 & have never had a problem with out of focus pictures. This is a great travel lens also, went to Hawaii for 30 days & Alaska for 15 days & never took it off the camera. Hope this helps, go to your local camera shop & put it on your camera & take some pictures & you be the judge.
According to a reply at another website, yes, the Fuze will work with this product, but you have to remove the plastic "sleeve" that surrounds the plug. See this site for details http://forums.sandisk.com/sansa/board/message?board.id=sansafuse&thread.id=524
Buy it and hope it doesn't break. The Cust. Service at Creative SUCKS.
Yes, it will :)
The main highways and established roads are good to go. but upgrades to the road systems are not always included. You may find that you have been directed the long way around. Having to go online with the 660 attached to the computer to updates maps is not quick or easy.. We absolutely use the 660 on all our road trips(even to Europa) but have to keep in mind it is not perfect..The built in units do not have to go thru the extra updating steps..
It does not charge on this unit... nor does my phone play well on it, only my ipod.
For my 2004 S60 it required the CD Changer port to function, so it likely will require your CD changer disconnected, unless it is build into the dash. I'd recommend buying direct, because they do not honor many resellers for warranty service.
Yes
I would feel comfortable with up to a 32" diagonal screen. A 40" screen would be pushing your luck; a 40" screen TV weighs about 35 pounds, and the product is rated to hold up to 33 pounds.
We used this for our Sanyo 22" and it works great. This mount is really awesome! Sturdy and the way it swivels, I highly recommend it. We ended up buying a second one for our larger tv for the garage too! As for compatability, I think most of the mounts are a universal fit, but I'm not positive.
You will have studs in the corner unless you live in some kind of special house that has no corner studs. I used this unit for a 36" flat screen and put it right in the corner. Works great. Did not sag at all.
Most televisions/monitors use the VESA mounting standard. Check your TV's documentation in the user's manual or online and find out if it has VESA mounting holes. If so, you are good to go! Keep in mind this is for TVs/monitors less than 27"

Hi CSC. I have the same question, I am about to upgrade to a DH70 from an H31. Did you ever get a reply on the comparison? Or did you buy the HD70 and found out yourself?
No
Hi, You can connect your Sony HVR-V1U Camcorder to your laptop via USB cable or i-link port. For further asssistance, please reach us at SocialSupport@am.sony.com. - Vincent
what do you exactly mean? you can put on it any divx, avi, mpeg, quictime movie, mpeg 4 or any kind of movie on the special software it brings and then it transformers it to the kind it can be seen on the device, look at the pictures i'll upload on amazon on 13/02/07
I am very happy with my 2GB Sansa. Just updated the firmware (very smooth application downloaded from Sandisk site). Sleek design, not as cool as Nano, but very close. Ubercool video which Nano doesn't have, which works surprisingly well. Bigger screen than Nano too. Micro SD slot a great plus. And it also works like a storage device, so you can take files with it, something Nano doesn't do. Go for the $129 (at time of writing) 4GB model.
What is the question? Does it have an fm radio? No.
Yes. The beauty of Pentax DSLR's is that they will accept all K-mount Pentax lenses ever produced. I myself have a 25 year old manual focus 50mm M f/1.4 lens I use on this camera.
I bought the K10D in December and have used it fairly extensively for about three months, including some travel. The camera is well designed with an extremely comfortable grip, so even though it's heavy I feel the weight is well distributed and does increase overall stability. The camera's numerous controls are well placed and logically arranged which adds to its ease of use; it may be heavy but like any good tool it's such a pleasure to use because of the good design you don't think about it as a burden.
There is no shoulder strap.
You're kiddin', right?
No, you did the right thing. There isn't really any difference between component cables and HDMI. 91 bucks seems pricey, I bought one a year ago for 30 bucks. The only advantage over HDMI is it carries both audio and video. Also when HDCP is implemented you don't have to worry about your videos not playing over component, but that won't be done for years.
According to Toshiba it is a software error message, often caused by a failed firmware upgrade. There is no fix available. They offered to sell me a replacement, but I can get a replacement cheaper on Ebay or Amazon
YES. As long as your TV and laptop both have HDMI ports. I use it exactly for that - HDMI on laptop to HDMI on TV. Is wonderful because it also carries audio on the HDMI cable so you can easily watch movies (say from iTunes) on TV too.
Yes. HDMI cables transfer video and audio data.
I don't know about warranty, but about compatibility: The Wireless Extender receives any IR signal and transports it to the place you want.
Don't think so. The application guide for the RF extender doesn't list the 900. I have an 1100 so I can't be more specific.
This is not official, since there is no doucmentaion on this subject, but the way i do it, is pull it out, when the battery charger stops its animation (empty, 1/4, 1/2, 3/4, full and repeat) Damn i wish there was more documentation that came with this player. It could've been great. And yes, i already overcharged mine, it only last now for about 4 hours after a day of charging.
I had the same problem, the instructions stink! I thought that something would come up that would guide me as to what to do, duh! I am not great at electronic know-how, but I finally figured out that you need a program, like Windows Media, to work the thing, it has no program of its own. I opened up Windows Media Player and clicked on Sync. Then it showed the MP player and I figured it out from there.
yes.
One for the camera only.
Yes it works with all Roku devices! Glad I can help.
This remote is an older design meant strictly to replace infrared remotes. If LG's Smart TVs use an infrared remote, then this will work for it
It will work with any HP laptop that has an "Expansion Port 3". A quick Google search has an image of the port. The docking station does not come with an additional power supply, however is designed to use the power cord currently plugged into your laptop. The docking station then supplies power to the laptop; only 1 cord is required.
I could not for sure know if it is going to fit or not. You need to ask someone owner of the same camera than you. Hope you can find your answer.
bec. the slingbox is not wifi capable. you have to connect the RCA/Component cables from the cable box.
Yes, you can use this lens on your D3100 but only with manual focus. Hope this helps. Blue Penn Cameras
It can work with d60, but auto-focus is unavailable.
yes, but you won't get tv out functionality. when docked, you can connect the audio to external speakers or a tv, but the video cable will have no signal to it, so no watching zune videos on your tv or browsing through songs through the tv screen. i have an 8gb zune and bought the home av pack anyway, it's still worth it but it would have been much cooler if you could get tv out.
It does work with the 8g zune, but it doesn't give you all the features you will get with the 30 or 80g. It is a must have if you are going to be sending it thru a home a/v set up though, the sound is much better going through this kit than with just a mini to rca set up.
I would say one and half foot long. But please consider what I have mentioned
As long as it cuts off speakers when you plug in headphones, should work just fine in any set of front ports on a pc. There's only once when I've had a system not auto-cut the speakers and that was a software issue on a much older system. I've used these quite a bit and they're great for being able to use headsets you'd normally use with a cell or other single-plug sets.
worked with epson rx595 and my moden very happy with cable
Yes is the answer but an HD Cable would be a lot better with better clarity and sound, amazon have them at the best price, if you don't have a n HD port on your computer, I believe there is a connector made USB/HD .
Do not know that. It is a standard A end ( rectangle and B small square like end
Yes
If you're asking does it have a sleeve that slips over the handle of another suitcase, the answer is no. If you're asking does it have a shoulder strap that you can wrap around the handle of a suitcase, the answer is yes.
No.
If, by "pin" you mean banana plugs, yes it does.
I got a WD Passport 160 GB USB 2.0 Drive today. - It does not work on my 4-year old Compaq Presario 900 laptop (XP home with SP2). Nothing happens. - So far no trouble running it on my newer HP Pavilion dv4000 (XP home with SP2). With all the comments about working or not working with laptops I keep my fingers crossed! Noticed that reviews earlier this year were far more negative than more recent one's. Did they improve the product??
I think yes. I used it in my ps3 and it worked. Same idea but different console.
They fit your standard RCA cables like the one pictured here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCA_connector I can't find the exact size the same way the 3.5mm is listed... but it fits your standard DVD/Game Console/AV RCA cables. I've never seen RCA connectors come in any other measurement.
No, in line mode it really is just a buffer. And the phono setting will not work. You need what is called a line amplifier for that use. But for a 100 foot run from a CD player or such you may not need anything. Try it without it first.
If you're meaning does it have an aux input as well as a phono input, yes it does. So you can have one magnetic cartridge (MM) phono and one high level device (like a CD player, tape, iPod etc.) connected. And it's output goes into a high-level input, such as an aux input on an amplifier. It is designed to provide a phono preamp for amps or receivers that don't have one. Nice thing is with the switch, you don't lose that input for another device too.
I use it on my 50mm 1.8 canon
A T3 is a model 600. If you have a lens that has a 52 or 58 mm size, this fits on that like a haze filter
No this is not for the nano. Search for isnug nano. That is the correct one.
There are other q/a responses from owners of 70" TVs - mostly Sharp, I think - so it's not impossible to mount a 70" TV. The question is the spacing of the mounting holes in the Sharp TV. Check the spacing pattern. I remember at least one reviewer with a smaller (60") TV that said the mounting holes on his TV were too far apart. Check the location of the mounting holes and how far apart they are (top-to-bottom as well as left-to-right)
Check with Epson as mine came with a nice case and they might still offer them.

Yes you can but make sure the converter is not covered or hidden as it will heat up and need proper air flow to ventilate. I have been using them for few years no issues.
Try a COMPLETE reformat then see if it works...
Depends, I only used it for a laptop with no problem but an iron would be different. just feel how hot it is , if in doubt.
Yes
Yes, make sure you buy matching pairs and don't exceed 2.0 Gig
ECC. Is made for Servers. You can't MiX
If your computer is a Dell 8100/8200 this RDRAM [RAMBUS] will work. I suggest you purchase these 2 sticks, 2x512, to achieve your goal of 1GB memory. If your computer is something other than the previously mentioned, you will have to supply more information to determine the specific RAM you will need.
You should be able to do this, but why would you want to? Focusing would be difficult and it will drastically reduce the amount of light getting through the lenses. Then there is the increased motion factor.
I am not exactly sure of the TacShot. The first pistol grip I bought had a broken latch which the seller sent another one within a few days. I've been very happy with the product.
es provided it has the 1/4 inch attaching screw.
The legs are much stiffer than I thought, larger too. You are probably safe up to 5lbs, maybe even more. The tripod dwarfed my point-and-shoot Nikon Coolpix. Warning: the more you use it, the more flexible and less sturdy the ball-and-socket joints get.
sigma recently came out with 17-70 version which has a C mark on it. its a good walk around woiyth f2.8 to 4. IS or OS is a good thing and its a personal decision. I have always preferred them as sometimes you forget to hold your breath for that magic moment which may not be as crisp otherwise.
EF-S mount.
No the lens is definitely an Alpha only mount. There may be some adapters you can use to mount A-mount lenses on E-mount cameras. I believe the Carl Zeiss line may have a lens with similar properties coming out soon.
Yes. It can swivel up to 90 degrees angle.
You could get a line conditioner to protect against brown outs, UPS's generally have that feature as well. I have a LC2400 from Tripp lite that works wonders to keep my computer going even when the voltage changes
Hi. This unit has 330V clamping voltage.
Has 3 line AC protection (3rd prong for "grounding"); cord is also 14 gauge heavy duty. In addition provides surge protection for telephone/fax line. (Note: my information shows a newer model, costs slightly more. Have no knowledge of newer one except is available.)
Or I could wait for a player that can play both Blu-Ray and HD DVDs.
There are about six increments of backlight intensity to select from, including completely off.
You would have to use the aux wire in order to use it but it does work hope this helps
yes, more about the lens than camera, just make sure you get nikon mount
Yes. The tubes (Nikon mount) are designed to be compatible with any lens that can be used on modern Nikon cameras. I can use mine on both a full frame D800 and a DX 7000 camera. Any lens.
18 inches use an extender cable if you need more length .
No it will not, you need separate connection for a 5.1 system. You either need a high end laptop with the yellow/green/black connectors or a desktop with a sound card or built in sound card. If you have a Dell 630 your only option is to get external sound would be to go with a system that connects though USB.
Walmart walgreens anyone that sells batteries
Muguelisk, I have no idea if it works with your model. I did not with mine
Does it work for XP to Windows 7?
I am not aware of a box made specifically for these sleeves. I was lucky and found some plastic storage bins just the right size. I found them at Lowe's. You might try the Conltainer Store. If there is not one close to you then they have a website. You might also look on Amazon!!! One last suggestion: resize a cardboard box to the sleeves dimensions and cover it with stickon shelf paper. I also thought of another solution; Go to a used computer store and look for 5 1/4 inch floppy disk boxes.
There are two opposing holes through the base of the unit. The camera is positioned low inside the housing so the 'top side' is flat and will mount flush to the ceiling. I drilled a 3/4" hole through the ceiling to hide the wires. You could install a round electrical box which would provide mounting and hide the wires.
Of course.
It shows a pretty large area. We have it by our IT servers in our office and it shows enough that you can see if anyone is approaching the equipment. Sorry I can't be more specific. It's a good product.
If your tripod has a 1/4" or 3/8" attaching screw.
Number of exposures per roll depends on the camera. 6x6 is 12 67 is 10 etc
No it doesn't
THe film will make foggy pictures if the rolls are more than a few years expired. I've shot with film that are less than a year past exp date with perfect results
No
Yes, fits perfectly
As Obama says - Yes we can. But you must use software that will recognize the device. For that, use ColorHCFR which is freeware.
It only has one port for the bass to come out in the back, so yes this is normal.
I tried it before I could answer you. It can hold 4 cases well, 5 tightly. You might be able to put them side by side but it would be really tight and I don't think 4 would fit that way. Hope this helped.
I use this one for my dog and it's not so good
I am ready to by my ipod touch, but I can wait a while if the new applications are forthcoming. How can we find out?
I'm selling mine! :)
It depends on your ears actually.. To me, and coincidentally for quite a number, the best sound quality has got to be the ipod 5.5 generation (30g or 80g) since they use a better audio chip (Wolfson). I used to have a classic but traded it in for the 5.5 gen. The sound of the 5.5 gen is warmer, more natural, 'acoustical', and has more depth. Listen to big speakers when comparing this generation to ALL other ipods and you'll know what we're talking about. Cheers.
Yes you can add your CD's to your IPOD without the internet. You will need ITunes though. If you have the program already, it's very easy. Go into your preferences under "Edit". Hit the tab for Advanced, than within this section, key on the tab for Importing. In this section is where you tell your computer to copy the songs to ITunes. There are 3 drop-down menus you need to change to allow this. Once there you just move them to your IPOD.
you get all the apple box stuff, and then that's put inside an amazon box
This is complete kit includes inverter and switch.
The two lights connect to an inverter box using a two pin molex plug, the box connects to your mother board using one of the fan 3-4 pin molex ports.
I don't think there is any such thing as "milliamp volts", since volts x amps (or milliamps) = watts (or milliwatts). The package says the current draw is 5.000 milliamps and I believe that rating is at 12 volts. Suffice it to say, the draw is negligible.
The inverter will, but the bulbs are usually placed somewhere on the case exterior. I believe the case you have is about a foot deep, so if you were going for the "street-glow" look, it will work. Careful not to pinch the output wires to the bulbs, they carry about 2000 volts!
It worked fine in my MSI MSI -K9N6PGM2 AQMD mobo. I am going to get some more for some SFF HGP DC5750 units I have. Should be fine
YES! So far, anyway. I love this Yamaha as it turns on immediately not like my Onkyo. The tone is good, too!
Sorry, But i live in Chile. the warranty is not possible here. I only can say that this product is so good. sound is crispy and clean, and mechanism is silent. See you!.
on the belt clip, the little circle piece unscrews and you just stick it into the small hole in the back of the case and rescrew the two pieces back together.
yes it is.
Same combination I have in my f150 2005. Yes, will work with no problem.
Once installed this accepts a standard single DIN head unit.
It fit my car 2005 mountaineer.
I am sorry I have a Z130. It works great with mine in a 2003 Ford Explorer. Good luck. Update 03-08-2014: I did some work on my system today and I do not have the back support installed.
Yep. I bought the 2008 RTX and the hookups are the same.
If you are trying to install an after market radio and this is the reason that you need this particular item I would check with a professional first, like best buy or an installer. I would not know if it will work for your car or not. Sorry couldn't be more help
I'm not sure. If you go to Axxess' website you can look up application. It will be more accurrate than amazon. Then you can come back to amazon with the part number and order.
Yes. And they stay in place while viewing. The sometimes screw back down when you wear around neck.
I don't have a D7000 but my D90 and a D7100 worked correctly first time.
Yes it comes with two stands for rear speakers. One bit of caution my sub woofer already gave out. Very disappointing.
6"x3 1/2"
it needs electric
1 AAA
I think so I have a 5900 and it works
It comes with a cable that allows the shuffle to be plugged to the back of the dock station. System will not charge the shuffle however.
Do you mean galaxy? Yes it will. But I wouldn't recommend it, it's poorly constructed, and the push button started to fail after only two weeks of light use. The RF limited CR 577 Power mic with the tone control sounds much better.
Not familiar with that radio, but if it has a four pin mic connector it should work...otherwise you will have to have the plug on the radio changed to suit or vise versa.
I found that it worked for both my Canon Digital Rebel and also for my Flip video camera. The screw size (1/4) was compatible with both devices and the tripod had no issue holding up the Rebel. It's a bit overkill for the Flip, but it works!
Yes
I have had the same problem among others. Don't know why, but if you find out, I'd like to know!
This coverter WILL NOT WORK for a 110- 120 volt TV. If the TV is designed to run on 12 volts, or 9 volts and draws less than 2 amps, then yes.( it should do the Job)
It is anchored to wall, but should be able to get lights there
No, the Pelican Model 1495 does not have a built-in lock that utilizes keys. Instead, it has a built-in, three-digit-roller combination lock that you can set with your own, personalized, easy-to-remember, three-digit combination. Though, if you wanted to add one or two actual hanging key locks, you could easily do that as there are two places where you can.
see KenRockwell.com He has good reccomendations for this issue.
No
It works quite well with my 5100.
If you buy this kit to replace your original stereo then the black and gray plugs that went into your original will fit perfectly into the wiring harness they give you, then all you do is match the wires (which if i remember correctly are labeled) to your new radio's wiring harness and twist them together (and if your like me go overboard with the electrical tape to make sure there is not possible way the different wires will ever touch). hope that answers your question.
Yes, it fits your truck! It goes where the factory equalizer would be (to the upper right of the steering wheel).
it's black
It has an internal, rechargeable battery.
it never worked for us
you run a bead of cleaning fluid on the leading edge of brush, the with record on flat non scratch surface run the brush in circular fashion with the record grooves and turn the brush tiny bit as you go. You'll pick up lint buried in the grooves. Wipe brush clean repeat until both side shinny finger print free and clean.
Yes, you'll also need an eyepiece tube that threads into the T-mount. Most of the eyepiece tube adapters are 1.25" in diameter so they will fit most telescopes. Your Meade 8", I believe, comes standard with an 1.25" eyepiece holder. An example of an adapter on Amazon is at the following http://www.amazon.com/Celestron-93625-Universal-1-25-inch-T-Adapter/dp/B0000665V6/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1407169896&sr=8-2&keywords=t+mount+canon . There are several to choose from, but this will give you a start. Have fun with the Astrophotography.
Yancy, you need to buy a phono pre amp. They boost the signal to line level. gerard masters
The end of the transducer cable is female. I know because I needed an extension and matching the pins to the cable was tough. If not perfectly straight the pins bend and had to be straightened
Two speakers. They sound very good. You will not be disappointed at all
Yes. Been using it at work with Raspberry Pi running raspbian for over a year. I use it to power a belkin wifi adapter, thumb drive, and mouse/keyboard.
Input: 100-240V 50/60 Hz 0.18-0.105A 18-25.2VA Output: 8.4V 0.9A
Elantra the body did
Oops. I had put yes. I'm not exactly sure but it should fit
It will fit any hot shoe
Actually, this will probably fin ANY Hot Shoe since they are designed to take all makes and models of flash or attachment. May not match the body color but no one will notice except you.
Yes. The "pros" will tell you that any additional layer of glass can add distortion and reflection, but I leave a filter on all the time to protect that expensive lens from dirt, dings, fingerprints, etc. Many of today's filters are so well made with multi-coating and high tolerances that I doubt even the experts can tell a difference in 99% of photos. Years ago, so called UV filters added a hint of pink to fight UV. That is no longer the case.
I have screwed other filters onto another Hoya. Also the polarizing filter. Very happy with the product.
Inside is bright orange. I have no idea if my Panasonic Lumix is similar in size to your Sony WX350. The case is roomy for my Lumix and USB cable and one extra card.
I use it with the Sony RX100 and it fits perfectly. If the specs are similar, it should work well. The RX100 doesn't have room to spare, though--it's a comfortable but snug fit. Hope this helps!
have you got an answer yet? I'm also in teh same position and i get no answer.
just purchase the Ram elsewhere and do it yourself. It's very easy to install. Amazon only sells the pre-configured units from apple.
We used a PC and this Mac the Mac was much better. Much more simplistic and apple has a superior product.
just purchase the Ram elsewhere and do it yourself. It's very easy to install. Amazon only sells the pre-configured units from apple.
No. I ordered it for my Olympus Stylus 1 as it would appear to fit well based on the advertised dimensions. However, it absolutely won't fit as the advertised dimensions are exterior dimensions. With the significant amount of padding, it is way too small. I am very disappointed.
Take camera to store wjen Take ca.era to store when you get csrd to be sure
I did not find it on PNY's website here is the link tho, if you email them they may be able to send out a PDF or something...http://www3.pny.com/4GB-Performance-SDHC-Class-4-P2113C476.aspx I know it looks different than the one they show online, but the size and class are the same so they should be very close
Sorry, but I don't know.
Yes it will, and it works great!! With the blue tooth adapter I cannot say.. Cass
Yes, since utube is internet, it supports it and other internet based videos. It cannot be updated to windows XP or 7 since it is a Mac based computer it is a mac platform. In order to add a pc platform you would need to install a virtual pc program and then load windows into it. To do both mac and pc, you need a much more powerful computer for 2 platforms that are quite different. This is a great intro mac, but if you want a pc (Windows platform) you need to buy a pc.
Replace the battery...
I couldn't get this to install on Win 7 64 bits at all. Ultimately, I returned this for a similar product from a different manufacturer which worked just fine.
Yes, this will work well for your application.
No
Its okay really but an amp would help for sure.
Yes, it will charge any AA or AAA sized NiMH or NiCad rechargeable battery.
Best way to find what memory you need is to go to crucial.com and use their system scanner.
I have the mid 2007 iMac. It's very easy for me to install the memory, and I noticed the speed increased.
Raymond, this item will not fit your ThinkCenter. You need full sized RAM, not the smaller laptop sized modules. hope this helps!
As long as your notebook can take a PC2-5300 memory card, the 2 GB should work. If you have Windows XP or higher, adding the extra 1 gb. of memory should help increase the notebooks overall speed. That would be especially true if you have vista or Windows 7. I believe Windows Vista and 7 require a minimum of 2 GB of RAM. Hope that answers your question Lou
I put mine into an x60 Thinkpad, but I'd check X41 specs on Lenovo's website to be sure.
The Inspiron line is not listed in the description, but it is for an ATX, if your Dell PC has that form then check the dimension of the product (on the product description page) against the one you have to see if it fits.
The clip on this mount would hold a GPS that is 3 1/4 high. Your GPS would need indentations on both the top and bottom to be able to snap into the clip.
I don't think so. It connects with a regular phone type plug.
If you mean a cord with Quick Connect on one end and RJ9 (smaller than typical phone cord) on other side. Then that depends on your phone. This has the Quick Connect on the end so you will need what ever adapter connection your phone has (USB, RJ9, etc).
Plantronics has good tech support 1-800-544-4660
Mine was a remanufactured unit, but the seller sent a replacement without any question.
Yes itwill. any manufacturer that makes leses for Canon can be used with this dapter/extender. Also, with the glass element, some lenses allow you to use either auto, or manual modes. Attachy to the T3i, attach lens, and you ae ready to go. Hope this helps.
Yes, but overall I'm not happy with it. Edges blur. Not what I thought it would be
not sure i went to crutchfield.com to double check this did have everything to hook up all the stuff in my 02 navigator
Yes, actually the layout of control and shift are very good, on the center pads. The two complaints about key layout are the ~ location is very counter intuitive for me. (it where left control would normally be). The Insert key is acccessed by the keypad toggle, which is annoying for ctrl-alt-ins, for vmware virtual machines. With that said they kes are trivially remappable. The keyboard height is taller than a standard keyboard, and won't push under my desk on the keyboard tray. I own two of these now.
I haven't received any complaints (or dirty looks) working in a pod of software engineers in an open floor-plan. The Kinesis keyboards are far less noisy than, say, the Das Keyboard or older/re-issued mechanical key-switch keyboards like the IBM model 1. That said, it's slightly more noisy than a standard microsoft or apple keyboard.
nope, no 5.25" square space exists
The VGA quality is related to the clock speed (of both the monitor or TV and the video card). If both these factors are capable and satisfy the resolution you are wanting, this splitter will display images of up to 2048 x 1536 pixels. It only provides a way to boost the existing signal while allowing you to utilize multiple viewing devices. Hope this helps.
Yes
Yes
No they did not. The installation was supposed to be possibly below counter/ console/ car dash using what came with the car and / or what ever it is being installed in. That's what I was told at the time; so I used them anyway.
First of all it says that it will charge your ipod but in all actualty it's doesn't charge at all
Yes.. Works great
Its a long range UHF antenna.
I live 30-40 miles away from Seattle and I get good reception with it mounted inside the attic. Seahawks look AWESOME!!
That is just an informational piece of paper. The actual disk has nothing printed on it. The top has a shiny surface designed for thermal printing (as in "Prints with Rimage Prism, (Google that one!!) Paper Labels and Screen Print") The disks themselves are about the best you can get, but you probably have read most of the reviews and already know that. Don't worry about the special "Thermal Print" requirements, just use a Sharpie Magic Marker and remember to burn slow. Have a great holiday season!
Could you please explain in more detail. Are you trying to say you would like to use this item to connect via Wi-Fi? If so, then no, you cannot do that with this item, this item is just a switch. What you need is a Wireless Router.
I tried with clean vista installation. You can edit the audio track only. Technically you can edit if you have the right codec. But I Goolged a lot and nobody seems to be able to do it with Microsoft Movie maker or other free video editor.
It is. Cnet reports that it isn't, as does the best buy comparison, but it is. The one touch dvd burn works like a dream and the editing software that comes with it includes a vista patch on the installation disc.
NO, this drive is for 3.5 Stiffy Disks only. (5.25 disks need a special computer card that couples via a USB cable and an old 5.25 drive with an old PC power supply to drive it)
Absolutely. Any light meter works with any and every camera. It gives you a setting for you to use in manual mode. Depending on what and how you shoot, a L-758 meter may be a bit of overkill, though.
The typical recording time is 45-55 minutes and typical playback time is 105-135 minutes, each with a fully charged battery, so the actual depends on the mix of recording vs. playback which you actually do. My guess is that most users will get an actual total probably closer to 1 hour or less per full charge.
No, it onl;y shoots 1080i, but all you will need to do is deinterlace the source when editing, which will in turm make it 720P.
You need to buy the MPEG 2 codec from Apple's web site to be able to read the files created by this camera in iMovie, etc. I think it costs about $20.
Yes they are dual coil and 4 ohm very nice woofers
the price is for just one
i had to order a charger from the internet. sony has a charger that recharges batteries i do know if amazon carrys this charger,
No
Sorry - this is not a reply...I just want to know the same thing. I'm in the process of buying both a Macbook and the Sony DSW55, and it's important they get along great! Does anybody know otherwise? Please let me know before I order!!!
HollyLime: Yes it does. On the upper right side of the camera, notice a plastic cover. Unsnap it and you will see three ports: AV MIC and DV. DV is your firwire port, aka ieee 1394.
I asked a sales rep at Best Buy about this camera and he told me Sony was discontiuing this camera. Which to be honest is a load of hooey! Not only that but they seem to be out of almost all of their sony products. Maybe they aren't going to carry Sony anymore... Who knows? Best Buy doesn't carry it but Ciruit City does and that's just how it goes sometimes with electronics... they don't carry all the same models and brands of items. This gives the customers more of a variety of products at their disposal.
It comes with a firewire cable (mini connectors) and an audio/video out cable (mono/encoded).
The GS320 works most effectively in NTSC format.
The cables from the KVM to the computers are six feet long. On the other hand, the keyboard, video (monitor), mouse, speaker, and microphone need to use their own cables to plug into the KVM. Note that the cables from the KVM to the computers have a VGA plug and a SINGLE USB plug. Also, there are separate cables for the audio in (mic) and audio out (speaker) for each computer.
I wouldn't think that will work. There is only one 15 pin video connector per input or output. I cant rule out doing a USB to video adapter as monitor 2 and using the usb switch in the KVM, but that sound pretty complicated. they do make dual display KVM-just do a search. This is not a dual display unit.
You can, and I do, use the 30-to-19-pin converter to make it work with the I5, but it's a little awkward because you can't seat it firmly into the base.
I don't mean to start an argument here but, some LCD and Plasma panels are available with refresh rates of 72Hz and even 120Hz, and as far as I know, 60Hz refresh rates are the norm for almost all HDTV's. Also, CRT is the only technology that can display interlaced video as such, "fixed pixel" displays paint their pictures progressively.
Yes. Im using windows with this comp. Working well for me
Yes it does work, but I had to reinstall a second time to get it to work. Not sure why that was. Hope it works for ya on round two.
Hi. Not sure about Xbox One and 360. Never had them before. I think it only works on a PC computer far as I know.
I do not know what "bnc" stands for. But that antenna is the perfect answer to my 1963 McIntosh stereo system.
Probably Walmart or somewhere like that. There is 1 tape included, if you buy the camera from me.
It will available in second week of April. Still long time!
I have had the same problem. I brought it to best Buy and they said I probably need a new battery, but they dont sell them. You have to purchase directly from the manufacturer. Havent done it yet, but I am about to now
Any miniDV camera will work, so you can buy the cheapest one you can find. Just makes sures its miniDV and that it has a firewire port (most do but some don't)
On your camera screen there is a w button that zooms In and a t button That zooms out.
Very much doubt it, though never tried this. It uses sonar so I doubt it would penetrate.
that's how mine is set up
No, there is no balance control on the remote- just on the front panel of the unit.
Another internet dealer cites one-year, parts & labor.
It Has 2 sets of terminals, the ones pictured and the ones on the opposite side not pictured. I purchased two of these for a small bathroom install and sounds really good, clear and with the right amount of bass.
If you like a clean install in a bathroom drywall (like I did) use the PYLE PVC10ABC bluetooth wall streaming amplifier. Has aux in, SD card and USB input. It's the perfect combo and easy to install.
Like others have said, you need an amplifier to drive the speakers so they are best used hooked to a home theater system or an inline amplifier hooked between the speakers and your TV. Amplifiers built into TVs typically have just enough power to drive the TV's speakers only. Check your TV owner's manual.
These speakers require a power source such as an amplifier. I ended up buying a 3 speaker set from Radio Shack that plugged into the head phone jack on sale for $20 bucks. Sounds and works great. I would suggest something like The bullet which I use for my laptop and phone when I use them for music.
This is the price for the pair and they continue to perform well for me. Can't go wrong for this price!
Probably not. You will have to put an amplifier between your bluetooth receptor and the speakers
I've owned these for almost 4 years and they are more than appropriate for a 5.1 surround. I've used them in a 7.2 surround system as rear high, front high, side high, and rear low. they deliver man. Buy em. You won't regret it.
I am not aware, as my 2006 Honda Civic car did not had any screen or monitor. If you monitor or car music system has AV input, then you can connect this back up camera. For my Civic i had ordered rear view mirror with monitor. Hope this helps.
Well it does, but not in the camera. The date can be stamped on your digital camera images by enabling the add text feature within the provided FinePix Viewer software." Anyway, I believe the best way to add a personalized time stamp is through the software Gena PhotoStamper. It will place a reversible date stamp in a large directory of photos in a minute. It is free for 30 days without registration. You can download it at www.download.com.
Yes it will. Fits my Mk2 Perfectly. No place for anything else though. Managed to squeeze a spare battery in the pouch but is a bit too snug.
Hi Zuquim, this Sony LCSCSQ carrying case are for Sony Cybershot. You may try to check on this: Sony LCS-X20. This one works on your Sony Action cam AS100. -Ely
Imsorry i Cant help you my sony handycam is a model HDR XR100 but this battwry works well with it
Sorry I'm not sure about the compatibility side! I never purchased the quick charger I just use the factory supplied cord for the hd disc video camera with battery still docked in camera and it only takes about 30mins or so and last a long time ill put it this way the small blu ray disc are able to burn 45mins hd and I do 2 of them with no problem! Ive had the batt 3yrs with no issues. I hope that I helped you and sorry for the late reply! Regards,Pete.e
Depends on your sound card. There are FAQ on the audio-technica.com website that explain this. Ideally you have a full-duplex sound card and then you should be able to listen while you record.
This required plugging into the wall, as all the 10" ones I have seen. Mine came with a remote.
All you need is a hole in the drywall the size of the speaker and about an inch clearance all around the hole for the speaker-hook-grab-arms to swing out the pull on the inside of the drywall for the secure mount. i.e. can't install upagainst a stud. ---Dale
The security plus license includes unlimited users; it will replace but increase your existing license.
I have this device attached to my Samsung flat screen tv which controls sound for my vhs and dvd players. It was a simple matter to attach it to the tv audio output and it then works with the vhs, dvd and tv. I'm not at all "technical" but the instructions were clear and easy to accomplish. The devise provides great sound for me and I've had no trouble with any kind of interference. Bev B
No problem. They can listen at their level and you can set yours to the level you prefer. CF
7" wide x 7" deep x 10 3/4" tall
Yes, it does come with a shoulder strap.
It should fit the camera along with attached 50mm prime. I'm having a 18-200 lens most of the time attached with my Sony a57 that I carry using the bag.
not at all; this is only good for video output, and predates HDMI which carries sound as well as video. You must have the sound carried by another source such as a sound card output from the computer for example.
You looking for a DMS-59 to VGA or DVI
yahoo mess does not work for nokia n800. u have to download pidgin from here http://www.pidgin.im/ which will then see other messengers' contacts.
absolutley - you could even make it two 16gb cards!
Yes. But if you are asking if the difference is like VHS versus DVD, then no.
I think it is a unisex bag. I really love it, has lots of compartment room too.
make sure you take the 5'' cap off (and not just the 1 1/2'') the front of the telescope , make sure you have both caps off of the EYE piece , use the largest eye piece (32mm) and point it at the brightest star you can find
I assume you are asking about the orion scope vs the celestron scope? I've no experience with the orion st, there's a comparison on cloudy nights' user forum. There is a lot of info there. I beive that is where I found a write up on what to expect from various size optics and focal lengths. I'm still happy with the astromaster. It has pretty good optics, but as many people have pointed out, the mount is a little flimsy.
This is for celestrial AND terrestrial viewing. yes, you can look at the whales. And yes, you can view the beautiful night sky:D
You can see Jupiter and if you're in the right place, Mars and Venus. You will need to purchase the lens expansion pack to get good detail on either, but the expansion should also let you get some pretty good views of Saturn and its rings.
Yes. I have the same computer and put one of these in it. It will make a big difference in performance overall. This is the fastest P4 that you can get. Put this in and get as much ram as the 4600 will take(4 or 8gigs I cant remember). These old processors are still good ones.
The units are selling fast. My local Apple store was completely sold out when I went to get one. They said they received a dozen or so in and were all sold in a day or two. They told me to check back soon as they receive new shipments daily. I went back a few days latter and they had dozens of them on the shelf.
Yes, you can switch modes on the unit between the two to read from the transducer or the wireless
Yes the dual view is used on all of the hummingbirds. It's a quick install and they send you plenty of cord. 20' cord and all you have to do is plug it straight in to the already existing port
nope. with these flash mp3 players you really should buy the 2 year coverage for 20 dollars. if you buy an ipod or microsoft zune that battery will be replacable. that is why they cost double.
You can charge the sansa view and with speaker docks using the Altec Lansing inMotion iM413 Portable Audio System for Sansa.
Thanks for your question! According to a suppliers website this lens is compatible with the Canon Rebel EOS T5i. I hope this helps!
Yes, that is my current receiver, works great
Don't think Easy Share is working any longer.
It plugs into the audio outlet - very easy to do.
Shouldn't really matter, but don't get ripped off buying a $60 cable from the local electronics store; you can get one that does that same thing for $20 or less.
Hold onto the headband with one hand and pull down in each ear piece with the other; it does take a little bit of effort. Each ear piece adjusts down about 3" or so.
The only other thing I would check are the volume knobs on the side of the earpieces. If that doesn't work then I think you may have a faulty pair.
? I have these M-Audio for over many years and they are the best no trouble at all.
It doesn't fit. You can only clip it to the strap. Griffin should stop selling it as a strap for the shuffle as it only fits the first generation.
Hi Carol, CD Walkman, model DEJ017CK, may use AA batteries, both rechargeable and non-rechargeable. When using rechargeable batteries, you will need to use an external battery charger. Vincent
read the manual, front to back. read everything. you should be an expert when you're done. if not, come back and i'll try to help you if i can.
I suggest the vc200w just to make sure you have spare amperage,but yes!
same battery... CGA-S007....... think TZ1 is a little bigger than TZ3 are you upgrading to the TZ3 from TZ1? have you looked at the new TZ5?
I don't think it has enough power going out. I bought this product to use with my X box 360 in Thailand and it didnt work. I work ask someone who know about wattage.
Hi, If the card you buy has the Mio program on it, then all you have to do is change cards. If it doesn't, then you have to load the map(s) into the 'map' folder. I have a back-up SD card for safety, then I just put the maps I want to use into the Map folder on the card I use. You can download a lot of Mio maps for free if you look around for them on the web. Hope this helps
Same camera... 7.2 MP and 12X Optical Zoom
I would say no. You would need something solid to screw to.
Sorry, used screens do not come with the 2 year warranty. They fall under whatever return policy Amazon has. Also, I don't know if you can pick up directly from an Amazon warehouse, but I don't think so. It is possible to will call a screen if purchased directly from Elite Screens
Made in China
Power = Volts x Amps... So 300 is more than enough. Personally I bought the 500 Watt version because I use it for many things
Yes this will be exactly what you need. We will be travelling back to Oz and NZ that's why we bought this product all the NZ stuff we have here in America we use it to step up to 240volts. When we return all the American bought electrical goods we will step down to 110 volts. We do not have anything that needs more than 500 amps.
This camera does not have interchangeable lenses. However, this camera does have threads on the lens that would allow you to use filters and attachments, so you might be able to find an adaptor that would help you get the effect you need. Hope that helps.
I would not do it, at all.
I believe that's the length of the case. You can find exact dimensions on the Elite Screens website.
Has a standard 110V plug :)
Sorry but I believe it does not; 110 only.
Don't leave the screen down to air out if its in a place that could be reached by kids or anyone who would mess with it. If you can safely leave it down 24 hours should be all it takes. I could not and the smell was reduced after a week of using a couple hours a day and gone after two weeks.
I do not understand H. Cothran's post -- North Americans get the cassette player?? I thought it was just the opposite...
What item are you talking about? I may be able to help but don't know what you're asking about.
I love this little camera! I'm still learning how to use it. I find that best picture quality is 5M Fine. Last night I took pictures at a party using the Best shot Party option and the pictures came out great. Play with the Best shot options then override them.
You need to play with the controls to learn them or check the detailed manual on the CD that came with your camera or online at the below link. You can turn up the sound. The sound recording I get with my videos is surprisingly good & in no way too low. Manual to learn how to change settings is here: http://ftp.casio.co.jp/pub/world_manual/qv/en/EXZ1050_DI_e.pdf
I called Toshiba about this and was told it's just a market difference. The TVs are the same, the models just vary in each market. I guess online retailers just mix up the models.
Gave trhis as present around x-mas 2007. Found out recently that unit went belly up and has been at the "service" center for about 4 months. Chose this because of reviews but seems that there is an inherent defect according to service center. Pc. of Junk. Gave away a problem instead of gift. What a fiasco. Stay away Toshiba. Have various SONYs. Decades without problems.
It will not run them at the same time but it will work for one at a time.
No. It converts 110V-&gt;220V or 200-240V-&gt;110V AC. It doesn't take 12V DC (or 24V DC sometimes) that car electric system uses. Look for a so-called car inverter.
Hey bro, as im in Australia using this tranny I had to buy a travel adapter outlet to be able to plug it in at home. So are you able to do that..??
I have used it for electronics like a TV where its not in constant service. If using with a motorized appliance like a refrigerator I would suggest getting one with 1/3 wattage above demand use. Like a refrigerator that is listed at 1000 Watts use hook it up to a 1500 Watts converter.
Removing the Pedestal Stand: 1. Carefully lay the front of the unit face down on a flat,cushioned surface such as a quilt or blanket. Leave the stand protruding over the edge of the surface. Extreme care should be used when removing the stand. Remove the Jack pack cover on the back of the TV to expose the pedestal stand screws. The Jack Panel cover can be removed without tools. Remove the five screws. This will allow removal of the pedestal stand by sliding the pedestal stand away from the TV.
V 2000W model should be ok
You can but as I recall you can only do it through the FireWire port and then when you finalize the disc you can play the movies back on a regular DVD player
I use mine on my iPhone 5S when shooting video. Its mono only but it is way better audio than without it. It's also small and you can keep it in your pocket so you will use it a lot. There is an adage that the best camera or video camera is the one in your pocket when you need it. The same applies to this little microphone. Get it.
Yes, Philips DVP3340V DVD VCR I have came with a remote and works very well with Philips DVP3340V DVD VCR Combo.
You can not view 1080p divx or xvid by this machine. any of 59 series. I own 5980/12. it's the chipset it has: Zoran Vaddis 7 (778) see the manufacturer's spec sheet: http://img65.exs.cx/img65/7866/zoranvaddis7spec1pq.gif ps: copy paste the URL to address bar and click "go".
Nope, just bought one. My tv is avi hdtv so have to get the adapter cable. Would be hard for phillips to supply a 30 dollar plus cable with ever dvd player for every type of set up. so only rca type composite cables are supplied.
No
I'm pretty sure you can.. but I suggest bluetooth headset or turtle beach...
no, I did not but it does have issues on Sound.
These will work in fresh or saltwater aquariums
1.25
I wouldn't recommend running with no deck...I tried it And didn't have great sound so I ended up getting a clarion m303 and its like night and day difference. In regards to the cables, this amp came with no cables. Refer to the owners manual for the required cables. For my setup with the amp connected to the clarion deck and 4 6x9s I had to purchase ground, power and amp signal wires And speaker wires and 2 sets of rca
I just got off the phone with Samsung. The only difference between the two models is that the 5087SAX model is made in the U.S.
All HDTVs have the same quality through SD. You'll be able to see the broadcast but not clearly. If you go to a friend's house that has an HDTV broadcasting SD and go to another place with HDTV and SD, you'll see it's basically the same, pixelated quality. Hope this helps. It's not all that bad though but it's definitely not worth getting an HDTV if you plan to use only SD. You can try this out. Good luck!
Well I heard two things about that. First the HLT5687S had a halo issue on some of the model and it looks like that is fixed in the HTL5687SAX. Second I heard that the HLT5687SAX is manufactured in America. Don't know if thats true or not.
I'm having the same problem and it's intermitent. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. When it doesn't work, I have to turn the TV on and off several times and then it will work. Then sometimes the TV just turns on by itself. We have a Samsung technician coming tomorrow to check it out - hopefully I can post the solution...
Unplug overnight and try the next morning- If that doesn't work then you are affected by the class action settlement problem. Www.samsung.com/us/capacitor settlement/
It takes 6 numbers
18 watts per channel RMS (continuous) @ 1% THD into 4 ohms, x4, 72 watts total RMS.
I'm assuming that you mean the electrical adapter for the speaker. On the bottom of the AC Adapter it says that it has an output: DC 9 Volt 100mA. You might find one here on Amazon or possibly at Radio Shack. I looked at my manual and there is no company name or address. Good Luck.
I can't notice it on mine unless the input is a completely black image.
Not sure for an Xbox, but for my PS3, I bought a coaxial digital cable, optical cable, and a optical to coaxial converter. Use these the optical from the PS3, connect to the converter, then connect the coaxial to the converter and to the PS3. I think it's the same process for the Xbox 360 but I'm not entirely sure.
The info states that the max capacity is 11.02lb.
Both. friends
I'm not sure why that would happen. Have you tried using an input other than S-video? I have never had much success with that type of input choice. Can you use HDMI or RCA?
I bought this battery, it did not fit.
Haven't a clue, I am just a camcorder owner.
I don't know, but at less than $4.00 can you really go wrong. I would just try it, because these should be complient for all DV600 series laptop computers. I have an old DV6446us, and it worked just fine for my old laptop. Now if I could just stop loosing them, I would be doing just great. I don't know if this will help you or not.
I never had it full. I had it for one year and it stopped working within that time.
If you have a cable box from Timer Warner, you should be fine. The cable box will act as your tuner. You only need a tuner in your vcr if you DONT have a cable box.
Rudy, yes I have the manual for this item. I can copy any pages you'd like and send them to you. Or as the previous person suggested, which is probably the best answer, go to sony.com and get the manual yourself.
sears does have this set on sale in the ad that came in 12/27/07 newspaper $799.00 and as someone else posted take ad to cc or most chain stores and get the extra 10% off they gurantee.
I really can't say. My printer is a HP CP1525nw and it works great. You might want to check with Crucial.com. They have always had a chart of compatibility that displays what will work with what.
no
Jon, I don't know how big the 5gb model is. I tried to find a picture of it on the internet, but only came up with the 2gb Shuffle, which is what I have. This armband fits the 1 1/4" square model only. It had a small Velcro closure to hold it securely in it's little pocket. The Shuffle is about 1/4" thick, but there is room in the pocket for expanding a little more. I hope this helps.
Yes
No. The device, in effect, is an external graphics card. The only way to upgrade graphics performance on a laptop is to get a new laptop.
I/O shield , CD driver and cables ship with the motherboard
Get Eneloop or Rayovac Recharegable Hybrid Batteries which preserves charge for long periods of time. Extremely slow self-discharge rate maintains 85 percent of capacity after 1 year of storage.
Yes this is the same battery. In the description for this battery it states that it can be used for a Powershot SD 970.
charger battery strap manual program CD
Not sure what you mean by specific device for HD movie transfer. The movies in "HD" mode are 1280x720 at 30 frames per second. There's plenty of programs out there that will take said file and put it in proper 480p file that works great for DVD playback. Of course your sacrificing quality, DVD video is a lower resolution than what the Canon TX1 takes.
Absolutely ~ no problem
Probably about 3 1/2 inches not verry deep
If you have a Canon Rebel, my first choice would be a 70-300 IS. That will allow you great sports shots without having to carry a tripod. It also has a panning button which allows you to follow your kids as they run and have a clear shot. This one could be good too and it allows wider shots as well.
I wear glasses and this headset comes no where near them! This is the BEST headset Ive ever had and would never switch to something else. Ive had it for awhile now..no wear & tear. Sound is awesome!
According to the Amazon.com page (http://www.amazon.com/Phoenix-Telephoto-Teleconverter-Digital-Cameras/dp/B000NOTWY8/ref=cm_cd_al_qh_dp_t), it will fit the D40, but I have no direct experience. It fits my D3100.
Only a Canon service center can give you that information.
Dramatic increase in corners at f/2.8. Higher resolution. Better bokeh wide open. Improved optics.
appx. 3 inches wide 4 inches depth and 8 inches high. there good speakers by the way!
Does this case fit SD1200IS Cannon Power Shot. It looks like the case I got with camera when purchased?
t is a pack which takes 8 AA batteries. We use rechargeables and would not be able to survive without these units. They help the flash recover quickly without overheating and allow us to finish a job without having to reload. batteries. Great product.
Only a computer unless you use a usb wall plug adapter to make it work in an outlet. Also, I could not get this to sit in the dock as pictured. I think mine was defective.
check for updated firmware on the philips site
Ours turns green and don't know what it is. It was green for three weeks and just yesterday came back in full color. I contacted Samsung after trying everything on my own and they said "it must be some internal parts" and offered to set me up with a repair man. I am still undecided if I am going to try to invest a couple hundred dollars in a repair or get a new TV. This is our third major problem with this TV, so I will probably purchase a different brand TV.
Scott Blanchard, It's likely an internal issue, which would require a professional service call in pretty much every case. Please reach out to the Samsung customer service center to schedule a repair technician to inspect your set. We look forward to assisting you. --Mr. S
Not sure. What I did was use online chat with Crutchfield. Told them what I had and they recommended this product. I have a cd changer with the jbl option and it works great. Good luck.
Yes, this TV supports 1080p via component. This was a selling point for me, because I want to play my X-Box 360 games (Lost Planet) in 1080p.
After the camera has been setup, no PC is required to operate it. The camera works standalone (just needs Internet access)
No. It is only -50 to +50 deg The cam does have Tilt. specs are here http://panasonic.co.jp/pcc/products/en/netwkcam/lineup/bl-c131/spec.html
Yes, I use my E510 with Windows XP with out any problems.
Yes, they will, but you will need an adapter
You cannot go wrong with Olympus 70-300mm. I got it for only $350 and it takes great pictures across the focal range.
Yes, they will, but you will need an adapter
You may want to check out the Garmin Foretrex 101. Sounds like what you are looking for.
I have a 2012 impala. Fits. Hope that helps.
im not 100 % positive but i belive so because the radio seem to be interchangeable........
It works fine with an X120E, your computer should have no issues with this device.
I didn't think there was a 2000 Yaris
yes it is i have installed it in my brothers 2005 Yaris
It fits my 03 Silverado and it's the exact same head mount as your Ave.
No sorry they will not fit a Honda they are only for Chrysler, jeep.
To be honest I'm not sure. I own a 2002 jeep grand Cherokee laredo. I did buy two sets of these because the magnet on my soundstream tarantula series speakers was too deep. Sorry I can't help you out.
I wouldn't know the answer to that question. If I were you I'd contact Geneva directly or a sales rep in your area. I would have suggested calling Design Within Reach, which carried Geneva audio products for some time, but it no longer carries the brand. Sorry I can't be of more assistance.
Yes - I have the camera outside and the receiver inside attached to my TV about 25 feet away
No
yes, it will fit a D-40. it has the focus motor built into the lens , so it will autofocus on your body...I used it on a D-60 with great results. still using the lens on a D-7000. it's sharp and light weight. has the same 52mm thread size as the 18-55 kit lens. ships with a plastic reversible hood
yes it'll amaze you how close you can get with this lense. It seemed like I was never able to get close enough to the action with my 28-80.
Not that I know of it was a genuine Sanus product. Sometimes manufacturers give different sub model numbers to online stores to differentiate them from the same thing sold in another brick and mortar store like Best Buy
Goodness! I didn't put the system up, my wonderful son in law did. I'll ask him and get back to you. We even changed the TV, got a larger one, and it's still doing fine.
Yes, definitely. And with ease. And so nice for walking down very narrow aisles. I love this case. My only wish is that the interior was a single, open space vs tight compartments. Would make it easier to drop things or remove.
The speaker is at an angle in the housing, you need to get a side or 360 degree look to see if the angle is ok for you....
Yes. As long as you have a receiver that does at least 5.1. Plus you need to make sure the inputs for the sub match the inputs for the receiver. Otherwise you may need some adapters to get it to work. I use 4 of these with one center channel being a different Yamaha and it sounds great. My family just visited this weekend and commented about how awesome it was.
Yes works fine on my Windows 8 laptop
I was wondering the same of a USB port for firmware updates.
Just tell everyone that it is 1080p, nobody will know the difference, especially you. This set does accept 1080p input through HDMI.
I'm pretty sure. I tested my laptop with the video and audio. Video was crystal clear. The audio was perfect with no lag and no distortion.
It appears to do this with my Canon Camcorder connected to a microphone mixer with the adapter. It is not true stereo sound.
This is the question I would like answered as well. I have complete hearing loss in my left ear, I'd like to have everything sent to both sides of a pair of headphones, so that I could hear everything with my right ear.
Its a jack
12"w x 14"d x 16"h
I just ordered these for $352 + $8.45 shipping and handling from 365USA who are an Amazon partner site. You can't find them via Amazon directly, but I found them through this site by typing in "shure se530" on google and they come up at the top (paid search) via "GoSale": http://www.gosale.com/4932054/shure-se530-sound-isolating?gclid=CMO8jfynxo4CFRFoYAod0hKDAA This site shows (at the time of this posting) 365USA at the top with the cheapest price, and that link takes you back to Amazon.com. I looked around for any negative ratings on Google etc and couldn't find any. So I hope to get these Tuesday 9/18.
Comes with the correct screws to attach to you pc case
Tom can you be a bit more specific? Fusion radio from a Ford Fusion or a Fusion Marine radio? The antenna has a standard FM automotive antenna male plug.
I installed mine inside the counter of an outdoor kitchen. The counter is composed of concrete fiber board & stone veneer with a granite countertop. I get great FM reception but only fair AM reception. I would imagine it would work fine on an aluminum fishing boat if you mainly listen to FM stations.
It is not powered, it is a passive antenna. Just plug it in and position it where you get the best reception for your application. Good luck
Sure, it should work. It plugs in the back of the radio and grounds itself.
Yes, you can remove the mast.
The mount is the same as an automobile antenna. The antenna position is also adjustable with a screw driver.
I don't know. All I do know is my microphone on my Logitech camera died because I dropped it so I lost the sound. I bought this headset it works great. I'm happy I didn't have to buy a whole new Camera.
According to my research on CNET, the cable length is 8 feet.
It has HDMI in so I don't see why not. If you though realize it would always have to be on whenever you want to see anything using fire tv
Its a push. Go with the one substantially cheaper. Dont consider any surround receiver from another manufacturer.
Hello !! No , none at all !! I just plugged the little connector into a USB port on the side of my monitor , and it was ready to go !! I have bad eyesight , and this has been a blessing for me . I am sure that your mom will love it !!!
Yes, it is compatible with MacBook Air. Thank you AramediA Support Team
The description says 40
Did you ever find an alternative to the BB2001? Funny, I just bought the im600 today, and it still had the slip in it for the BB2001. I would like to buy a subwoofer for it though, so let me know :) That goes for anybody reading this, too!
These speakers are probably all you will need, they increase the clarity across the full audio spectrum. When I was building out my 5.1 home stereo system I started with just these speakers for the first 4 months, and it was great. I added rear, center, and bass b/c I wanted to go the full 9 yards, but in conclusion: just having these speakers will revolutionize your tv experience.
This system does not include a Blu-ray player. It matches the dimensions and aesthetics of Sony's Blu-ray players.
No, it cannot. The remote for this uses infrared, while the PS3 remote uses Bluetooth.
Personally? I've got a Razer Barracuda soundboard with optical output which is why I am looking at a system like this to replace my existing speakers.
This speaker pkg requires a 5.1 or 7.1 amplifier to work. Adding that to your LED will surely enhance the sound quality of your set up. The speakers alone will not.
If you mean the RCA plugs, I don't think so. The connections on the back of my speakers are bare wire connections.
You'll need an amp. Google for more information as I'm not the seller
...with mounting hardware, at your local hardware store. They don't come with anything fixed to the back of them for that, though. I wouldn't with these. You could, though. It's certainly possible. Just nothing built in to do that on these that I have noticed. I put some small rubber bumpers on the corners of the base and have them on my fireplace mantle with a bluetooth Sony stereo, they're terrific. Very solid, nice speakers.
The on screen display (OSD) does not show up for any normal operation. It has to be turned on through the video menu. Once the OSD is turned on you will not be able top watch any video until you turn off the OSD. It is a pin but not too bad.
The stock thermal coating that comes with the coolmaster is as good as arctic silver. No need to purchase arctic silver an $8 savings. The secret is not to use very much, a couple of grain size drops is suffice.
I donated this item to the dump after unpacking it and having similar problems and after hearing the sound quality of this piece of craps. Sorry can't help you.
No, it does not. The iPhone 5 has a lightning connector. The connector on the Samsung Home Theater unit uses the old 30-pin adapter. Theoretically, an adapter (30-pin to lightning) should work- but I haven't tried that, so I'm not sure it would work.
No. There is no line level outputs on this unit to drive speakers directly. This DSP unit is intended to take the output of your factory deck and flatten the signal to allow for aftermarket amplification.
You should contact JL audio for that question or an authorized JL shop
Probably about 13 pounds. According to the HP website, the monitor with the stand weighs 19.8 pounds. I have a stand for a different 19" HP monitor that I believe is comparable (if not identical) to the stand for the W2207 and it weighs about 6 pounds.
Yes, it does come with a CD, but you don't really need the CD for the monitor to function well.
Good question, if you find out let me know. I just put a small reader's digest in front so it won't bother us in the bedroom.
The sound leakage is there, but not at an extreme level, unless he plays really loud. But, considering the isolation performance of those, I doubt he will need to play it real loud. And, even then, it shouldn't create a disturbance that is considerably higher than what you would create by using an ordinary earbud. In any case, this is not an open-back headphone, so there won't be a lot of leakage.
Why have these jumped $100? Yeah, they are discontinued but the replacement model are close to $200 also. What's the deal?
Yes, we used it at morning drop off at school to thank parents for bringing their children to school by giving them a cup of hit chocolate and a cookie. Just don't forget to unplug before it burns with the small amount you will have left after everyone devour it!
What piece is it missing ? I would contact Hamilton Beach and ask them if they will send you out the replacement part .
60 cups equals 480 oz
Yes you can.
iMovie 06, NOT iMovie 08. If you upgraded to iLife '08, don't waste your time or money.
From what I have read, the only difference is the zoom ability and a tripod. This is what I read on another website so I really don't have any conclusive information.
Try this link from their website I bought the Ultra yesterday. http://www.flipvideo.com/products_flip_ultra_specs.II.shtml
I don't think it will be a exact match. I have a 2010 civic LX and the dash is black but the kit I ordered was like a charcoal grey. It was not a exact match but looks good in the car.
It is for 2006 to 2010 Honda Civic, all of them in that year range have the same dash, this dash kit replaces both the standard stereo OEM part and the navigation OEM part.
I don't know what an e250 is but when I got this cord it was as big as an iPhone charger so it didn't work for my Sandisk MP3 player. I got my money back.
Of course. RAW files are just files after all and this is basically just a hard drive with software that transfers files from a memory card to the hard drive.
no, the only output is USB 2.0
We are currently selling this item for $5.80
I do not believe it will... This has a rounded base for the 430ex ii and the sunpak has a square head.
The sensor assembly is not repairable only because the internal components can't be obtained. But the sensor as a complete assembly can be used as a direct replacement for a failed sensor assembly. Just shut off power to the entire unit, disconnect the wiring inside the dual lampholder that is connceted to the sensor assembly, unscrew the sensor assemblyand remove it then install the replacement sensor using a reverse of the removal procedure.
Yes - it's just a glorified card reader. My daughter uses it with my MacBook with no problems. Just drag and drop the files.
where you plug them in is irrelevant, but connecting them to the motherboard is usually preferred. if they're too loud, I suspect vibration against the case. Did you use the included rubber mounting plugs to mount them?
I don't know. My camera is a Coolpix S203.
No. The contacts and current output are different.
The battery I received was most definitely a Nikon one, exactly as pictured.
Yes there is an auxiliary input to which you can connect an external mp3 player. Aleast there was last I checked. :)
Yes it does
Go to rapidtables.com. they have the conversions calculation you need.moo kiwi and
I don't know why not, then again I am not an expert, just a home user.... I would hook them up to different battery posts though...
It is a bit tricky, and it will take both some practice and patience. Included were some instructions, which I found to be helpful. There are also numerous YouTube videos illustrating the proper procedure. It is a matter of both folding and twisting to achieve the original, compact disc. I would suggest that you head over to YouTube and search for "how to fold a light tent" and you should find multiple videos. Hope this helps. Just be patient. You'll figure it out and find it to be easy.
Yes, I use it for small items. There are two different sized tents. The lights are good too.
hey, Cal! ..Love my Paradigm studio 60's, love my Paradigm centers, but as much as I love the Polk 505 sub in my larger living room, the Polk psw 111 is probably one of the best value's in audio today. Tight, accurate bass, no plosives and no listener fatique. It is just spectacular with music. No knock on Paradigm , they are a great company...but after 40 years in the entertainment industry, I gotta tell ya, there are some speakers that do rise above their price tag-this is one!
The one I bought will only run on 110V. 60 htz. But, in looking at the availability of 220 v 50 htz. models, I see Polk makes them. Even the manual is written in 6 languages. I don't know if this helps. Polk makes them, but maybe Amazon doesn't sell them. I'd recommend looking at Polk's web site, or retailers web sites like B&H photo, Crutchfield, New Egg, Best buy. Etc.
Use a splitter my receiver only has one pre out for my sub so when I placed the order I also got that as well. The splitter was a recommendation when I was looking at the sub and from what I was told when I was looking around it helps with the signal. This sub really hits nice and clean hope this answers the question
I'm moving to Africa soon and I'm in the same situation... I saw this sub in Best Buy and it says on the back 100-240V 50/60Hz so shouldn't be an issue. I want to confirm if the ones supplied by Amazon are the same???
it will charge most usb devices as long as you keep cranking. it won't redirect power from batteries into the usb port.
These speakers sound great. Don't know about fitment.
Brilliantly, sound great.
It should. It works with DirecTV.
I wish I could help. But though it is a lovely unit it would not work on my Telus account. Inquire at your server.
That's for the 6.5 not sure on others they have details if you click on item description 4.0 impedance and I have mine hooked to a punch amp and lowered ohm out put on amp they sound good on bike
Don't know but I can recommend going to Crutchfield.com and enter you vehicle information in the car audio applications app for a list of speakers. Then go find best price.
I don't recall if there was a gasket or not, but I suppose you could make one or use rubber washers when you mount them. I installed them in the doors of my 1997 Miata and they fit perfectly. I just took the door panels loose took out the old speakers, put the new ones in and put the door panels back on. I used the same screens on the doors so the look original. Bada bing bada boom! And they sound great! You'll love them and the price is right and Amazon is the best!
It did for me.. I use mine as my primary Radio... No issues.. Good range, clear reception....
Maybe 5 miles in the sea, with no obstacles. Should be fully charged to extend the range
Hello, Yes Jumbo grames are suppported, MTU 9000 and depending on the OS you can do bonding (Linux), Teamming (Windows) with the 4 ports. Works perfectly.
That sounds like the box. Looks like you need a 6.5 round if you aren't changing the mount, sorry that's the g8. The g6 does have 6x9s.
Lane, if you measure from corner to corner diagonally across the center it measures 5 inches. I hope that is what you were asking.
I do not remember if there was a grill as I installed into 2002 royal star venture that already has its own plastic grill
NO!
it can be pluged it a cigarette lighter for power.
Yes, It has a 2.5 jack, but it isn't a "dock"
For me this thing was junk. Allot of static in the sound and volume switch was bad. Personally now i like the jbl band speakers for listening to music with my cell phone
There are two disks on the back of the main unit. One controls volume and the other controls the bass.
What does No Reader mean?
Yes it should, if in doubt ask someone as Best Buy.
It worked in my 2007 Pontiac Vibe. You can Google the fit guide to double check, but my guess is that it would.
Don't use it cuz it's not gonna work. It's so cheap and so bad product. I really don't think that should be here for sale.
nope i was going to use it for my laptop because the hdtv i bough dose not have a vga but my laptop acer netbook dose so i need help finding something that will work so u can project it to my tv have found something that will help so i can project my laptop to my hdtv vizio
Just plug them in to the head unit. That's what I did for mines and they sound just fine.
You get one pair
I placed an order specifically for SD cards knowing the SDHC cards would not work in my A530 Canon Power Shot digital, however I received SDHC cards, which I returned and received a refund. Cards received did not match cards advertised and ordered. Advertisement needs clarification !!!
Any music device/phone that has auxiliary audio out can be plugged into this through the aux input so you can play basically any device through it. Remote won't work - but it will still play.
H 1 3/8, W 12 5/8, D 11 1/18 (H dose not include plastic bubble for bulb) Yes it was advertised as slim.
No. It uses two standard AA batteries. One could substitute rechargeable double AA 's , but there is no re charger in the camera itself.
Not sure of any limits but we have a 16 in our AX650. Hope this helps
yes it does...just tried it last nite on my dad's acer laptop with vista home premium. I'm having probs on my desktop, with xp. Playing video back in Windows Media Player doesn't work. Audio is high speed...sounds like alvin and the chipmunks
To my knowledge it does but if it doesn't work you can return it .
I am using it on a Toshiba Laptop and is working perfectly. One of the original memory chips failed. I ran the crucial application and made sure what specs their program recommended. The PNY on Amazon was cheaper than crucial.com.
no its been awhile since you posted this but, go with the sony, you wont be able to tell the difference on resolution on a 40"
Yes you can view 4:3 movies with black bars on the sides or you can use 3 types of zoom to fill the screen. also you can use it as a pc monitor in widescreen of fullscreen with black bars ob the sides (1:1 pixel mapping) i got the kdl-40s3000 and it should be the same, only regret on this tv is that the 46" one was too expensive at the time and i had to get the 40".
Yes
Good question, i use it for the same reason. As for its function its a really small scope, so steady hands and good eyes(and patients) are required. It takes a little time to focus it but it does allow you to see when your trichs are ready. For the price its worth it but if you can afford a bigger better quality one i would go with that. The built in light works well though. The over all size of is a little bigger than a large thumb (if that helps at all).
only thing i understand is that they are very good. i have so enjoyed watching ballet with them.
I don't have them with me but they are super light.
They are not real large -- will fit into a medium handbag. Beware -- if you wear glasses they are hard to focus.
You should check the seller return policy process and provide them with a reason for return.
If your going to bury it I would use duct pipe (PVC) to run it through and cap the ends with caulking, that way if you have to replace or move it later you can just pull it out and feed new cable through. I do that with all my cables, speaker wires and low power lines for outdoor trains.
Make sure it has the same audio cable builtin with it. If the specs are the same get the cheaper one. I think it might b a lower guage wire used in the cheaper 1. The cheaper 1 might use 18 guage wire vs 16 guage in the more expensive cable
Yes, I changed mine due to the same reason and it works like new. I suggest you do the same it is very easy to do.
Yes, I just installed it in that exact vehicle.
No, not this particular model; Sony BDP-S301 is the one with HDMI cable included.
And the problem is the same for the BDP S550. Just bought on Thursday and it always display "no disc".
I haven't had any problems with my I,Robot disc since I purchased it when it came out. I also own tyhe BPD-S300..maybe bad disc?
Our headphones work very well for the grandkids, in our 2013 Town & Country Van. They system came with 2 headphones and we have 4 grandchildren, so we needed 2 more sets.
This is Just my opinion it probally will since my phone is a Samsung and it still working
If you're tracking this, M. Gudde, you may want to jump on today's Gold Box deal for the TomTom ONE XL GPS at $99.99, and feature for feature, it's is hard to beat. It comes pre-loaded with maps of he US and Canada, and users can download additional maps onto an SD memory card and install them on their TomTom for navigation almost anywhere in the world. Did a quick check at the TomTom factory outlet site, and they're selling the TomTom ONE XL Refurbished for $159.95 right now. This one probably won't last very long today.
No, they are strictly headphones. The quality of the sound is diminished by the sound of the cord pushing up into the retractable ear piece section. Very annoying.
These 2 items share the same Sony Manual shown as MDR-RF925RK and MDR-RF970RK. I scanned the manual for differences. I found that 970 has noise reduction, 925 does not. Also when fully charged, 925 lasts 20 min longer for every hours which ends up being 4 hours longer on a full charge. Here is the link https://docs.sony.com/release/MDRRF970R_US_FR.pdf
Doing a google search showed ebay as one option. The other was a question listed in sony.com, asking about buying replacement ear pads. Their answer: The Part number for your Earpads are as follows: (the R and RK are the same earphones) EAR PAD (860RX) (RF970RK) 3-198-847-01 Contact our parts and accessories department directly to order. https://servicesales.sel.sony.com/ecom/ ... 1857293684
Answer edited thanks to Alvin's comment... Looks like this is exactly what you want according to what the following site says. http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/Apple_MacBook_MacBook_Pro/Upgrade/Macbook_selector http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/MacBook/DDR2/ http://eshop.macsales.com/item/Other%20World%20Computing/5300DDR2S2GB/
With the mac you are referring to, go online to crucial.com; click the "scan my my computer." It's virus free; and you have a mac so your good anyway...once the program is on your system, run the scan, it will tell you every type of memory that is compatible with your computer. Good luck
Yes it does coz it's powered, meaning it has a power adapter that provides the power to it rather than only through PC or so.
Input: 100-240V, ~50/60Hz, 0.5A. Output: +5V, 2.6A
only bonus is a barometer and a compass. Is it worth it too you? It wasn't to me.
You can but keep in mind the accuracy is not survey quality. Best accuracy I've seen with it is +/- 10 feet.
No, a cable is not included. Frankly, I didn't realize it had an interface until I looked the device over to answer this question.
For accurate elevation, altimeter needs to be calibrated. Try to find a spot where you know the elevation and then go to the altimeter screen and enter that elevation. I believe if you leave it on in the same location for an hour or so that it will "autocalibrate," but I think entering a setting is more accurate. Also possible to enter known barometric pressure if you have that available. Note: This is not a set it and forget it kind of thing.
you load maps using the Garmin software, you must purchase the topo map cd and install it on your pc
Greetings, no it does not come with Pre installed maps.You can buy from amazon, an sd card with the maps you need.I enjoy my Etrex vista, and it is a life line for my Washington state hiking trips.You will love it&gt;GR, Leavenworth Wa
As long as the cable is in good working condition there is no problem.
Most of the dryers are 2-phase 220V. VOD 3000 is a single phase transformer. You cannot use this transformer for the 220V, 2-Phase washing machine.
It may support them (the voltages are not a problem) but it may be a bit iffy in regards to the wattage. An unexpected power spike may well cause the transformer to trip offline. Normally you want to have a little cushion in the rated wattage of the transformer just to ensure it is able to handle modest power spikes.
no it does not
you can not download flash
Absolutely
I just bought, and hooked up the iGo Stowaway Ultra Slim Bluetooth Keyboard and it works perfectly. I purchased this PDA and the stowaway keyboard for grad school as I ride my bicycle to school everyday and didn't want to lug around a laptop. The keyboard fold up to approx 5 inches x 3 inches and when unfolded is the size of a typical laptop keyboard minus the top row of numbers. Bluetooth compatability works great for it and it is very light to throw in a backpack.
You can if you buy pocketmac or missing sync. I have had better results with ppc devices using pocketmac over missing sync. The palm sync built into osx isn't as good as the stand alone software for palm from pocketmac or missing sync.
It's not a factory Dell, it was an imitation but a good one, exact match.
Hi Barbara, that's an excellent question that I wish I had the answer to. But, I could not figure it out, so I gave up on it and the telescope hasn't been used since it was bought. I would honestly invest in a better telescope. When it comes to this, just like everything else...we get what we pay for!!!
It weighs between 7 & 10lbs. It can be broken down & once this performed it can be carried in a suitcase
Negative.
Well I had mine shut off for two days. when I fired it up last night it started playing back the song right in the middle where it was when I had turned it off. It always starts playback where I left off and I have owned it for a week.
Headphones are required.
The base unit is a little black box that doesn't have the tightest seal so I wouldn't put it too close to wet areas. Probably best if you put it in a cupboard or fasten it under something.
yes , each unit i have are on different frequency's
This is a normally "closed" switch, so when power is interrupted you must re-energize the relay with the remote.
I don't know about a signal. We use these to turn on rear LED flood lights on our snow plow trucks. It helps our drivers see what is behind them when they back up.
As long as your provider offers the service. This does not have any impact on your cable box.
Did the same thing. Had to use a variety of tools to stretch it and then pry it out. Ssds are apparently thivked than hhds
I bought it especially for that, and it works great!
I do not know what the leptop you have. On my leptop installing XP and works perfectly.
I put cd onto my laptop and then connect the MP3 player via USB. Then I copy the music from the computers onto the mp3
Yes it does
The battery that came with it lasted about a year. I bought a replacement from my local Mac dealer and it holds it's charge longer, it cost a bit more but worth the extra money.
Yes, I'm pretty sure that it would. It worked well for me.

It was for my nephew so
I'm not sure, this one works on my old xbox360 which is not the newer slim type.
Every time a new operating system comes out, it requires a more powerful CPU and a lot more ram. It might run windows 7. I hate windows 8, and windows Vista was terrible. It will be slow with games. I do not really know. dshollismd
Yes, it will run it with no problem
Not sure? It's mostly used for the big DSLR cameras. All I can say is this, my camera got water damage when I used this rain sleeve. Good price, bad quality.
Look up that model number online and see what remote is offered with that dvd player. I would'nt suggest that you purchase this remote until you do the research. I would make sure that you dont get the wrong remote and have to sacrifice the S&H Cost. I purchesed this remote to controll my aftermarket Pioneer AVH-5000dvd Head unit.
I don't know. I barely used it with the receiver I bought. Sorry
Unless you really need the wider angle of 870. I'd go for the Powershot SD950 IS. It has more pixels and a LARGER SENSOR. Even with more pixels the pixels sites are larger. Larger pixel sites equate to less noise and better low light capability.
Yes, for sure, I would recommend that you aquire an owner's manual, if you don't already have one. By using the dubbing funtion on the remote/machine, you can very easily record dvd's to vhs tapes, and, also vhs tapes to dvd's. Get yourself an owner's manual, online, or at your favorite electronics store, the instructions for these operations are fully explained. I hope this has been some help to you.
Absolutely no. This is the same receiver that I have and it does not work. This is a skimpy little wire and I'd be surprised if it works on anything. Definitely step up and by the Cisco one.
I don't think so 2 is as low as it's rated.
Send back to Eton
Dial it all the way down until it stops buzzing. Then gently turn it up until it just barely buzzes. It takes a light touch to get it just right. It seems to work pretty good. I still occasionally get a false reading but for the most part it is adequate.
the keyboard is fine but the mouse is no good, not easy to use and too big, difficult to navigate
18"x11"x7" in a syrofoam container in a box slightly larger...the design of the container is superior to the design of the microscope,
It should. I'm not aware of any conflicts. I do know it works just fine with a Lenovo tablet when that tablet is working with a Bluetooth keyboard.
No, that picture is a symbolic graphic used to signify a hard drive. that is what the insides look like. a hard drive is a very sensitive device that has to be sealed because the slightest incursion of dust or any foreign material will ruin it. hard drives are manufactured in a sterile, dist free environ.
This was a new hard drive for replacement on a hard drive that went bad. I got my on November 2013. It is working good. No complains, good for the value. I dont know what the original warranty is.
You need to discuss this with the seller. Get the response in writing and save it in case you need warranty service. Other than a manufacturing defect, chances of getting a replacement is slim in most cases, customer abuse being sited as the reason for failure.
I am not a gamer, but the HDD you want to replace is an SATA 2.5 inch. The one you are asking me about, Western Digital Caviar Blue 320 GB Bulk/OEM Hard Drive 3.5 Inch, 8 MB Cache, 7200 RPM SATA II WD3200AAJS, will not fit your PlayStation 3 because it is a 3.5 inch HDD made for a desktop. Any laptop 2.5 inch SATA HDD will work. Just make sure it is a 2.5 inch for a laptop.
U need to make sure that your imac has an atapi interface or that it can be converted to one.
No this is blank disk sealed
If you plug in a 3.0 yes but it won't transfer the speed through the pen drive, even if it is a 3.0 pen drive.
Don't know
If you use WPA encryption only the TiVo branded N router will work I believe. You can find more info on the TiVo Support page by searching for wireless adapters.
It means there is a volume switch on the speaker with two options: normal, or loud.
Yes , It has 2 4"woofers and 2, 4" flat tweeter/mid speakers and it sounds amazing if you use a Quality cable, search for HDMI 1.3a and take a look at the arizona cables, i changed over to them from the el-cheepo"s and never looked back.
bulbs look great but do not last bought two bulbs didn't last but 15 days each 30warrant
I returned it as it did not work in mt JVC
It has a standard 120V AC 2-prong plug and a small switch on the front of the unit to select low, high or off. You can plug it straight to a wall outlet or power strip and control it with the switch or leave it switched on and plug it into your receiver and let your receiver control the unit.
I had the same question. I find it amazing that companies like these still don't find it necessary to develop for Mac computers? Maybe 10 years ago it made sense, but now days with Windows on the way down and Mac looking to be the computer of choice for most consumers, Belkin better fork up the money to support us.
No
Yeah hey need to fix that haha. Though 30fpm would still be an improvement of my old aiptek. I was wondering the same thing about quality until I found this grea review on a blog. It's shows the quality in and out of water. http://www.freevlog.org/index.php/2007/07/10/testing-testing-sanyo-xacti-waterproof-e1-review/ Just got one last night;) hope this helps.
Yes, I've been outside for hours taking video's of my kids sledding. Works great, even after dropping in snow and water.
Go online & search for it, Apple may have some, also try PNY & Crucial
It binds whatever you put in it. You can cut the spine length if necessary which I assume you can do with any spines that are plastic.
This device has worked fine for me under Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04.
I have non POE cameras so I had to purchase POE converter boxes so that I could hook network and power to my existing cameras. However, if the camera is built for POE.....plug and play. I have all 4 POE ports powering 3 security cameras with POE splitters and one POE access point. I have not had to touch the switch for months. Exactly what I wanted and once again, TrendNet delivered at a fraction of the cost!
I dont know
Hi Lisa I saw that it is a lifetime warranty if you buy it from another vender. If you don't hear from the vender contact Amazon. They have always been able to help me with any questions.
Yep. Cat6 can support up to 1GB of Ethernet speeds
Yep, exactly what it is, a refurbish. These drives normally come with a one year warranty, so 180 days shows a rework. The price should determine if you should take a chance with it. Good luck
Yes, It was boxed and padded very well.
No
No. This is not a Bluetooth transmitter its an FM radio transmitter so you can dial into your radio station. You want a 3.5mm to Bluetooth RECIEVER for inside a car on the stereo's aux input, if available (no music to the headset as that is illegal inside a vehicle), or a 3.5mm to Bluetooth TRANSMITTER, for use outside of a vehicle putting music straight to your headset (bypassing the "only calls" function of most Bluetooth ear pieces). Try this
Yeah, I'm waiting for this, too... As soon as it's here, I'm buying (if I don't get impatient & just buy the MacBook Pro somewhere else...).
Minor bumps? 200GB drive rather than 120GB, Penryn processor, multi-touch trackpad, twice the video memory, all for the same price. Wait.
The graphics on the 2.0Ghz model are perfectly fine for your purposes. I have one of these machines and it is excellent for just what you plan to do. Enjoy!
only on Oct 26th
I bought a 24" iMac last night (6th November'07) and Leopard wasn't pre-installed. I got a Leopard disk, and had to do the installation at home, which takes about an hour and half. The installation is a piece of cake, but I wish it came pre-installed.
... if you buy your Apple from Best Buy their warranty (about $30 higher than Apple Care) covers dead pixels and all damage to the outside ... power surges, heat damage, etc. The salesman @ BB was going to work for Apple the next day and gave me this hint about BB's warranty (in home also) extended coverage over Apple Care.
Hi John - yes. All drive caddies are present. I would likely put 1TB (or 2TB if I have any spare) drives (wiped clean) on each one. Pete
Grado
Unfortunately not. Those are powered from the computer itself, these have an external ac port and a speaker plug (3.5mm or whatever the standard is now)
The open top side measures 12 3/4", top to bottom measures 12 1/2". I was pleased with these sleeves. Dan T.
It won't stop the mold from continuing to damage the records. It sounds like you have a moisture issue. These would help keep the cover from getting damp. But I found these sleeves to be average at best. I would look for a different company. Their sizes are all over the place. Good luck
yes
Yes works fine on my nikon D 80
Looks like it should work just fine it seems to meet all the required specs but I would check the original card just to be sure will fit in the same slot.
It will work with Windows 7.
There is no auto shut-off.
Yes... I have a 60'
Yes, it does--it's a small plastic stand that looks like an iPod charging station. You also get a power adapter, which plugs into the stand. So basically you plug the adapter into the stand, stick the camera into its slot, and it charges. There's a little light on the camera which turns green when its all ready to go.
It should; it's offered as an alternate brand to the Sharp
Yes it works. You can send 3 1280x720, 1360x768 and 3 1920x1080 but in 1080 the refresh rate will be 50 Hz. If your tv accept this refresh rate (I think you tv will accept this refresh rate)
We ordered one album and it enhanced our presentation.
it is about 5 feet tall (not exactly sure) that is a rough estimate. It IS a stand. There is no need to attach this to your wall. Very sturdy!
If you mount your TV to the highest mounting point possible, it should be no problem. I have Bello AV rack which is 26" in height and I can place my center speaker on the top of the rack which is another 8" in height and enough to clear 65" TV's bottom bezel.
Yes sir, it will hold it.. The kit that's included has many different options for the various sizes..
i dont have that problem, sorry
they sure will if you have the proper adaptor such as this http://www.amazon.com/3-5Mm-Stereo-Splitter-Audio-Adapter/dp/B0009JFF7A/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1262147896&sr=8-3 2x female rca x 1x female 3.5mm
I know it is 1 year but it may be one of the one's under the 5 year plan. I think you can check it out on the Amazon site. Best reguards RickS
Found an article I think might be what you are referring to: http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/282860-32-blue-black
does ps3 have a Sata connection? Serial ATA....or older eide connection?
I don't think so. The mounting plate is flat so putting it in a corner would be tricky.
Yes, if you have RCA or a stereo-mini output from your multi-input device. This pre-amp will only use one input and is analog-stereo only. The quality of this pre-amp was very good.
This cannott transmit directly to an iphone.
Yes, I currently use it on Windows 7 (without any restrictions that I'm aware of or have noticed).
its a piece of junk
No, it's a great unit but if it needs repair it takes 6 months.
Mount this wide angle peephole at a child's eye level, instead of at an adult's eye level, because you want to see if someone is crouched down below the peephole waiting for you to open the door, or if there is an animal on the ground. If you mount the peephole at an adult's eye level, then you see what is happening in the trees, but you generally want to know what is happening on the ground, not the sky.
8 ohms
Depends what laptop your hooking it up too
"does this have a built-in speaker?" Answer: No, you need a pair of headphones, or buy some computer speakers that have a 3.5mm stereo jack.
I think Amazon updated one or the other. It is in fact Intel Core 2 Quad Q6600 processor.
On my pc this well, whith a littlle bit to custom the software of my graphic card!
That's interesting. I wonder why it's called a DVR. I actually had the same question as Dennis, thanks for your reply. OK. I just got off the phone with tech at Archos and both the home and travel DVR do record from TV, VCR and DVD player. The main difference is the Home DVR dock is not travel friendly because of size/weight and there is no "s" plug on the travel dock.
The attendants answered any questions for the guests, but everyone enjoyed taking the pictures.
I have more of a backlight issue when viewed from off angle. There is a white fuzzy band of excess brightness on the right 1/8 of screen, that washes out the color. is this similar to your set?
Hi Les Fuleki, there is no actual life expectancy for this Sony TV. Other may last couple of years, some are not. It may depend on the handling, usage, weather condition and other factors. -Ely
NS77H is the model number; /B is black, /S is silver colored.
Hi Kim L. Bonsteel, Yes, it can. This player can play disk repeatedly. Press DISPLAY in the remote then select REPEAT. Thanks. &gt;Joffrey
As long as your boombox has an auxiliary input then yes. The plug is "headphone sized" so anything headphones plug in to, so will these. I connect my phone or iPod into my computer speakers all the time.
If you have an aux port in your car then yes.
I don't know but I would not recommend this antenna. All of the testing I did with this antenna indicated that it decreased signal range as compared to factory antenna on my wireless access point. I took several measurements in different directions and at varying distances and in all cases the signal strength was less with this antenna.
Yes
Sorry i dont know that
Yes it is
Sizes run differently depending on vendor/manufacturer.
I do not see an expiration date.
Mine has no white border.
Our tech people told me it is a really good one because we have videos or still shots going and it is easy to switch between them. We have it set up so that the timer turns it on when the office opens and shuts off when we close so I don't have to do anything. The sound on the videos is really good too. I am not in the office for several weeks so I will respond with the screen dimensions and frame size after the 5th.
1. Residue has not been a problem. To remove: warm surface a bit with hair dryer on low. If there is any residue, Goo-gone will remove it (no problem). 2. Label is a plastic thin as paper and is washable with a damp cloth. Letters are not raised, it is printed with toner. We are very happy with the product, but it seems hard to find.
It transmits digital signal for your stereo sound !
Try Sony brand DVR-
9 volt batteries (one for each), and the microphone is included.
I am not an expert...... but these are just generic memory devices and should work with any cell, tablet, laptop, etc....
Both are Firewire. There were 6 and 4 wire connections, the 6 wire carried power. It was sort of the defacto serial protocol for digital video for awhile. It is too bad the n ewer compouters no longer include it and you have to buy a separate PC board. Nonetheless, the ends are both Firewire and can be used as DV or data
Yes I have this cable. That is why I put in a review. I don"t understand what you want to know.
Not sure about that. Just log on to a desktop memory website and allow automatic memory diagnosis.
can not answer your question
Maybe very small low draw appliances. Check the power draw rating of appliance
It's just a knob to slip the remotes hole over to hang in place
these are removal clips for the smaller GorillaPod Joby GP-1 (used with small cell-phone size DIGITAL cameras). The BH1 ball head mount appears to fit only the larger GorillaPod (usable for the SLR cameras) like what you have. I have both GarillaPod sizes and checked the base mounts to whether the release clips would fit both sizes and they do not and the ball itself is a different size. Before you invest in getting the small GorillaPod (if you don't have one already), be aware that GP-1 is too small the support the weight of a larger SLR camera.
it yakes type 1 and type 2 CF but if you google search nikon coolpix 8800 specs, you'll get more detailed info. hope it workd for you
The manual for the Janome 9700 says it can use an ATA PC card. A PC card is much larger physically than a CF (Compact Flash) card. They are not interchangeable.
Dear Megan Does your computer say something about DDR2? Do you have windows 7? It depends if is a newer computer yes, but if you have windows XP it might use a different one(DDR instead of DDR2).
Pesquisei na internet e vi que mesma configurao: ddr2 667 mhz. pra funcionar sim.
Not a good idea. Get one from Kawai. Polarity could be reversed. May not have enough power even if voltage is correct. 9-12volts is a very wide range and the FS690 might want something more definite. Could damage keyboard!!
It would technically be possible, but I think it would be more trouble than its worth. You'd need a power source for it--run off of your car's cigarette lighter. Worse though, you would need some device containing a hard drive to store the video. I think you would be better off with a standalone camera that had a slot for an SD card. You might look into something called a "dash cam".
I would say about 30-40 feet. It helps at night to have street lights or garage lights to illuminate your subject. During the winter I had better night coverage because the snow on the ground gave a great contrast to anything that was going on.
Yes, absolutely.
Yes
No. It comes with what you see in the picture only.
No. No mounting on the back. These are pretty heavy and are meant for stand mounting.
They r no more in production, but u get a 5 year warranty like normal
Definitive Technology's own specs says it's 14.75 x 5 x 5 inches. It's only properly shown here under 'Technical Specifications'. I'll contact Amazon and hope that they fix the numerous errors.
It has a digital tuner, and comes with an AC adapter. As far as the external antenna jack, I have not noticed, however I use it in an internal room in my house and the reception is great.
no remote
If it has Bluetooth, it should work fine. But I would ask Microsoft first, if that is possible. I am no expert.
No, it didn't come with a case. I don't think it does regardless of color. I recently bought one used in April of this year. I've been using it on my android tablet and it's been working fine for me.
I Think that depends on your DVR.
It runs off an A/C adapter. The cable that runs from the camera has two plugs, one runs to the DVR (video) and the other one is power. The A/C adapters are available on Amazon.
It is a CCTV camera so you will need a CCTV card in your computer with software to record onto the hard drive or a DVR for CCTV cameras. It is not a stand alone unit.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but no monitor should require drivers. If your resolution is messed up you may need to update or download your video card drivers or software. Depending on your card you would need to visit either Nvidea or AMD (Radeons) webpage. Or you could always try customer service by phone or email at http://www.hannsg.com
A couple of years ago alot of people had them and were selling. Low supply of remaining left over new ones has increased prices and costs for vendors to get them.
I doubt this keyboard has a Mac eject button, but you can add that button to right end of your Mac menu bar by double-clicking this file: Macintosh HD/System/Library/CoreServices/Menu Extras/Eject.menu
Yes, it does. But this is a very very old model and you should be able to get something better like the SB6121 for about the same price
It is 12' wide by 9' high. Can handle anything your projector can put out.
I bought an epson for 250 that is excellent we use it at lake
C means it came with the Cable (C HDMI) usually sold at Costco.
You don't. This came out before real smart TV's were around. You can hook a computer or a Smartphone (through HDMI) to it and use it as a monitor.
Yeah I have this chord and the defender series otterbox case on an iPhone 5. The end of the chord is slim enough to fit into the case and the chord is surprisingly longer than expected.
It's 3 Inch (7.62 cms).
i would say yes. you can use a wireless headphones practically on any device which has a mini phone jack, which this old TV has.
Yes. that would be correct. Just need to make sure that your camcorder is able to rewrite as some do not.
I have a Blue Ray DVD player in my new Computers and I can watch these on mine. You have to be sure and finalize them first though after recording on them. Hope this helps
It screws onto a lens.
This camera does very poorly in low light.
Yes, this cam have a firewire port on it
Our unit came with an AC adaptor and played like it should.
Sorry, I use this to teach a college math course and I have been busy grading a test. Yes the gooseneck separates from the base and connects with a USB connector. I am going to try to attach a picture. My son also attached the base to a piece of plywood with velcro to stabilize it and give me a uniform location to place the notebook that I write on. Sorry, I can't see any way to attach a picture. If you contact me at mjbell522@msn.com , I will send you the picture. M.J.Bell
I don't know how dark you mean. I use it in a classroom and my problem is usually too much light. I prefer to turn off the lights and just leave the blinds open enough to give the students some light in order to write. In general, the less light in the room, the better the students can see it.
Facing the back of the camera it is behind the cover on the left side. You need to angle the screen back a little and flip open the cover which is labeled HDMI USB A/V OUT. It connects to the USB A/V OUT port.
I don't know why a few people say it has no LED. I just purchased this same model (4gb Data Traveler 100) from another store and it DOES have an LED light that blinks when their is activity. Maybe their stick is defective and their light is burned out or something, but there definitely is one. Its a green light behind the logo.
it does come with a small lanyard with a keyring connector on the end. it's hidden in the box, taped to a piece of cardboard. i've kept mine on my keyring for months, and it's quite sturdy (especially considering how often i toss my keys on the desk, etc)
It should work. You will need a plate mounted to the ceiling with a ball joint that allows the pipe to come down at whatever angle gravity requires. This mount mounts to a pipe (and the pipe is not supplied). So, technically, yes. But it largely depends on your plate and pipe.
Those go into the tv not the cable box. Into the audio out sockets.
No. This is networking cable not speaker wire

Ball fits all Nuvi brackets. Suction disk is attached. Basically, this product is just a much, much better version of the suction mount that Garmin sells.
Didn't use the sticky pad I never stick anything to my dash as they do not come off easily! Stick it to the windshield
No, it's just a sleeve
No
Unless you are really aggressive it should stay put. Ours has been used in a 3/4 ton PU over rough roads and never moved.
================== &gt;&gt;BRiT says: The HD-A30 does 1080p output. The HD-A3 is the one that only does 1080i. &lt;&lt; ================== Thanks BRiT, ... Your Correct, ... I corrected my post above!!!
Make sure you have the latest FW version - easily downloaded from the WEB via the built-in Ethernet Port that ALL HD DVD PLAYERS HAVE. Latest FW = 1.1/1.1 Read this for the A35 INFO http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=925599&highlight=A35+FIRMWARE Phil
Yes. It will detect the ka band and/or k band that is associated with the device. Will not identify to you to what actually threat is as the possibilities are endless. The k and ka bands are very widley used. Ive had this detector for about a year and I love it.
They are only illegal in the states of Virginia and Washington D.C
Sorry no we currently don't ship overseas.
Don't know about the fotodiox but the Kenko do offer the electronic connections, so autofocus works, within the limitations of all extension tubes.
I looked at it this morning and they have it set at $2,324.99(Amazon Direct) which is the opposite direction the big box and online retailers are going which is downwards.
Yes they do. I bought a LNT4065F and it dropped about 150 after about 20 days and I called them and they gladly refunded the difference back to my credit card.
69 has a matte screen instead of the glossy reflective screen, and it also has 20000:1 contrast ratio instead of the 25000:1. So if you are worried about being in a bright room and have alot of reflections on the screen, get the 69, otherwise the 71.
THEY TOLD ME IT WILL BE SHIPPED DURING THE FIRST WEEK OF FEB. 2008
Take a look at the images at http://www.circuitspecialists.com/bc-1hu.html there is a picture of the power cord there.
Should work with any sony a-mount camera. So i believe that's a yes.
no - only to canon dslr--
Sorry, mine is older model.
Mine is made for canon.. U need to get the one for Nikon.. But I am not sure about Nikon lens since u got 2 kinds of lens for nikon
EF-S mount.
Which system are you asking about specifically? Model and/or description please.
You can if you flip the light box with the opening on top.
I have a D5100 and it works just fine. The little flash sync trigger slides into the hot shoe and there you go ready to shoot.
ididn`t even know they had a two it takes two sata wires if thats what you mean one from the board and one for the power
For a microwave you would be much safer plugging directly into a 3 wire grounded outlet with a 20 amp circuit and breaker. The joule rating on a power strip is for surge protection, most likely from a lightning strike or something of that magnitude. I hope this helps.
These are 2 grams each, sold in packets of 5. I hope that helps.
The one I got had a version of ubuntu called Zorin which works very well in my opinion. I believe it has an SD slot but don't have the computer with me at present.
Yes. I have the widest roll on it right now, works perfectly.
Yes it should hold textbooks and notebooks in addition to your computer. I actually cut out the black inner lining that separated the two zippered compartments. This allows me to fit my purse (it's a large purse) , computer (15 inch), a thick spiral notebook, papers for work and high heels all at he same time. I take the train to work, roll it all over and to the bottom/wheels are sturdy enough to handle all of the weight without dragging! This is by far the best investment I have made this year!
Not real or fake leather. Its a water resistant material and very durable. I actually prefer this over the leather case I used to have.
i just flew with this bag this weekend ......no problem
Yes.
Yes
It says 1 meter right in the description. That is about 3 feet.
Yes, this cable is CL2 rated and can be used for in-wall installation.
It says 1 meter right in the description. That is about 3 feet.
Speaking from experience, this item should of came delivered in clear plastic packaging with the monster logo on it.
Yes.
Yes it will
Don't know
In short, no. In fact "dot-by-dot" is available only with a 1080i/p signal. That's not to say that SD pictures look bad at all, but this TV has a lot of settings so that you can tweak SD pictures. SD programming can be set to a regular 4:3 picture (with bars on the right & left) or stretched out to full screen in several ways.
Unfortunately yes, there is a very good chance you will if you open any files that were infected and you don't have a good anti-virus program running. If you aren't using an anti-virus program, don't transfer any files to your new computer. If you are, then run a scan on the drive and find out what viruses are there. You should then be able to disable them or delete them from the drive (depending on how malicious they are) It should then be possible to transfer your personal info to your new computer
Yup, works great with the 610.
No reason it shouldn't but you should upgrade the speakers to something decent anyway.
Yes, there is a lithium battery,CR2025 Look at bottom of remote and about a one inch wide cover. You must put your finger nail or edge of knife or screwdriver into the very small slot on left side of cover and move it to the right and at the same time put your fingernail in the top wider slot and pull towards you. A little drawer will then slide out containing the battery. Hope this helps....
I'm sorry to hear you have had trouble getting help. I'd suggest contacting the seller you purchases from. You can contact the seller directly from the link on their storefront. From the detail page click on the seller's name. From there just click "Contact Seller" on the bottom right-hand side of your screen under Further Information. I hope this helps!
From their website http://downloads.smartpartsproducts.com/usermanuals/spx8_um.pdf
Hi, as far as I can see, you can't hook it up as a component to another system. On the back I can only see hook ups for external speakers. I don't see any other output/input ports. Hope that answers your question.
well if you go to olympus's website it tells you how to download the firmware update 1.1. your main issue may be that you dont have a 4 gb or larger card, as you need a micro-sd 4 gb or higher.
Xd card readers are available that plug into USB ports. If your printer can take a USB plug you have your problem licked.
I don't believe so - you have to take the battery out and charge it in a charger.
well if you go to olympus's website it tells you how to download the firmware update 1.1. your main issue may be that you dont have a 4 gb or larger card, as you need a micro-sd 4 gb or higher.
That would be a question best suited to the individual seller. When I bought mine brand new, I believe I still had to buy the XD card separately.
the macro setting isnt exactly the best, most of the time it turns out blurry - works best about 6 inches away, but the super macro mode seems to work better - for as close as about 2-3 inches. I know this probably isn't the most helpful response, but ive only had the camera for about a few days, this is just what ive noticed.
Yes
It should be compatible based on this specification sheet: http://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/accessories/batteries/#charger. For some reason, the charger list doesn't list the Z30 camera, but the NP-46(A) battery is compatible with the BC-45(W) charger.
Probably. My original NP-50A was 3.7 V. The replacement NP-50 is 3.6 V. I am going down in voltage, you are going UP, which is more of a concern. The difference is so small I think it is okay. Questions to answer: is the battery rated for your camera model? Do the other ratings match (mAh, etc)?
In most situations with Windows 7, 8, and 8.1 the driver will auto install once you plug it in. Also if you use Linux it will auto install upon boot up into the system.
My EX475 (two 500GB drives) shipped today. Original ship date was Dec 11th to 26th, so at least in my case, it'll arrive much earlier than the originallyl scheduled date.
yes on both questions it comes w/ ac power.....if u want usb powered w/ great bass response buy a logitech z5 comes w/ remote
I would not recommend this to be used for audio, the microphone quality sound is pretty terrible compared to headset microphones I've used. I would recommend using the WebCam with a different audio input device
Yes, the webcam control software which starts when the cam is on has the ability to zoom in.
I asked the same question, for the same reason, over at the Logitech forum. Unfortunately, for security purposes, the mouse can only "mate" with one computer at a time, so you can't use the mouse with both laptops simulataneously. However, you can make a shortcut to the mouse's connection in the Bluetooth Manager and it's pretty easy to switch laptops by just pressing the little button under the mouse.
Most tablets have ability to recognize bluetooth devices so it could detect the mouse. Just a matter of the operating system or the app being able to use it.

According to Wikipedia this is a 2nd generation router. I see no reason it will not work with 10.4.11 - I have it for a long time now and it worked with everything I connected to it, flawlessly.
It should work - that camera appears to be compatible with MS Pro memory sticks, and some vendors bundle it with a Sony branded Memory Stick Pro. That being said, I don't have a Sony Cybershop camera so I don't have direct experience with this combination.
I don't see why not.
Pairing bluetooth keyboard with the iPhone will not work.
I don't think so. The one I bought was in English without the and tildes.
The same
Yes as long as your TV has the matching VGA(SVGA) plug. Just select the PC setting on your TV. Mine works find but remember to keep the cable away strong power cables and heat
i hear this "beeping" as i describe it, as well, and have found others on youtube that experience this as well with this camera, it is quite annoying, although its not nearly as loud as you make it seem.. most people dont notice it even, but once you do it is quite annoying... i wondered if i got a defective unit but after finding many others that also have this it seems to be just how the camera is , i still have 20 some days to return it and i probably will because of this, oh well.
Yes you can. Format, depends on what you use and save after you edit. I use Roxio and save as WMV. I also burn to DVD and play on a 50" plasma. Video is better than our old VHS-C and close to MiniDV.
Yes. You can do pretty much anything with them: put them on Amazon, on myspace, anywhere you can upload videos; you can save them to a dvd, you can watch them on tv, etc.

I guess that's just the drawback of the camera. If you don't have a possibility to download the video from the Flip Cam, you can't record anything new.
I've been to Hawaii 2 times, it's beautiful. Both cameras take excellent images. Scenic shots are often done with wide angle and not a lot of telephoto. The higher the zoom, the more camera shake you get. 10X will show more shake than 6X even with image stabilization, unless you plan to use a monopod or tripod. I feel that 6X is plenty of zoom for most of your picture taking there. I would suggest the 720, it's over 2 oz. lighter and a bit smaller body size. Aloha
check the exif data with an exif viewer program and look for "shutter activations" or something like that.
Sound quality is better on the SoundDock.
Nope. That model doesn't have FM Radio. It has only two inputs: 30-pin dock for old iPhones and iPods and an auxilary port for 3.5mm cables.
you need to check how many watts does your tv consume. it should be somewhere on the back side of your set. if it is below 300 watt then you can use it.
No
When you plug the speaker back in to power it charges.
Yes.
The small round one with the little pin in the middle. Not the flat style
Although I haven't tried it, the surface looks like it should accept paint just fine. Maybe try an inconspicuous area of the speaker first as a test.
Yes , they can with no problem. We mounted 4 of them, two in each side of the room
If your audio-video receiver is properly set up, then yes, they would sound and perform very well with that subwoofer. However, the speakers themselves have enough good bass response that the subwoofer is truly not needed. I have a powered subwoofer connected to my system and it has to be turned down to bare minimum to prevent it from overwhelming the Polk speakers output.
Surprisingly, the bass is very good on the RTI A9's due to the porting technology. However for THX movies, I have a Polk DSW PRO 550WI 10" subwoofer as well for really strong thumping. The subwoofer is tucked away in a corner behind the seating area and the combo front back bass is excellent.
Just don't put the spikes in the feet and place them right-side-up. The feet have a rubber insert in them already.
No the zippers are not metal they are of a nylon or plastic composition. Bag is functional and sturdy have used it for business and pleasure.
Not too heavy. I'd guess 1.5 lb.
on the roof of a mobil home on a trailar
Yes on the direct tv...can't answer the hd... We used it on our old camper.
No it's for closed circuit video
Yes, it appears so. The panel on the back reads: Input: ~100V-240V 50/60Hz 4.5-7.5VA 2.2W
You can transfer your photos from the T200 to your mac via iPhoto. The memory card from the camera also shows up in your desktop so you can drag and drop photos from the card to any folder you like. Hope this helps
Agreed strange. Actually, I pre-ordered the Silver from SONY and it shipped ahead of schedule...arriving today via FEDEX. Looking forward.
Sigma USA warranty is three year&gt;7 year extended warranty is available.GeorgeK
There is no reason to worry. It will fit almost all DSLRs.
the binder is 10-13/16 inches tall by 8-1/4 inches wide and 3 inch thick spine
Should fit any Cannon EOS mount with the correct ring. Used it on a T3i and EOS 5D MkIII.
I don't know, but mine did not work long--like a few weeks.
Yes everything included. Good TV Mount. Easy to hang. Good Quality would recommend to anyone.
Yes it should I used it for a older 42" Panasonic in the garage. It is very versatile.
Yes it will work just fine.
I currently do run on Windoes 7 and it does not need any extra installing software other than connecting to the computer. Very smooth process.
This is magnetic reed contact switch, which means both pieces must be aligned for the electrical circuit to be closed. To answer your question, it's not a sensing device. It will only tell you if your window/door is open or closed.
If it gets wet, there shouldn't be an issue. Just dry it with a towel to ensure it doesn't rust over time. But I'm not sure how it will do submerged underwater, like scuba diving. The inside will most likely fill with water and I don't think you'd be able to dry it well enough on the inside.
The front of the box has the "Microsoft PlaysForSure" logo and the "Napster To Go" logo. So it's compatible with some/most subscription services.
Sorry, I don't know. I bought it as a gift and never open.
By far, the majority of my high def wish list is on HD DVD exclusively. For me, the question was never "should I buy HD DVD" it was "should I buy a player that will allow me to play the odd BD too". Both formats will be around for years to come, and I think that smart buyers are among the early adopters of the universal/dual player formats.
This lens requires a 52 mm drop-in filter that is placed near the back of the lens near the mount.
According to Nikon's website, the D750 uses the MB-D16
I don't know, as we bought it for an HP switch. I think I remember something about Cisco having their own proprietary items. Sorry I can't give you a definitive answer. You could try calling Cisco tech support?
Not this model, this is a 120v
It works with USB 2.0 for certain. I have not tried it on USB 3.0 as yet.
Hello, The speakers have a 100 foot range and can work in a home that has many wireless signals. The speaker kit connects to one device at a time, but is easy to disconnect and connect to another device. To set up you connect the speaker wires, plug in the speakers, and turn the power on. It's that easy! I hope this was helpful!!
Yes you can. The Ion Tape2PC has a stereo record input on the back of the unit. Depending on what you are using for the source of your CD (laptop, cd player etc) you would need to match the output (line out or headphone jack) cable to the rca input cable on the Ion unit.
was 6 hours now 3 and a half
I believe it comes with a dc cord also.
Yeah, if you plug the clip into speakers it will play through them. Many stereos nowadays come with this feature (usually referred to as "mp3" on the remote or controls) and you can get plenty of mini speakers in various price ranges that would work for it. The clip works great and would be great for a nine-year-old.
The Z812is will not accept a filter without some kind of adapter.
about 9 feet!
Without taking my TV off of the wall it looks to be about 5 1/4".
I have used with Kindle, so would assume Ipad as well, but not tried that. By the way - I really like these little speakers.
The speakers themselve should be enough. I have a crappy sound card and these speakers sound wonderful! Good luck. They're awesome!
The amps are built in -- you need to plug them into a 110V outlet and feed them an earphone signal from some device.
They aren't specifically designed to be wall mounted speakers. I'm sure there is a way you could figure it out, but they do not come with a way to easily mount them to a wall. They are meant more as a desktop monitor speaker.
Yes, it will.
It should if you haven't used up all of the bays
Yes.
Yes. I have plenty of USB cables, and just pick one that is handy. You need a USB A to B connector, A being the connector normally seen in computers, and B a square connector with two edges beveled. Mini and micro USB A connectors will not fit. That's only a problem if you are buying one online; if you look at them - it is obvious.
I have used it everyday for the last 4 months and this thing still looks good. I have it packed pretty full and drag it all over for my job and it still shows no signs of wear.
No it does not
Yes. And with a firmware update coming soon or maybe already available, you'll be able to take calls directly through the P2's built-in mic.
It's already released in Korea, people who pre-ordered there got some special items. -.- For everybody else outside of Korea, it's most likely going to be released in mid October, since the warehouse is still making more and shipping out world wide.
Mine is not, I use a wireless mouse or touchpad on my unit.
Yes, it works on all the 700 series Garmins. It fixed mine.
It might. The one I got didn't work for me. It wouldn't stay on. It alternated on and off.
yes

You'll need to be more specific in order to get a valid answer, but here is an answer based on the info on your question: Maybe. If it's a standard SATA drive with no encryption then you should be able to get the info. Is something wrong with the new drive?
I do not know
Both RGB (analog) and DVI-D. See full specs and description at Viewsonic's website http://www.viewsonic.com/products/desktop-monitors/lcd/value-series/va926.htm
Yes, Bob. The fan assembly I received actually included a tiny packet of "thermal paste". Check-out "http://www.ehow.com/how_6870400_install-775-cpu-fan.html" for a little more help if you need it.
As long as your current fan uses screws and not plastic clips this one should work without any problems (I've used this fan on several different brands of computers (e.g. Dell, HP, etc.) without any additional steps needed) - if your existing fan uses plastic clips then you may need to install the adapter to the mobo so it will accept the screws instead of the plastic clips... Good luck! RH
Yes, it will fit on that motherboard. I have 2 ASUS P5K PRO motherboards and they fit good.
Do NOT USE THIS converter: Several Amazon users have already reported it has burned up, and two of the three I have purchased have burned up under normal use and low currents. It is UNSAFE in ANY country at ANY frequency and voltage.
Not sure I understand the question......
I'm sorry; I don't know. I have a Canon 50D. Wish I could have helped.
No, there is no DC in. However, I got the grip when I bought my camera and love it. It is the one attachment that I believe is necessary if you do a lot of shooting.
Yes, I'm actually using this product with my Sony cyber shot.
Yes they are!
Yes
Yes, that's the one I bought this for. Works perfectly.
Im unsure if it was made by microsoft directly , but it came packaged just like it did when they still made them. and it looks identical as well. great product, I personally love it.
Yes, definitely.

The slingbox needs to be hooked up to the TV directly. However, if you have a smartphone with a video out display adapter you could watch slingbox on another TV by streaming through your smartphone (assuming you have purchased the Slinbox app for your phone). As you mentioned, any remote computer with Internet access will also work. Hope that helps.
Yes, anywhere you have cable and Internet you could log on anytime
I don't think so. It has its own app. You can use the web player on your desktop and laptop, but you'll have to buy the mobile player for your phone or tablet.
Thank you for your question. Konica Minolta Dimage A200 holds Compact Flash (Type I or II) Transcend's 133x CF cards are the perfect match for enthusiast and prosumer level DSLR cameras and camcorders.
I ordered the one for the coupe, and it fits perfectly. I have 04 coupe.
Yes if it is docked up on the ipod docking station.
yes
no
passthrough what?
Yes it should. I can fit my wallet, cell phone, and keys. I think the inside measurements are approx. 3 x 3 x 6. It's tucked away in my boat for the winter so I can't check the exact measurements for you.
Yes you can mount a go pro. That said it only can be used to steady the Pro or as an extention. It's not on of those sticks that you hold out away from your self and do a video selfie while skiing down a hill. It will not flex or angle in any way. I hope this helps. Good at what it does and takes lots of abuse. Had this over two years now. Still works great.
yes i am using power cords for my old motorola cell phone and it works great.
In theory yes ( it can slide up and lock ), but i would not recommend it. The locking mechanism is really just there to keep it from sliding out the top. It might work for a small very light monitor.
Other than screen size not much of a difference. The 705 has a 7 inch touch screen and a the 605 has a 4.3 inch touch screen ( basicly the same screen as found on a Sony PSP) so it really comes down to screen size vs portability.
The ExpressCard sits flush in my MacBook, but SD cards protrude a bit. I eject the SD card before putting the laptop in a travel case.
The reader sits flush, but the card does not.
Joe Y., Just got your email...yes, the HD-56G787 is listed as one of the TV's the TS-CL110UAA works with. I would not buy the one you have this question attached to as I experienced only one weeks worth of use. I have bought others through Amazon, although I am not able to recall them specifically, which worked a year or more.
No. There is noticeable Bluetooth latency with this keyboard. Great for media centers, terrible for high action gaming.
it's a regular size keyboard, lightweight and easy to use. Don't know about the kindle, we don't have one. I use it with my ps3.
It is blue tooth keyboard. I connect to my i7 computer, kindle hdx, ps3, and sony TL phone. Yoga, why not?
It has a small red light on the back that blinks when it is recording. The unit can be set to record either at set times or when motion is present.
Yes, the unit has an external switching power supply, that gives the record player 12Volts
I'm sorry; I haven't used this for any instrument other than my electric, steel, Hawaiian guitar.
I'm not sure, but it will replace any TV remote even if its digital.
I am using a Philips universal remote which may not have every function as the original but it works just fine.
It does work under linux.
High setting should only be used for simple HEATING appliances such as hair dryers. Do NOT use it for electronic appliances. See my review on this product for details.
Two separate 6ft cables. I've had them for quite a few months now, and they both still work perfectly!
I got two pairs a year apart. First came with a nice hard case the second came with a cheaper case. Both from authorized klipsch dealers. check the website at klipsch to see if yours is.

There is a 10 pin splitter available on the market now and you should be able to use that. Google 10 pin splitter for dslr and you'll find the links
Ansmann 5035212 is .15 mm thinner than standard Ansmann 2850 mAh.
Hi Lori, I think your problem may lie in the format of your hard drive. More than likely your hard drive is formatted in the ntfs (windows xp and later file system). I am not sure but I am guessing that the easyshare dock reads fat file systems (most sd cards are in the fat file system). I do not own this dock (yet) so I cannot test this for sure. You may try to borrow a hard drive that is known to be in the fat file system and see if that works. Hope this helps
Yes
I haven't seen an UL stamp at the back of my power strip.
To turn it off just hold the back and the down button at the same time. This is not the same as sleep mode. To make the zune sleep just hold the play button until the screen turns dark then lock it.
Kevin, u got it wrong..It comes with a USB cable which will charge your player the moment you connect it to your PC :) Same goes for iPod..The charger that you see on the marketplace is IF you want to plug in the Zune to power socket.. :) While you are syncing your player, it will do the charging for you..isnt that just fine?
While hooked to computer, go to Device, music, right click on song, delete from will appear
I recommend you download the Zune software at Zune.net and try it before purchasing the device. (You have to use the Zune software to "sync" your music to Zune device.) Zune supports mp3 and wma (as well as AAC), so you can transfer them easily if they are not DRM-"protected". (The Zune software only adds DRM-"protected" files from the Zune Marketplace to your Zune collection.) FYI http://forums.zune.net/242458/ShowPost.aspx
According to Amazon the speakers weigh 2lbs. if purchased as single speakers. I did not weigh mine, but they they feel about 2 lbs. They are compact but sturdy. I relly enjoy the quality! David
It's for up to a USB 2.0, and is backwards compatible for the USB 1.1.
Christopher Baker, Xbox live was down all day for an update on September 29, 2008. Can you try this modem with Xbox live again, does it work well?
I would imagine it would work really well on a riding lawnmower. I used it on my motorcycle for a long distance trip and had trouble if beverage was more than half full. Obviously the angles and speeds are a lot more extreme than your mower, so should work good for you.
Not slippery. Great case, good protection for your ipod. I would recommend it.
Yes This case is very good
worked great no complaints...
No
It will definitely accommodate that TV.
There is a Velcro strap to keep it in place.
According to Amazon: iPod Classic 160gb (6th generation) dimensions: 2.4 x 0.3 x 4.3 inches iPod Classic 160gb (7th generation) dimensions: 2.4 x 0.4 x 4.1 inches In 2010 I purchased the DLO Jam Jacket for the 6th generation and it fit fabulously. In August 2013 I purchased the DLO Jam Jacket for the 7th generation and it fits fine. I am very satisfied with the fit of the Jam Jacket on both my iPod Classics.
No. I never had any trouble going over any type of surface. I travel extensively and over difficult surfaces - from escalators to sidewalks to gravel walkways. The wheels don't break apart of flake. Good thing since Wenger won't repair their products.
Yes, absolutely. The compartment up against the handle is clearly intended for a change of clothing. I've put a bit of padding at the bottom and it holds a laptop, power cord and mouse. It's not padded or designed for this purpose, but for how I utilize the bag, with a larger size laptop that won't move around much, I find it to be fine. This compartment is separate from the intended computer compartment. By the way, I'm extremely happy with this purchase.
The battery on mine can last for about 2 hours with Wi-Fi turned on. There are three different USB slots (one on the side, two in the back).
Nope, the clip is firmly attached and is not removable.
I purchased it for a trip to Italy and I had taken about half the pictures when the card in the camera said it was full, so I could say I was very disappointed in it. A trip of a lifetime and unable to take pictures was not a good thing for me. I don't know if the card will work in your camera, you might check your manual or check on line to see what the recommendation is.
I love this camera and have used it for EBay Sales because it does great close-up photos and also it is quite easy to use as some cameras are so complicated you never learn how to use most of the features. Rick
No does not come with case. Thank you
What do you mean by "it does not click"?
Yes, see our used offer.
Yes the adapter is included... Came neatly packed and everything
I don't know for certain but I would expect that would happen. If the power surge is large enough to disable/destroy other electronics in your house then I suspect it would damage this device as well.
yes but not from sony - they say it would cost more than to buy a new one, which is bogus - they ARE ABOUT $23 - MY BATTERY HAS NEVER HELD A PROPER CHARGE AND SONY OFFERED NOTHING
You don't need to buy the separate charger. The free charger that is included can be used at dual voltages. All you need is an adaptor for the European outlet.
don't know. you would need to ask/email garmin nuvi.
I wouldn't count on it, this thing doesn't even work on modern operating systems.
Mine are mounted in my basement behind a projector screen, and it's a wall with insulation. They sound great, and I haven't had any issues.
Pairs Best Regards, Mike Embers www.acousticsounddesign.com 888-224-3663
No
Correct, it will plug into any jack that supports an aux cable
I just measured 18"
With the proper adapters. It can be done. Would I use this particular fan on a CPU? No. I have a couple of these fans. My opinion. They are good for case use. But I would look for something that moves a bit more air than these to use on a CPU.
This Belk Tunebase FM transmitter is for older phones that have the wide charger connection; so yes it will work with your iPhone 4. It won't work with new iPhones because of the narrower charger connection. You probably won't be able to use it as a bluetooth option unless your car has the capability. I use mine for music and as a car charger. It works well - every so often I'll have interference but it's not the rule. I hope this has helped you.
It should be perfect for that
Hi, this is really heavy duty mount. My television is a 42" and there was absolutely no resistance on the mounting unit (by way of analogy, my television is like a single can on a kitchen cabinet shelf, there is absolutely NO stress). In my opinion, I do not think you will experience any issues by using this unti to mount your 55" television. I hope this helps.
I stay at a RV park in lower Alabama and my spot is several hundred yards from the antenna ath the club house. I could only get 1 bar and sometimes 2 but after I installed the Alpha I get 4 to 5 bars consistently and have good access to the internet. There a lot of campers in the park and when they are all on it slows down but I still have good access. I also tried a much more expensive one and got less signal.
it's perfect for kali linux and other systems... no lag nothing at all .. I prefer this one for hacking wifi and other..
Yes
This document camera can utilize a usb cord for camera output. Other options include vga, s-video, dvi, and rca (composite video). To see the full features in the user guide, please visit http://www.jcschools.com/Departments/InformationServices/PDFDocuments/V300AF_EngUM.pdf Kind regards
Check the Olympus website for verification. www.olympusamerica.com
It is 2.8 at 50mm and 3.5 at 200. The scale is fairly linear - it is about f3.0 at 135mm Sharpest at f4 and still quite sharp wide open.
This plugging into your computer is more based on your Motherboard. That being said if your mother board looks like this. http://www.esaitech.com/images/detailed/3/GGG/img54820.jpg Then you should be fine. If you look at the 24pin connecter in the upper right. Thats where your power supply plugs in. I personally think it would be very strange to find a computer that used a different type of power supply.
No, Sonos does NOT use your wifi network at all. It plugs into your wired Internet connection at your router, and creates its own wireless network, which is proprietary and not standard Wifi. In fact, that is the entire job of the Bridge. Sonos wireless network is a mesh, meaning all sonos devices in the network can relay signals. So the more sonos, the better the network, the better the range of coverage.
no , Sirius is a pay system with its own reciever, you will not need Sirius as there is a plethora of station selection on the internet
Absolutely. The color is not the same though, If you are paring it with the white foscam. Hope it helps.
I think it should fit.
i have used it...u need to download the newest version from their site to get iphoto support....it works ok, but the ft that i cannot delete images once imported is kinda bummer...i am also not thrilled about the fact that it cannot import movies from the camera :S
I am not sure of the dementions of the Kodak Slide Projector that you want to carry. The inside dementions will easily hold most any device not in excess of 14x13x4 inches.
Yes, it will
You will be able to do that
The screws are 1" apart. Holds real good. Have gone from New York to Wyoming with a loaded Wilson 5000 and has not come loose.
The space between the arms is short, less than a foot. If the sound bar is small, it should work. You can't attach bar to arms unless you use Velcro. Good luck.
I used a standard 12v plug in DC converter to an outlet which is controlled by my sensor system. If the security light has an internal sensor it may be hard to use it power the siren.
Yes. Use it all the time
it works just fine for both my Garmin Nuvi GPS suction mounts .... so I would have to say it will work with most STANDARD mounts
cds in their jewel case shoud fit.
It works great for 100 single sleeves. You can squeeze a few extra in as well.
Yes it should. I can fit my wallet, cell phone, and keys. I think the inside measurements are approx. 3 x 3 x 6. It's tucked away in my boat for the winter so I can't check the exact measurements for you.
They should work fine. The speaker is supported from the bottom and held in place by side clamps.
The seller sent me low profile adapters with mine. Might want to contact seller before it ships to make sure they put the adopters with the card. I have mine in a small form factor Dell and works great. Win7
Yes. You need to buy a splitter cable that has two ends. Pay attention to the end connectors and make sure they will work with your monitors. The software will install a small app in control panel for you so you can manipulate the settings. I have had zero problems with this card and the price is right!
whats rms
8 amp
About 3-4 inches.
Um, there is. Amazon is listing it for $4.50, fifty cents cheaper than on the alternate sites you mentioned. If there was once an incorrect price, it's been fixed.
Just went to the garage and measured mine. It is 3 5/8". Guess it must be the short one.
This is just the mount. You need to get another part that screws to this to hold your GPS. I have this mount on one of the seat thwarts in my Bell Yellowstone solo canoe. I have the holder for my eTrex30 attached to the mount. Love the set-up as I can fold this under the seat for transport. Look for the holder from RAM that fits your Oregon.
It depends on the power requirements of the equipment you connect to it. I've only used this unit to power rack-mounted network equipment such as switches & routers, but I'm sure it would be fine for a rackmount server as long as the power demands aren't too great. If you're looking for something for a desktop PC, there are better choices for a lot less money.
No idea. Haven't had this problem arise. Maybe on-line battery search?
Reload program if you have access to it. Pull battery to reboot remote is another option to try.
I've never gotten mine to play anything. It has never worked.
I've never gotten mine to play anything. It has never worked.
The bass is okay but for that style music the bass is lacking. I wouldn't buy these.
I have Bose Quiet Comfort headphones and much prefer these. The earpieces go fairly deep into your ear canal to work effectively. I find them comfortable but others clearly may not.
They are exactly as in the image. There is also a range of different sized foam tips if the conical ones do not suit.
I just spoke with the company who makes this....the new models do not have telescoping antenna...they have wire and, no, it does not have a clock. The numbers on the front are radio station numbers.
It should. My drive is bigger physically than yours so the case is a better match for yours than it was for mine. I had no problem with the electronic components, just the box itself.
Could not get mine to work with a consistent high speed. Bought a D-Link, installed easily and running without a problem.
yes, black/red ribbon included
Yes
I don't know, but basic electric wiring is pretty easy. With a quick trip to your local hardware store, you can easily cut the cord and reattach another for not a lot of money. On a 1 to 10 difficulty scale, it's a 1. You can probably find instructions on youtube for any electrical cord.
I am not aware of what an ijet is so I'm not a good source for a response to this question. Sorry...
Could never get ours to work!
You can use a 16gb. That s/b all you need even shooting video. SDHC 16GB CLASS 6
Technology used has nothing to do with the temperature. You can see trees, stones, bugs, etc.
It would work just fine, great product, you will love it, nothing else is needed, just get it.
yes
I have a Vertex Radio that operates form 450 to 512 Mhz. Vertex is owned by Motorola. David Two Way Radio Gear
If you install WinXP than any GPS that uses USB or a USB dongle will work. And the same goes for any printer, just install the WinXP drivers. If you're using the native Xandros Linux, then you should use CUP for printing, they have drivers for just about anything. There's less available for GPS under linux though.
No you will need a kca-sr50 and a scc1 tuner the sxv200v1 tuner is for the 2013 and newer models
It will be fixed on 2/25/08. Read here http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=998399
YES it does resume playback on Blu-ray movies which is I believe the first player to do it! Loads pretty fast compared to my PS3 (which was the fastest to load them)
Yes it can. There are holes on the back of the frame to hang either way.
Never tried: Sorry!
Yes you can. You can buy 3 pair of this and buy the subwoofer cable separately.
Yes they are, and they are perfect
Not sure if it is compatible with Finepix S9600, but I bought it for the Panasonic Lumix FZ-18. I had to purchase an additional $35 adapter ring separately. It wasn't included with the lens. This is an old lens and generates a lot of noise with very small reduction in light. Because of the length, the location/subject being shot needs to be really bright and lit. I suggest an SLR or mirrorless one. The money saved by buying this instead still does not make it worth.
can't help
Yes it does have place to hold the tripod, in front of the bag. Tripod leg holder is hidden inside the front cover.
There is no special spot for one...it would lie right on top of all your gear, and it would be really tight if it were to fit at all.
I don't think that would be a good application. It's rather large for POS, and the stand is not that sturdy; I don't think it would be able to handle constant use. There are so many holders for newer tablets used for POS, and tablet POS apps optimized for a touch screen interface ... I would go that way. This product is a gem for its intended use: a desktop PC monitor where space is very limited. IMHO anyway!
yes @ least two, I don;t remember exactly how many.
yes it does come with carrying bag not the best but it works for me...
Yes, it will fit a huge array of tripods.
That's why I bought two for my truck and the wife's Mini. The pins inside the reader got bent the after removing and reinstalling the SDHC card after a couple of times and the USB port on the radio gave a "Failed to Read". I managed straighten it out with a small jewelers screwdriver and its working okay.
I would think it would work. monoprice HDMI only work for me with it pluged into wall outlet.
Not one bit if they work at all. Use cat6. Not cat5
Yes dear Keith it's work but the aperture will be controled from the lens , its depends your lens features .
Yes, it is the same color as pictured. Black and Greyish (not white)
I do not know. I notice though it does not say it supports Windows 7, but I am using it between two Windows 7 PC's without a problem. I would ask Tornado tech support your question to be sure. Here is their email address: info@thetornado.co.nz
You can contact the Tornado tech support team. http://www.thetornado.co.nz/support.html. I wanted to sort a certain way when looking at files and they responded quickly. You probably know this, but this device does not support Windows past Vista. I loved using it though. Great gadget. Just looking this seems to be a current device http://amzn.com/B002VFFA5M This is Diamond's forum. http://www.diamondmm.com/board/ You could ask there if you can use 2 on 3 computers. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
yes - most will work with linux, if they are formatted properly. worse case is that you can format the drive to work with linux on the eee but that will keep you from reading the contents on a mac or pc. format it such that it is readable on a mac or pc (usually the way it comes from the manufacturer out of the box) and it will work just fine.
Sorry, I wish I could answer this one but I'm such a tech idiot and only used this for the very basic purpose :(
It works as intended including shutter control but since the suze and the addition of the two batteries, it does add weight and bulkiness to the camera. If camera is going on a tripod, (optional) wrist strap needs to be removed for better stability
Yes
Yes it will but I will say you have to set it to the remote trigger mode in you camera and does not have a half push auto pho us but it will fit your Nikon d3000
No, it's permanent. I don't require a lot of length, so I have always coiled and twist-tied the extra.
On-ear and yes they are loud enough for an iPod . Can't go wrong.
This will plug into any standard headphone jack. I've had it in my guitar amp, my Casio piano, computer, and my Android phone. Works perfectly in all of them.
You know I really think it would. I have thought of that myself. The zipper goes all the way up & so all you would have to do is stick the hose up near the top & zip it up to there.
A light drizzle. I sprayed mine with a water repellant & that kept it dry
Yes, there will be enough space for 2 MacBooks.
Hi Linda it can be used as a carry-on the one I purchased has been to Ireland and all over Europe. The only issue is weight. You add 1 body 2 lens 1 flash memory laptop or tablet batteries travel size toiletries and 1 change of cloths and a passport. It get real heavy. So pack what you need camera wise first and go from there just remember you have to carry it! Cheers Mike
There are no tripod attachment points on the bag. The right hand side has a mesh pocket; the left hand side has the opening to the camera storage section. I have slipped a tripod leg through the waist belt to free my hands, but I wouldn't walk any distance that way, as it will bang against your leg. Once I have my camera on my tripod, I carry them together.
Yes. I had this bag with me as a carry on during my flight to Asia. Keep in mind, it doesn't fit under the seat. It only can be stowed away on the cabin compartment. This is a great bag. I really like it.
Think so but could be a bit heavy. I've had a Canon Rebel T5i, a 70-250mm, an 18-55 mm, a 500 mm mirror lens, a pair of binoculars, various batteries, wires, filters and an iPad in mine without any problems and with room for a sweater !!
mine had two parts....the usb connection to the short part of the drive connections and a Model sy-002-5-12 power ac-dc adapter with the sata power to drive part of the connection. each is connected to the drive separately.
I don't know. Check info on site.
This system does not record, it merely sends audio and video remotely to its receiver. You can connect the receiver to a TV or a DVR/VCR type device. There are a few micro SD card DVRs that you can purchase to connect to it, but stand alone this does not have a record function.
This isn't quite the camera I purchased but, I use my mini cameras with this 12v battery pack.( DC 12V Portable 9800mAh Li-ion Super Rechargeable Battery Pack ) and am very happy with the results. It operates the camera all day. It can operate from 9 to 12 volts successfully.
Yes it is.
This thing came to me with 3 totaly seperate speakers with two wires to each. No instructions or anything just here it is. I have not used it since I only have two wires from my system to send the singnal to. Obviously I need some other part and the sender was less than helpfull at that.
It is fixed at an angle, i recommend the straight eyepeice model. This is great for packing into back country due to lightness. It is great quality though can be difficult respotting with the angle eyepeice.
Don't know about D300, but my Wife's D700 it fits and is basically a must if you want to take lots of pictures and don't have the cash to buy expensive low memory compact flash cards. I'm sure if you were using it for professional photography it would make sense to buy the high end compact flash cards that are incredibly fast. But not for us the common user.
I recently used it while shooting a marathon. I was shooting often 11 frames per second and never noticed it heating up. Worked brilliantly.
If you are into numasmatics, I think you need to find another option. The scope does provide detail but the quality may not be something you are interested in. Overall, if you are SERIOUSLY into coins, I would suggest something else. Otherwise, it is okay for the household amateur (which I am).
It only does manual focus
Yes you can, instructions can be downloaded on their website or talk to a technician. They're very helpful and knowledgeable.
a D-Link GameFuel router will solve your issue out-of-the-box
Mine never worked properly so I am not sure what it did. Bought two and they were both junk
No
I'm assuming that it would but can't say for sure. It works good when I plug it into the USB port on my computer.
No nature sounds.
I believe that it will connect without any problems.
I can't get it to work with Time Warner but am saving it in case there is a merger.
No clue. I don't know what astound is. Sorry.
I've never seen an express card-to-SD slot adapter. I don't think they exist, sorry. There are USB card readers though that should give you the same basic functionality though. Here's an example - http://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Flash-Memory-Reader-TS-RDP8K/dp/B001NS0OZ4/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1371066202&sr=8-4&keywords=usb+card+reader
I bought a set of these speakers a few months ago. They work very well and I reccommend them highly. Remember these are USB speakers and the only connection you have to make is plugging them into an available USB port. You DO NOT need an addition audio 0r power cable.These speakers are most valuable for anyone having a lap top or desk top whose audio card or chip has stopped working. I am very pleased with mine.
Total RMS power: 1.2 watts RMS (0.6 watts per satellite)
I use Pocket Wizards. The devices that came with this kit are really cheap and not worth working with. (My opinion)
If you have placed mulitiple sensors in different rooms on the same landline, then it should work fine. As the intruder entered into different rooms and triggered the alarm, it should call you and then there should be enough delay before the intruder entered another room to again trigger the alarm and call you. If you had placed the sensors in the same room then there could be a problem where the units tried to call at the same time and might conflict with each other.
I don't have the manual. Sorry. I might advise you to not place the sensor anywhere a mouse might walk past it closely--unless you like getting a cell phone notification as well as having the county sheriff call you at 1:42am while you're at you aunt and uncle's cabin.
It depends on how big or small an ears. But I Ithink its size is enough for the vast majority.
I put them where the extra woofer was turned away from tv to expand sound!!
They come with small mount with screw holes on the bottom , no way to tilt them in any certain direction .
Comes with a little stand and I put it on top of the dvd player.
I only have a klipsch subwoofer so I dont have a way to compare but the polks sound great even a high volume
It doesn't extend much at all. I don't have it now as I reverted to rubber lens hoods that allow me to rotate polarizing filters. With Nikon hood I would often touch the polarizing filter glass-not good.
Yes, works with filter attached. Nice lens hood.
Yes,,, you can get mount flat within couple inches of ceiling&#128077;
Yes, it will burn on all styles of CD's and DVD's
No it will not. This card is for 10 series plasma TV's only. Panasonic does make an HDMI card for your model but it is a single HDMI.
Honestly, I coudnt help you. But call the customer service, they are very helpful. Here I'll give you their number... 626-579-6899. I think they are open like 10-5 Pacific Standard Time or something like that. Best of luck, hope that helps!
No. These are not noise canceling headphones.
BIG
Since this is a headphone amp, connect it to the headphone out on your receiver using a 1/4" stereo rca cable.
I have mine installed on a IBM T43 and it works fine. I would give it a try.
Yes, this drive will work fine. The HTS5416 is a newer design that runs cooler and lasts longer than the HTS5410.
Yes
Yes
My 7" tablet says my mini-HDMI is only for output, so I would connect my 7" tablet to an input device regular-sized HDMI, such as a television or computer system. Then the output from my tablet will play through the larger device. You just have to figure out which channel or input mode to switch the larger device to... Some newer ones do it automatically. Check your user's manual for specific instructions. I don't need any type of aerial device.
Search on Amazon for BNC to RCA adapters in order to connect to monitor...you need to look for adapters that will make connections possible. To learn more, perfom a simple search on Amazon, type in BNC adapters. Finally, drive down to your local Radio Shack, they will fix you up.
They worked well in Fiji!
No it's not. I only use it for the tri pod not the camera or lenses
Hi, You don't mention the length, width, and circumference measurements of the stop, so it's hard to know. Even if they do fit, you'll need a divider to keep them from banging against each other, and the bag will lightly bend in the awkwardly. Also, the bag stitching is not sturdy so be cautious about weight.
Yes, that is the approximate measurement I get on mine.
That's are good size for carry on,but a bit heavy when it full gear inside, just need to make sure you can carry on the plane.
While I think they could be mounted to a ceiling, I don't think that would be their optimum use. Mounted vertically their design gives a very wide dispersion.
No - these are hard-wired speakers. Satellite refers to rear or side location for surround sound systems.
Yes I have a pair for sale under loubat distributors
The speakers are recommended to be driven with 20-125 watt amp. I use my RM8s as surround speakers for the Polk CSI-A6 and an old pair of RTA 11s. When compared with that setup they are a little bright and less full sounding. They work well for surrounds in my situation. I don't know about the CS10. I would ask your question on a Polk forum for a more informed answer.
They come with one.
It came in the typical Monster packaging style, in a nicely designed box and fully protected.
Yes. This has a crystal 319.5 learn mode transmitter so works with the GE Simon series alarm panels as well as the Concord series, NetWorx series and the older CareTaker Plus, Ultragard, Allegro, Commander 2000, Advent and SX-V Special. It does not work with the older CareTaker, SX-V, RF Commander or SX-IV panels.
the blower and heater board has two screw in that you can connect the power ends to.
120 gb ssd
Yes
Horrible sound. I returned it.
No, I used it with an iPod Classic and it did not need an adapter.
Mine was broken when it arrived, though in theory it should work with mini nano iPod...
I believe this is 10x optical zoom and digital zoom to 20x
I have a Compaq laptop and Epson workforce with uverse and I can print from my garage about 100ft and print no problem hope it helps, laptop has no Wi-Fi in it either.... There is a newer better version out now too, you might want to look into that, I know I am!
I don't believe so. You need the keyboard access to enter the router access and passwords, but you only have to do it once.
If the VGA and Audio ports are within 17" of each other, it will work.
Yes it will -check out Gary Fong's website by goggling him -I believe he is demonstrating it and further info provided -David
I have a Nikon D300s and it works fine on that. I am not sure about the Canon, but if it helps, the section that slides into the hotshoe has a gap in the centre of it, perhaps this is designed to bypass the switch?
Should work as it fits in any Nikon flash shoe.
I haven't had any issues. I purchased it to transfer files from a legacy HDD to a new SATA one and the new MB didn't support IDE. It worked without a problem in Windows XP and now is being used for the CD-ROM.
The head on the tripod is fully capable of a side tilt. This is a heavy duty tripod. I have used mine with a small jib/crane as well as a slider for video, and it is rock solid and steady.
I don't think so.
No, this is just an "extension cord", no volume control.
Yes, that extension will work for audio only with SoundTrue headphones.
I believe so... You can also use a boot mic on the top. I stopped using it because I find it too much of a pain downloading the videos onto my Mac... Great quality , easy to use... Just a pain to download...
You would have to contact Canon and ask them. Sorry I could not be of more help.
Are you sure they said the max size was 8 GB? Some people talk about using a 16 GB card on here. Maybe they meant 8 GB was the largest SDHC card available when the camcorder came out?
This cam DOES NOT capture hi def images, or video. It is a standard def camera, so if you have a regular tv it will play just fine, if you ever upgrade to a hi def tv, your videos will play just fine also. DVD's you author with videos made from this camera will work on a standard or hi def set.
yes, i just tried it out this weekend. running the latest version of OSX (10.5.2), iMove 08 captures video from the camera via firewire flawlessly. the quality is awesome.
You have to be somewhere where there is Wifi, like home or starbucks/panera's/internet cafes, etc.
Mine came with a processor and a fan. That's it. It may come with some kind of documentation, but mine did not.
240 should be ok but just so you know the power draw on idle http://www.pcstats.com/articleview.cfm?articleid=2394&page=2
It doesn't have that anywhere on the battery. The code marked is WALYNX-RCHB-SC K5109
No
I can simply answer this question by telling the customer not to buy this product, I bought this a little over a year ago and have had to have it replaced once only to have it go bad once again. The second time I just called it a loss and chucked the screen in the trash. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!
It's 4:3. The picture and dimensions listed are a bit off.
Any camera with lenses with 58mm thread
You only get 1 filter in the package.
yes if board has esata hookup and you have enable turn on esata in bios too after put it in,,it is very fast interface
12x107 ft. Yes.
I don't Think that is a Sigma product but it's a perfect reproduction and I haven't got any problem with. Fast shipping and customers attentions like thanks and origami. I've been satisfied.
yes, it can only record for 10 minutes at a time, it's in the manual. So you have to break it up into 10 minute segments.
Yes or just contact sony and they email it to u
I guess not. See here http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090304125652AAAw7kV
My daughter just bought this camera & it has an adapter in it that you put the SD card into so that it fits in the XD slot.
The sound on this camera is normal & good. Mine does not have that far away sound at all. I recorded my sons Christmas program and I can hear every word clearly.
I personally have the 850sw and purchased it because a friend had it and loved it. I think that an extra 2 megapixels is overkill and merely ads to the noise at higher ISO settings. As long as you follow the scene modes you will get very good shots. 8 megapixels is plenty enough for the crop factor to enlarge so an extra 2x is a mute issue with me.
I don't know of anyone that relies solely on a digital camera's internal memory.
Yes, no problem so far.
Yes, but from what I've found on Amazon, it's not NEARLY as wonderful as this one!!
I doubt it. Unless it uses normal windows drivers, it wont connect with their Bluetooth adapter.
Just to let you know you're not alone in wondering about an external mic input. I have two high-quality wireless microphones and a lot of experience using them. I won't consider a camcorder if it doesn't have an external audio input. I am disappointed that you haven't received a reply. Good Luck!
This model is an improvement to the SDR-H18 and is still priced comparatively. I think Amazon.com made a mistake. It is listed on Bestbuy.com as a ccd.
Just bought this, still learning about it. This is whats in the box: Battery pack, ac adaptor, ac cable, dc cable, av cable, usb cable, cd-rom.
Absolutely. It'll work perfect.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with either Audiovox, nor the the Lenmar battery.
No. And honestly - this product doesn't work at all anyway. I've only heard about 20% of buyers say it worked for them. If you're running XP, your chances are decent, but WinVis-Win7 is a for sure no-go. I decided to purchase something called an HD Game Capture from Elgato (their equipment is designed for Macs, but works well on windows as well) Check them out - it was more expensive, but worth every penny.
Yes...I currently use this with AFN.
Yes Per instructions, the audio out is for computer speakers (like my green plug) 3.5 mm : this is how I have mine set up.
Did your ps3 come with a mounting kit? You can find more information at this website https://support.us.playstation.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/5006/~/install-hard-disk-drive-%2812gb-ps3-%2F-cech-4201a%29 If you don't have a mounting kit they are inexpensive on amazon.
Yes sound leaks a lot due to the semi open driver backs.
It does, I've got the 32GB 3GS and it works just fine with it.
No idea about map my run but it does to Garmin training center. Shows HR, elevation, speed, route, etc. very good download.
The strap is included when you get this unit with HRM.
Yes, it will work with Dell Latitude series: D610 ATG D400 D410 D42 D430 D500 D505 D510 D520D531N D600 D620 D630 D630N D631 D631N D810 D820 D830 D830N. Note that the D/Port needs and uses the same PA-10 power supply as the notebook. You may want to check ebay there are several listings for this item. One is a new D/Port with PR01 power supply for $25
Yes, this is port replicator, so it works with open laptop. You can even have anothe display plugged in and used as a second display.
NO, your Inspiron 1545 will NOT connect to it. It does NOT have a docking port on the bottom of the laptop to do so. There are other "docking stations" or "port replicators" for your model but they only connect via USB and will not charge the battery. Get your DC power jack fixed is your only option. TRY http://www.pcrepairhelp.net/ $69 repair plus shipping -OR- http://powerjackrepair.net/ $100 return shipping included. Good Luck!
Yes it fit my 15 1/2 inch laptop.
I use the contour handle all the time to carry my bag. The handle fits well in my hand, it is, however, just a little too short to put over my shoulder.
Yes, it will fit a 2" binder along with a laptop in the main zipper section. But, not much more than that.
Yes it will.. it works with mine.
The wider field of view and the small camera size of the DMC-FX35 are things I like. The FX35 can be purchased today too while the TZ5 cannot. But, I am leaning toward the TZ5 because I also value the features of continuous autofocus and 10x optical zoom and its field of view is also wider than most cameras. This Panasonic page shows the differences between different fields of view. http://panasonic.co.jp/pavc/global/lumix/popup/wide_angle/index.html This Panasonic page shows feature differences between the two cameras. http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/vModelComparisonResults?storeId=15001&catalogId=13401&catGroupId=75047&surfCategory=Lumix%20Digital%20Cameras&cacheProgram=11002&cachePartner=7000000000000005702&items=214163|214166|213677|
The digital zoom may only be turned on in Normal, Scn1, Scn2 or Movie mode. Press 'Menu/Set' -&gt; Select Digital Zoom off/on
Lensmate is a company that specializes in filter adapters for these types of cameras. I used their adapter for my Canon SX10 and was very pleased. I think the web address is lensmateonline.com
It was quite expensive. Anyone looking at it was probably also looking at the LX3 which has become the reference camera. Now, it can be had for $200 and is a good deal. Same sensor as FX35.
Yes
I am having the same issue ... found your post when looking for a solution
The chcarger that should come with it, is a plug in box that the battery goes into. I don't think you can charge it with the battery inside the camera. You can search ebay for fufi j10 charger to maybe see a picture of it. The batteries can varry on how long of a charge they hold based on how old they are or use they have had. Replacement batteries can be searched for by type number/model number of the battery probably both on amazon or ebay. Factory batteries are usually the best types.
yes, and yes
Go to JVC.com--When the page opens, in the upper right corner click on the "Support" tab--Put the model of your camcorder in the search box--Then click the "manual" tab and you can download a PDF file of your recorder's manual--After you download it to your computer, you print a copy if you wish--
Did you updated the drivers, try what it says here: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/windows-7-driver-problem-for-jvc-everio-hard-drive/dca93734-17a9-4053-90a6-f70a4206295b
The fd1000 does not zoom while recording. The Fuji S4500 does. Set the zoom on the 1000 before starting your recording and you will be OK. This might be just an economy measure. 1000 is older. Maybe that . Otherwise, do not really know. Set it prior the shoot.
Some sites sell battery covers for around $50 but if you buy another model of the same camera, you can just take the battery cover from that one.
Very easy to transfer pics to a computer--just pop out the memory card and insert it into the memory card slot in your computer. you can then view all your photos from the card or copy them to your computer hard drive and then view them from there. This is a great point and shoot camera. The best feature we like is that it also has the view finder that makes taking photos in bright light easier when you can no longer see the image on the LCD screen.
The camera itself says "Japan"
Yes, you have to buy cables separately. I did not receive any cables with the speaker set.
Yes. I used mine on this device while I had it. You charge the ipod with the USB cable and cigarette lighter adapter. The USB cable goes into the bottom of the device and the connector on the top goes into your ipod. I found the transmitter to be too weak so I returned this item. I prefer the Satechi Soundfly SD. http://www.amazon.com/Soundfly-Player-Transmitter-Stick-Players/dp/B0018P7WZ2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1377260749&sr=8-1&keywords=Soundfly+SD You can't recharge with the Soundfly but the FM transmitter is far superior to the one in your inquiry.
It will work with any Apple product with a 30-pin connector. For further assistance, please email support@satechi.com. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
Im pretty sure it works on both. Id check out their website to be sure.
About four inches.
I didn't. The power adapter needs to be plugged in to a power outlet and connected to the booster by a coax. I had a short coax from my cable company lying around and used that.
The camcorder is 6 cm thick, 8.5 cm tall, and 11 cm long.
Hi D., you can use the 8cm DVD+RW disc on this camcorder. It can be used for recording. -Vincent
No HD, but its close to it in quality, we use it for ghost hunting and the night shot is great for that and its our main vacation can!
Is your HDrive on your computer formatted to FAT32? Reformat your HDrive to NTFS. Take note that each time your downloads breaks down it is an exact amount of time, each time.
Answer: I have never used a lens hood on the video camera, I didn't know there even was a lens hood made for the camera. I suspect using a lens hood could limit the amount of light being captured by the camera and in low light situations might cause a problem. The thread size is 37mm. Sorry I can't help you.. RC
Hi Dennis, Low-light scenarios is a general issue with personal video cameras. Simply put, you can not expect the same video quality for low light conditions as for sunshine day recordings. I have Canons HF11 and am actually quite impressed how good the quality of the low light sensitivity became nowadays (I am recording fireworks). Under which conditions are you taking a video, whats the object ?
Yes it will most definitely work. I have the same one but it's mounted on a roof with the same type of dish, I get all the sats, 110,119 and 128 which is ceil for HD channels. You shouldn't have any problems as long as you have a decent sat finder. Hope I was a help to you. Good luck with your install.
I am sorry I can not Help you. I never did get it to work
I have not ever heard the term "Western type LNB." I am in northern California, and it works great . . if that is of any help.

Hi Jessica: Looks like this camera uses AA batteries. This means the charger is not needed,nor provided by Sony. Yet, I do see a couple of sellers give rechargeable AA batteries with chargers. You really should direct this question tp the seller. I hope this will help you.
Not sure about the D610, but it works with our D7100, also full frame. One thing we noticed about the Tamron lens is that it tends not to focus any more. Some playing around with the lock "resolves" the problem. This happens in combination with the D90. We are now using the lens on the D7100 to figure out if the problem is the body or the lens.
You can set 10.
Yeah it fits the 4 1. But I wouldn't recommend it. It only lasted me like 2 weeks before the battery swell up.
I am not sure and they might have changed but isn't iTunes for IPods only as they use a different format. The Mac OS X version of iTunes can also synchronize with a small number of discontinued digital music players,[47] while the Windows version will support only the iPod.[48] The synchronization is limited, however, in that the iPod is the only digital music player compatible with Apple's proprietary FairPlay digital rights management technology, and thus most music purchased through the iTunes Store can only be played on an iPod.
No, it has an internal rechargeable battery.
Yes. I have been using it for several years. Works great.
I have a SB 500 and 600 and the flash connector fits fine.
Sure will, it's just a cage to hold the drives with a fan on front. Just make sure you have enough free drive bays to accommodate it.
Yes
The BOSS PSA-120S adapter has a center Negative (-) and the external barrel Positive (+).
This is 220v model: BOSS, MODEL: PSA-120S, INPUT: 100-240V 50-60Hz 250mA, OUTPUT: 9V 0.5A 4.5W
You would have to invent a bracket, attach a board or something.
I don't see why not took a look at your boat online.... Should be able the mount it on the sides.... I use mine on a sit inside fishing kayak and it works just fine.. Just gets in the way alittle bit when I make a far move
Sorry, I don't know the answer to that. Mine was a custom installation where I had to glue them in place.
I bought them expecting them to be normal size about 2 inches or so and they were about less than an inch
It fit my a300 fine and to my knowledge the 330 & tbe 300 is the same body just different internal components. Fyi ... this is not a true sony product. They advertise it as such and it is not. This is an Chinese copy but it still works. I sent them an email bitching about false advertising and they refunded me 40%
Only the A200, A300 and A350. They all share the same basic chassis, later cameras are different.
Yes, it will.
I don't know. I have a EOS 6D
Hi Suz, yes you can attached your Sony DCR-SX41 to this Sony tripod VCT-80AV. However, for the remote controller, it is not compatible with your camera. -Ely
I'm guessing it should. I have a Sony HDR-XR160 & it works perfectly.
Not sure
Same frustration, I have been unable to find out if such an animal exists. I do not believe so...
No and to be honest, vc or os is not worth the extra cash
It certainly does fit the Sony A700 camera. I have used this lens with that particular Sony body. It takes great photos. I also use it on my Sony A77 camera body.
It is a WD Scorpio Blue (SATA 3 Gb/s): http://www.wdc.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=506 But newer revisions of the WD Passport seem to be unsuitable for use without the enclosure. See: http://forum.notebookreview.com/showthread.php?t=307430
I don't know. You'd have to check the dimensions. Is it the same as dimensions the Bottom Line Fishin Buddy 140c (you can check the Hummingbird web site)? If it is, it works great with my tube and my sit on top Kayak (I run the strap thru the supper holes).
No
No Blue ray does not work on my player
I wish I could tell you 100% yes. It says it is all region free and will play any dvd from any country or region so I imagination it would. I know this answer it's that helpful but so far mine has never given me a problem with any region I've tried. I hope this helps.
I do not believe there is any Input to this DVD player. The DVD's are the source of the video signal and there are multiple choices of Output. This is not a recorder so there is no call for video Input.
nope, just 2... and u can use both sides to secure. eg handlebar or stem.
Sorry, I replaced the lamp and did not have that issue afterwards
I am not sure&gt; However once it is a Bluetooth adapter it should work. Please check the actual car stereo from JVC and see if this adapter works.
if you can see the picture, that means, the lens is working, the tv. won't tell you is on.....If you see the picture then go to menu, and reset the date when it was replaced, The fan I think is for cooling, but Iam not positive......
I checked with our IT folks and the answer it, it should. We have OS 10.9 at this point, but IT updates every couple of months.
Works fine for me. Faster than wifi.
What was the solution? I have the same problem with mine (sort of). It beeps, but so faintly that you have to put your ear right up next to the camera body to hear it. I did figure out where it eminates from; I took the lens off and set it to timed shutter release (so that I could here it beeping continuosly, and it comes from inside the camera behind the mirror. Is yours audible now, or just barely faintly beeping?
1600 is your max ISO
If the lens is a Pentax Bayonet mount it will fit this camera. I use several manual lens from the 1980's on my K20d. The manual lenses will of course only function as a manual, and you will have to set aperture and focus yourself.
No, but there is a new version of this lens that is WR.
Richard, did you end up purchasing this for your jeep? My husband has a 2003 jeep wrangler and I thought this would be a great gift especially since he off-roads alot. I am just not sure as the specifications are geared towards a boat. Thanks for any information
No. But the batteries last a really long time. This is the best pocket-sized radio I have ever owned.
This mount is not a swing out mount and thus stays parallel to the wall. However as you can see in the picture of the mount it does have a tilt feature where you can angle the screen downward to reduce glare or provide a better viewiing angle if it's mounted higher than typical. I hope I understood your question correctly and was able to give you the answer you sought.
Yes you can add your CD's to your IPOD without the internet. You will need ITunes though. If you have the program already, it's very easy. Go into your preferences under "Edit". Hit the tab for Advanced, than within this section, key on the tab for Importing. In this section is where you tell your computer to copy the songs to ITunes. There are 3 drop-down menus you need to change to allow this. Once there you just move them to your IPOD.
Yes it does
Amazon issue probably - find another site
You can find it online in pdf format and printable here: http://www.ithomeproducts.com/sites/default/files/pdf/itrr-501-manual.pdf
yes there is a place to plug in phones or aux speakers
It should work for your 2005. YouTube this product for the install. Looks tough but very simple in the end. Have a safe place such as a cup to put all the screws into. Also use a magnetic screwdriver if you have it. For iPod or whatever buy a simple RCA cable that connects to the red/white RCAs in the products picture.

I have a 2007 with navi.. really doesn't work great. if I have the ipod playing I can't use the navigation. never could get the phone part to work. if I don't need to use the navi then the ipod plays fine, but can't control with radio. hope that helps
Its the same as the retail processor, but the seller buys in bulk so its not in original packaging and doesn't come with a cooler. Same processor, though.
The one I have is about 15.5 inches wide
The cap on mine fits pretty tight. I am happy with it. Good luck
Yes!, thats the camera i own.
I use the Fiio, it uses a single AAA battery, its cheap and ill be damned if it doesnt make these bad boys light up!
yes
I just bought this camera recently and I'm guessing the answer is no. I've been trying to figure out a way to get the date on and it's just not possible. This is like the 4th camera I've bought for myself and I'm a little disappointed that I can't put the dates on. But all in all it's still a good camera.
I do have a choice and I own them both. I take them both on field trips. The S100FS is faster in getting action shots, but the HS30EXR allows me to get closer to my subject. I usually shoot from a tripod using a cable release.
None. It does come with a puny 32MB SD card, but for what they cost, pick up a 2 or 4GB one.
I found the Canon Rebel XSi a fairly easy to use. Of course I had used this type camera before so it was not very difficult for me to immediately pick up and use. The lens that comes as standard with it should be adequate; however lens are interchangeable and a different focal lens may in line to adapt for different occasions. I think just off the shelf the camera will suffice. This Rebel is one tough one for every use with the proper lens.
I'm not 100% sure about this camera in particular, but most cameras fit the standard tripod. The screw on the tripod is a standard size, and fit most cameras and camcorders.
It's approx. 4" wide by 13" long and a shade over an inch thick. mHope that helps you out
I probably could if i could get the thing to sync with my wifi, but i cannot, so it sits up in my closet. A boat anchor. Better to get a Bose Soundtouch for internet radio. I did. It is easy to use, syncs with my wifi without any fuss, and has great sound.
I googled it and what I found says "yes" The 18778 is suppose to work with all Celestron series.
I'm pretty sure it won't fit in this case. My larger lenses won't fit. I have to carry them separately in their own cases.
Yes
Not sure what you mean by box, but this is all you need in between your aftermarket head-unit and the harness embedded in your dash (leading to your car's factory amplifier).
yes. never add an amp to an amplified antenna. something is going to burn out.
Yes, this will work with any outdoor/attic antenna. With Amazon's liberal return policy you have nothing to lose by trying it. Mine has worked for 5 years now without a single/signal problem.
Just as you did, I would check with Crucial at crucial.com and use their system analyzer to determine if this is a fit. That's what I did! I was able to use these and went from 2GB to 4GB and was extremely pleased with the increase of performance. In my opinion it's a great value for the gain in performance. I suspect if the specs are the same it will work.
Paste either of the following links into your web browser, either will work: http://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-2-0-Male-Cable-Feet/dp/B001MSU1HG/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1388266733&sr=1-2&keywords=usb+cable or http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Hi-Speed--Male-B-Male-Meters/dp/B001TH7GUA/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1388266733&sr=1-3&keywords=usb+cable One end is the standard rectangulare USB connector, and the other should be the square connector with 2 rounded corners. Both are available through Amazon.com.
You need to set it up as a repeater fpor your existing router, which is a feature of the unit that is not even mentioned on the box. Then put it midway to the point at which you want to extend the signal.
Yes, but it would be best to have the Trendnet help desk (phone # in documentation) assist you in the set up, which is as yet manual for Mac. It's not hard and my phone experience was positive. After that no further issues,works well. CV
yes just use the phone "filters" like you would with your service
Yes
Hi Michelle! Yes it will work. This camera can use A-mount lenses. -Anthony
Completely interchangeable. Only older Sigma lenses may not work fully, but those lenses aren't worth keeping anyways.
Photo frames have an input for several types of memory card and will read jpg files directly from the card. Some frames have built in memory for a limited number of pictures which you load via USB. A portable DVD usually has no memory card slot but you can of course make a DVD on your PC to show a selection of slides. Video editing programs will allow you to crop your pictues plus pan and zoom but this is a tiresome process.
Great idea, and think how useful it would be in eg a hurricane type emergency when the electricity cuts out and you're left wondering what's happening! (in our area radio stations just ignore hurricanes and suchlike.)
This is a critical question for me and I can't find the answer any place.
Yes, comes with AC Adaper and 12 v DC Car Cigerette lighter charger.
get the sony I checked them both out at CC and the Sony blows away the Pana. See for yourself the picture is really nice on the Sony, the pana is just OK. also no remote for the Pana or swivel screen.
Huh! Figure! I never expected it to work in such a dated player, but indeed my dozen or so JPG's burned on to a CDRW (just to answer your question) did in fact display on this unit. That's the only format I tested as it's the only one you mentioned.
I've never heard a loud whirring with my unit. The only time the disc makes noise is when it is first loading. If it is a home made DVD, the player makes lots of "searching" noises, but when it finally starts to play, it is very quiet. I'd say your friend has a defective unit.
I have a Nikon D5100 and got this but the Mini-B 5 pin is incompatible with Nikon. I had to purchase the USB A Female to Mini B Female Adapter ( http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JJTIEW/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 ) and used the Nikon supplied connector (UC-E6 Micro USB cable) - http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-25604-UC-E6-USB-Cable/dp/B0000A1VS3/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1408215895&sr=1-3&keywords=Nikon+micro+usb- to attach to this adapter on the USB side.
I had the same question, what you have to do is call them, the replacement is 15 bucks plus shipping, here is their number 866-602-7742.
Yes
The answer to your ? is yes it will. The bt500 is mentioned as a btooth connection device in the user manual for the printer on page 23 chapter 4. For the price you cant go wrong. Thanks for asking. TG
It is likely the lubricant used. I had the same issue and bad performance on this line of product. In about two month the head was stiff and locking bolt broke. Hope this helps.
If you have a standard thumb drive already, you can buy an adapter cable at most computer stores and some office supply stores.
As there is no disc/software as with the Kodak, just convert them to jpegs ( in a seperate iPhoto file/so you don't get the lower res photos mixed up and you should be good to go.
Wouldn't we all. If budget is limited, go with previous 60mm micro; it's outstanding. Not a huge saving, but a saving nonetheless.
Yes, it will. You can confirm this by looking at Nikon's information about the lens.
Yes.
Not 100% on the 4, but I have a 4s and I dock it every night to charge. I've had this for about 4 years now and it's worked with my iPod nano, by son's iPod touch and now my iPhone 4s. Love it.
800?
Yes
Go to http://www.igo.com/power/power-tips/icat/tips for your answer. If the specific pruduct you have does not appear oa a choice, send iGo an e-mail and you will get a prompt response.
With the Sony players, you can use Windows Media if you want...it's compatible. However, it doesn't force you to. If you prefer, you can also use a simple drag-and-drop with folders, like a mass storage device.
After looking closer at my camera it is a Sony Cybershot DSC-P73. Whether or not the 3 makes a difference, I don't know yet. But, if that's the case, then it was my mistake in not looking closely enough.
It's just a single speaker. "No such thing as a silly question, just silly answers."
The lowest possible position of your monitor will depend on its size. I have a 23.6" widescreen monitor. When the monitor is positioned vertically, it can go all the way down to the point where it touches the base ring. When the monitor is positioned horizontally, it can go down to a point about .5" above the ring. Smaller monitors, in the horizontal position, would likely sit above the ring a bit further, but this will also be dependent on where the mounting holes on the back of the monitor are centered.
No. Just bare wire connections. But this device does an outstanding job. I have two and have connected two receivers together. I would HIGHLY recommend this product.
No and No (the product has no sensor built in that would detect signals from any remote).
No warm up time required. Plug it in, turn it on, and you're ready to go. I think that Pyle audio equipment is an excellent value. I've purchase four pieces of equipment over the last several years and have been very happy with everything that I've bought.
I just went to Channel Master's website, and it appears they combined the inputs. Be careful buying Amazon Warehouse, as I bought a CM-7777 that was used (FM trap set to "OFF") and no mast mounting hardware
Everything you need to use it is in the box: The pre-amp, the power supply, cables, etc. Been using it since last spring and it improved considerably my signal.
No, it does not.
There is no remote.
I haven't done that, but it should work. If you have electric defroster wires in your rear window, they may reduce the signal strength.
Only if it is comparable with new fittings. They have changed the pins so you need to check. I had to buy a new stereo as well
The two versions are the A16, which does not have image stabilization (for cameras like Pentax with IS in the body) and the B005, which has image stabilization in the lens. Auto focus in both is driven by the camera.
No...n please don't waste your money 2weeks after installation the camera started blinking in an out upon me putting my truck in reverse, now you will see the screen say back up camera but no picture, at night it wasn't Any good at all because of the LED lights and the plate lights It was to much light..It was suppose to be water proof but isn't not...
No, there are no jumpers for usage with chipsets that do not properly perform speed auto-negotiation. This drive was not detected by an older motherboard with the VIA VT8237 chipset. It will work fine with SATA 1.0 chipsets that are forward compatible though.
Don't know. We purchased this specific drive as a replacement for a defective drive in one of our RAID systems
The battery does not work, and does not fit in the slot for it.
no, it is for cameras. Maybe if the connectors were adapted, maybe. It would not be as functional as a dvr for satellite or cable.
Yes...that is correct
Connects via the MiniDisplay port
Yes, the Apple Cinema Display is designed to work with the MacBook Pro. I have the late 2012, but I had the 2010 also. The Display not only works with the MacBook Pro, it provides power and a hub with usb, thunder bold, firewire, and either net all with a single cable.
I do have it hooked up that way, and I've done it in two different ways. Initially, I did have it hooked up to my laptop, and could use both this screen and the small laptop screen as dual monitors. Last year, I purchased a new Apple iMac, and am able to use the iMac's screen with this screen in a dual monitor set up. You just plug the Thunderbolt connector on the Cinema display to the Thunderbolt port on the iMac, and it works great.
2010
It is pre-installed. They send the sotware on two discs for future use if needed.
I called Amazon's computer help line and was told they will only offer the matte finish.
Thats frys, amazons stuff always comes for me. I got mine a good while ago, was less than 8 weeks for sure. And I didn't have to mail anything or damage my box, it was all automated.
OSX 10.6.8 has Preview, a program with tools to adjust color, contrast, size, and to save in formats like .png, .jpg, .tif, .gif, .pdf, etc. Preview can also rotate, crop, resize. There is no word processing in Mac OSX, but can get free download of a powerful suite Apache OpenOffice that runs on 32-bit or 64-bit depending on your processor. I have Intel Core 2 Duo 2.4 Gz which is 64-bit.
I think that you should get a new version of a macbook pro. This one is a old version and doesnt run the new OS X mountain lion.
It definitely should
Yes, they do. Just need to use your network's password and save it.
It comes with a USB Cord that plugs into the computer for charging. However, the directions say that you can plug the USB into a regular wall plug, I.e. take the USB portion of your Droid/iPhone cord off and plug this cord into the "wall plug" portion of that cord. Hope that helps....
Yes. Provided you keep it charged. Essentially, it is a spare battery pack and will charge my iPhone completely in less than an hour.
I have the iPhone 5 and it works great!
No it does not work on solar power you will need to charge it with the micro usb cable either plugged into your pc or any 5v power supply from your phone. Hope this helps
The easiest way to gain apps is by looking through your phone to see if you have the Google play store. If you do, that's where you'll get them. If you don't have the google play store, i would try to download that first. Start there and Good luck!
Yes you can download apps. I don't recall if there's a sd card port. If there is make sure you know the player's capacity before you spend your bucks.
I was never able to get mine to work, so I have no idea.
It fits my a 550, and should fit any A mount Sony.
It uses a Sony/Minolta A mount so I doubt it.
Most single din indash TV will fix as long as it does not have a fold up or down feature. Pioneer is a good band and is a good combination with this product.
No
Yes
The quality of the squeezebox output would be a lot better than the airport.
Not very well, so far. It has failed to include my playlists which hold several hundred tunes each. It would take days to manually rebuild them on the Squeezecenter software. if anyone knows how to remedy this i would be gartefull for the info.
I used a stupid-cheap Boss 1100w amp. Had a billion great reviews. Sounds fantastic.
The strobe is xenon, with a duration of 1/750s at full power and ~1/6,000s at 1/16 power. Rule of thumb to totally freeze flapping humming bird wings is 1/20,000s, so it falls short for that purpose. Gravity based drips, on the other hand, are frozen at ~1/1,500s. For me, it did a pretty good job freezing water sprayed on a model's face from a squeeze bottle at about 1/8 power.
Don't worry about that.I received correct item .
No. According to C. Stallings I've totally misunderstood how these work. Please seek out C. Stallings's comments for further information.
Hello Art, I use Gefen with my wireless headphones and sometimes I have to put in TV volume for others and I hear a slight echo which is not bad. I think the lag depends on both the adapter and the wireless transmitting device. I would ask the manufacturer of the wireless transmitting device to suggest the best adapter for their product. That is how I got Gefen for my Sennheiser wireless headphones.
I have not tried it myself but as long as the output is 1-bit serial digital and you are driving a stereo analog input, you should be fine. I had an old stereo amp I used for awhile for my tv that drove 160 watt speakers and it was great. So the unit did not add any appreciable hum in the output.
There about 2inches thick around where the subs go and an inch thick all the way around. The box sounds really good I bought one for my12s pioneer comps series pro there 3500watts and they take it. But after time the box does began to show cracks. Just depends on how much bass your using. Great box tho
Not a problem at all! It's still a great sound
I have it for a re audio sex 15 with 650 watt rms amp it slams my truck plus the ml 320 has perfect sound damping
Not sure but it gets low and loud with a 15 inch memphis mojo
I don't know, I didn't buy the dual 12 inch enclosure, I bought the dual ten inch.. Sorry..
It's a Sealed, Down-Firing box. Hope that help.
The hole size are for 10" ( flat speakers ) they hold better sound for that box & yes the seat would still latch
You have to run your own wires from the quick connection to the subs. I recommend nothing less than 16 gage but encourage to run 12 or 14 gage. Make sure to have some weather stripping for the subs AND for where the quick connections meet the box. A even better solution is to use silicone to seal where the quick connections meet the box.
Yes. When you look inside before putting in your sub you will see a bead if glue around all seams. I have had it for about a year now and it has held up well.
It will do the trick for any 12 inch circular subwoofer. The only thing you need to be sure of is that you measure the entrance to your trunk. I had an issue getting the box into the trunk of my 79 trans am. It would have fit fine inside, but I couldn't get it through the trunk opening. Food for thaught.
This comes with a standard 4 pin molex female connector which will match up with the male connector which is commonly found in any pc power supply.
You will have to control the volume on the plug in device
I was wondering the same thing. Given there's no mention of FM radio, I doubt this is the 2009 version. I'll be shopping elsewhere.
That tends to happen to me after a year of constant use--usually rebooting solves it temporarily. Some of the other Wacom tablets are wireless-compatible, maybe for this reason. I use the tablets for everything, to reduce wrist movement, so I don't mind replacing them; but if yours is new, replace it (belated advice).
Its pretty quiet. Its not silent, but it isn't loud enough to notice for the most part. I sometimes forget that its on.
Overall or just middle pocket?
There is no way to print wirelessly though you could print across the network if the machine attached to the printer is turned on. The only good thing about this printer is the small footprint. Otherwise it will give you trouble in ways you never imagined. Steer clear!
All the AM stations I have in my area come in very good with this unit. Hope that helps.
Yes, but they do not stay set. As soon as the radio is unplugged from ac or batteries die the presets are lost. And they are very hard to reprogram.
You press the 1 preset button with the radio off, I believe...
It comes with a cord and also runs on D cell batteries.
most likely is the lamp is no good or it those not have a lamp,if the projector is used,you file a claim. to amazon in your account section.....
Yes, these sensors can be attached with velcro however the main base stattion has an 'ON-OFF' switch.
ask GE
If it is a Vizia RF switch it should work. The RF is the important part. Look for the Z-wave logo on the package if possible. Good luck. BTW I would spring for the remote with the LCD screen. Makes the setup much easier, it will display if the "pairing " was successful. I have 5 devices on the remote with the LCD display and they work fine.
Don't need one per device. The repeater picks up signal from multiple devices. You don't need a repeater per zone- the repeater sends signal to the main device which distributes to your various zones
I didn't try to daisy chain it, but it didn't double range as specified. My base was about 100 feet from a gate I had it on and I needed the repeater to go through 3-pane storm windows. The base could not pick up a gate that less than 50 feet around a corner without the repeater. Hope the answer helps.
It just increases the range of your system. It doesn't change anything with the zones. You'd probably need a second controller for that.
No the wireless monitor can not be connected to a computer to my knowledge. I would not recommend you get this product especially if you are planning on wanting to record.
Yes I have a rear view camera and this tv installed in my 2007 expedition
Yes you shouldn't have a problem with it.
not with this one...... this one is a wired camera and can only go 60ft from home best to find a wireless camera that has an app for your computer or phone
YES, IT IS ALL ONE PIECE AND FITS WELL
I have the GN9120, which this fit perfectly. I don't know if it's compatible to the GN9350.
Yes, the Philips unit will work as a digital converter. It has two tuners- one analog and one digital. Use the remote to select the digital tuner and it will output the digital channels in your area (provided you're getting a good signal from your antenna) to your analog TV.
Without breaking the cable, no it cannot. The point of the cable is to have the most secure connection between the steel wire and the carabiner, so that it can withstand high amounts of weight.
Yes I have an iPhone 5 and it work just fine with the adapter
not sure... but it works great in my '06 ES330 (although it does take up the input for the satellite radio... easy sacrifice for me)
I'm not sure of the question but if there is a signal the radio should lock on to the station. I have only used the radio in the city..hope this helps.
- one triple AAA =/to 'fair to good' battery life (this is my second one of these radios in seven years - excellent reception AM [at night] + FM) I LOVE this little powerhouse of a radio !!!
Overhead-headphones on mine.
Because it is a picture in picture. Not the whole screen. You would need to flip.
not sure I do know this series was part of a class action law suit with this size not included but still defective I own one and have spent more on repairs than on the tv itself it has been worked on 6 times in five years buy something else anything but Samsung
do not buy this tv unless you are prepared to have it repaired every year you own it!
Had this problem as well a long time ago. What I ended up doing was, because the unit is wood, you can install an exhaust fan on the back of the stand and turn it on before you start playing.. It's kind of a hack but it worked great on cooling everything down. Hope that helps!
750 has an additional woofer speaker for better bass, a solid state flash drive with some preloaded content - consisting of "exercise, children edutainment, cooking recipes, image gallery & games", and it is DLNA certified. Physically, the 750 is rectangular, note the curve of 650 at the bottom. The "Touch of Color" red bezel is on all four sides, not just the top and bottom. Also the clear part of the bevel is slightly thicker around the edge. Edit: Also forgot that the stand base on the 750 is rectangular, versus the oval of the 650.
according to crutchfield it will
If your factory stereo is double DIN size and you have the right wire harness then yeah its pretty much plug and play. Works great with iphone/ipod touch via usb cable or bluetooth.
You sure can!
No, only plasmas and LCDs can be wall-mounted.
Mrs. Smith, Please reach out to the Samsung customer service center for troubleshooting and service. Thanks for your support of Samsung products. --Mr. S
Sure...if you're willing to spend money. Either the the T-com is bad which will run approximately $350 to repair or the Panel is bad which is around $900. Either way, with TV's having dropped so much in price it just doesn't make sense to repair it.
I am sure you can, as long as you can receive the DTV air signal.
Just play the 8mm on some unit like a camcorder, and send the signal to the DVR610's input jacks.
I was soo close to getting the 4081, but then the 750 series came around, and had the usb & lan inputs, plus the 750 has a better viewing angle 178* as opposed to 4081's 170* hdmi ports didn't make any difference to me. I saw the lan input as a possible upgrading futureproofing option (downloading new firmware and such).
I have a similar problem.. but it's not in the red portion. Mine looks like it's separating from the black edge that meets the screen edge at the bottom portion of the bezel. Amazon is sending out a replacement as we speak but I hope this isn't going to be in the replacement as well.
M. Guerrero...well said. All very good points. However, you forgot to mention that Best Buy is among the "Bait & Switch" royalty, being notorious for having items priced in their sale papers or website that are misleading at best and could be more accurately described as fraudulent. Such a store will never get my business. I do frequent local electronics stores that have an opportunity to compete for my business and I am willing to pay a little more for the service they offer on my purchases.
It's on the first page of reviews, from July 8, 2008. It is a long review, but the info on the black tweeking is in there.
plasma = panasonic LCD = samsung
must be hooked to some source of signal (cable, antenna, etc)
If your ps3 blu-ray setting is on 1080p 24, it won't work. Switch it off, then re-start your ps3. From there, movie plus mode is no longer greyed out.
if your power supply doesn't already have the proper connector (I think this card has a 6-pin PCI-e power) then you can use one of the following two links which are Molex to PCI-e and SATA to PCI-E adapters. http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-6-Inch-Express-Adapter-LP4PCIEXADAP/dp/B0007RXDDM/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1396353653&sr=1-2&keywords=pcie+power+cable http://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-SATPCIEXADAP-6-Inch-Express-Adapter/dp/B007Y91B80/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1396353653&sr=1-6&keywords=pcie+power+cable
I don't own the set but I would imagine it's the capacitors inside it that are discharging electricity. My Toshiba LCD does this after I turn it off every time. Anyway, I've read about this a little and I would presume it's okay, unless it's truly excessive.
Hi, On newer plasmas, this is not much of an issue. The Panasonic Plasmas utilize a "pixel shift" which avoids the image burn which occurred in the past. Just don't leave the same image on the screen for an extended period of time, and use the tv in "full screen" mode for the first 100 hours, and you will be fine.
Qstarz is set up to run with Windows. Check the Qstarz website for Android connectivity. I could Bluetooth to Windows 7, but only for 10 minutes or so, the Bluetooth part of these small GPS units is notoriously poor, and loses Bluetooth connection on a regular basis.
Yes. it's a different dish and transducer for HD. Not only that, but the DISH HD satellite is in a different orbit, so the dish would need to be realigned to the HD satellite.
my Panasonic tv suggested it as the only after market adaptor I could use besides their expensive one , when I plugged it in .. it picked up my router and I got Netflix and many other sites,it is 3 years old and still working great.
I put mine in yhe weep holes of our brick walls and it turned brown
no
I really can't say for sure. I have a computer savvy friend and he told me to order this particular one. All I can say is; it works fine on my COMPAQ desktop.. It increased my factory rated 2 GB to 4 GB.... Sorry, I couldn't be of more help..Jerry
I received firmware version 3.AHL for Barracuda 7200.9. But probably doesn't mean you will get exact one.
Who knows, when mine came it was IDE not SATA
The native resolution of this tv is 720p so everthing gets converted to this resolution (1080p, 1080i, 525, etc.) when displayed.
Can be used with any system including samsung
Yes, if the unit can receive the channels from the antenna.
probanbly not. dvd's have a coding making them impossible or very difficult to copy. a special software is needed.
It is suppose to but be warned, after one year this item completely malfunctioned and Panasonic support did NOTHING to help. It is junk. Panasonic video equipment is not durable at all and they do not know how to fix it or are unwilling. After numerous phone calls and emails they offered me a 10% discount on a replacement item only good at full price Panasonic store. Buy Samsung 1st or Sony second.
Not that I found. We resorted to getting a mobile folder box for it so it could be transported.
You can record if you receive your TV signal from an antenna and you can record on a VHS from the DVD player.
You can try this: http://www.videohelp.com/dvdhacks/samsung-dvd-1080p8/9266
they will at low power , any zoom and and the exit gets smaller and amaller
Yes
maybe once or twice a month
Very comfy. They are adjustable. They cup your whole ear. The foam is really soft.
I don't know about the 110, but i own the 54g2. The stock Linksys firmware is not so good, IMO, but the open-source Linux-based dd-wrt firmware adds many features. Some of the dd-wrt features are options to boost speed and range, via various means (e.g. setting transmitter power output, creating a G-only network, etc.) Here is a description of some of the advanced wireless settings: http://www.dd-wrt.com/help/english/HWirelessAdvanced.asp And basic wireless settings: http://www.dd-wrt.com/help/english/HWireless.asp For more info about dd-wrt firmware, please see my review:
Ya and it sucks too that that happened. Still, this router ROCKS! Kinda sad tho that just when I bought this one, other merchants were selling the wrt110 for less money. Whatever, I wouldn't be able to take advantage of it anyways.
It does come with a cloth pouch to carry the headphones but it's not made of leather.
My estimate is about 50 feet but the signal strength falls off quite dramatically at that distance. In our 3,800 sqft house there are areas where I have no signal. The house has 3 levels with all 9' ceilings. I will be installing a range extender. The router works otherwise quite well!
seem to recieve the same even in extream conditions , I hope this awnswers your question
We used 75 Ohm I read the directions and if you are using outside antenna then us 75, inside you can use 50 Ohm. The phone number to Wilson Electronics is 1-866-294-1660
11x7.5x4.25 from what i can remember. i sent them back so i no longer have them to measure.
Most likely it will. It's universal
I have a case on my phone and it never even feels warm from the heater.
Takes me about 10 minutes from start to picture
The vuqube should only be for DirecTV already .you my have to call them.
I have a direct tv receiver. The VuQube will operate on either direct tv or dish network. I have set my cube up several times while camping in my RV. It works great, the only problem I have is it will not pick up my local channels.
According to forums, all variants of the XD use the same sights.
Yes, it is. Good quality, too.
In general a color conversion (warm or cooling) filter is just that regardless of camera or lens it is placed in front of. I sometimes use it when taking shots of sunsets/sunrises with my D7000. If you want a lens strictly for protection then get the best quality crystal clear lens possible-no distortion or color shift at all. If you are relatively careful a protection lens will not be necessary. Remember you will need one for each size diameter lens you own unless you buy step up/down rings. Most actual lenses are recessed (not all) so scratching it rare.
If you just need the cord, it's generic and can be replaced at most electronic supply stores. If you need the part with the inverter box, it uses a proprietary connector on the back of the speaker so that would have to be obtained from Altec Lansing directly.
I do it all the time. I have a 23" wide screen monitor, and routinely resize the window.
No not at all.
Nope don't buy it
My camera is an older model, I believe. It's a SP-570UZ. Works perfectly for it!
Yes. As long as your TV has a HDMI port too.
YES, with full autofocus capabilities. When I first bought this lens I used it on my D70. I love this lens! Just got back from hawaii with it and it was a joy to use as always.
2" HIGH,12 3/4" WIDE,10 3/4" DEEP
yes it did.
Yes so long as you have your set top box such as a cable or satelite box set to tune to that given channel weekly. And the dvd recorder set to start recording at that set time. I use mine on tuner two with me dish 222k reciever and it works great. I have two of these recorders in my house. One in my room as stated above and the other I use in the living room for capturing my dvred content onto dvd.
Yes. I have a 24" LED mounted on it. It's not the sturdiest but works. I put two straps on TV when in transit. No problem in a year and 10,000 miles.
We installed the bracket under the cabinet in the motorhome and it works great. there is an adjustment to increase the holding power when swinging the tv up and out of the way. You shouldn't have any problem in holding a 10 pound unit up. It snaps into the bracket. With all the bumps that we have hit the tv remained up and out of the way. it should work on any flay mount surfice attached with drywall screw inserts.
Yes
No
This lens can be purchased with different camera mounts. You need to select the right one.
I would say yes...and if you have an original USB cord to any device, this can be also be used. You should be able to plug any USB into this, I charged my GPS with it. If your ipod has the kind of 'bigger' ipod end, it will work. Sorry I don't know how else to describe it.
I just measured mine that I bought in October, the cord is 4 feet. Cord and charger around 52" I highly recommend it.
Nope, as far as i have been using it..
Hi, included in the package for this Sony DSCH50 are rechargeable battery pack NP-BG1 and battery charger model: BC-CSGB. Hope this helps. -Ely
Well, I use a 300 watt power supply (the default that came with my computer) and no problems have occured in the few months I've been using it.
Yes it will with ease.
I like them. When I get the place fixed up in my basement I will be getting another one. The only trouble I had with them is the screw holes i had to use were not stretched out long enough. I had to use a round file on them. My televisions are 23".
I don't see any yellow in mine. They are a very light tan, or what some would call a "putty" color. Hope this helps.
On mine, I attached a wooden board to the roofs structural cross beam with 2 drywall screws under the roof felt. NOTE - Make sure the screws are not too long where they would puncture the roof. The unit can then be fastened to the board at the 4 mounting holes. Sound from this unit is okay - I hear static even with a ground isolator.
It is not Bluetooth capable. You have to have infrared headphones.
Yes it's strong enough. But the cd reader it's terrible it last 30 minutes.... Never work again... My kids see the movies from the USB input.
You can find those screws at your local ace hardware or Home Depot... I found mine of an old rc car I found laying around
Mine have been great! A horrible hum sounds like a power problem. This unit did not come with a power adapter...
No there's really no room except space for a normal speaker cable. The RCA will absolutely not fit.
All I can say is I thought the 'OmniMount' was lame, tacky, easily top heavy.
Unit has speaker wire outlet's only. The manufacturer website has everything you need to know.
Yes it does we have the PLMRKT18 though, not sure if its the same. Hope this helps
i don't think you can
Technically it should the 8301L is for 3" LCD's but Giotto doesn't list the 6D for the SP8301L. I suspect the 8301L is not an exact fit. There are slight differences on the camera back. I think Vello has their 'LCD Screen Protector Ultra' that is an exact fit.
i don't know but i'll check for you. i just got a new pair of rx. ray bans. i do know that it's against the faa regs to fly an airplane with polarized glasses and when wearing them the vasi lights can't be followed and some instrument output can't be seen from an angle. i haven't tried them with my mark v ii yet. my guess would be no. it's possible that the lcd might not work well with them though.
I believe one year, I've had klipsh speakers for years never had a problem
the site has them Celestron Motor Drive for AstroMaster/PowerSeeker EQ Telescopes
Well, you can and you can't. You can focus in on it, yet Venus is so bright that you cannot see any land. It looks like a tiny star.
I like it..does everything I need for considerably less money.
It looks like it. :(
I believe that if you have a mount on your GPS that has the ball receptacle, it will work just fine. It just snaps into your mount. I assume it is a universal ball mount. It works great on my standard mount.
It's pretty simple. You run your left and right front speaker wires from your amp to the sub, and it has "out to speakers" terminals you would then use to run speaker wires to your speakers.it comes with very easy to follow directions for set-up with good diagrams.
It is just under 56 inches. I have a 56.25 or so inch space too and it fit for me with about 1/2 inch on each side. But you may have difficulty rotating the TV to reach behind it and connect cables etc. I would go to a store like magnolia and measure it yourself so you are not disappointed.
Yes, it can be used as any part of the setup ( all channels) as long as the ohms match your reciever.
the speaker only has only one set of inputs. I feel it would run on L or R channel but it is designed to operate on center channel. example - using dolby surround the center channel is where most of the dialogue (conversation) comes from. either way I have been very pleased with this speaker... sound and quality. great product for the money. let me know if I can help further
It should work just fine. (never used it with wii u disks myself) You could get the Skipdr Wii Disc Repair/clean to be on the safe side. Digital Innovations 4090100 Skip Dr. Accessory Kit for Nintendo Wii. Or you can buy this and use it in any Skip Dr disk cleaner.
No, I wouldn't think so. The sponge ear pieces are removable and washable,but not the rest of it.
These are wired headphones, so Bluetooth doesn't really enter the picture.
Yes, it can be adjusted where you want that to happen.
battery, strap, manual, lens, lens cover (front and rear), battery charger
Very doubtful; I couldn't even get it to work properly on a PC. I returned it for a prompt refund, and replaced it with a Logitech C210 webcam. I've been very happy with it, and I believe that Logitech will work on all platforms.
The SD card might be bad. Have you switched out the card with another?
Really not sure. We purchased for the Powershot D-10. May want to call a specialty camera store or Canon's 800 #.
I purchased my SD890 IS from Amazon last year just because of this problem with my older Canon SD 700IS. Perhaps Canon can help with this issue. I just took a photo for a test and the flash worked on A - ISO HI and the picture seems to be fine. Perhaps it's your settings that play a part in this issue. SS
I have not used a canon point and shoot recently, put I purchased a Panasonic fz8 about 9 months ago specifically for concerts and I haven't been disappointed. Be sure to stick with the fz8, not the upgraded fz18.
it's a very small green light that is lit at all times and very dim.
No
It's total length is 10'. It is suitable for home theater speaker wire
Like anything stuck to paint. Start at a corner and get a good edge to work with. Be extremely careful not to chip or dig into the paint. Work across to get a full edge started. Could us a soapy water solution to loosen. Pull along the wall and not back away from the wall. It is all going to depend on type and quality of paint and primer. Also your patience level will be a factor. Good luck.
You can see the details on the legrand web site - they really should do a better job of getting the listing right on amazon: http://www.legrand.us/wiremold/at-home/cord-organizers-and-covers/cordmate-cord-channel/cmk10-cordmate-kit.aspx#.UsQXTvRDt8E It's a very random collection of pieces: 4 - 30" CordMate Cord Channels 3 - C19 Couplings 2 - C16 Flat Elbows 1 - C17 Inside Elbow 1 - C18 Outside Elbow And don't forget: Tools needed for installation: Tape measure Fine tooth hacksaw - Mark
Yes
You should burn it first. You can go the other way but you'll need to be certain that it is completely dry before you burn it. There is a possibility the graphics could smear if you don't. Not likely but a possibility.
I am not familiar with the verbatim hard coat. The yahoo watershed is very good material. Prints beautifully, Don"t get coasters. I have Not had a problem with scratches.
Yes. This item is able to be shipped anywhere in the world.
Great question! I bought mine for similar work. At low mag the camera will be focused at about 12" from the work. As you go up to high mag, the camera will need to be closer, and sitting on the part at max. With camera about 6" from work, the magnification is really good for wires in the 0.002" - 0.010" range.
No
I don't think it's been released yet. I bought this about 2 months ago now, and like you, it was listed as Out of Stock at the time. Anyway, reading over at Logitech's site, it looks like these were supposed to have been out in May, but obviously that hasn't happened. I can't find an official answer anywhere as to when we can actually expect to see this released.
By now, I bet you've figured it out. If not (and if it's like my 765) it's: "tools" &gt; "settings" &gt; "language" &gt; "voice" Pick one with the TTS modifier.
Yes, it comes with a car charger and suction mount. The product description fails to mention this. I made the mistake of ordering them separately.
Sorry but im not sure..:
I dont see why it wouldn't. Look at your current connections it should be the male equivalent for this harness.
Don't know about the Shure model, but the Sony PS-LX300USB stylus is a model number N-6516. I have been shopping and have found several compatible ones. The base model (which comes with the turntable) is conical diamond, with a carbon-fiber cantilever. There are also elliptical and hyper-elliptical versions, with aluminum cantilever. I don't know enough to recommend a vendor yet, but if you do a web search for N-6516 Stylus you will find several.
It should. When we were using this product we had 3 speakers.
I have the S-AIR Speaker, but no card. The slot says EZW RT10, will EZW-T100 S-AIR Signal Transmitter work in this slot. Can't seem to find EZW RT10 cards.
From everything I have been reading on GTP, this won't work on the PS4 unless Sony updates it so it can be used. If you are buying this for the PS4, expect it to not work. Yes it is USB and Plug and [lay and all that stuff. But If Sony has it blocked out, It will never work.
yes, it records on both, not at the same time. And it can switch back and forth between if you want to record something on one and the next thing on the dvd.
Look On The Golflogix Web site, They Should Have Them.
I called tech support and they said you can plug in a 16 GB microSD/SDHC card and thus have 24 GB total (!)
It is very easy to do. When you are in Sync mode in Windows Media Player just drag and drop the name of your playlist to the player. Click Sync.
no, you can't. Itunes only connects to ipods. You can use windows media player to sync with you fuze. another thing to keep in mind that if you got tracks with DRM from iTunes, they wont be able to trasfer to the Fuze unless you re-rip them to MP3 format.
I just bought this computer today at Best Buy as a closeout for $565
It didn't come with it when I bought it, you'll need to pick some up
According to the list which I'm posting the link to, it is not compatible with your Dell. http://superuser.com/questions/96588/upgrading-cpu-for-dell-xps-410
no
This receiver only offers the additional HDMI for video. You would still have to connect through analog for audio. So it isnt any better. The TX-576 offers the proper use of video and audio for hdmi according to the owners manual.
Going by it's enclosed instructions a massif 5Kg or 11 lb. of load capacity while the tripod is set up and standing, should keep a normal camera person happy.
Yes. But the retail box is shipped in a slightly larger box with packing material.
Car chargers are designed for 12 volt systems. This should work fine provided the connecting port for the device matches.
Pretty sure they do.
Yes, I own the SE 215
Im not Sure .... I would imagine yes as they fit all Shure SE IEMs
I'm not sure (no pun intended) what qualifies as "better", I believe they are pretty much the same (thinking of foam design and density). The real advantage is that the Shure tips are intended for Shure products, and I have had great luck with them. Fit, both in your ear and on the device is the key to great sound, at truth be told, these are the cheap part, but in short I think they are more the same than different. I hope that helps.
All you need is a HDMI cable (1.3, 1080p supported) goint out from your PS3 to back of the 606 (game.tv HDMI input), and only one output from the 606 to the HDTV., that is it, no other cable involved. HDMI stands for high def multimedia interface, it does both Viedo and Audio. It is the future.
I have the 606. I have my Blu Ray on Through, and I see no degradation of the signal. This is one incredible receiver. I recommend it highly.
Yeah I already ordered all of the HDMI cables I need for this receiver from Monoprice. Now I will just act like I am not interested in it at all and maybe the price will drop back down. Think I'll head over to Circuit City tonight and just buy it there.
Mine lasted less than a year and since I didn't buy from an authorized dealer, even though it was new, they did nothing for me. I will never buy another Onkyo product again.
I went with the Polk Audio RM6750 5.1 set. Plenty of volume, no distortion, nice range and they look great. They're currently going for $258 here on Amazon. If you search a bit you can find them for $200 somewhere else (hint: egg). These speakers are good. For $200 they're a steal. There are better speakers out there, but none that I know of that are better for the price.
The cable that I purchased transmits the electrical sound signal flawlessly. I am totally satisfied with the cable.
yes it does.Its a great player.
Yes it will fit but it will be baggy. I can also put a folder with papers also with the computer. Anotherwords it's not a snug fit.
Yes, the AirPort Express will quite easily join your WiFi network and stream all your iTunes music. What you can not do is use the AirPort Express to extend the range of your AT&T DSL router's wireless network.
Yes I have a pro and it's got a hard case on it, and it fits inside just fine!
Wouldn't think so....I found it to be a tight squeeze and finally went to a larger case.
AC adapter included (HDMI cables not included)..........yep it does
Yes if they are both HDMI, i use it for my xbox, either for my screen on the wall, or on my desk. I just turn on the television I want to use.
Adapter
No. I only goes one way. VGA out HDMI in. Not the other way around. It sounds like your are wanting to go from HDMI out to VGA in.
I bought mine in March 2010 and it does have voice address input and it works well.
yes
Please do not buy that one... It won't even hold a 25min charge and no one would ever respond to my emails... I hope this really helps and saves your money!
it "should" as all the Alphas have the same shoe - but be sure your flash is a low trigger current flash - I burned out my adapter with a Metz 60CT-5...
With the battery on about 4-5lbs I would guess. It's really nice if you are printing black and white legal docs.It does a good job with color, but is slower depending on the detail. I am in real estate, so I use it as part of my mobile office. Laptop,Printer, blue tooth (A must) and battery for printer and I set up any where and have full capability. The Battery is the heaviest part, probably 2-3lbs.Hope that helps. You won't regret getting all the little add ons I don't. Ray
Well so far it's been keeping a charge for me for year and a half I believe and seems to be strong, hope that helps...
I think a lot would depend on where the pins were on the printer. Go to the Canon website and ask there; they would be better informed on the compatibility.
I do believe so. It worked on mine.
Yes it is compatable. However once you get it you need to download the bluetooth driver they tell you about in the installation manual enclosed with it for it to work with your laptop or computer... don't forget that.
You can do that but the more common way is to use a door handle that always opens from the inside then the electric strike funtions just like a non electric one
It has two mic input jacks on the front and one MP3 input jack on the front. It has AUX switch on the front and AUX input jacks on the back.
My mixer don't work please help me this
Hi, I use this on Nikon D5100 without grip ( much lighter than D800 ), but it's not comfortable to me.
I'm using it on canon T4i and it works pretty well for me
Yes......this speaker has no ac power requirements at all. It is only powered by the audio signal from your amplifier. The household voltage is not a consideration. The voltage would matter to your amplifier but most of them are adaptable to different voltages by the changing or orientation of a tap on them. But the speaker itself just uses the speaker output signal from your receiver/amplifier. The only speaker that would have a voltage requirement would be in the case of a powered sub woofer. I love this speaker and would highly recommend it to anyone.
When not under a load it's red. When it's firing it's green.
I have mine in the corner and I have to see, it sounds GREAT. it is down firing, but it stands about 3 inchs off the ground. They may say not to put it there, but with mine there, but it sound good in my corner. For the price nothing comes close to it
They are 12.5 H x 6.9 W x 8 D
25 - 240 watts suggested amplifier range.
not at all. these are a decent TV, light music speaker in a small room coupled with a small sub {pioneer sw8 or martin logan dynamo 300 would be a good match}
For their size they have good bass. Keep in mind you will never have window rattling lows from any speaker this size. I am very content with them. Get yourself a subwoofer if you really seek thump.
I paired them with a subwoofer and they work great!
Um mm hard to say....There nice speakers and nice looking...I think they would look a little funny on the ceiling. I would mount them on the wall. As I have mine that way....they look and sound great. Helps being a 3 way speaker as well.
Hi, this is passive PA Speaker. To use them need an amplifier or receiver. Recommended amplifier power 70W
It's one piece. Check out the product description. I'm very happy with the speaker
the advice I found, and only after trying it with Bi-wired with my receiver, was unless you actually have two amps to power the speaker, wire it with the bridge in place via the single channel. You won't notice enough change with it bi-wired, and you only end up losing a pair of channels that you could otherwise use for rear surround or a second zone.
I have a pioneer 75 watts pushing them and they sound okay. 165 watts would prob sound nice.
china
No this is the older iPhone tip for 4s.
From what I was able to quickly google about your laptop, it uses a SATA (Serial ATA) hard drive. This just means the type of pin connectors your laptop uses to connect the hard drive. There is also UATA (Ultra ATA) the other major type. Some laptops have propriotary ports called ZIF connectors, which wouldnt work with this. Double check your hard drive type and if its SATA, it should work fine. Here's a website that explains it: http://www.computershopper.com/laptops/howto/replace-your-laptop-s-hard-drive Here's another site that goes into more detail if you are interested: http://www.geeks.com/techtips/2005/techtips-010605.htm
It is the larger one
Yes - I used it with a D90 and a Tokina 12-24mm. It can however be difficult to avoid getting front bag port in the corners of your shot at wide focal lengths.
It will if you make adjustments on your system for the third party input on your system. This is WYSIWYG, so if it is OK on your system when you view it, it is what you will print out.
Not sure about Docsis 3. Will say that when the "cable guy" checked for resistance in the cable line both coming and going with this device he found virtually none...to his surprise. I have found these to be very worthwhile investments.
I would think not knowing that your antenna is really inside your home.
Contact harmans customer service by phone, i found them very helpful the few times i did.. It could be a software update that you could do yourself or something small that an authorized repair center near you can for a lot less then the cost of a new receiver..good luck with it!
Hello. Yes, the JBL Sound Stage Micro does support docking and charging of the Apple Ipod Nano 4th generation. I know because I have one and it charges fine in this speaker dock.
yes
According to the Apple experts NONE of the new iPods (the ones with the USB connections rather than the firewire connections) will charge with current JBL docked speaker systems. They will play, but not charge. (as of June 2010)
I really don't know.
Yes it does! Best speaker system I've ever had!
No, it doesnt
Try remote.com
I have tried recording two very loud events. My son is in a band (he's the drummer--what a coincidence). I recorded their last show and got terrible distortion in the audio. I have also recorded videos of model rockets launching. The larger motors are very loud and create a lot of distortion in the audio. I am pleased with the video and the audio is great for every-day noise levels, but I don't think will do what you want it to.
Yes
PCI
Technically yes I think it will work, but not the best setup because the mics will load down each other resulting in poorer sound quality & less bass. Probably less noticeable with small mics like that. Best solution is a Y combiner built especially for mic inputs with isolation circuitry. UPDATE: See comments, I'm not sure I understood your question correctly.
The SBH-100 is not arca-swiss compatible.
Hi kasey, it is made of some sort of plastic leather-ish material...even though its plastic, it really does the trick and it doesn't look bad at all, I hope it works
no... no
Yes. I ordered an album along with this and it plays just like the old days.
hi dannyd5050, you're correct, it's just a matter of pausing then reinserting another vhs. i hope this answer is not too late for you. thanks.
I am having same problem. screen goes blank. have emailed sanyo but no reply
Yes, don't get the single 4 ohm voice coil. Get the dual voice coil version. The sub in my tahoe was 2 ohm and I had very little bass after installation. The dual can be wired to 2 ohms and will sound much better. I have a 2001 tahoe with sub in the rear driver side. I highly recommend looking at replacing the head unit, bypassing the built in amp and adding a rear sub amp as well.
This sub-woofer will not fit the best as a mid-range speaker. I will suggest to go for a woofer that is smaller then 6.5 and fits the voices (mid) freqs.
No it doesn't.
I didn't want to cut the original connection so I just bought the connection at auto store connected it to 3" speaker wire connected the other end to the speaker since you have 4 connection gotta figure out positive n negative hope this helps
No
No, it's only a rotating plug.
Absolutely, I've used it with 8/8.1, 2012 Server, 2008Server, XP, 7, Vista even 2003 Server and major Linux distibutions w/o hassles.
No, this pair uses an IR frequency to receive the audio signal from your vehicle's media source. The headphone solution that you seek are a set that uses bluetooth technology.
No. I don't think so. It has no plug ins or wires. It only picks up the signal in the factory installed dvd players.
They definitely work in a 2012 Honda Pilot. I wouldnt see why not an odyssey or a chevy or a ..... :)
The Receiver for the Onkyo 5100 does not support audio through HDMI,it is pass through only for video.You must use an optical cable for audio.
You can receive sound but but you can't send it. It doesn't have the ability to act as an intercom.
This camera video output is BNC female. These cameras can hook uo to your DVR system if your DVR video inputs are BNC male. Yes, of course. You can view and hear what is going in one day 24 hours .
No. One male is the mic and the other the audio out. Each jack is labeled and they are not swapable.
If your Samsung 60" TV has RCA audio out (the red and white patch cables), then yes, this will work. Plug the red and white male plugs into the female RCA sockets and the 1/8" plug into the Aux in on the back of the Wave Radio.
Assuming that your TV has RCA *out* and your Altec Lansing has a 1/8" stereo mini-plug *in*, that should work just fine. These cables are typically used to go the other direction (1/8" out to RCA in), but there's zero reason for it to not work with the current going the other direction.
Hi, I am assuming the PS3 plays BD right? I say connect to that HDMI port unless you have the additional BD player. HDMI is audio and video signal combined so it should work wherever you plug it in. Good luck! I love my 920 so far.
They are very nice velour pads. I hate that pleather stuff. Totally worth the money, 100 better than stock.
Yep, It sure does
Yes
If you mean the Custom Pro One Headphones, Yes. I have them on mine and I love them. My wife thinks they look sharp also.
Yes. There is a black paper separating the the two sides within each sleeve. You can pull it out and use the sleeve for a double sided document.
yes, the headphone jack is located under the volume knob. it only provides mono sound (one ear), but it works fine if you don't need stereo.
Hi, I have found that tuning the Sony radio is excellent and precise. It tunes to a station with ease and continues to stay tuned perfectly, until I change to another station. Great radio! I hope that I helped you.
I never tried it before, but my friend has one and he tried it upstairs with the router being downstairs on the first floor, and it worked fine.. Do you get a good signal with your laptop being in the same bedroom? If you do, I believe you won't have any problems..
It didn't work at ALL. I just tossed it in the trash because it wasn't worth sending it back, etc. I could hear just fine on it, but when I would speak into the microphone, all that would come out is garbled static. Spend the extra money.
Should work just fine.
The PLS-9 won't fit, the PLS-15 should work, but I have not tried that combination. Good luck, I really like the PLS-9 with my Mac Book Air.
It has a button to change channels up and down, but you cannot tap in a number, you have to scroll through them.
Typically with an Android phone and USB connectivity, the connection has to be recognized between a computer or a power supply. If it doesn't fall into one of those, the phone can crash. There are some exceptions to the rules. If the minicam has a bluetooth connection, the phone can be paired wirelessly to transfer photos if the phone recognizes the camera as a file storage device (the key word that a bluetooth driver needs in order to work with it). If would help if you know the make and model of the mini cam you are using.
Yes, it should work...I have the same controller...it worked for me...but I used the on the go cable. This should work still...they are the same, except the on the go has a cord.
No only VGA or component input and HDMI output.
No, this unit converts from VGA to HDMI and you need an HDMI to VGA.
try the rca website
You have to do the following 1) make sure the belt clip is not attached 2) take a penny or nickel and pry open the cover from the slot at the bottom of the radio. Put pressure straight up and don't be afraid to apply enough pressure. The cover will pop open from the bottom. Hope this helps.
Does your DVR have an eSATA port, firewire, or USB 2.0? It should have an eSATA. The hard disk will stay on. Most cable boxes offering DVR have some sort of option to plug into your computer or an external drive for copying to a hard drive.
Yes it worked for me. Just remember to have a charger and you'll be fine.
Yes
Yep, you can get the adapter here. http://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Adaptor-Lightning-Charge-CableAndCase/dp/B00DXYWT68/ref=sr_1_6?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1379981157&sr=1-6&keywords=iphone+plug+adapter there are many types of adapters. I prefer this one for my devices.
I just bought this unit today and I could not get it to work with my iTouch 4th gen. I guess I will be returning it.
yes, mine works great with it
I do hot see a balance control function on CD player
Yes it does. This radio is great!
It takes three (3) C batteries that are not included in the package
I bought it for my adult daughter to use in her master bathroom, so don't have daily contact with it. It has a nylon-type cord attached on the top in two locations so it can be hung in a variety of places. I'd think you could rig something to attach from that very sturdy cording. It is a great little receiver, BTW.
Yes
I've exchanged my set once, and with both sets there is definitely some very minor clouding on a completely black screen, and in a dark room, but it's not noticeable when a picture is displayed on the screen.
They have a 3.5mm plug. Check your mp3 player input. Some are 2.5mm, some are 3.5mm..i phones and most are typically 3.5mm. There are also adapters from 3.5 to 2.5 both ways you could get.
I like swim with Speedo because my rutine is 60 minutes and is too boring without music
Yes. One head of the cord fits into the headphone outlet and the other head is a USB head which u can plug into your computer or use any USB charger for. The same cord is used to upload music from ur compuer. It is an ausome MP3 player. I highly recommend it.
It's probably toast. My first aquabeat quit after a year, and I think the second one is on it's way out after a little over a year, even though I used it far less frequently than the first one.
I have a 20 inch TV mounted to this bracket- cannot answer your question
Worked for my cat. He bites it and then loses interest.
I think it would be great for that. I use it to protect cords and phone chargers from my cats. It is both flexible and lightweight.
I have one.
The D-Link Wireless Dual Band N 600 isn't used to piggyback off other wifi systems without using any wires. If your ps3 is wifi capable, there may not be a need for a router.
I wrote an email to Nikon about this and they said no filters UV or otherwise were being planned for the P80. They did not give me a filter size so I guess I'll ask them again. However, I would treat this camera more as a point and shoot and therefore probably no one will want to create a filter for it. Certainly not Nikon. I will let you know their reply.
One thing to make sure you do is put the card in and format it from the camera menu. I have yet to use it in a camera, I have only used it in my PSP, but it works great.
Connect the player to your computer, open My Computer, then open Coby device, double click device, open the music folder and delete what you want.
No
This is a relatively old device, so unfortunately you cannot; I had one in middle school, and I'm in college now.
I'm not sure. My ps3 had just quit playing br. Wouldn't acknowledge that there was a disk present. If your need of a good cleaner I would buy it and try it.
it sees it as Bluray, not DVD
I got mine with the headphones, but you should be able to use buds if you want, all headphone jacks are 1/8 inch in diameter.
Works great, solid, good height. I haven't used it with the extended lens yet.
The XZ-1 is designed to charge the battery installed inside the camera. That's the normal way. I prefer to have an extra battery fully charged at all times. That's where this charger comes in handy for charging a battery outside the camera. So the answer is in or out.
This is original manufacturer's Olympus charger. I've used it a lot last year on vacation. It works great with olympus battery & with genetic batteries as well.
Mine came as a factory new. With maxed out ram And drive. 1TB. It is the BEST Macbook pro that i have ever owned. I bought from ebay to get user upgrades already done. Absolutley satisfied.
Yes, but it requires a piece of coax that is not supplied to connect the power supply to the splitter/booster. I had a short piece from one of my previous cable setups that is working fine
This device must be placed BEFORE any MoCA devices, since is bandpass is only to 860MHz. MoCA 1.1 operational frequency is 950-1550MHz. Now the issue, to insure that the device isolates the ground loop it needs to be on the output side of any splitters. FYI, there is another device made by TII Networking technologies that has a band pass of 1 to 1000MHz, which would include a portion of the MoCA operational band, this device allow MoCA to perform anywhere it is placed. The TII device part # 220, ASIN# (Amazon PN) is B0070Q6URO
You can find complete specs, including insertion and return loss, here: http://www.broadbandamps.com/Products/GroundIsolator.htm
No
Pl-239. I think. I can't remember for fact the number but it will fit any cb radio type connection
yes it will work in the cb band with no tuning. for ten meter band you will have to cut 12 inches from the tip of the antenna. don't bother with the tuning rings they don't change the frequency that much.
Yes it can
This is not for USB! It is for DisplayPort, a different standard.
A very long time. I've had them in my home and beach house for six plus years. You normally see a light on the device. I haven't heard the churp but I think it does.
It should
Not sure, but cables worked just fine with my ZMODO cameras. I think they are all the same set up
I would suggest an amp. You'll all a lot of the deck to run these properly.
no idea for Toyota, I put them in a 2002 Jetta....Amazing sound, what an upgrade for a low price
I believe you need to have a hot shoe in order to attach the light scoop. There is a piece that slides into the hot shoe to secure it in place. Hope this helps!
Hello Meghan...Unfortunately, Nikon changed the top popup flash area of the FX series of cameras, placing the flash further forward than previous models. This makes the Original and the Deluxe Lightscoop models incompatible. We've looked at coming up with a change to the Deluxe by adding length to the support arm, but we haven't had enough requests to do it. Our web site lightscoop dot com does point out the incompatibility. Best, Phil Williams Director, Fulfillment Lightscoop.com
Mine didn't come with instructions.I googled it, but mine didn't work at all. Sorry.
Triggered it with built-in flash of my camera.
I had the same questions so I emailed Amazon. This is their reply: Greetings from Amazon.com Thank you for your interest to purchase from
I can vouch that the built in speakers on Samsung's 550 series are pretty disappointing. They fire down and back instead of forward, giving a muffled sound. IMHO Samsung's picture quality is marginally better, and I'm unsure if Sony's L line has a problem with the white "sparkles" that the W and V lines have with programming shown through HDMI, but I know on the W and V series sets that the built in sound is much better. If prices are comparable I'd go with the Sony.
I have the same problem. and dont know what to do.
Almost nothing. This isn't an active device. It just a reflective screen meant to be projected onto by an actual projector. The only power used is for the little motor that raise or lowers the screen.
I looked up the manual on your stereo and it looks to be just a standard single DIN size deck. I installed this in my boat on a alpine deck that was single DIN and had no problems. Im sure it will work for you as well.
I'm pretty sure it would. It has a Velcro strap.
It is a color camera, and when I could get it to work it was fairly clear, not HD clear. This is not a reliable camera system.
No, this older version of hardware does not have night vision. Logitech's newer, more expensive hardware does have night vision, I think. The software for the older hardware also will not work with Windows 8.
No. The remote camera needs to have access to the internet in order to send you the alerts and video. Furthermore, this version of the camera is faulty and obsolete. Check out either the updated Logitech system or another brand.
I don't know what a DNS Service is, so I guess I don't need it. For local viewing you only need a computer, for remote viewing you need the computer hooked up to an Internet service. It is super easy to install and set up. If you have any issues at all the have great customer service to help, they answer the phone, speak English and walk you through a troubleshooting process. I highly recommend it, I have it installed it in two business locations, I can monitor employee activities and we've caught a few thieves too,
it should...but it needs an old version of windows(xp)
i don t know exactly,as the whole system did not work with me at all.sorry)
I do not know
Only if it is designed for a canon camera
Yes it will however with a crop sensor you need to know it will be a 105mm - 300mm
Yes. The one that is labeled in the description as "for Canon" .
Sigma is the brand of the lens but you can order it for a Nikon , do not buy the one for Sony or other brand because is not going to fit your camera
Soren. I bought mine in Sweden, so of course my unit works on 220v. That being said, it does NOT have a universal power Supply... meaning it clearly States "230v" 50HZ This leads me to believe that Sangean makes a specific USA version and a European Version with different power transformers.
You can only tune in to stations listed on Frontier Radio. I have Sirius/XM and I need a password to sign in on the internet. I haven't figured out a way to include my password in the IP address for Frontier.
No it doesn't.
Yes mine have not fallen off even after high temps over 4 months or so of use.
Yes, at least it did for me. Love it.
Yes it does,an much higher.right now i am runing 2860 x 1800.
no doubt that was Sony's original msrp that was projected way back at CES '08. Amazon trying to get a jump ahead on the marketing game simply never bothered to change it.
No, this graphics adapter is only for a workstation / desktop computer with regular full size card slots, like the Mac Pro. It cannot be used with a laptop computer.
You need at least two room units and the master interface module. Look for the offered kit with three or four room units and the module with power supply. Very versatile system but the room units are interfaced to the master via standard cat5 data wiring. Two room unit alone will not work without the master module
If the ipad out put is strong enough to push the signal through 50' of cable?
I have cox Cable and used it to split the signal and it worked great. This should do the job.
Fits my rebel t4i like the original. This is the real canon part. Not a knock off. I use it with the canon eyepiece extension.
I'm not sure what channels 2-7 are. I can tell you mine picks up all the major public networks. Abc,cbs nbc, fox, and a bunch of other channels I cant think of. It's a great antenna.
The channel master website has a helpful attenna selector http://www.channelmasterstore.com/antenna_choice_a/134.htm I did not know about the antenna selector but it said this was the correct antenna for my location and this antenna works well at my house.
If you have an analog TV then you will need a converter. This antenna picks up digital signals and requires a TV with a digital tuner or a digital to analog converter.
I am not sure, my phone did not fit, but it wasn't an apple so that was my mistake. Also, I purchased a 'used unit' which was not in good condition.
No
No, the Espson Universal Projector Mount does not come with an adjustable rod. You have to buy it separately: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001769L24/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=33LF3R2J51049&coliid=I1TOSQMCXFVBEH
Heat is completely optional. You can turn it off and on.
Make sure the refresh rate on the computer is 60Hz. If the refresh rate is different from the T.V. there will be image tearing.
Yes, maybe. It does have standard 1/4x20 threaded hole on the bottom for tripod mounting. It's more of a matter of whether your binocs are too large for the mouth of the clamp. That also might depend on where on the binocs you clamp. Mine are relatively small Bushnells and it works for them. ~Jay
Yes, but use extreme caution! The clamp holds with a small area so is likely to break your window if you are the least bit careless. I would recommend looking for a dedicated window mounting system. My preference is for those that use lever-action suction cups, since they are far less likely to break your window.
I don't know the actual size of the Samsung Note 10, but it fits my IPAD with a keyboard cover very nicely. Sorry I couldn't be more exact.
The length of the audio extension is 15 inches. Hope this helps.
Yes
If I understand what you are saying you would want the reverse of this, A female 3.5mm to RCA Male
You can find it here at Amazon for less than 1/2 the price of retail. search Watts WUVLAMP12, WUV12-110, 12GPM 843mm 41W Water Treatment UV Bulb
You can buy it from me for $115, or just get one off EBay or Amazon
The question does not make any sense. You need to re phrase it. If you mean can the bulb be shipped installed the housing I would not recommend it.
They have mounting holes in the back and on the bottom of the speakers. The logo can be flipped over. I mounted them from the ceiling and it turned out very nice.
Yes. The mount has a ball joint which allows the speaker to rotate freely. The mount can be attached in the back as well as at the bottom of the speaker.
I purchased this for a friend and it is still working. if the battery is not even charging it could be the wall charger going bad
No, not on the camera itself. However, since the videos can be downloaded to your computer, if you've got software that will do slo-mo you can do it there.
Just lookup on Amazon for an NP 40 battery... I bought 2 for 14 bucks... Good to have extras...
I used Pinnacle's VideoSpin software to edit the footage. I think you can burn a DVD for the first 2 weeks then you have to purchase the upgrade version for $30 (download). Based on what I've seen it's a real bargain. The CD version of the upgrade is highly rated and costs $60. VideoSpin is freeware but the codec package is $15 if you plan to use it beyond 2 weeks.
They are in my opinion the exact same. I use the TSI 400's with a CS 10 center and a Polk 10" sub, and Polk in the back, and an Onkyo head unit. The TSI's have a great mid and highs and are said to have great bass(I keep my sub at tolerable levels). The bass coming from the TSI's and sub is incredible!! Movies or music, they rock!!The specs are basically the same but the TSI's are "newer" with piano finish and such. I am very happy with them!!!
http://www.polkaudio.com/products/tsi400
5 years.
No
I don't see that as a problem. I have my CS20 hooked up to a Yamaha RX-V671 which has about the same output. Should sound great!
4 3/8 inches for the depth of the top flat section, and 4 7/8 for the height of the very back. The overall depth of the entire unit is 9 3/4 inches.
Yes, they have been discontinued by Polk. There is a new model out now
I'm not exactly sure, but if u go to onlinestereo.com they have a fitment guide that will help. The speaker depth is your main concern.
Yes, it can be used while being charged.
Sandisk is remarkably bad for info. I know that the Titanium series is faster than the regular Micro, coming in at 15MB/s read speed & 9MB/s write speed. I seem to recall that the Micro is closer to 10MB read and 6MB write.
U3, is this a U3 smart drive Sandisk?
I am not sure in as that it has been a while since I had to go on the search. But if you go to the Vizio site and look up remotes, it will tell you the model that you may need. Also, there are three providers listed. You can call them and ask them directly as well as they will let you know if the have it in stock. Good Luck
Filters the low frequencies out from burning tweeter out. Did not care for these at all. Went through alot before I realized there were not the best. Check out Orion HCCA silk tweeters much better.
You cannot play conventional DVDs on it b/c it lacks a DVD drive, but you do have other options - 1. Attach an external DVD drive so that you can play DVDs 2. Stream movies from someone like NetFlix (I love this site) 3. Download movies from Amazon (or some other site) onto the SSD "C" drive or onto an additional SDHC card which you can plug into the provided expansion slot. You can buy high capacity SD cards at reasonable rates. See Amazon's offer of the A-Data 16 GB SDHC card for $29.
On its own it can't, but you can get an external CD drive to plug in.
I don't have one yet but I can't really imagine it not supporting an external usb keyboard. It's not the size of the monitor, but rather the resolution you run it at. The EEE pc has a standard VGA output port. I don't think the GMA 900 (the video chip that the EEE pc has) should have any issue with 1680x1050 which is the standard resolution of 20"-22" inch monitors. 24" monitors which typically run at 1920x1200 im not so sure about.
Yes it will work fine with Led lights.
Yes it comes with a carrying case.
i dont have them in front of me but the eye pieces do adjust separately
Yes they are ...they will work perfectly and have excellent crisp sound
I found this to be rather small and cables fit tight when you have more than 2 or 3, I'm not an expert but I've used the larger (double kind) on my other TV installations and has been much easier to fit HDMI, sound and power through it. Also know that you have to order separately the mounting plate/bracket cause is not included.
I'm not using VGA cables in mine. I imagine you probably can as I have about seven different cables running through mine. Now it's tight but it's pretty good size to start with.
Bryan, I tried this with ATT Uverse - no go. I ended up going with Cox cable internet (only internet) and bought a recommended Cisco modem from Cox. The Cox cable comes in on RG# and the modem converted it to Cat#. I am in the Northeast Ohio Area. The balun is for moving video from RG# to ethernet back to RG#. I still have my balun - 20$ deglakewood@ameritech.net if you need anything. Good Luck - David
It is 4 inches wide and 5 and a half inches long.
If it's mounted absolutely perfectly then there's no sound. Our door makes a very quiet click sound because the magnet is pulling the plate flush, but there's no sound from the magnet itself.
You might need a driver for the device you install in the case, but the case itself will work with XP.
Yes it has a power supply , but the one I got was for SATA not IDE
Should work fine with windows 8.1 64 Bit. There is a driver out there if you want to use it as well. Google Xonar Uni driver. hope this helps Best Regards, Frank

You can connect a 2.1 system. Connect the front speakers to the subwoofer and then connect the subwoofer to the front out of the card. It is detailed on page 6 of the card's quick start guide.
Yes, Any Windows 7 machine, any PCI Express slot 1x-16x. Card is PCI Express 1x but will work in any PCI-X slot.
Your question is unclear: The Hauppauge box is not a cable decoder. However, if the video comes out of the TWC box, it is already decoded, therefore The Hauppauge box can record it. However, you can not display or record it in HD since it does not have an HDMI input... HD only off the air...
Yes that is what my camera is. Works just fine.
Only works with these models # Action-HD (model: Z5X5P) # GO-HD+ (model: DAM-Z5X2) # GO-HD (model: DAM-Z5X) # MZ-DV (model: DZO-Z53) # Zoom DV (model: DZO-Z33) # Pocket DV5800 w/ Built-in Charger (model: DZO-V58N) # MPVR+ CB (model: DZO-V58N) # M-DV CB (model: DZO-V58N) # PDVR+ CB (model: DZO-V58N)
The padded dividers are included and they are removable/adjustable.
The answer i can give you its 0 degrees to the left and 0 to the right but it does tilt a bit downwards depending on size of he tv and positioning of back bolts...
My box came with various spacers and needed screw sizes all in a blister-pack.
Yes, it works with the 120. I wrote Kicker repeatedly about this, but they refused to answer. Finally I just bought one, assuming it would work because the 120 and 80 Zunes are so similar. And everything works as it should, including the remote. I wrote a review for this (you can find it on the product page). If you were considering buying one I definitely recommend it. The sound is amazing and it's conveniently small.
Are you trying to replace the display or the whole thing. If you are trying to replace the player email me at skydart82@yahoo.com I have this and no longer use it
Yes
I only use it at home, not in a business, but I don't see why this would not work. Just be sure to choose a wireless channel that is not being used in the neighborhood (download the app Wifi Analizer and see what are the channels currently in use nearby). If all channels are already being used, choose the one that has less wifi networks connected to. This definitely improves the wireless quality!
green only
Yes same size and belt clip will work. Still loving mine, best GPS out there and no yearly charge.
Sorry I don't know. I had an issue with mine not acquiring satellites. I had to return it for another one.
Yes, it gives you distances to fairway bunkers.
mine is just batteries...i'm sure there is an ac adapter that is compatible with this...
not bad sound, I use it to watch tv while I am on the treadmill.
Actually, I would think so but the body is considerably different (and smaller) than the Evolt 520.
Kind of an open ended question, don't you think? Pretty hard to answer. I know only what is in the product description on Amazon. If you have a specific inquiry I might be able to be more helpful.
You hate widescreen because you've never had it properly displayed on an output device. When properly displayed, widescreen is exponentially better than 4:3.
Can you repeat the question? I don't understand what is being asked.
I have the exact same problem after 3 years. Now the color is way off from the get-go as soon as the power is on. Just called Sony tech support they offer $579 + local tax for a refurbished same model. I think the offer is a bit off the chart, considering the price of a new set. And this is simply not acceptable from Sony. Please call them and appeal to them for a free fix. I will. Liz from CA
I don't know if you made your purchase yet or not, but I'd check out the difference in glare/reflections from the screens. I have heard the Sony has a non-glare screen, but most plasmas have a glass screen that reflects background light and can be distracting.
We actually had to cut ours out. We had to cut the ribbon and then put in a new ribbon. Unfortunately, after that episode it was just a short time till we had to replace the complete unit. Seems there is something in there that when it goes bad or breaks, it jams the ribbon. When you finally get the ribbon out, look to see if any additional plastic comes with it.
The legs are about 5" long.
Hi, I own a 30gb classic ipod and it fits mine perfectly. It does not move around in the case at all. This is in my opinion the best arm band on the market. Ive had mine for nearly a year and have beat it up quite a bit and it still holds my ipod just as well as the first use. The velcro on the arm band has held up exceptionally well too. Def a great product.
This model is a stand alone unit that has a phone jack that plugs right into a phone jack in your house. It wil work with any phone that it shares the line with. There is additional functionality that you will get if you pair this headset with a cordless phone, e.g. ability to see caller id of an incoming call while you are talking on the headset. You will have to check with AT&T regarding that.
I would not say that it is 100% water proof per say. This is because non-water proof cloth materials are also used to made the comfortable padding behind the bag and the zippers. Hope this helps :)
3 shirts and 3 pants
Mine seems to be a tight weave of durable nylon thread. It's lightweight with durable zippers and strong, well-padded shoulder straps.
Yes
The CPU is a 3GHz processor. It can be used in an LGA775 motherboard with an FSB up to 1333MHz. Your motherboard will determine your FSB and both CPU and RAM compatibility. I've used these CPUs with 1066 and 1333 MHz RAM with fantastic performance. I think it performs better than the Q9450 which is a Core 2 Quad with similar characteristics.
Depends on how much you are paying. If the E8400 is free, or next to free, sure, go for it. But there are much better processors that should be compatible with your motherboard, that will give you better performance enhancements. For example a core 2 quad, or even a faster E8xxx series chip, like an E8500 or E8600.
The 323 includes a USB port, intended for a USB printer only. The 323 is also an older model, and could be discontinued at any time. However, as of June 2009 321 users are still waiting for a firmware patch to correct some major issues with the box, while the 323 firmware has already been thru multiple updates and is perhaps the more stable choice at the moment.
Yes
Yes
If by phone system you mean something like a PBX, I believe it should.
This should not negatively effect the reflectors ability to bounce light. My reflector is wrinkled up except for when I use it and I have never experienced any issues with the wrinkled reflectors ability to properly light my subject.
I used it in a Dell Lattitude D830, I am not sure if it would be compatible with Apple stuff.
don't think so and mine didn't work anyway so I don't recommend this product. It made one hell of a racket after I installed it and I was unable to use it for reinstalling my software so no computer for me... good luck
Couldn't tell you. Go to ifixit dot com and see if it matches. According to ifixit, the part number is 857CA. If you search Amazon for that part number you should find at least 2 sources.
The YDS11sl will work but they also have a Bluetooth model if his iPod is capable.
Not sure but beware that this is not an original adapter. This is not going to last more than 1 month.
If the 190xdb is Arca style, yes. I updated my critique of this product to reflect the fact that after taking the D ring off by simply pulling it out of the hole sideways, I discovered it is only in a shallow indentation, approx. 1/32 inch deep, not enough to recommend hanging expensive camera gear on. Maybe it would be fine but I won't take the chance. If you buy it make sure you buy a secondary tether. ss
It is 1 5/8" x 2 1/16" and I suppose it would depend on the head you put on the tripod since this is just the mount that bolts to the bottom of your camera.
I dont think so. Quick release plate is different, yours is Arca-Swiss Style. Manfrottos is a 200PL type Sorry =(
It fits on mine. I have the joystick handle
Yes, you need to buy a separate wireless router. I think it is called a W1000. I got mine pretty cheap though.
You only need one per home unless a second internet account exists. If there's no wiring upstairs for connecting a computer, get yourself a wireless access point.
Check your local Bestbuy they may have a few in stock as I have seen many just weeks ago.
If you carry it as a laptop, you certainly will.
Yes it will fit. I used for my 5th gen classic. I did have a problem with the battery, however, because it would not hold a charge. I returned and bought the UpStart 616-0232 equivalent which worked fine.
Standard headphone jack, so should
Hey Bonny, I have the galaxy phone. Works awsome
Desktop
yup and yup
Sadly, this will not work. The Alpine 64 will only support sockets for AMD, however, there are other Alpine coolers that do support the 775 socket motherboard and processor. ;)
Yes it's a good quality sounding speaker you can adjust the bass
yes, it comes with over the ear and over the head.
yes. push straight down and a little red light on the set at the bottom lights up, so you know it's muted.
Yes, we can answer for than 2 lines at a time.
I just did the same thing. I bought a TV from Amazon at the best price (this morning 01-18-09) and now Onecall has the best price (same day but evening time) The price only went down $30, but hey $30 is $30 and I thought I heard that amazon has price matching through 30 days. Help us!
Size of the pen is 16cm tip-to-tip or for the imperial system: 6.29921 inch
It should.
Yes, the one I bought is used with my wife's Mac Mini. OSX 10.7 Lion. Works fine.
According to the specs, of course, http://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/G50V/#specifications
NSCALE we looked up the ASIN# B001AHALEC for the PBL sandbags and we have the bags listed at $9.79 plus $14.49 shipping which is $24.28 total. If you purchased via Amazon Prime for our Sandbags, Amazon Fulfillment Center send it via their Prime program of $24.99. Please feel free to call us at 1-800-495-8148 if you need assistance.
Yes for all 4.
the manual says a steady yellow lamp means room temperature has exceeded proper levels cool the room. a flashing yellow means lamp is not secure.
Nothing. We ordered one and less than 60 days later it stopped working. Couldnt get a refund or a new bulb. So finally i called Amazon and got a partial refund since the company I got it from refused to do it themselves!
yes works great
It is only a ad card reader. So it will only read whatever a standard as card reader will read. Frankly I am not sure.
Yes
It didn't have the PBL logos but I can tell I was pleasantly surprised with them. The constructions seems quite sturdy and the locking mechanisms give you a nice positive lock
No, I wish. It doesn't even have a front end menu to let you know what disks are in which tray. All and all its still a great player. I still love mine.
yes
So far only one major difference to my requirements: 876= 2 HTMI outputs, 806= 1 HTMI output
No
I would think so.
bro, I have no clue. :( it's pretty small. I mean if anything just meet in the middle and make 2.0?
If it's got a double DIN radio slot, yes. If not, no. It does require an adapter piece (about $15 from Ford or a car stereo installer) as it's slightly smaller than a double DIN radio.
Yes, i believe it will
Sanyo it appears does not want to market these in the US as it is absent from their US webpage. J&R Electronics does not post it on their web site, but I was able to place a telephone order for one for $699. I'll see in a couple of days if I got what I ordered or not... --R
Well there are two distribution blocks that split the main zero gauge wire to two four gauge wires. So both of the blocks have two each. I didn't use them cause I installed another power cell and just ran the four gauge wires from that instead. Just to give you another option. Its a really great kit and worth every penny too. Hope this helps.
According to Altec Lansing Tech Support the iM310 is compatible with the iPod Touch 3G
I have the same problem. There is an adapter to go from the 30 pin to the 8 pin (new connection) I just haven't been able to find one locally.
Yes, all you need to do is change the adapter as per the requirement usually they need 9 Volts DC thus instead of 111 Volts you buy it in India or Pakistan a 220 Volts with out put of 9 volts. Riaz Khan
Tools&gt;Settings&gt;Language&gt;voice. Make sure you have one selected. American Jill or Australian Karen have good TTS.
With my Pentax it worked great.
You can use the telephoto lens upstate NY, or photograph birds in a tree in your backyard or something use it for long distances that what it's you use it for.
I had 8 GB memory when I was using it on my Mac Pro. But I have only OS X 10.6.8. I found the resolution to be fine. Course resolution will depend a lot on your display more than on anything else. Well, that and the camera's capabilities. I won't say it's the best camera out there, but it is for Mac, easy to set up, and I found the pictures to be of acceptable quality, bearing in mind that that is also a subjective thing.
Yes. We have 2 pairs of these headphones that we got to replace the Volvo headphones we use in our '09 XC90. We haven't had any trouble with them and have had one of the pairs for over a year.
The R2HE50CL's are dual channel. You need these if you have more than one unit in your vehicle and want to watch two seperate things on two different screens. If you only have one unit in your car, then the IR2CFF works. Hope this helps.
It works with any sticks and a 75mm bowl mount. On the AVTP, you would need to remove the video head first. I have used this with the Dracast DR-DVT 17B which are essentially the same sticks as the Ravelli just re-branded.
amazon already carries the 3-cell version here http://www.amazon.com/MSI-Laptop-Intel-Processor-Battery/dp/B001BIK9H4/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&s=electronics&qid=1214530042&sr=8-13 although it says 3-5 weeks shipping. The 6 cell is supposed to be available in mid-July.
There is a button to go back a song but no 'rewind'.
It comes with the USB cable that you need.
No they won't. You would have to trim about 1/4" off.
They should work as long as your other setup relies on infrared for the connection.
Sorry to tell you the sender sent me a damage Iogear and wants me to pay for postage to return it. So I just absorb the loss instead spending more money. Call them and they said thats their policy ,so read their policy first . So I bought the PIXELFLASH USB 3.0 THIS ONE IS VERY GOOD NEVER FAIL ME ALSO COMPATIBLE WITH UDMA 7 CARD .VERY CHEAP SO BOUGHT ME TWO .
I have good news for you! The power adapter is rated for 100-240V
Upscaling requires an HDMI connection from the player to the TV
NO. I suggest not buying the battery from this seller. I bought one a few months ago. I barely fits my T61 and later battery died in 2 hours.
No
Can't answer your specific questions, but I can tell you that mine developed a vertical line on the screen within 6 months. The cost to ship the TV to the manufacturer was almost the same price that I paid for the TV. Bottom line...I would never buy this brand of TV again.
Element electronics. http://www.elementelectronics.com/ its not a super duper expensive TV but for the price its been great for us. We wall mounted it and its been 2+ years without any issues. one of my great buys for value.
The LN26A450 is a lower resolution monitor(720P Vs 1080P). If your using it for HD TV only, than the picture might actually look better on the lower res monitor because that is the resolution HD TV is broadcast in. If you want the most out of your DVD's, BluRay's, and video games then go with the 1080P.
When you have a screen under 30" 1080p doesnt really matter http://s3.carltonbale.com/resolution_chart.html
No it does not. It was nothing I expected. I never used mine. U can have mine if u like
No, unless you have it on a flat surface on your lap. The fans are not covered so any soft/uneven surface will hit the fans.
No
It's not too heavy, surprisingly lightweight for how sturdy it is.
I just looked at my camera. It has been in the camera for about 5k weeks and still says full charge. I have not used it in the 5k weeks.
According to the manual, pay 61, obtained online, this LI-50B is the only battery that should be used in this camera. Google it with Olympus "SP720uz manual" and you will see it.
You do not say for how long assume you do this till the battery dies which I have never done&lt; it should last a couple hours I have taken 30 to 40 pictures in a matter of 10 mins. and the battery did not drain so sorry but little help here I am satisfied with the normal charge life of these.
Yes, better than the original battery!
At an average of 6 MB per song in mp3, about 1300 or so. This figure can vary greatly depending on the quality of the songs, since a higher quality, larger and therefore less fit.
Yes you get your item exactly as is shown, clear case included.
I don't understand the question, but the Oregon GPS has a touch screen that works very well.
Yes you can....mark a waypoint then "save and edit"...you can change the one you marked with the one you want...pretty easy...Good luck...Also, check Google or the manual as to how to :enter a waypoint:..
The one I got is the smooth metal finish.
I had a Nikon 50mm 1.8 and my nephew had a Canon 50mm 1.8, and we both got these and love them. Be both have noticed a difference.
it has supported a canon 7d with 70-200 f2.8 and extender. this is about 10 pounds total. it is very sturdy. I suspect that the head that you choose, not the tripod itself, will be your limiter.
Press the "KEY" then, 0/1, 2/3, 2/3, 4/5, "KEY"
i use internet explorer 9, google chrome version 12 the latest version as of june 30 2011 and firefox 5 running on windows 7 home premium, service pack 1, back button works fine.
The one I got was, but it came from a third party seller bbeckholt, it came missing parts, dead batteries, no transceiver, and basically non functional. Rather than replace it he jst refunded my money leaving me hanging . The description should mention the version.
Yes. I have an ioGear switch: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002K0TU2C/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and all keyboard functions work on both computers with this keyboard.
not sure i fully understand the full context of ur question but this keyboard is worthy of a new upgrade or replacement.
No
Hi, please send us more details about your concern at socialsupport@am.sony.com, give us your contact details and the exact model number of your unit so that we can assist you further. Thanks. Ely.
What is the question? I got these anticipating needing them to clean dust/oil from my D600. However, I have been one of the lucky ones that got a clean D600 and have not had to use them yet after 5K exposures.
Mpro 2 duo it is a special memory card from sony.
I use my fans to cool a stereo receiver and pull the heat out of the cabinet.
The arm bad is of a heavy nylon material, i suspect it will cause more sweat! I purchased this case for just this, yes it protects the SD Card opening. For the price, and the case it is a reasonable purchase.
My suggestion for the easiest fix would be velcro.........can glue a pieced to back of MP3 player then on armband or whatever you attach it to........should work unless you play rough when it is attached to you.........
You can plug your cell phone, computer etc. into the input on the back of the radio using a standard cord. You can play u-tube or Internet radio, iPod music :) It has clear sound :)
Most likely, yes.
I do not think it has an electrical cord but I could be wrong. I am moving and it is packed. However I charged all my rechargeable batteries before packing. I just set it out in the sun and the batteries were fully charged is a couple of hours. I do live in New Mexico where the sun is very intense. Solar anything works great here!
This charger only performs on individual batteries(AA&lt;AAA,...etc) ,no pack can be accommodated as per specifications.
No but you can follow along in your Bible.
They are made in China
Jaime, there are no female RJ 45 connectors (connector for cat 5 cable) on this unit. If you have some basic electrician skills, I guess you could extend one of the blaster or sensor cables with cat 5, but you might exceed the signal specs for wiring and your unit would be unreliable. Unless they sell extension cables for this, I would not do it.
Yes,Be sure the CPU is on the compatible list of processors...it must be a 65 watt processor. If you have 4gb or more in memory you'll want to install the 64-bit version of Win 7. If you have 3gb or less in memory, the 32-bit Win 7 will work fine...Look on Intel's support website and see if the motherboard has 64-bit drivers first, before buying the 64-bit version of Win7...if not you must use the 32-bit version of Win 7. Good Luck!!
yes I use it with my kindle and it works great
You usually plug in headphones to the TV you have your PS3 connected to. So it depends if you have a place to plug in headphones on your TV/Monitor.
No. Turn off, then begin recording again.
Yes
Yes
yes
It should work. I don't have Vista machine to test, but it worked fine with Linux, XP and Win7. This is just a switch followed by a standard USB hub, and it doesn't require any driver. The standard USB drivers included in the OSes just work.
Snug, but yes
Seller sent adapter for free. great service!
Yes, on one pole I have a Clearstream 4 pointing one direction and a Clearstream 2 pointing another direction, both connected to a signal splitter in reverse (into the out connections), then into a signal booster and into the house. I did the same thing with two VHF antennas on another pole and I receive over 30 digital & HD channels without having to move the antenna rotor every time I change a channel. As we live in a valley between several broadcast antennas this was how I solved the problem and it works fine.
This was for a workstation so I cannot answer how it handles games. We don't play video game because we would probably be sooo bad at it :)
Yes. that is what I use.
Sure thing. Ideal for the 800e
Thank you for contacting us. Cameta Camera sells this item as refurbished for $399 with free standard shipping to most US addresses.
If you buy from Amazon itself, it's USA, but you should be a bit more careful if it's purchased through a 3rd party vendor. You can always call to verify.
Likely less than 2 minutes... it will carry you thru a short power drop-off or give you time for a quick (but orderly) shutdown.
the "efs" signifies that it will only work with a crop sensor camera. so if your camera is full frame, this lens will not work on your body...
No, it is smaller and would not work with that size tv. It is very sturdy, though.
I use it with the Tamron SP 70-300 F4-5.6 alone and with a Nikon 1.4x teleconverter with good results. It may take a little adjustmemt of the strap to allow for full zoom.
Yes
Absolutely! I have several versions of Windows on these discs.
Beats me but Newegg had them again for an hour or so tonight and for only $549.
The 901 does not have a PCMCIA or ExpressCard slot. It does have several USB ports, which can be used to connect to cellular broadband devices (such as the "USB727" from Verizon, for example).
The manual agrees. It's listed there as Fast Ethernet (100Mb/S) for RJ45 wired Ethernet links.
If you're using a SD card there should be no reason why you can't transfer files that way. Both devices have a SD reader. I don't have a Eee PC, but I suspect that you shouldn't have a problem connecting a kindle directly to it. The Kindle connects to Windows as if it is a USB thumb drive with no special software. Most likely Linux will also view the Kindle as a USB drive. I've never had problems with getting other versions of Linux to mount a USB drive, so I don't think this one will be any different.
Hi, My Lumis is 4"x2" and the lens extends out to 2", with a lens diameter of 1". That fit perfectly, but if the sony is much larger the case might not close comfortably.
It fits my VGN-SZ370P, I don't know about the CR407E, but this battery is not last as long as the original battery, it is about 2/3 of original, but it works for this price.
I don't know the exact sensitivity# but I have had these installed for a couple months now. I am running them with a 800 watt 4 channel amp, and they are the best I have had. They just keep on amazing more and more.
I would consider them average. Same size as stock replacement pictures. Maybe slightly smaller
I bought them for my boat. I would say they have a decent amount of bass, but I have 8 of these set up with two 10 inch subs and a couple of amps, so we cut the bass to the speakers back some from the head unit. I really have enjoyed the speakers and get lots of compliments from everyone who hears the system.
I got this because I hurt my elbow. It is really great. I did not have any issues with the mouse. I must say it takes about 2 weeks to get used to it, however, after that it is great. One item to note is that the CTRL/ALT keys are not well positioned so if you use them a lot you will want to set up quick keys. Hope this helps.
The standard config is a single switch. The tripple is sold seprately. I love my kinesis. One at home and work.
It's rated for 15 amp circuits and provides no tamper-proof protection, but since it's intended for wall mounting presumably for TV installtions, why include it.
I have the same issue. Try "forgetting" the connection and reconnect the arc mouse. They usually works for me.
I don't know Atlantic, but it works with Comcast.
Heck yeah!
absolutely
That little black cloth was in a plastic square bag. That is one of the best eye glass or camera lens cleaner you may ever get. I have several of them and I don't share it with anyone including my wife.
No
I steamed mine... took about an hour or so to get the major ones out. Left it hanging over a weekend and it looks great!
10 foot side
no its to thin
The one that I received was formatted and "plug-n-play" ready for all devices.
Sorry. I don't know. I have not used it with this player.
Hi there! I used the Orion Dovetail L bracket to fix my PST atop my NexStar 4SE mount. Here is the product URL: http://www.amazon.com/Orion-5052-Dovetail-L-Bracket-Telescope/dp/B001DGR54O
Only the sun.... The sun is the only celestial object bright enough to be viewed through the h2 alpha filter.

If you found a manual or got a lead can you please post it? Thanks
The Zen X-fi will work with Amazon Unbox, but the Zen X-fi 2 lacks the necessary DRM10, so it's a no-go. Honestly, just stick away from Creative. They seem to have little vision for the high quality company they once were.
i dont recomend this heatpad, look up tilt stealth by madminds, its a new cooler for mbp that will be shipping soon!
Seems unlikely. If you place it below the cooling fan it would make no difference as the laptop pad works on heat transfer and therefore does not cool air so the fan would simply be blowing air at ambient room temperature. If you lace it above the fan it would block the fan and the passage of air altogether.
The Canon Rebel XS is fine for learning photography. If you're more serious about your photography, however, I might recommend a model with more features and a little better performance like the Rebel T1i or T2i or maybe even a semi-pro 50D or perhaps the new 60D. But also leave some funds available for more lenses, an external flash, a spare battery and a case. If you only plan on taking the one course and then just using the camera for casual photography afterwards, the XS will do the job.
No. You re not. It is called slow synch. You can change sync. Speed by going into the camera's custom function and change it.
Not sure. You should probably open up your computer and measure to make sure this heat-sink will fit nicely....or ask the person selling it.
I have the same question. Anyone know?
In addition, the back touch-screen interface is 3.5" rather than 3"... a bit bigger. I struggled with the differences and ended up getting a T77 with a 4Gb memory card ($25 more). I decided I could get by with a slightly smaller screen on the back for the price difference.
Use iA and as close as 1cm. Use a tripod or hold still. Do not block the light. This is the equivalent to a $1000 DSLR macro lens(not counting other lenses for mid and telephoto); not including the body which would be at least a D90 body, to get similar camera features. There are many pros and cons but MACRO is a FZ28 strength.
I just got the Lowepro Ridge 30, it fits LX3 nicely. I would think that the Ridge 20 would be a bit tight for the LX3.
Yes it does, but with limitations because the SX50 is not an SLR camera: 1. It Can not activate the bulb function on the SX50 (it is not an option on the SX50) 2. It could work with time-lapse photography, like self-timer, interval timer, not as long-exposure timer- this should be programmed on the SX50 I hope this help.-
From what I've read, this is basically the same hardware as the d-lux 4. Differences: different coating on the lens (same lens) different firmware a longer warranty (either 2 or 3 years for Leica - different reviews give different figures - vs 1 year for the LX3). the red Leica logo! Also I've seen it suggested that there are some external bits of rubber trim on the LX3 which are not present on the Leica. I think you also get Capture One software with the Leica, which is a high-end RAW processing package.
Yes, you can use zoom in video mode but not flash.
Some refurbuished products may have been repaired and some may just have been returned for no functional reason. There's no real way of knowing. But, in general, I'd say the extra warranty period is worth the small price difference. Now if the refurb cost 50% less, that might be a differnt story.

No, but Roku has a app that you can use threw wifi.
Yes
Yes
It needs to have a PCIe Slot (x1, preferable, but even a x4, x8, or x16 slot will work)
It should work but you may want to verify with the manufacturer or the outlet that is selling it. They usually provide a list of compatible models. I can not positively ascertain wether it will work in your particular model. Hope that helps.
Yes, that is for the docking station. FYI, docking station does not come with a power supply. One cord which has one plug which plus into your laptop.
Not sure to be honest. It is a pretty much generic dock station with a 25pin connector. I have an HP Pavillion i7 and it has been working great for more than a year. Nice to have extra USB plugs. I use a very large monitor, which is the main reason I bought this. I'm running Windows 8.1 and no issues there either. For the price I think it is a great deal; makes portability much easier.
Yes.....thanx a lot
I recently replace my own color wheel. YouTube the precise model of your TV and it will walk you through the process--took me about 30 minutes and saved me $$$
YES BUT THIS DELL RUNES VERY SLOW
I have found no delay. I have a room upstairs with 2 Play:1 speakers and a Sonos Sub, and downstairs in the living room, a Connect that is attached to my home theater system via an optical cable. When I join the two rooms in house party mode (everyone playing same source) and I stand halfway up the stairs, I hear no delays.
It is not possible to turn Sonos devices on and off remotely by the app. I do use WEMO devices from Belkin and it works perfectly to turn Sonos devices (and others) off and on remotely. You will need to download the WEMO app which works well.
I don't know in what appliances these batteries will work, but they work in our phones. Sorry that I don't have a specific answer for you.
I have used it in the rain and have seen videos where people have dropped it in a fish tank. I know others that go Geocaching with it and have dropped it in the river and they still work. Their range is usually off by 30ish feet if you are hiking though and in the woods depending on how dense it is it might jump around.
I believe it does but look on site and put in your model number to verify.
I don't know, sorry.
I have my 70" Sony LCD mounted on this mount. It is cast iron, with no ball joint. It does tilt up and down, but probably not enough to mount on an angled ceiling. (could always go through ceiling and make a flat mountable point in roof joists??)
I believe it will. This bracket is very heavy heavy duty and sturdy. I have a 70" screen on mine with plenty of sturdiness and stability. I do have a nice foot ceiling and have the only 6 inches down, so the rigidity is good.
yes it will rotate 90 degrees as long as you are far enough away from a wall
Yep. A 70 in Sharp Aquos has been hanging from my ceiling for the past year and half without issues. Just to be sure, however, I ran the ceiling mount through the ceiling and connected it to a 2 in thick board I ran between my ceiling joists. I have no problems with the mount or the connection even with my very overweight self running (and thus shaking) the house.
Yes plug and play auto installs driver
Actual dimensions of the unit are 15x12x3. The box it comes in is 18x14x5.
Yes, an in line fuse (on the main power line) is added protection that I highly recommend.
Plug the camera into any television connected to a VCR and select "record".
It has the standard Apple adapter plug, so if that's what your iPod has, then it should work.
This iPig comes with little attachments that snap into to the port/docking area on top of the ipig for different sized/types of devices. They have the types of devices printed on each attachment. I bought the pink iPig about 2 yrs back and I LOVE IT! It has great volume and it was well worth my money spent.
The cable is made for an iPhone 4. Grom nay have an updated cable that connects to an iPhone 5 but you will need to check with them on their website. You could also possibly purchase an adapter for an iPhone 5 that would connect to this.
I have it for the RX8.
I am sorry I am on vacation oversea right now and I don't remember the model number of the Garmin that I have. But it work well with my Toyota Camry mounting on the airvent, you do need to use a velco tie to tie it down to secure it.
If the 2689 has the same little ball/hole on the back as the other Garmins
I haven't really watched video off the hdd yet, however I have streamed movies off the net. I'd have to say it gives me a good 5 hours and I suspect a little more even after the battery meter goes to red. It doesn't display battery life in % like my Htc Tilt so it's tough to guess.
I think you pretty much answered your own question. The Archos isn't even in the same league as the Eee netbook. Netbook wins.
Yes you can. Go to the music or whatever folder.
No, it is not a stand-alone alarm horn that is tripped simply by applying voltage; it is a hailer requiring a signal source (voice/music/alarm). It is simply a speaker.
Could but not too powerful
Yes. Very easily
I have a Galaxy Note 3 and put it in mine. No problem. It's a standard "micro" chip. Had it in my previous Samsung Galexy S too.
I ordered two and neither came with an adapter. Great Micro SD card though!
I tried it with a printer, but it didn't work. Other items were hit or miss (hard drive worked, usb phone connection didn't, camera didn't) I can't vouch for all of them due to all the makes and models out there, but the ones I did (even if they did connect) were unreliable with dropped connections.
Switch, two sets of usb plugs, some vga plugs or something, and the small button to change the output.
More than likely
I never bothered to ask, with such low volts running thru I didn't think it necessary.
Thank you for your question, we offer the Nero for your computer that works as your burning software is only a free item it does not affect any duplicator process with this machine. The USB is provided as a free item so that when you have a computer without a burner this USB can hookup to the bottom drive and that drive will act as an external burner for your computer.
I'm not a techie in any way, but I have the problem with my computer's front USB port only for my external hard drive (the computer doesn't even recognize something's plugged in). When I plug into the back ports, it works fine. A pain, but it works.
I own the 1 TB model and also noticed the heat buildup. I keep my unit off unless I'm backing up data. Had it a year and so far, so good.
Yes I use it with a 7d and a 70-200 mm f2.8 works great its small enough to be moblie strong enough for any weight.
No - this is an OEM product - comes with CPU and that is all.
Yes it will run Xcode 6.1
Hi. The round portion of the earbud is 5/8". The tab is 5/16". The total is just under 1". I happen to have a medium too. The round part is barely over 5/8". The tab is 7/16". The total is barely over 1". The medium is thicker overall and the tab is shaped differently and distinctly wider. I'm guessing that most folks prefer the small, because I see a lot more of those offered online than the other sizes.
Yes it does!
The suction cup pad attaches to this smooth surface.
You won't be able to just pry it off, without risking damage to your dash. It can and I did remove one with adhesive remover. Work it around the edges with q-tip. A real light oil will work also.
The input is 100-240v @50/60Hz 0.3A Output:5.0v - 2.0A
No not really. It's a simple replacement and comes with instructions that are easy to follow. If you have a cell phone with a camera take pictures before you begin of the motherboard.
From the box shot and price I would guess No I would say you need to add a heatsink and fan
No, just the 40 CB channels.
I'm sure you can just call them up and ask for a replacement. Or just look up the company website.
No. These barely lasted me three months
I don't have a Macbook but it's the same plug that's on all earphones and it's easy to drive from portable devices.
Yes
The only time I did terrestrial observing with a 10" dobsonian / newtonian telescope the image was upside down, but brilliant and crisp at 38x. I observed a fisherman in a boat across a lake. Without the scope I could hardly see the boat. Through the scope I could see flash of the monofilament fishing line in the sun!
Hi David, I had a similar problem when I ordered one of these off amazon. It arrived without the mount so I had to look for one. turns out, unless you buy the telescope straight from Orion, they will not sell the mount separately. However, if it was bought off of amazon you should be able to send it back. I contacted amazon and they gave me a full refund including shipping and they paid return shipping. Hope this helped =]
It won't fit "in one piece," but that's not a big problem. The tube is separate from the base, held down only by gravity and a spring on each side. You'll have to unhook the springs from the base, put the tube in your back seat, and lay the base down in your trunk. That way it should fit fine (though I don't have a car like yours to measure). The tube is 45-1/2" long and the base is about 18" in diameter. Ordinary transport won't disturb the collimation.
Thank you for your inquiry. At this time, we are not able to ship orders to Canada that are placed through Amazon.
Yes, it fits all D series cameras and most every other Nikon. I use it with my D5200.
I've not been able to get it to yet. Have tried with eyetv and sage, but mythtv is next.
I don't think it will. Thisd is an OTA ATSC tuner. For IPTV you need something like a ROKU or Apple TV, possibly just a PC connected to the internet and a subscription to the IPTV service you need.
These are cherry switches.
I live in Ringgold on the other side of a hill, and also use a Winegard booster. I get 3, 9, 12, 39, 45, 53, and 61, as well as all of their -.2 channels. And when a tree in my backyard is bare I also get 6.
Sorry, I have no idea.
Works good, just fiddle them around a bit.
Hi James we get a lot of wind here to in west virgina we live on top of ridge. Its a big antenna and catches a lot of wind but so far its done great. One thing I suggest is using two inch mast pipe thu. I used inch and quarter and the wind bent it some but stayed up. I'm changing mine to two inch in spring. I live 50 100 miles to stations and I regularly get 30 to 37 channels. FREE You SHOULD INJOY IT
First try the FCC utility:http://transition.fcc.gov/mb/engineering/dtvmaps/
No
I do not know what you mean about the zone but I bought one it works real well will pickup any thing up to about 100 miles very dependably with a rotor and amplifier
Yes they will conture to the pitch of the roof! HOPE THIS HELPS
I don't know. I bought this stereo used and had to go online to find the part number for the antenna.
I am not sure. I have the Sony 700 watt stereo and this antenna wasn't the right one for my model
No
3
Yes, it will work with a laptop or desktop. The range is usually 5ft max. After that point the mouse can get glitchy.
I read through the whole manual and it doesn't say anything about working with bluetooth.
Hello from Medialink, No. This adapter will only work on a computer running a Windows Based operating system. If you have further questions, please contact us at 856-216-8222 Tues through Sat 9am to 6pm Eastern or email us at support@medialinkproducts.com. Thanks, Medialink
After trying to get Tivo to work with wireless adapters I finally just conceded to purchasing Tivo's adapter. Have to say that was the best decision, easy install, Tivo's all work perfectly. Just spend a few extra and get Tivo's adapter and you'll be a happy camper.
Call Electronics Basket or Panasonics for extended warranty. I trust this brand and I don't bother to ask. So far, it works excellently
This lens does not have either of those features, it can only be focused manually and since there is no IS we recommend using this lens with a tripod/wireless remote to avoid blur.
Yes it will! Your Camera will take CF1 and CF2 cards! This adapter is a CF2 and the Only One available for the Mobi WiFi Card and it works Perfectly! The Mobi WiFi Card will work alone in any Camera that supports SDHC Storage! Have fun with it! It is easy to use and You will Enjoy!
It doesn't have a place to plug into a USB cord. It has prongs that flip out from the back to plug into the wall.
Yes choose the one with the Lightening Connector Not the 30 Pin
There is no battery required. The connection to the radio is on the inside mount, and the outside is just the antenna mount.
I believe it will work! Connections are standard.
Yes it will, if the connector fits the antenna will work
Yeah, the less heat the better for the system. Having the fan boosts the chances of extending your PS3's life by at least 3 years depending on how often you use it.
Not sure about fat boy but mine seems to work good
Amazon sells replacement/extra Nikon EN-EL 12 Li-ion batts and states on the website that this battery will power the S9500 Cam.
I charged mine over night, worked OK in my camera.
I don't know. I bought it for an EN-EL 12 battery, and it works great for that.
There is a light on the charger that blinks when charging and is solid when charging is complete.
I am not sure if they are compatible, but call this company called Pureland Supply at 1-800-664-6671, they specialize in all tv lamps, they will tell you if this is the one you need or not. Their business hours are 8-5 Eastern standard time. Hope this can be helpful to you.
Voltage is 115 VAC
Sure does
No clue, I had a 55" sharp aquos, and it worked right out of the box
When you turn on your television, you get a sound that is similar to a jet engine whining when you start it up. It whines and gets faster and faster, and really never goes away. Soon, it will lock up and your TV won't come on at all. What is happening is that the bearings on the color wheel are worn out and are grinding at a very high speed. If you hear a whine, get ready to replace it soon.
It's called a micro USB cable I think. I would recommend bringing your camera to best buy and ask for a cable that will work for it. Other wise get your self a SD card reader and upload your clips that way. Ronders :)
Unfortunately, form my experience there is no way around it during recording. However, this camera has built-in editing functionality. You can stitch the snippets together into one continuous piece. It's quite easy. Then there is also the video editing software included with the camera.
yes it does
it doesn't work at all... didn't stick to dash or windshield. My Whistler came with a little rubber mat to sit on the dash and it stays put, have never had an issue with it moving. I wouldn't wast my money on this.
Here's a link to the warranty. http://www2.panasonic.com/consumer-electronics/support/Warranty-Information/details-TH-58PZ800U Failure rates have come down from about 6% to 1% as the technology and the manufacturing processes have improved. I've read that the average repair cost for a plasma is over $1000, so I'm seriously considering a extended warranty from either DTVexpress or Squaretrade. The cost over 5 years is not too expensive (between $150 and $400 which depends on the the initial cost of the TV) which will give me some peace of mind when a fault occurs.
No, just when Amazon is the selling vendor.
I would like to know this also. I don't think any information will be available unfortunately. I'd like to say that the original MSRP for LN55A950 was $4,199.00 and then it was increased to $4,799.00 I think. Either way many retailers selling this TV at a premium (way above MSRP). The price should drop a little because Sharp and Sony are both releasing LED sets either in October or November. I think the original $4,199.00 price was good for a TV like this, but it is definitely not worth $5,000.
Yes, connects with a minijack.
Yes
It can, if the wattage of the halogen bulbs doesn't exceed the wattage capacity of the sensor.
That is too big. It's also too big to be cm. Maybe they meant the packaging? The actual stick is about 1.25 x .75 inches. It is about 1/16 inch thick. Hope this helps
Don't have actual dimensions, BUT I do know that it will stretch to fit your head PLUS some. A friend with a 29" circumference head fit those glasses. Then after a month, the glasses slips off his head.

I realized that i did make a mistake, now is it per weight
Yes If it fits your radio. They work fine for my radios.
I couldn't get ANYTHING on this device to work right. Do yourself a favor and get your money back.
Antenna's position is The Key!!! And I use this Antenna: Philips SDV1225T/27 Indoor Passive Antenna http://www.frys.com/product/6640864?site=sr:SEARCH:MAIN_RSLT_PG Sometimes I get almost 90ch but most are foriegn! (Spanish Asian)
dang 3 years for $403? i got mine from best buy they offer 4 years for $199
I don't know, as I don't know anything about iPhone.
No. This item is not available in black at this time.
Hi, it depends on your speakers. The hole size is 5 1/4" which is adequate for most 6.5" speakers, but this isn't standardized. Some will fit and others might require hole enlargement. My 6.5" Pioneers will fit a 5" hole so I had extra room. See if you can figure out, or find the hole cutout size.
Yes
This lens is specifically designed for APS-C Sensors and it'll not give good results on a Full Frame camera. THe image circle will not cover the full sensor. Here is the link to the compatibility cart on Tamron's website: http://www.tamron-usa.com/lenses/prod/assets/pdfs/slr_compatability_chart.pdf
Please go to canon website and look up your model, then under optional accessories it will have different batteries listed that can be used in the model of camera you have.
this seems to work fine
Hello. Unfortunately this item cannot be shipped internationally. I hope you find an alternative!
Works fine -- quiet, nice picture, good tracking.
Yes it does
While these might be long enough, they are not wide enough, have enough grip, or hold tightly enough. If I understand, you just need ties to keep the bike from rattling a bit and not completely securing it... but these ties are more for bundling computer cables and better suited for such things.
It will depend on how thick the cords are and how tightly you wrap them. The wraps are only 8 inches long, so if you're trying to go around something bigger, it will be tough. For me, if I can wrap my middle finger and my thumb around it and touch, I can use this wrap. Hope that helps!
Yes! The chip description is; 2GB, 800MHz, DDR2-800 PC2-6400, 200p SODIMM, 1.8v
I am a W7 Ultimate user. As for 8, their support page states "WinTV v7 installation package, version 3.2 for Windows 8, 7, Vista and XP" If it does 8 I would think it does 8.1
It will record two programs at the same time. Obviously on two different channels. We do it all the time.
No it does not it is all powered from the pci express board connection.
There is a plastic cover shown, remove it and aux input is accessible. Yes, those speakers should work.
My guess is Yes. But I would not buy these splitters, they are very poor quality. The sound cuts in and out a lot and you have to wiggle the connecter and keep it in just the right place for it to work. I would spend a little more money on a better quality splitter because you will end up throwing these away. At least that has been my experience and I bought 10 of them.
If you go to the Tamrac WEBSITE, you can look up the internal and external dimensions of their products. The medium is a model MX5383, and is located here. http://www.tamrac.com/products/masflashpocketmedium/ The large is a model MX5385, and is located here. http://www.tamrac.com/products/masflashpocketlarge/ If you click on the "SPECS" tab, you should see that information. Also, I believe another reviewer answered this question in a review and subsequent answer on September 14-15, 2013. He was using the large size case. Hope this helps.
I don't want to bag on the product but this is old, you can buy a better one with the cost, also squeezes your head kinda hard
Yes, iphone ipod, ipad, computer, Will need an adapter to xbox but other than that its good.
From description: "Sold as a single unit to Mount one speaker."
no
45 watts per channel, they sound awesome good bass with little distortion. I am running a alpine head unit with a alpine power pak. Highly recommend.
No there is not
Earphones
I wish I had an answer for u, I haven't used mine for a few years now , I bought a smart phone and put all my music on that , I never added videos. I'm sorry I can't be more helpful maybe contact the manufacturer , I hope u find an answer I'm sure it's frustrating. Good luck
When you pause the dvd, just hit the pause button again and it will resume where you left off. However, if you've turned the machine off and left the dvd in it, it might resume to the same frame as long as you didn't open the drawer. I could be wrong but just try it.
Its a dvd player. No batteries or screens. It plugs into the wall and to a TV.
I've seen Matte finishes on some TV's. Check out Walmart if you've got one.
Just set mine up. I do have a home theater system, so it isn't an issue with me. But I am also not impressed with the sound from the tv. You certainly should be able to hear it over other noise, even though it could be louder.
There are now reviews posted. Go to www.ecoustics.com.
No, the battery you want is a Samsung SLB 10A 3.7V 1030 mAh lithium ion battery. Rob
Good luck! It didn't do anything on my desktop even after finding drivers etc
No
If Windows 7 64 bit is the home editions. The answer is Yes!
I don't know but I wouldnt buy this product...It came apart taking out of the commuter..the first day!! TOO Cheap apparently,buy a better made one..spend a bit more...worth it!
You check here for a fit guide: http://www.dicapac.com/manual/guide.asp
totally, no problem!
I'm estimating about 24 sets/pairs. There are six rows, each row is approximately 10 inches long. I can fit eight rings on a row (and I believe each ring is comparable to the size of a cufflink).
I really could not say because I bought it for my husband who plays bejeweled blitz on it and that plays just fine.
What I do know is that Authentec is the software source that runs the Eikon to go USB Fingerprint Reader.
Emery, your condo restriction prohibiting outdoor antennas is probably illegal and unenforcible. See: http://www.fcc.gov/mb/facts/otard.html
No. You will receive over-the-air channels such as ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, PBS, etc.
I bought my GPA in 2010 but it has been used several times since then and worked fine. I am going to Italy in a few weeks and someone told me they thought I could update the maps before I left.
Yes, they are the same. Garmin separates the model vs add-on components (like a traffic receiver), which this unit comes with. There is nothing to do to activate the traffic feature. Just plug it into you car's battery port (cigarette lighter) and if you are in an area that has traffic service, it will work. And if you get a screen telling you to go to Garmin's website and "activate" the traffic feature, ignore it.
Yes. In fact,batteries only. Three triple A's.
No output port - you would need to get a splitter, connect that to your ipod, then you could plug in two but I would assume the volume would be greatly reduced for each speaker
There is no low battery indicator. Just keep extra batteries and put them in when the sound is distorted or stops.
The back thread was 43mm. The front thread is 52. Note: The back thread on mine uses a 52 to 43 stepdown, but it is on so tight, I cannot remove it.
yes it does. We have 4 zones and a speaker selector. On this we have speakers and sub woeffers
Yes there is an input and output coupler for the Bose 901 equalizer
The USB input of the RR2150 is meant for PC and Mac interfaces only; this is because the source device will need to download the appropriate drivers. If you wished to use a different source device such as an iPod, the RR2150 offers an auxiliary stereo 3.5mm input as well.
I think amazon should include manufacturer information for all its products: "made in ___"
In the mouse.
they are 6 power. work very well in a theatre which is why I bought them. you don't have to constantly refocus. probably would not work real well for bird identification but would be useful to locate and then use a higher power pair
Not sure. We use them on our Cisco 7941 and Cisco 7961 phones.
I don't know if it works with a model 7911. It does work well with model 7960.
I recommend calling the seller to get the correct version. I ordered the wrong one at first and hand to exchange. There are a bunch of compatibility details about headsets that don't make it into the description.
I just tried it with my Canon t4i and it seems to work! It would not work with my canon Optura 600 movie camera
The plug size is an eighth size, if your phone has this, it therefore should fit, or you maybe in need of an adapter.
I have found it heavy and durable with one exception - the wheels can be a little fragile. I have a 2 inch drop from where my case rests to the floor and on one occasion the case got accidentally pushed over the lip and caused the wheels which are plastic to bend and crack
If desired yes - top and bottom options
This device can be used as an extention, connecting two hdmi cables.
Should work. I've had it on 3 different cars and works great. Doesn't slide. Haven't tried on a Prius but should work I'd think.
Fully extended the base is very flimsy and would not be able to hold a mirror less camera. The built quality is very bad. The tripod is much lighter than the shaft so it is top heavy causing a topple easily.
I have been experiencing the EXACT same problem with my Canon A590IS since Nov. 2008. I replaced the lithium, button cell (not cheap or easy to find) and still have an occasional loss of date and time. My guess is the pull out battery carrier the button cell sits in is poorly designed allowing the cell to momentarily lose contact and thus require a reset. There have been at least a couple of complaints about this problem in the 590 reviews.
This camera runs on normal AA batteries, you can see the battery level indicator on the screen. Though the batteries do not last as long as proprietary batteries, but you will not be worrying about running out on them, as finding a pair of AA batteries is relatively easier.
I have purchased three Zunes. Two as gifts. Bought two 120's and a 30. Ive tried an I pod. a Samsung and two others. They were all returned. The Zune has what I think is a better and easier program. So to answer the question, ................BUY!
I'm having this issue, too. Camera seems to get confused and the whole frame becomes blurry rather than focusing on the one object. It takes several attempts to register what I'm trying to do, and then it's too late - opportunity has passed and subject has moved. Time to really study my manual I guess or maybe this is a shortcoming with this camera.
Agree with all the people about a good lens, you need a lens with at least an f2.8 aperture and image stabilization for fast sports. The 6 frames per second of the 50D is adequate, just make sure you learn how to anticipate the action and pan.
All Canon EF lenses are compatible with the 50D and all of Canon's other dSLRs. You just have to keep in mind that the 50D's smaller APS-C sized sensor will make your lenses seem 1.6X longer in focal length. Your 100-300 will give you the same viewing angle as a 160-480mm lens and the 28-105 will no longer be wide angle but seem more like a 45-168mm moderate telephoto. I tried out my brother-in-law's 100-300 on an XTi sometime back -- very nice image quality as I recall and EXTREMELY fast focusing.
I have been experiencing the EXACT same problem with my Canon A590IS since Nov. 2008.

Yes, it does. Facing the camera, its on the left side, next to the port for your pc hook-up, under a rubber cover
The "IS" is part of the full name for the A1000IS and A590IS, but sometimes people just leave it out. There are not IS and non-IS versions of the A1000[IS] and A590[IS]. Canon's including it into the formal names is useful to distinguish them from some models that lack[ed] IS. For example the earlier A540 lacked IS. The current economy model, the A480, lacks IS.
No, it does not. Cycles per second or hz are established at generation. This unit converts voltage only via a simple transformer. To change frequency you must "regenerate" your power. Check out this link for more info : http://www.georator.com/Frequency-converter-basics.html
These lens are totally different. With the 18-200 you are covering a large range of view. You easily can use it in your living room and take a family portrait and in a few seconds later go to your backyard and get a quickly close up of a bird without changing lens or exposing the camera and your lens to moist. So, if you a plan to shoot wildlife or subjects located far away you need the 75-300. Otherwise, i would recommend the 18-200. I hope this help ; )
No. You have to manually focus when you're doing movies
I have the same dilemna. However, I am currently thinking that the 28-135mm is better suited on the basis that it is USM and therefore quicker to focus. I've had non-USM lenses before which tend to aimlessly go back and forth trying to focus when shooting in normal to low light. Since you have an APS-C rather than full frame camera, the 28-135 is equivalent to a 45mm-216mm which to me is enough zoom since I am not into sport photography. Hope this helps
that would be 72mm
Using the Kaito Radio antenna, it just clips to the telescoping antenna on the radio (no plug) and extends from the reel to it full length.
It does, it's quite sturdy packaging as well and there's a carrying case that comes with it as well
yes - I love this lens - it's on my camera more than any other one
Yes, I bought it because I have an X201 myself, works perfectly.
Hi Ralph, You can easily activate your TiVo by going to the TiVo website. Copy the link below and paste it in your browser search block. TiVo will walk you through the process and collect your money too! If on-line is not your thing you can call them to set up service at 877-367-8486 https://www3.tivo.com/tivo-mma/activate/activate.do
No, Tivo will not work with satellite TV, DIsh Network or Direct TV. They have their own DVR recorders which the customer must lease directly from their company. Tivo works with most recognized cable companies such as Comcast, Charter, etc.
Yes.
Your best bet is to check out the Tivo Community web site http://www.tivocommunity.com/tivo-vb/ There are gobs of forums (fora) dealing with all sorts of Tivo matters. It's also independent of Tivo so you get the straight talk you need.
Lower arm swings down 90 degrees to place camera into portrait position. Flash and upper arm stay in place.
Yes. All Bogen Heads will work with all Bogen tripods.
Mine isn't handy for a weigh-in at the moment, but Manfrotto's published weight is 1kg or 2.2 lbs.
I have no knowledge of the camera you mentioned. In "most" still and video cameras there is a threaded hole in the bottom where the mounting screw utilized by the Tripod fastens
I know the 77" is that's what I have
The thing about the noise canceling is that it doesn't work 100% well. It acts more like a bass boost imo. It cancels controlled steady noises, like fans and microwaves, but not unpredictable noises that change tones like people speaking and construction. So to answer your question, if you have your music loud enough then yes people will be able to hear it.
The size connection is small for MP3 player. Regards.
The Aspire One I had ran on Windows XP. So I gave up on watching any videos...not enough memory. Kept stopping to buffer and buffer etc. Since Windows 8 supposedly uses a much lower amount of memory and thus frees it up for other programs, maybe it would work ok. But can the hardware support Win 8? I don't know. Bottom line is if streaming video is critical to you, look at another model. This is my personal experience and I am not an IT professional.
When you log into Windows, open Control Panel, User Accounts, click on 'Change Password for your account". This will then be your Windows login password.
All I pretty much listen to is EDM. Once I started downloading it in Flac or Aiff I have never heard such quality from a headphone. I am so happy I found and purchased these. I hear EDM as it is meant to be heard. The bass is fantastic and the vocals are crystal clear. I would buy another set.
Do you mean a selection of pre set sonics...like ampitheater...or jazz..classical..that sort of thing?
This is not a question.
It all depends on how long your labels are. It is a bit over 26 feet total label length, but you waste probably 3/4 inch every time it cuts a label off. If you want it to go farther, make several labels in one printing, and cut them apart with scissors, and you will get more labels on a cartridge.
Not LinkPC they sent me a fake.
Yes
Don't think this is the same "Airplay" technology used by Apple. These have been around a couple of years. I noticed in news from the CES that there do seem to be many Airplay receivers and speaker systems in the works to function with iTunes/iPod. If you've used the Airports to stream, you know it's a pretty cool system.
I would like this answer also. I hooked my up to a toslink convertor an no sound came out of the sound bar. Any help?
No
Not sure what the question is
if it has a usb port, it works with MOST HP printers, my guess is all that have a USB port
Hi There- I am sorry to say it does not. I tried to install it, I took it to Staples technical department they worked on it for 2 days and could not install it and then my personal IT fellow could not. So... don't waste your time and money on this product.
i'm not sure what you mean -- but i really like this product.
After the free 90 period, yes, you have to pay for the updates. It is $39 for three years at a time. All updates are easy through the software provided and a quick software update through your USB port.
I'm pretty sure there are 60 pages in the binder I bought. each sleeve has space for 4 dvd's, 240 discs (and 2 pockets for covers. But let me warn you that the binder is really thick! It gives accurate dimensions , but until you see it , you may not realize just how fat it is. I'm looking for thinner binders that will fit the pages. I think it would help in organizing by movie genre also. Overall, except for its bulk, I am very pleased with purchase.
Yes, absolutely. It's a USB cable that plugs into a USB port on the side of the macbook.
It only had a headphone jack.
No no belt clip
Yes, you can.
No no belt clip
Hi Lestelle, No. This Walkman doesn't have that feature. -Anthony
Yes, you can in the radio option.
attach the usb cable from your walkman to the computer and it will charge
It only had a headphone jack.
A built in battery that can not be owner replaced. With normal use, the battery should last four or five years, longer than most people keep a Walkman.
I took this up with Logitech tech support (June 28, 2013). The first tech rep I spoke to said it's OK. When I got cut off mid-conversation, I called again, and was connected to another tech guy who wasn't sure. He spoke to the product specialist, who recommended against it. I got the impression that earlier versions were provided with adaptor capabilities, but the more recent version has not been tested (and is therefore not supported) for PS/2.
Works with my TiVo HD just fine.
My remote seems to work fine after this mysterious update. You right, nothing seems to have changed.
yes you have to set up ir control with FM TUNER and the remote or you can use original remote

Go to apples website , There you can compare the current models that's available.
They haven't updated it in almost 2 years so if they don't change it at all we can assume that it may be discontinued, because the iPod Touch is expected to get a 128gb model. Personally I would rather pay $250 for 160gb rather than $400 for 128gb.
I gave it as a gift and never got feedback. sorry
This is a back-tracking unit yhat is used to set way points. It is not designed to locate from a remote location. It is meant to help you get back to a position you set that you were at previously.
I've used my GPS quite a bit and the battery is still going strong. I turn it on just before I head into the woods to mark my starting point and then turn it off. When I'm ready to head back to my truck or camo I turn it back on and follow the arrow home.. so it's not like the unit is on the entire time I'm in the woods. Hope this helps you out.
The range is good. It depends on satellites. Sometimes it takes a bit of time to acquire a signal. And it can have trouble in low lying areas, or places where signal interference may be an issue. But I have never had an issue with eventually getting a signal in my area, although it can be slow at times.
If things worked perfect it should - but I found it took way to long to connect with the satellite for my liking. It was raining and after 2-3 minutes in the rain I gave up. That wasn't what I had bought it for, a shower buddy!
I still have it...Do you want to buy from me ..By pedestal you mean stand ..right ?
Yes, there is a scroll where you can change the value of bass from low to super high
Yes
I believe any two prong plug will work in a 3 prong receptor, just not the other way around, i.e., a three prong plug will obviously not work in a 2 prong receptor. The third prong is merely a ground. So it's up to you if you feel it's safe.
As far as I know no it only makes a h264 file
I'm pretty sure not, you need a computer to run the software that actually does the recording, not to mention the hard disk onto which the files are written. This device only encodes your analog material into digital, it doesn't have any processing capacity or disk space...
Take your VHS tapes and turn them into DVD or place them on your computer or turn them into a youtube video.
Yes, AS a matter of fact I used it to increase lighting for a marriage ceremony using the cn 216lr light bounced off the ceiling. It worked out very well, for an hour ceremony non stop.
Sure... if your songs are sync'ed with your computer, when you plug in your new iPod, just re-sync with iTunes to the new iPod and it will copy everything over (depending on how you've configured it). I have three different iPods connected to my Mac, two of them are hard drive based, and so they both are mirror images of each other.
The iHome iP99 will. It's designed for iPhone but will work for iPod Nano 4th Gen.
With the iPod Touch you don't have to do anything to set it up and it doesn't cost anything. It will connect anywhere there is wireless internet as long as it is open or if you have the password to a secure connection. With ours, if we get on it at home we have to type in our password but if you are somewhere that offers Wi-Fi like at a fast food restaurant, all you need to do is open the internet on your iPod and it will come right up. Hope this helps!
Amazon music app
What is the question? Does it have an fm radio? No.
it doesnt matter 8gb or 16gb they have the same battery life, its battery life is like 4-7 hours depending on how you use it... Its battery life isnt even close to what apple claim it to be.
no
The iHome iP99 will. It's designed for iPhone but will work for iPod Nano 4th Gen.
The iPod shuffle comes with the docking station and the headphones included in the box. Everything you would need to start using it, and perfect for a 9 year old girl. They are very tough and durable, though somewhat small (might be easy to loose).

You can use it with both.
Yes, I have the same question, and will only purchase this item if there are speakers that can be used with it. I already have the CA portable digital speakers and use them with my (now full) 8GB ipod nano, doesn't look like the 2GB shuffle is compatible with these speakers.
It comes with a charger cable you can use with your computer but it does not come with a charger you can plug into a wall-type outlet.
yes you can delete them right from the camera

they are included on any I bought good luke
Apple TV does stream music from the cloud. We just got an apple TV for Christmas and it works great!
ATV2 is jailbreakable ATV3 isn't
you guys don't even realize less than 1% of the country have the bandwidth necessary for decent 1080p. why should Apple, or any company, waste money on a feature hardly anyone could run? if you think there is a huge difference between 720p and totally compressed 1080p over a WAN connection, then you are living in make believe land, which is fine, because someone has got to buy all the Monster Cable.
I just spoke with an Apple rep as I am also frustrated with Cover Flow. He said to: (1) plug my ipod into my computer / iTunes (2) go to my nano's Summary page (where you can see the storage space or refresh the unit, etc) (3) click on the Music tab (4) uncheck Display Artwork -- I hope that helps!
I've noticed lately that Amazon has been giving very conservative estimates on its shipment/arrival dates. My items have always arrived well before Amazon's "estimated" arrival dates. I think this is a game they play with us so that we're happy when our packages arrive "early." The real question is whether or not Amazon actually has these in stock. Is Apple holding them back from everybody until Wednesday? Or are they just asking their sellers to not put them in customers' hands until Wednesday?
I am in the same boat as you. I've been considering getting the iPod Touch or the Samsung Galaxy Player 4.2. I've had an older second generation iPod Nano for 5 years and it's still in very good condition, but since it is 2gb, I have ran out of room for my songs. Not sure whether to upgrade to the iPod Touch or the Samsung Galaxy Player.

I use it to control my PS3 at about 20 feet with no problems.
if your convertor is a digitalm convertor. yes it will.
Yes it will work. it's backwards compatible with most Viper alarm systems.
Yes
The version I bought has a Canon lens mount. According to their website (http://www.tamron-usa.com/lenses/prod/1024_diII.asp#ad-image-0) it is available with a Sony mount, but it is designed for DSLRs, not video cameras. I would call Tamron USA to find out for sure.
Sure. Install the apps "Voice Memo" and "iTalk" (or they may have come with the most recent upgrade, $10 from the Apple site), and just leave some memory in the iPod.
To the best of my knowledge this service is no longer available. I had worked for them several years ago and at that point we were struggling to make any impact on the tech market. Best of luck in your search.
It comes as a set of two. It is like a matching transmitter/receiver pair. The set I purchased works well over a short distance, I think it was about 50 or 60 feet. It would not work as far as 150 feet, which is what we needed it for. Also, I don't think you can use one without the other, they only work together. You use Cat5/6 cable, but it does NOT work over an ethernet network.
You could if you use the Netflix BD-Live streaming disc.
Yes, I had the same problem on my SONY BDP-S350, in order for it to play your BD player must have either internal memory (PS3) or external memory (1G or more flash memory) inserted to handle the the BDLive requirements of the disc.
The 550 has 7.1 analog outs (versus 2.0 on the 350) and can internally decode DTS-HD MA, the 350 cannot. If you are like me and do not have an HDMI receiver the 550 is the better choice as I can still get lossless audio through the analog outputs.
MY experience told me that it worked for D300s but not D800. I believe it would work for old model Nikon DSLR.
I am not aware that Canon Rebels take CF Cards.
Yes. It is a very nice leather case with strap. I have enjoyed this lens for a number of years.
YES
I absolutely would only screw it into the wood studs with the screws. Mine is rock solid AND I too am a perfectionist. If it's not in a stud, you MUST use the anchors, but I can't vouch for it's sturdiness.
The kit had the bolts for my Samsung.
According to the Panasonic lens chart for the 14-45 lens, the minimum focus distance is 1 foot or 12 inches. I haven't tested the G1 in the more traditional macro/close-up type approach. I didn't get the impression that the camera likes getting closer than 12". From @2-3', I was able to engage the Extended Zoom (2x) + 4x digital + a Tcon 1.7 teleconverter (1200mm) and got surprisingly good results. I'm not suggesting you do it, but it worked.
There is a little bit of noise from the focal plane shutter. Though it's not as bad as with a conventional SLR's mirror flap.
I heard the later firmware versions prevent one from using third party batteries, but not sure.
You need to lift the table and move the belt to 45rpm wheel!!!Classic :)
Good computer configiration is a must to support a large HDD like 1TB. When you connect a HDD like 1TB its a good idea to divide the 1tb in 2 or 3 partations. Reason : Faster retrival of data without giving too much load to your CPU. This eliminates most of your issues. Based on my experiance Segate is one of the best till day. WD is doing good from the last 2 years.
It's a standard USB cable. While the connection to the computer is a standard (Type A), the fitting on devices are varied, as there are at least 5 different types. The best solution is to take the drive to an electronics store and show them the connection on the device. Additionally, you are not restricted to length, so you can actually get a longer cord if you wish.
PS3 (last i checked) only reads flash drives and hard drives formated in FAT32, not NTSC. Large hard drives come formatted in NTSC, and windows XP and vista will not format large hard drives into NTSC, so you have to download other software on your comp in order to format your hard drive to fat32. Then it will read music, video, pics that are the correct file types that PS3 can read. Also system update your ps3 so it can read as many files as possible. Download this program to format: http://www.compuapps.com/download/Swissknife/swissknife.htm
powered right thru the USB!! no electric wire!!
My brother is more knowledgeable about this than me and he said: "The last several units I have installed all had muvee software on them. After using muvee I chose not to use it and use the old Seagate backup software." Hope this helps.
Is going to ask you for a password which are the last 6 digits of the MAC however after a while the internet signal was not reaching throughout the house and I did attach a Cisco router that allowed me to put a password also and then I will connect only using the Cisco password.
Hi, I asked Amazon customer service and this is the reply I got. Hello from Amazon.com. As informed by an appropriate department, this item "Seagate FreeAgent Go USB 2.0 Portable External Hard Drive" is compatible with Windows 7. I hope this information is helpful and thanks for shopping at Amazon.com. UPDATE: I purchased it and yes, it does support Win 7.

Don't have it with me at the moment, but the maintenance manual indicates the existence of an express card slot. You need to get the 7-character model number and look it up on the Lenovo website to be certain.

Pretty much. My friend and I were discussing this when my hard drive was failing. Basically, these hard drives are just refurbished of hard drives and they put them into the external hard drives (like these).
DD-WRT and OpenWRT are popular customer firmwares available for certain routers. They allow the hardware to be used in ways other than the original factory settings, sometimes resulting in greater stability, or the addition of certain features. http://www.dd-wrt.com/ https://openwrt.org/
I really don't know. We have it in the loft of our home and it can reach to the driveway about 150 feet away. Also we have a metal roof so it may block the signal strength. I hope this helps.
Axion - the additional antenna is essentail
Otterbox makes an armband!
I have it being tripped by grass blowing on windy days. Good luck.
The manual says the rf range is up to 450ft. depending on receiver. Mine is about 100 ft away from the 330a and works very well. At first mounted my sensor in the sun and it had a lot of false alarms, I was able to move to the shade and it is very dependable. The detection range on my sensor is pretty close to 40 ft. and it is mounted 8 ft off the ground.
The screen is approx. 12" diagonally and the computer weighs around 3.5 pounds total. It's an extremely light model and very easy to carry around.
I could not answer that for sure. It is working just fine in my son's gaming computer. He needed a stronger power supply because he added a video card.
It's basically the same remote just doesn't have the multiple LEDs like the original. I like it.
Yes. I had a problem programming it, but I took it to the Geek Squad at Best Buy and they did it in 2 minutes, no charge.
it doesnt attach to camera. it attaches to the filter threads on the end of the lens. as long as you are connecting to correct size the threads are standard.
Hell no. Like 45 very low light I had to put a splitter and put two of the bubbles in one just to make it bright enough. I no longer use this set. Very cheap wish I had kept my money and got something better. But I thought I could make it work since I was only doing small shoots... I was wrong this is terrible. I'm just being honest. Save your money to invest in something better and the back drop stand is terrible
Don't use it ..threw it away
I bought the item for my Nikon D90 and you should contact a camera shop for the straight skinny. By the way, it is one of two parts needed to connect your camera to your telescope. The adapter fits onto another part that is directly attached to the telescope as you would an eyepiece.
Yes, just get the one for the canon mount. Remember these are manual focus as the lens and the camera can't communicate.
I don't know this camera, however if Canon exchangeable lenses fits this will also
I bought one of these and it works, but not as well as I had hoped. It is quality made, but remember if you turn your lens around you lose autofocus. I saw a review done on Youtube where a photographer compared everything from different length macro lens to extension tubes to a reversing ring and the the reversing ring performed the worse. I am thinking that you aren't allowed to post links on here. But if you go to Youtube do a search for "8 Best Macro Lenses (Unbiased review)" and see what Jim Harmer had to say.
I don't know why it wouldn't work. The filter thread size of 52mm should work with that lens. When you say it didn't fit, you mean it wouldn't screw on to the end of the lens? Or the lens wouldn't connect to the camera body with the reversing ring attached?
If you are using the reverse mount, you are mounting the lens backwards. This means there will be no electric connections to the camera. You must set your lens to manual and adjust the focus and exposure manually, otherwise it will not work. Which lens are you using? Did you attach the ring to the front of the lens glass or the cameras lens mount?
Any M42 screw mount lens should work with this adapter. I have 2 of these and they work flawlessly on my 70d and more.
No it does not work
This allows you to mount an M42 mount lens on a MD body.
I don't think you lose any light. It's very thin and there's no glass. The lens I used it on was a zeiss 50mm f1.4 originally for 35mm contax film camera, so using it on a Canon 20d with aps size sensor did make it a 75mm lens more or less. Works quite well.
The ones I received expire Dec 2024.
Power-saving feature, or misfeature, of the device. Its fatal flaw. Best workaround is to turn up the volume high on the iPad, and use the volume controls of the Logitech to control volume.
Yes. I use it with an iphone 4 in my office sometimes. You will occasionally get a message that says " this product is not optimized for iphone" because technically it's not shielded for phone use. I just ignore the message. I have never heard a bit of interference or had any trouble receiving calls. It charges fine as well.
The SD1100's zoom only goes out to a film equivalent of 38mm vs 28mm of both the G10 & SD880.
I purchased two additional batteries for my Cannon. They were both made in Japan.
I think the difference is the silver canon is not sold from amazon but 3rd party...I just purchased the coach kit strictly from amazon...so not sure if this helps, but it seemed as if that is the only thing I could come up with.
I heard something from Ritz Camera guy.. he just said we can definitely buy on Black friday...
Yes, I have one in my camera right now.
I have a camera without a viewfinder, and it is a problem to see anything outdoors in the sun. On my next camera purchase, I will go back to having a viewfinder.
no, it does not. i use it in a Polaroid Colorpack 210. the only film i know of that works in Polaroid 600 cameras is made by the Impossible Project.
Yes outer threads
I bought it for a Nikon lens... but is sold as a filter for any lens needing a 55mm filter
You have to check the lens that you are using with your T4i. If you look straight at it, it should say X mm somewhere. For example, the one I have is 58mm so a 55mm filter will not fit it. Also, make sure you don't confuse that number with the zoom length, which is probably also in mm (for example, 18-55mm).
My Hoya filter box was not sealed. The filter is wonderful... my photos are clearer than they were with the cheaper filter from another manufacturer that I bought with the lens. I am happy with the Hoya filter.
No a 55mm lens protector won't fit on a 67mm lens. Look for the 67mm UV protector if your lens is a 67mm one.

No. Look at the end of the lens that is not attached to your camera and it will have writen 72mm for the 28-135mm lens. This number is the size of the filter that you will need for this lens. You can also look up your lens on the canon site and look at the specifications for each canon lens that you own. If you have the same canon 28-135mm lens I own, then you need a 72mm filter.

This is a deep cycle wheel chair battery. It is not meant as a starting battery for a car.
Usually there is a little rubber cover over the hole for connection. Look in the hole and see what it looks like and compare it to the end on the shutter release. Not all are the same for the different models and very frustrating.
I don't think its the right cord for the d3100. Check a camera site for accessories for that camera.
This remote does not require any programming - it plugs directly into the camera and works.
I got it as gift for someone else so I don't know. sorry
According to their website it is only for BD35K, but I wonder if they would honor it for the 55K. I might try. http://www2.panasonic.com/consumer-electronics/shop/Video/Blu-ray-Disc-Players.list.75009_11002_7000000000000005702
gojo Well, I can tell you that I talked to Panasonic and you will have to hard player to something in order for it to go online. You will need an ethernet adapter with LAN cable. This is what you would use to play games, so they are called internet wireless bridge, or adapter bridge. Just make sure you can use a LAN cable with it since there are no other options on player. Check out other threads concerning this too. They mention types of adapters to use. Val
You have to look at the speed level on the card. Sometimes it makes a difference in performance. I always choose fastest available. On the SDHC cards the fastest acting card is a Class 6. Regular SD cards use so many different speed types its crazy-- example 40X to over 100X. As far as brand, I would imagine most work with this machine. I use a cheap brand SDHC with my Panasonic camera.
Secondary audio settings will only effect the audio over HDMI. It should be turned off so audio bandwidth can be freed up for the lossless audio codecs. With standard DD and DTS over optical it should not have any effect.
Yes
Yes, but there are way faster routers out in the market than this. Check the specs and compare. I only use it solely for the SIM feature.
Yes this card is PCI, not PCI-E one. Regards.
Yes, just get a connector with dual female ends and a length of coax cable to reach between the antenna and your tv.
Hi Susan. You don't need a digital TV converter. You can connect the RCA Antenna directly to cable input of your flat TV. But the signal that you will get from broadcast through this antenna will usually depend on your location. I think digital converters are needed only to old tvs(analog tvs).
Unfortunately not much can be done. I disconnected mine and purchased the powered flat 50 mile amazom antenna. The one you have does not state a range. I could only get 4 channels. But i am now getting about 25-35 and i am about 30 miles outside of Chicago.
Mine did not come with a stand or easel. The seem to work better when laid flat anyway.
I note that this camera does take SD and SDHC cards, so this will fit. Keep in mind that this is JUST the adapter for a micro-sd card. So you need to have a micro-sd card that fits into this adapter. Then it can be used in your camera.
Keep in mind this is an adaptor and has no memory. As long as the slot in the Nintendo accepts this size adaptor and you purchase an Micro SD card to go into the adaptor it will work. One caution is to check what size chip that the Nintindo will accept. It is possible that a Micro SD chip larger than 32 GB might not not be addressed correctly by the Nintendo even though this adaptor will take 64GB Micro SD's
No.
It will run pretty well. There's a video on youtube with someone running it with only 1GB of RAM and it's fine. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AykH-zUcPJw
Conrad, There is a way actually. Amazon allows you to rent movies for just a couple of bucks. You just download it and you are able to watch it for about a 24 hour period. Also, if you have another computer you can use the disk drive to put it on the computer and then transfer it via usb. A great software to use for this is (Xilisoft DVD Ripper Platinum 4). You just put in the DVD you own, run this software and choose witch format you'd like to convert it to and your done. Simple as pie!
You need the adapter, but is included
sounds like you need to learn to manually set the exposure , shutter speed, f-stop etc. This lens cannot autmatically do so, there are on-line tutorials, etc.that may hep. Perhaps you can find classes in your area.
I believe it does but this would be a question better directed to the seller. They respond pretty quickly
If you order the model for the Alpha 77, it comes with the correct adaptor. But having just bought one myself, I would not order again. It did nit meet my expectations. You get what you pay for...
I'm not sure.y camera is a Sony Alpfa 900. I had to request an adapter for it so you will probably have to do that for yours
Yes
@K. chambers Yes. It's pre-installed
Yes
No it doesn't. I just use the camera strap.
I'm not 100% but I assume so since the majorityof stuff is made that way. I bought this about 1 1/2 years ago for my kids kindergarten class. When they return to school I will try to look into it and post a review. Sorry this doesn't help much now. But you might be able to contact sony and ask them.
yes
If you notice on the description, they sort of "hide" the full details of most items, if you click the link just below it that says to view more, this surge protector claims to carry-through 1800W. I can't verify this since I have picked up my own, but maybe someone else who's purchased it can.
Unfortunately it uses RF technology. Which is good in that you don't need line of sight to operate the device, but I have yet to figure out if I can configure my universal remote (which uses RF) to operate it.
You still need a cable card. We've had our Moxi for 3 years. It does all that TiVo does but it's not as user friendly...in my opinion.
This is not directly answering your question but rather giving you my opinion about the disc itself. If you have printed on regular printable discs before with your printer and the picture is so-so, a good picture but not vibrant, well these discs bring out the "Vibrant"!! I have printed several hundred of these discs with a cheap Epson Artisan50 and when people see them they say "Wow" these look like they were professionally done!! End of Story. If your Canon Pixma MX922 is set up to print DVD/CD discs then i don't think you will be disappointed.
I know it is compatible with my SX10 IS and works great. I would assume it would then also work with the SX30 IS but cannot give you a definitive yes. If you can find that answer, this flash is a terrific value. Not the best flash on the market but way better than anything comparably priced. Good luck!
I don't know positively, but I assume it would. As I said in my review, it is custom-tailored to the Canon EOS cameras. It works seamlessly with my 5D classic, and also did on my 40D before I sold it. There's really nothing to program; just attach, turn on, and shoot! Hope this helps!
They won't prevent you from hearing loud noises like say a motorcycle or truck when your out jogging,walking, etc (which may be a good thing) but they do a decent job of letting you hear the music with minimum interference. I think they are worth the price. You can spend more for better earbuds but if your looking for decent sound without high price they are worth the money.
And now they are saying they were $79.95 to try to make $14.95 sound like a good Cyber Monday deal? Really?
As of yet I have not had a problem with them, but it hasn't yet been a year.
As of yet I have not had a problem with them, but it hasn't yet been a year.
They do work with the Note II! I actually have the same phone and bought them specifically to use with it for listening to music not realizing they had a microphone as well. My mother, who is hard of hearing, says the sound quality on calls is perfect. Could not be happier with my purchase!
I would say try to call them. My JBuds were great then one day they just stopped working.... O_o I called in, explained that they don't work and they shipped out new headphones the same day. I've never dealt with better customer service, no dumb questions were asked like "Did I cut the wire or chew it" (Sony customer service lol) they just sent it out. I could have gotten lucky but who knows, call them at 1.866.358.6640 and good luck.

I don't have a Samsung tablet but they do work with my wifi only Ipad2
As of yet I have not had a problem with them, but it hasn't yet been a year.
Hey Hun about 30cm long and yes it can work with your samsung but honestly I would recommend you go for the j5 instead of the j2 reason being is that it holds in your ear much better and it sound better but it is a little more then than the j2.hope you find this info helpful.
yes and yes
I would definitely recommend two people. You have to screw the TV to the bracket while the TV is being held. You need the ability to hold the TV, which you really need two hands to do, which leaves no hands to insert and secure the screws.
This thing is a beast. I mounted a 65" LED, not a problem. I think it should handle any of the large flat screens, limited only by what you are attaching it to the wall with, and what type of wall. I made sure to use lag bolts (included) and pre-drill into the wall studs.
Shouldn't be a problem If I recall mine was the same situation
Yes. That is how mine is connected.
I don't use any external amplifier. I just have a headphone plugged into it. The phone's loudness controls are more than adequate since I have to back off the volume.
Yes but only works for local calls. If you speed dial long distance calls, it doesn't place the one and will not dial through.
yes
The cable itself is 60" long. I didn't measure the plugs just the wire.
Yes I believe it will. I have shelving walls between in my system and still works
Yes, it certainly does. And a Schuka plug. Additionally the manual is in 9 languages.
The product has not been released yet according to Amazon, therefore they are not letting people post reviews yet.
Obviously you don't live in Miami...6 figure cars are certainly commonplace here.
You can't. There is only one Ethernet jack on this phone. What you need is something like the Cisco SPA525 or 514 or 504 or other model that act as a switch. Those phones will allow you to connect to phone to the Ethernet and then your computer to the phone. For all these phones you will need a power adapter because I seriously doubt the hotel will have PoE ports.
Yes you can.
If I remember correctly the drives just screw directly into the chassis.
I would imagine that by now (Dec. 1, 2008) you have seen these sets of review posts?
Same thing happened to me, although it worked for about a month before dying completely
Yes
Yes, it is.
It's been a while but I don't think so. I really like the product.
You can but the field of view is pretty narrow
No. Daylight will damage the electronics.
I am not sure to what you are referring as the "adhesive mount disk.". If you mean an extra disk to be applied to the dashboard, it's about the same size as th TomTom disk. The Arkon mount works so well with the windshield, you won't need it. I can put it low on the windshield on the left side. The TomTom is easy to see there.
We have to measure the screen diagonally to find out the size. Also, you will need to determine if it will be 19W (wide) or a regular 19". I actually had to google my monitor model# to find out the correct size (after ordering the 19W in error). Hope I helped.
It depends on the angle. If they're behind you- even from a couple of feet, they can see the screen
If this is the product in question: http://www.dell.com/us/p/inspiron-15r-se-7520/pd No. This processor would not work in a laptop. If you have the product in my link any of the processors at this link could be compatible. http://ark.intel.com/products/family/65506/3rd-Generation-Intel-Core-i7-Processors#@Mobile Safest bet is to find out what the TDP is of the processor currently in use and match FSB and TDP with socket type and processor series.
At its longest point the box is just under 11 3/4 inches, it is 6 3/8 inches wide and 6 5/8 inches tall
yes about 12-13 will fit in, but the case will not close as the jewel cases are too high. the case is too wide to lie it down sideways
As far as I recall, the transceiver is not RF based so I don't think that you will have problems.
Unfortunately this item is not allowed to be shipped to the UK per the terms of the manufacturer. So please see your local distributor in the UK.
Metal and very sturdy
I didnt install it , my brother did .but the nut size looks to be a 9/16 foe the top and like a 3/8 for the lower terminal .Hope this helped
sorry, we dont.
Dump the crappy CFL's and use proper photo-floods. I use 500w photo floods and make sure the umbrellas are not super close. This is a really good-value-for-money setup. It won't last a million years but if you are doing casual shooting, occasionally, it is just fine.
I would personally want a lot more light for video. I think this is better for still shots with a camera on a tripod and a slow shutter speed.
These lights are 5 pounds at the most. It shouldn't cost that much.
LxWxH 17.5"x12.25"x4.5" Diagonally 20.75 All internal dimensions.
You can......but I found it doesn't really need it!
It comes with a stand off for pole mounting with a clamp for a 1 1/4" - 1 1/2" pole, pipe, or broom stick, if you like. You do not have to use the stand off or clamp, which is not assembled when delivered. It can be laid on attic rafters or hung with string most anywhere. Connection is an antenna wire only. Coax or flat twin lead. This is NOT an amplified antenna. It does NOT need electric power, nor will it accept power.
I think yes I use it in my Mini Copper in the configuration you have just mentioned. I did add a 30 pin jumper cable that is connected inside the glove box with the adapter and then I use my lighting cable at the other end for my iPhone 5s.
i now use an IOS device with lightning. if i remember correctly though, this piece did not work very well.
I am pretty sure that this docking station is for the newer SATA hard drives only.
Yes
Yes. It stores photos and videos. It stores any type of file you can store on your computer (PC or MAC). It works perfectly for both a backup of your files, but also for moving a large amount of data from one computer to another by saving your files to the drive on one computer, and then saving from the drive the files onto another computer. My wife has a MAC and I a PC..and we can share and help each other edit photos or videos. My two drives are still working perfectly. Hope this helps.
Im not sure. But i do not recommend this one. I put so much info on it and one day it just wouldnt work. It woukd spin but no lights or anything on the screen. Had to pay 50$ to get the files off if it. I say spend that extra 50 now and buy a WD passport. Works like a charm.
I'm not really sure. It should though, but I'm not aware of MIDI itself having any actual specific commands for sustain.
I think Creative Vado HD is superior to the rest. You can search Amazon.com for Creative Vado HD or look at http://nothingbutcreative.blogspot.com/ for sample clips from Vado HD. It's really promising.
yes
I do not believe there is any timeframe for the length of time that this item can be effective I've had mine for over 5 years and it works like new, as far as I know it can be used on all cds & dvds.
The bag is 9 inches wide by 6 inches tall and 5 inches deep.
I'm using it on Windows 7. It's definitely 64 bit.
Yes
Yes. Mine came with 2. One with the mic and one with the stand.
Yes the bag is all black outside and inside I hope this helps p.s. I love the bag a lot of room
If you hit the "Ctrl" key and the "+" key at the same time, the text gets larger, and successively larger each time you do it. Similarly "Ctrl" and "-" makes it smaller. That may be what you're inadvertently doing.

NO
It could clamp into an air vent but it doesn't come with the clip, you would have to buy that somewhere else. I stuck mine to my windshield with 2 way tape and it comes off the mount but to get the mount off I would have to use a razor blade.
Parrot works with any kind of phone ones they have bluetooth. If your phone has bluetooth capability it will work with Parrot devices.
I'm not an expert on this device. You should contact Crutchfield, and they will advise you.
That would depend on what you hook it up to, mine is hookud up to a vcr that records 8 hours at a time.
SIM card or phone memory card? SIM card no. Memory card yes.
It wouldn't work with Windows 8 on my new pc. It's been awhile since I tried or researched it. Win8 was not in the writeup on their website. Could have changed. I went back to my old pc with Vista. Don't have wireless capability. Also bought another hard drive and Windows 7 for my new pc cuz I can't stand Win8.
In order to record images from this camera on your laptop, you will need an appropriate adaptor to connect the camera to the laptop. This camera terminates in a BNC connector. Few laptops have a BNC-in port for a composite signal. You will also need appropriate security recording software.
I have the Samsung E360 DVD player with zoom in stock.
It does come with a manual; but this is a simple machine - it's fairly easy to figure out - I personally never used the manual but if you're stumped ask online, or maybe inquire the manufacturer to mail you even email you the PDF for the unit you have. Good luck!
Yes it does. The kit comes with the required power cords
Not that I know of.
Yes, it will work with your Blackberrie & 2G, you do not need to plug anything into this unit, this unit will work up to 3ft away!
probably means 2 batteries in the pack - that is how mine came. Do not know for sure.
No expiration date on batteries or package. The first package of Panasonic telephone batteries have been in use for months and were the answer to batteries that needed replacing. Bought a second package for another phone which is where I checked for an expiration date.
Sorry, I hit the wrong answer. No, you cannot use these cables to go from RCA to component. You can find an RCA to component converter and pair that with rca and component cables to make it work.
I had no luck. I bought it and got no signal. Even did a continuity test and seems as if there is no connection. Good luck but I think this is a novelty. No actual way to convert technology.
I wouldn't unless you know that the ps3 internals use a sata 2 data and power cable and you would also need a copy of the Sony PS3 OS in order to make the swap, so in all yes but research a lot.
There is not any disk exposed. It's a regular SATA hard drive, which I am using right now. Probably you are having an optical illusion :)
You check in system information screen (apple logo). It can only be update at apple store. New ones are all latest firmware
Shouldn't be a problem. I use mine with XP Pro x64 via VMWare Fusion and have had no issues.
it's 9mm to 10mm manual zoom. Don't know exactly but a guess would be closer to 10X Zoom Optical. No digital zoom.
zoom is manual..... no pan as this is a fixed camera
It'll work with any shotgun mic with similar casing and thickness. The shock mounts internally are made of a very durable rubber so you shouldn't have any problem getting the ATR-6550 in there.
Yes
Yes
Yes it works for cyber shot sc-w530 and the car charger is a major bonus.
If the broken hard drive can be fixed by something like Apple Disk Utility, this product would work. If your laptop hard drive has bigger problems and crashed, you will have to take it to a data recovery service such as Disk Doctor. The StarTech product is a docking station that can hold two hard drives (either 2.5" or 3.5"). It provides the drives power and a USB cable that is used to connect the docking station to a computer.
yes
Your question does not deserve an answer. Cs5 is a very expensive program. Buy The mac then Buy cs5 .
If you sign up for direct tv than yes http://www.directv.com/international/filipino. If you do they should be provided a dish and a satellite tuner but there will be a monthly subscription. You won't be able to get signal from actual Filipino satellites.
Can I receive the full service here in the Bahamas and what is the monthly subscription?
No
At Crosley..... http://www.crosleyradio.com/Accessories Or right here on Amazon. http://www.amazon.com/Crosley-NP1-Replacement-Needle/dp/B0002FO2IO
No this is Poe consumer so you can power it without using the wall plug power supply.
Modem, phone cord, power cord, user manual cd, how to connect to Internet with AT&T sheet
Yes. I use this modem to connect to my ISP and I can connect to the VPN for my company. The modem does network address translation for my home network.
I used a cheap Boss set that I also got on Amazon for around $11. I believe it was 8 Gauge.
I have no idea if that would work but I have to ask why would you want to do that? Its a very expensive solution to use the multiport adapter ($77 from amazon) to replace a $20.00 Ethernet switch
Yes...it comes with an adapter to use it for one plug in option.
These frequencies are not supposed to be used for land to land and most are designated for "boating related discussion only." At this price I'm sure you can get some Motorola walkies for much cheaper.
VHF is 'line of sight' transmission which essentially means that if the two locations wishing to communicate can 'see' the antenna of the other then communication is possible. Normally with a hand-held radio such as this one it would mean that you're limited to considerably less than 15 miles because the curve of the earth will preclude a 'line of sight' that far. The only exception would be if the other location (i.e. - the Lock) has a very tall antenna then it could be possible, but only if the antenna is very tall.
Yes
You can go up to 2GB RAM (cost: $24 at Crucial). It's easy enough to switch out the sticks. Don't know about switching out the HD. HP makes a 6-cell battery for it.
Yes you can put in a larger SSD hard drive. I was looking at one that is 32GB. Forgot the vendor name though. I think it was something patriotic in the name. Maybe Patriot?
dont know dont like macs probably
No. I purchased a new battery and was unhappy to learn that I had to purchase a new charger due to a very slight change in design.
We have the model with the switch and it works great. I think as long as the plug,fits inside if the recharger unit it should recharge. Maybe you should check on the return policy if it does not fit.
It's just the speakers with the box
No, it has it's own plug built into the back. I love it.
Most of the manufacturers have done away with the 5 year warranties on the majority of their drives. This one only comes with a 1 year warranty. Some of the better quality, heavier duty drives come with a 3 year warranty, but you typically pay a lot more for those drives. Check newegg. They may have one with a better warranty in your price range.
You may have to contact Olympus with that question. The E-500 wasn't listed as one of the compatible cameras in the listing. I have the E-510.
Kalyuan Chen Sorry I cannot answer this question for you, I am using this flash with a Olympus E520 and is working great. Regards Bob
Can't exactly say it broke on first use. But when putting it together could drop it to about four foot to clip on drape.
I've used several different backdrops for this particular stand and they have all worked well. However, a few of the backdrops have been heavy enough to make the stand a bit unsteady, otherwise I have encountered no other issues of incompatibility.
I doubt it since the Apple Fire uses an HDMI to interface withe audio. The iPod does not have such an input.
It depends what type of speakers. This is not an amplifier so if you are hopping to plug the speakers directly in, no. If you have an amplifier for the speakers you need to get an adapter that has a 3.5 mm plug on one end.
No. The volume provides what is the device you are connecting this dock
I bought this for my daughter's 4th gen ipod touch and it all works. It also works for my 2nd gen ipod touch.
Absolutely, our family room is about the same size with a high vaulted ceiling.
I don't know. I returned it because I have a metal roof.
Yes it is
it's hard to tell from the information you have mentioned but if you are speaking of not hearing " aircraft " base stations then unless you live close to the airport , that is normal. aircraft base stations are typically fairly low powered and have closer to the ground antennas designed to transmit mostly up into the air. the fact you are hearing aircraft suggests the antenna is working and that it's capable of hearing normal high powered base stations ( like police, trunking or pager transmitters ).

Hello Kevin! I have a 05 Navi TL and the pa15-hon2 works flawless with it! Buy with confidence!!
By AUX i suppose you mean the 3.5mm headphone. If this is the case, then NO. The aux input only transmits audio so you WON'T be able to change tracks or charge your device or display text through the aux. Only the 30 pin connection can charge and control Ipod/Iphone devices as well as display text.
Between 4-6 feet if I remenber
In theory, yes. I am not familiar with a canon gl2, but i use this to transfer video from my sony hdv camcorder to a pc with windows 8, using the firewire cord. If you have been able to transfer video to another computer with firewire, then this should work the same way. it's just adding a firewire port to your pc if one doesn't exist there.
yes. i have 8.1. no problems so far
NO, draws power from PCI slot
I haven't heard an ounce of motor noise come through this, it runs beautifully. It doesn't have an auto-matic cue and it should run through a mixer just fine
This is not a mixer. This is a turn table. You need a stylus that fits a 500.v3

No, any brand USB drive up to the maximum size it can handle (I don't remember exactly, but I think it goes up to 1TB?). I use a variety of usb thumb drives in it all the time, as well as larger drives (both WD and non-WD). It's a spiffy little machine and has handled every video format I've thrown at it so far :-) Hope this helps.
The flat band in the middle is flexible so they auto adjust, some of the most comfortable headphones due to this fact. There's hardly any tension on the ears.
I can't remember if it's included in the package, but either way an adapter costs like 1-2$.
It doesn't say what cameras it fits. But it does mount to already existing camera lens. Says compatibility 52,55,or 58mm mount. Beware, this is not a zoom. It just makes it more defined. "HD"
Check your local store. It might save a lot of shipping and refunding.
Yes!
It's supposed to. The 7D mark II can or at least should be backwards compatible with the LP-E6 batteries and gear. That's per the canon website. The LP-E6 and its "N" counter part only differ by the chip used on the battery and a slight capacity increase.
The Canon Website (http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/cameras/slr_cameras/eos_70d#SuppliesAndAccessories) shows this as an accessory to the 70D. I use it on the 5D Mark II and the 7D. It's great for doing updates to the camera's firmware (also on the same page). Hope this helps you.
Your buying just the grip. Batteries sold separately
This is NOT a spam seller. You will be fine ordering them :)
This is the Canon manufactured LP-E6 battery. It will work in any Canon camera that uses the LP-E6 battery. The T1i uses the LP-E5 battery they look completely different and it won't fit. Probably have different electrical characteristics also.
Don't know about a Magellan. Try www.rammount.com This might help: Internal Dimensions: Width=6", Height=4", Depth=1.75" External Dimensions: Width=6.5", Height=5.25", Depth=2"
Unfortunately, I don't know. I don't have a lense hood. But these screw on directly to the lenses. It would depend on how your hood is attached.
The wires can run inside the pipe
I do not have pictures but assembly is very simple. There are four L-brackets that attach to the slides and are then screwed to the underside of your work surface. It took me all of five minutes to complete my installation.
If you want the keyboard to go under the front edge of your desk when pushed in need at least 16 inches
There is one slot per each memory card one behind the other
If the memory card is an SDHC memory card it will work. The camera comes with a 32 MB card that is barely adequate, I replaced it with an 8 GB card and it works fine--many more photos!
Garmin has a really good customer service team. Call them...they can answer the question for you. I've never heard of nuvi 355
Sorry I do not know answer to this question.
I wasn't sure what model that was so I googled it. That took me to ebay, where a company was selling a home dock which looked like it would fit mine ( a sportster5) and a group of others.If your st5r is a starmate 5, then yours should fit the audiovox speaker system as well. By the way I still love the sound that comes out of this. Jeff S
Hi...I have the same question. I hope it works with the Stilleto since I already bought it for a X-Mas present
Remove the silver reflector first of course. squeeze the diffuser and muscle them on. Simple. Once
As long as the tablet works with the micro SD card then it will work in it... u see these card are what stores photos, videos and much more on phones. .. so they are like having extra storage for memory...

My ipod is approx 2 1/2"w x 4" tall & it fits. Not sure of the measurement of the first gen.
Yes. The Tv is Vesa compatible, which is what the mount is. Your tv is 400x400. The mount is measured up to 710x450. Your tv will weigh approximately 40 lbs and the mount is rated for weight up to 165 lbs. Hope that helps.
I am still using iPhone 4s, and the "Nike+ Apps" is applicable to any iPhone models, I'm pretty sure it will work, have not tried on latest OS version. This Nike+ sensor will work also with other brand running shoes,(so you're not limited with just Nike shoes but other brands) if you buy a "Nike+ Sensor Holder" (amazon also carries it) which straps around the shoe lace.
I think this would work with a nike plus app regardless of if it's on an ipod/iphone. However just so you know, this is a product that has to be worn in a specific kind of running shoe. Look for the Nike symbol on the bottom of the shoe. It slides in underneath the inside liner. It only works with running or walking. It doesn't do me any good if I'm in the gym on an elyptical machine or bike, or stair climber.
Use WWW.militarycac.com for all troubleshooting
if you live south of Virginia you can get the signal off of 61w.North of there you would need an in line amplifier,but yes you can get 61w.
Yes it will i use it with mine
No. Crop sensor only. Look at their website. They only have a couple Nikon full frame.
Yes, it will work very well with a D5100!
I am looking at the Eagle Tech Foldable Keyboard as I write this, and can confirm that it does not lock when placing it upon your lap. I would not recommend using in your lap. However, on a flat surface, it works awesome.
There is a hole in the bottom of its case. I placed it where I wanted it on top of the computer's case, marked the hole's location and bored a corresponding hole in the case - being sure to catch the metal shavings. Then, I bolted it in place. (I ran the drive cables up the back of the computer case where they are exposed and have been knocked loose.)
It's for the fan. I simply unplugged the fan and routed it to a separate fan controller that was powered by my main psu
Yes it is actually very forgiving as far as power is concerned... a 12 volt battery should work just fine... the unit is very simple to wire... I use it with a small strobe light
This memory will work in the newer models of Aspire One (models AD257 and higher).
That would be a "NO" If I read the specs right you are running PC-2700 and that in no way can be upgraded to what you want.
No, I do not believe this is compatible with your Netbook, however you can try crucial.com and run the program to see if you can upgrade.
Yes it is. You can always check owc.com for what ram is compatible for your mac
I don't know, but it have worked in American, Asian and European cars that I've tried
Six feet. I just measured it.
it will fit as long as the spotting scope has the standard threads on the bottom of it. as far as the opening.........i mount it on 1''x1'' square tubing and it could still mount on something larger with no problem.
Although I can't be 100% sure, if the scope mounts like a camera, then I would say it would work
Here is some discussion on mac compatible: http://www.epizenter.net/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?199953
The Vado HD outputs in 1080i through the HDMI cable. From my tests it appears to be for both live and playback video. Therefore if your PC has a HDMI input it should be possible to use it as a webcam, allowing you to record as well. The only "problem" I see is that you cannot remove the text that you see on the screen (e.g. time left).
It is very sturdy and as long as the pattern matches and the weight works I wouldn't see a problem. I had my 150 lb son hang on mine before I put my TV on it...he has legs to break the fall, TV does not. It did not budge.
No. To tilt the TV, you have to loosen a lever on the back by hand. It takes all of 10 seconds, however. You can angle the TV to the left and right without adjusting anything.
This is polyester.
Long after you do, most likely. No UV inside a record cover...
There is no fine powdery substance on the Mobile Fidelity Inner Sleeves. The only sleeves that I have seen a fine power residue were on ones that came with a record that Record Technology, Inc. (RTI) pressed. That was only one time that I noticed it.
The 2000-K model is simply a different black chrome color as opposed of the silver on the HDJ-2000 and otherwise has the same specifications.
It comes with a regular headphone jack. So I use them when I travel with my phone and then when I need need to dj I add the 1/4 jack that comes included and use it for my my dj gear
No
Yes, we do have this external battery charger and the Amazon item number is B00FIJXWY4. Please let us know if you have problem to order it. Best regards Bill
Yes
Yes, this car adapter/charger will work with the nuvi 205. I just used it and it worked great.
Plenty long enough, but the resistor which prevents the NUVI from going into map loading mode is somewhat intermittent, or causes a long wait for the NUVI to complete it's booting cycle..
Not that I know of...
The cable is 4' 6" long.
I want to know if it works with windows 7 and if not what can i buy or install to get it to work?
I'm not sure actually. I do know that mini HDMI and micro HDMI are not the same. Mini HDMI is larger. I hope that helps.
All Lomography film is past the expiration date but does not give you a specific date.
Yes it should. Mac mini's use the same memory as laptops because of their size and the PC2-5300 is the proper speed rating for your Mac Mini. You can go to www.crucial.com to look it up. Hanh.
Some laptops do not apply full power to the USB ports, if it runs on one your computer supplies full power and you do not need the extra plug.
It should. I use a samsung mp3, but it also works with mine and my sons cell phones which are different brands. Basically, any device that has mp3 songs stored on it. There's a short wire that plugs into the headphone jack and then into the FMtransmitter device. When the two are linked, it "broadcasts" over the car's radio speakers. The FMtransmitter's buttons are to select a station you manually sync the car's radio to the station on the FMtransmitter... obviously, a station that isn't otherwise broadcasting; you know, one of the static stations.
Yes, but I would spend a few extra bucks for a more sturdy product.
It probably is. I purchased it for an old dell laptop and it worked.
Yes
yes
mine was 6 months and it works great!
Hi Dorothy. The answer is yes technically, it could work for both due to same old fashion technology. This kind of cable works in my Windows PC, MacBook laptop, and HP printers. Check your connector types and go. In the worst case returns at Amazon are so easy and free.
I doubt it. It works between printers and other devices. Anyway, the Shure USB Mic should just connect into the USB plug on the laptop unless the laptop it too old to have a place to connect a USB.
I believe the HTC one uses a micro HDMI not a mini HDMI.
If you are using it to charge from your computer, it should. I just tried it on my Droid and it is charging.
I looked up your Garmin and it has traffic capability, so yes this will work with your unit.
This is just a wireless access point, and not a router (with switch). So there is not the typical 4 Ethernet switched ports that you would normally find on a traditional wireless router. Hope this helps.
Hi Samit, I don't have a lens that large but if you screw the camera on snugly, it should work. The tripod itself is very study for what I've used it for. You can lock the top into place so I imagine it should bear the weight. Again, I haven't tried the extra weight on it myself, but it's worth a shot! Andrea
I just got this and it works with my cricut machine to my laptop.
They suck and fall down so not worth trying to
Yes it will. Hoodman Loupe is 3.0" and can fit LCD screens up to 3.2". The Canon t4i screen is 3.0"
Yes will work on any LCD monitor or even cell phone screen.One of the best things I ever seen looks like 3D
No, but you wouldn't know it.
You can use turboccc's TTSVoiceEditor utility. It allows you to edit and change the Garmin VPM voice file. I also have a 660 and purchased an 885T and was also disappointed with the weak volume. The utility allowed me to increase the 885T to almost as loud as the 660. A side benefit of this utility is the ability to change the default announcements like "recalculating" to a saying of your choice. Mine now says "we're making this up as we go", which drew some giggles from passengers. http://turboccc.wikispaces.com/Downloads
I would not spend this much. I have a 765T and overall it is great.
They twice sent out the wrong product and the laptop did not fit. I just eventually got something somewhere else.
Yes it will fit perfectly.
I'm not sure read the Features & Details. It has the list of models
It works great on mine. Wish I'd bought it sooner. Good luck
I don't think so. I think this is only for the MacBook Pro. Ask the seller directly just to be on the safe side. This cover rocks!!
No it does not. I didn't receive a carrying sleeve or anything other than the hard shell case itself
I don't believe so. You will need to contact the vendor to make sure.
Absolutely , it doesn"t matter where you purchase the item, they are great to deal with.
I hear the debates on this and both sides have valid points. For my wife and I, we can't afford to just replace everything each year. Major things like our cars and electronics we get the extended warranty. Just knowing they are covered is well worth the little we pay and we have found the square trade to very well worth it. For us its a question of not having to worry if something goes wrong. Hope that helps.
When you purchase the item I am pretty sure
Hi Joanne, I'm honestly not sure about men's razors, I would recommend going to the Square Trade website to ask them directly.
I do not know
You get the one to cover the replacement cost of the item. It doesn't matter HOW you paid for the item (in your case, gift cards plus credit card). That's your business. What the warranty company wants to know is the replacement cost. So go with the $250-300 version. Good luck.
I bought a digital camera and was able to get the warranty a few days after purchase. I called Amazon customer service and they got me set-up.
I have an HP computer but this just plugs in with a USB cord pretty much fit any computer I would imagine
8 ft
Yes! This will work with the Canon EOS Rebel T3i Digital SLR Camera Body
No! Only the Focus can be manually adjusted. The "Iris" and or Aperture leaves are electronically controlled only..
if it's from pioneer you'll be all set with the wire that's included in the mount box. I have the box and speaker from pioneer and it works flawlessly. just be sure the wires are attached correctly to the sub and that they are very secure once attached to the sub. once you mount the sub you can't really go back and fix the wiring. just take your time and read the instructions
There is no screen.
Yes
You need to look in the laptop and get the number off the memory module or look in the manual that came with the laptop. Look at memory style and speed not the manufactory name.
When that happens I just replace the battery. It always works. Sorry. (Maybe try a different new battery?)
No it didnt, I bought it and the screw holes dont line up : (
For the price, I was pleased. Sorry for taking so long to respond.
I'm sorry but I cannot answer as I returned the book and ended up using clear 8/10 plastic envelopes and white large binder
The terminals on the battery 1/16" smaller than the connecting (female) terminals on my APC 550 UPS. I snipped off the terminals on the depleted battery and slightly widened the female terminals enough to accommodate a tight fit with the snips laying atop the battery (male) terminals.....
Don't buy this computer .... there isn't a harddrive inside that's why it's so inexpensive .... look for another computer with similar specs but spend at least $125 on it .... you should be ok then
Hey Richard, thanks for your question. You can install a bluray on the computer. You need to pay attention to the interface(the connection) so when you buy a bluray, you can buy an external USB2.0 bluray disc. They are plenty out there. For the internal bluray, you have to look for a SATA interfaced drive and it has to be small factor. Then you will have to sacrifice the CD/DVD drive to fit it into this PC. SO ye you can install a Bluray on this computer. THanx
Absolutely, clean while device is off
no, the docking station is for 30 pin connectors (pre-5th). you'd need to buy an adapter.
No, no it doesn't. It charges your iPhone, iPod and plays your music. It's has amazing sound, bass, volume, and color changing features. You can make it stay one color or have it flash multiple colors. My daughter sometimes uses it as a nightlight. It has a 110v cord and does not have battery operated capabilities. Well worth the purchase and long lasting.
yes it does
Yes, I use it to do paperwork, address envelopes, read, etc.
Yes. The keyboard cover is a pale shade of the shell. It's taking a bit of getting used to, typing on the cover rather than the bare keys, but my MacBook Pro is nicely color-coordinated&gt;
Doesn't make any noise when you open it, and isn't any louder to close than it is without the case. Hasn't left any scratches or damaged my computer in any way, and is comfortable to use (except maybe when it sits on my bare lap and the feet leave marks on my skin!). ;)
No
No Luis... This cover is specifically made for a laptop.. The unibody MacBook.. I think the description gives the specs for this particular case... Hope this helps!
It's a hard plastic case that can slide easily, but from my experience it hasn't!
Mine came with a matching keyboard cover.
Yes
I would think you need to buy the shell for your specific model number.
I have not had that issue, although I suggest you contact Pyle direct. Also, try holding down the power switch while plugged in. I cannot look to see if there is a reset button as mine is too close to the wall. Check the back panel for a reset button. Good Luck
Unless I've understood you incorrectly it sounds like you have answered your own question. You should use the amps separately. If you must use them together you should make sure that the power going into the other is turned down almost all the way otherwise you will blow one or both of them up.
there are multiple inputs available, but i went through 2 of these things before upgrading to a better unit
I noticed that too. I think it's preset, but know for sure. Contact Pyle tech support. The # is in the book.
I'm not exactly sure but it will work with anything you plug into it as far as USB goes.
I returned a Pyle PD1000A as it didn't work. Purchased a Sony that works well.
No, this case is not at all sticky and it will not prevent the iPod from sliding. However it is very compact and does not add bulk to the iPod like the silicone cases.
Hello Heidi, I went into Amazon's website, and typed in my battery title (similar to yours) which in this case, will be PA3536U-1BRS. From there, I looked at the comments that best fit my laptop and had good reviews and made a purchase from there. Hope this helps out.
I heard you can return it for a refund.. minus the shipping charge, if any....... have you contacted the seller and asked them?
You're going to want a speed light. This Sunpak is nice but not fast enough if you're going to be shooting say a wedding where you need a quick recharge time The Nikon SB 400 it's as small as this Sunpak but faster in recycle time. Suggest you visit Ken Rockwell.com he is a professional photographer will ample notes and opinions on all photographic equipment. By the way I have both these flashes, my SB400 speed light is over in Thailand the Sunpack here in the US.
Mine came with the program mode. It has manual controls for shutter speed (from 1/1000th of a second to 2 seconds, and Bulb mode), focusing and aperture size (f1.8-f22). The aperture size and shutter speed can also be controlled by the program if you wish. Hope this helps!
Its completely manual!
Yes
3 Dell U2713HMs dont fit, like not even close
Yes
Yes
I don't see why it shouldn't. I had no problem reading a 64GB SDXC. It took a little time to read thru the data but worked just fine on my MAC and my PC.
I don't think so, the markings on the slots only say "SD" and "microSD"
The flash drive-inspired RDP5 USB card reader sports a compact, handy design with a built-in USB connector and a bright LED for indicating card insertion and data transfer. The RDP5 supports many different memory card formats, including SDXC cards
They don't cover it. By definition (their definition), a cracked screen means abuse, which is not covered. Google Acer Aspire One cracked screen, and you see that others had cracked screen for no obvious reasons.
I feel your pain! I'm trying to pull the trigger and I can't decide for the life of me!
You can use a exterior cd drive through the usb port, and that will work just the same as if you had the cd in your laptop or desktop.
I feel your pain! I'm trying to pull the trigger and I can't decide for the life of me!
Yes, MS works is included. I just got this 2 days ago, and I love it
The LED is mainly used for showing which DPI speed you are at. You can't turn it all the way off using the included setpoint software. The closest you can get is set it to blue (darkest color) and add enough DPI profiles so that only one of the lights is lit up. As well, while using the mouse your finger pretty much covers up the lights.

plug in the external cd/dvd player and reboot. hit F12 during the reboot and you should go to a menu that allows you to choose the external drive as your boot device, then hit enter to confirm when asked. cheers Larry
My Acer Aspire One model is:ZG5 and this battery Works OK with it. (It fits-replaces my old battery UM0*** in the check list provided).
They are just cheap cardboard. I haven't compared them to another set of red/cyan glasses to be sure, but they LOOK exactly the same.
Cowon s9 all the way. Since it has audio quality light years better than iPod touch.
i think it will,it works perfect with my 5th gen
It is a pretty light weight tripod. When I shoot with our Canon 5D Mark iii with a long 70-200mm heavy lens it has a hard time holding the lens. 30 lb prompter is going to be too much weight.
I would like to just know how to hook it up!! I cannot figure out what goes where and there are no directions!! I know the outfit was cheap, but geez!!! If you like yours so much, then purchase one to go with it!! Could you help me get mine set up?? I just cannot figure out what wire goes where. and not all of them fit
Yes but it will still only store the same amount of data. Still shoots or video.
no
Don't know the exact joules number but it's for small electronics like a phone or answering machine, not a computer or stereo. hope that helps.
They are firetruck red
It's about 10 or so feet. Rough estimate, but it's long enough to move around my desk and what not.
I gat my adapter from amazon for the plantrionics 77043-03 I don't know what a CS5040 is.
Yes it works
It has the older Minolta Maxxum/ Sony shoe so you should not need an adapter.
I've been using mine for about a year now and haven't had any malfunctions with my camera
I have a Nikon d80 and it works great with that. Definitely better than the built in flash and is ok as a professional. If you are in photography I recommend springing for a little more expensive one and a soft box or defuser.
The video and the mic quality have improved significantly since the old Cisco Flip cameras. These work just like the old ones, just with some improvements to the quality of the product.
If your XBOX works with standard USB storage devices this should work just fine. I would suggest either a 32 or 64gb USB flash drive. I just got a 64gb from Amazon for about $12 plus shipping.
My answer is both yes and no. I purchased two identical units of this model at separate times. One has been working ok (good) other is totally unreliable (bad), i.e., either needs to repeat a process(insert-remove) many times until finally show up or the icon fails to show up. No icon means no file transfer possible. I have five (16GB) flash drives in total made by three different manufacturers and find one made by Kingston to be most reliable so far.
All that matters is how your connecting it. If I know my macs, you either have a Mini-DVI or MiniDisplay Port port. Regardless of which, you'll need an adapter to get the output to be DVI or HDMI, depending on the monitor your buying. Once you have the correct wires, it should work great. The only caveat I can think of is the graphics card inside your mini. Unless you have a really old mac, it should be able to output to the monitor's native resolution.
I have the latest version of the Classic, and it fits perfectly.
No
Yes
Yes the brackets can be adjusted. It is a safe bet that it work
no i think it would be too snug. my coolpix s4000 fits just right and it is smaller specs than yours.
Yes it will. It is a lovely case with a string handle and the camera fits inside with no problem. I do believe the case was made for that camera.
I'm frustrated about this too. I'm glad to see the price drop however. I hope you get a reply soon.
BUMP. Same question. I've been waiting awhile to get even a tiny camcorder b/c I figure wait as long as you can, then buy what's current. Some stuff I'll want to do, not sure if I can wait any longer than mid April. Anyone from Amazon please comment...
I'm frustrated about this too. I'm glad to see the price drop however. I hope you get a reply soon.
Yes it does. Hook up the HDMI to a TV and the tiny LCD on the ZX1 blanks. You see the same display info, graphics etc. during playback and live camera that you would otherwise get on the LCD.
It have to be one or the other because it only have one port but I have never tried that configuration that your reffering to
mine came with a convertible charger. A USB with a wall plug. it will also plug into the computer or a car plug.
I think because if it's used it's less and if it's new it's NOT.
To view pictures press the arrow button &gt; on the bottom then use the notches on the side of the OK (right or left side of it)to scroll through them. Just plug the camera in using the USB port to import pictures.
I don't think it's set-up to take add-on equipment like that, but I'm sure you could Google it or contact Kodak directly. It's a pretty straight forward point and click for basic to intermediate use. Great little camera.
The sound was pretty clear. The only time I heard something buzzing/static-like was when we got near an area that had a radio station for the setting we were using. We would change the station, and we would be all set.
Yes it should work but with a 250watt powersupply, which your computer is running, could not be quite enough to operate that..you may also want to invest in some ram. Your PC comes stock with 512mb of ram. It would be beneficial to up it to at least 4mb. But to answer your question, yes it will work with the proper software installed from nvidia's website
Yes we have this too...plus a ticking noise! My husband just noticed it, and was like what the heck? You can actually hear it on the video while playing back if we are recording in absolute silence. When he shuts off the auto focus the ticking noise stops. I would be interested in others with this camcorder to comment on the noise.....I mean is this a defect or something that is just the way the camcorder is?
I don't believe there is one. Are you mistaking the pop-up flash for a view finder?
No

Surprisingly yes
"Phase Alternating Line", I do not know. If I could do it over again I would have bought the Sony Handy cam. This thing is not very good to say the least in artificial light. Absolutely terrible in any kind of low artificial light. Very acceptable outside in natural light. Sorry not sure about the PAL though.
My 7 inch car DVD play it's not working no more please don't buy
They have A/V in and out for mini plugs
As long as ur head rest comes off they work with any car and they are simple to install email me if u need more info @princelj175@aol.com
If the console is gonna be permanent just don't hook it up to the other headrest. Or if you don't care if both play off one disk make the inputs available to reach and you can hook up what ever you want... VGA hookup (yellow, red, white) is required so some adapters may be required for newer gaming systems.

Mine was sealed in plastic so I would think your's is either used or tampered with in some form.
Hi LaQuinta, if you are pertaining on connecting this Sony DVDirect Express on a TV to watch DVDs, apparently it will not work. You needed to have a camcorder that supports USB mini for you to connect this device. Then the camcorder will be connected to the TV. Hope this helps. -Ely
I usually plug the charger into my Garmin first and then plug the charger into a wall outlet in my home.
And the sticker reads: 2.0A for BOTH the 5V and 12V output ratirings. Really a neat product. I will be fixing a friends laptop, just pulling it out of the case, setting this up and using their HDD as an external and it has always worked. This is my third order of the same product from the same source, always the same professional response. Hope this helps you. Will
The unit has a dedicated iPod cable connector and there is also an Aux input. I guess you could play the satalite unit via the Aux input? I hope this helps.
It records in 720x480 square pixels (PAR 3:2=1.50). If you are in computer display land, no changes needed, your player should letterbox accordingly. For mastering to DVD, a 720x480(3:2) image marked as 16:9 display undergoes a 32/27 DAR transformation to get from AR 1.5 to 1.777. You need to apply following filters: resize to 720x480-&gt;604x480 (or 608x480) add black borders 604x480-&gt;720x480. Now the new 604x480 image displayed on 16:9 tv, will give you back the square 1.5 aspect ratio.
I have two Asus Xonar sound cards that send digital signal from my computers to older MSB DACs. The sound is quite wonderful, very musical. I prefer to use the optical out if I can, but coax seems to work very well too. These are both in older computers that are dedicated to audio playback only.
This sound card is an overkill for you Astro A40 headphone. However, if you like this setup, you can go either with or without the mixamp. I personally would not get the mixamp since the sound card comes with comprehensive software for all your adjustment needs.
Yes
I have one--rsdahl@cableone.net
It is 10-5/16" wide, BUT...the power connector (from the wall wart) and the coax cable (from cable TV or external antenna) come in from the left side, so you either need to allow another inch or so on the left or have right angle connectors for them. The headphone and AV-in jacks are on the left and would need a similar arrangement. Height on the supplied stand is 9-3/8" or without it is 7-3/8". The set itself is 1-3/8" deep, but if the stand is used the depth is 4-3/4"
The one I bought in June 2013 was, in fact, a 110W power supply (model A1188). The seller was "Value Twist" and it was new. It's been up and running continuously ever since.
It is the only type of power adapter that will work with the Apple Cinema Display to plug it into power. If you lose it, or it goes bad, you must get another one. Be careful though because if you also have lost the cord that plugs into the wall and then into the adapter make sure you get it also. Many of them on amazon and other places do NOT come with the power cord to the wall.
Yes, it does.
i love my canon d10 underwater camera!
No... it is not waterproof. You can use the Sylus 740 with the waterproof casing.
This unit came with a spacer in the package, you don't have to use it but it helps out. I always keep the spacer on. Keep in mind that is model is the screw in type not the bayonet model. I use mine on a Canon GL1
It's a 58 mm, so no.
It doesn't have usable capacity -- it's an adapter, not a hard drive. It is intended to allow an external hard drive to be used with the Clickfree software installed on a small flash partition. It may have limits on how large a hard drive it recognizes, but in my use it worked fine with 1TB hard drives.
Yes it does and its stated right there under "product features", "Two AV inputs". I've had XO vision monitors in the past and was never disappointed. Good luck.
hello richard, about your question, best can you do is to buy an extra battery for your camera, the model vw-vgb130 has an stamina around 3 hours and model vw-vbg260 around 6 hours duration, you choice the best for your activities.
If you have IMovie - it will capture it and organizes everything by date. I have found it very easy to get onto my Mac.
sorry but i dont know..... i just use the discs to record.... i dont think it is a standard memory card...however....... i just found out .. it is a sony 4 gb memory stick....produo...just now looked it up for you..... there you go.....hope that helps some...
Yes
They are on all the time. U just cant see them in the day
Uses an RCA video plug in. It should work no problem if the head unit you have has the RCA video in jack. Look at the back of your head unit and look at manual for it as well.
The internal volume for this box is 1.2 cubic feet per side.
The mounting depth for this box is 5 3/4" and a sub with a mounting depth of 5 7/8" will not fit. You can use a mounting spacer ring to increase the mounting depth, but then that presents a clearance issue between the box and the seat.
Unfortunately we do not have any speaker boxes for that truck.
Yes it fits perfect in my 07 super crew.
The HD stands for "Heavy-Duty". It is a different model and the cab is different and this box does not fit the HD models.
Yes
This box will fit a 1997 Chevy Extended Cab as long as it is not the HD model.
I use and app on my iPhone called iCam. I have multiple cameras at my home and work and all of them show up on my iOS devices. Additionally I can choose to record motion event and or send me text notifications when there is motion. Works flawlessly.
Thanks for checking. The mini-SD is won't fit. The camera uses MicroSD cards, anything from 1 GB to 32 GB in size, any speed although class 4 or better is recommended.
Yes it does. It just has an adapter piece for non USB plug ins.
is the WIFI on? Try pressing Fn+ F11
I would us the gm-8601 for just one of these or get two and wire up the speakers in series and then parallel the power with the gm-9601 thats the set up I have very loud and no distortion
I dont know exactly probably about 14 in wide 15 deep its been about a year since I bought it and never had to buy again and they still run as good as day one but I'm pretty sure that's about right they came in a box inside of a box with styrofoam surrounding it hope this hops you out man if you buy them you won't be dissappointed
I'm sorry. I have a truck. I would guess that the installation kit would be adaptable to most vehicles. They send you a lot of extra material in the installation kit. My radio looks like a stock installation and I love the little shelf below the radio.
I'm not to sure, I have new NISSAN Xettera 2012. Best find out Google 2005 cr -v speakers size. But I believe it does 75%
It is a one-pack with four batteries.
Yes , 2 ohms will pack a punch , but not overheat or blow the woofer.
No it too big
About 1 cubic foot.
Yes they are four ohm
The bass on these subs is tremendous. You just need to make sure you have enough power to support them because they hit hard. Very hard. Personally I would pick these, not because kicker is bad, just fosgate is better.
Hi, did you ever find out the difference? I need to order tapes myself! Thanks
You'll need a camera that can play / record from / to miniDV tapes. Then you just have to interface that camera from its cable source (usb or firewire) to the computers input; with some sort of capture software. It isn't so easy as newer cameras that have hdd / flash drives, since the tapes don't store 'files' so to speak. Sorry you lost the camera.
Yes, if you order today, I believe it will get there in time. I would have to ship it today. Please place your order within the next hour, so I can make it to the post office before they close.
Only if a WiFi card is included.
The diagram on the Power Supply shows that the center is (+), outside is (-).
Yes. Utilizing the romex cable (code compliant cable to run behind constuction) to run the electrical service behind your wall in lieu of the power cable your tv comes with (not code or fire safe) is really the whole point behind this kit along with a clean install. That's why places charge$200 just to install an outlet and another 200 to mount the tv. It's time consuming, especially if it's your first time, but it's worth it.
Size of a double lite switch. Is flush with wall when installed
I think it does, although one rarely uses that function on the remote. BTW, I have two of these for sale MUCH cheaper than the person who is selling them on Amazon. One is used and one is new.
The dimensions are 6 feet by 9 feet.
Yes the lens fully compatible
Yes its compatible, and its not a macro dedicated version but in the lens the word macro is written, tooks nice macro/bokeh style photos
Lens hood included. Belive warranty is one year. A great lens for the average photographer. O
Not sure I use canon only
In a VM, peripherals can be tricky to access. Depending on the VM you choose - "Parallels"? - I would venture that if it "sees" the USB ports, it will be able to access the Sabrent interface. You may want to address this question directly to Sabrent, or to an OSX forum. As OSX does not use the same disk format that XP uses, there may be other issues to address. I am not the "expert" here.
Hello, yes we can and do ship internationally, however you would be responsible for the duties and fees that the shipping company may charge.
Yes. There is a viewfinder on the camera. There is a button to the left of the camera to switch it from LCD to the viewfinder. I hope this helps!
You can download the pdf.version. Do a search for L20 manual.
Yes
Perfectly! You can do what ever with the IPhone on this reciever music phone calls perfect...have fun with it. I do....
No.
As far as I know the firmware update cannot make that 630 read SDHC cards. I would be very surprised if somebody could get that to work. If somebody has hacked this limit somehow feel free to post it here. I suspect this is just a misunderstanding.
You're not losing all that space to any "formatting", you're just prey to marketing and confusing computer lingo. Hard drive manufacturers dictate a 1GB as 1,000,000,000,000 bytes whereas Windows calculates 1GB it as 1,073,741,824. Technically speaking, windows version of GB really should be referred to as GiB rather than GB. A 500GB hard drive sold by Maxtor/WD/Seagate etc. will show in windows as 465.5 GB. Just as these 8GB cards show as 7.44GB. For simplifying, you can pretty much divide the stated capacity by 1.074 to see what you're actually going to get.
Sure. They work great.
Hi, sorry, I have no idea. I hooked these up to my computer and it came with all the appropriate cables. Best of luck!
I can't see why not it is the connect that determine it use.
Yes
Yes. It'll fit that model. This fits most of the Sony cyber shot models
I installed these chips on an early 2009 iMac, and the worked beautifully.
I believe it will. I had a 2010 mbp and it worked in there! But it was a pain in the ... Getting the screws out of the bottom of the mbp!
Yes. It comes with one for transmit, and one for receiving. Pay attention to your connections. These work great for video. They only carried two channel audio in my setup.
You can have multiple cards installed, however, your software must be able to support multiple cards.
Approximately 15 ft.
yes it is backlit
It is a model K DL-052000 - what do you want to use if for? There is no manufacturer listed on the transformer, only made in China. Hope this helps.
I have mac book pro 13 inch mid 2009. It didnt work on mine. I had to return it. I got one from 'CRUCIAL'. They are one of the best brands around.
idk i have a 2008 mac and tried to increase ram and hard drive i don think this one worked for me but the one by "pony" did hope this helps
This is Laptop/Notebook type of memory, and cannot fit into a desktop model. Best to visit the manufacturer website for the desktop model and obtain the specs they call for when replacing memory. With all the specs, then shop anywhere and match the specs. Like DDR2 or DDR3 or 1066MHZ or 800MHZ, just be sure to match all listed specs and pinouts.
Don't know regarding pc3. However, it is 10800 and DDR3.
Yes
Yes, I use it very nicely with my Galaxy S3. Very nice keyboard. If you carry it around in the shipping box, it travels really well & lasts for a long time. If you throw it into a backpack without the hard cover protection, it doesn't do as well. I still love it enough where even if it breaks I'll spend the money to get another.
Yes, the headphones are independent of the internal speakers. You can turn the volume all the way down on the TV and adjust the volume on the headset.
Seriously I could not tell you, I don't have the other one to compare. I no longer have the original pair I bought either.
No, only Windows LIVE Movie Maker which is only compatible with Vista or 7, NOT XP. BUT it is FREE.
No it is not TTL capable.
Yes. Please keep in mind that this is not a dedicated flash so there is no communication between the camera and the flash. This is a more manual flash. Hope that helps!
I believe I answered this once. The item you mention does not have a power adapter and does not work well with one. Plugging in a powere adapter seems to interrupt the output. It is strictly a portable battery powered device. Deric
Non-chargeable batteries only. And mine "fried" the batteries after about 6 mos. I had to return and I do NOT, now, recommend buying one.
Not sure
Hello Jonas, the kit I tried came with the grills for mids and woofers. Take care.
Yes, but only when it is on. There is an on/off switch right next to the aux port. This is a great feature because the module can distort other stations while on. Having the ability to easily switch it off when not in use is great!
Yes you can; I have done it.
Using Short Arm Side Clamps: Maximum Depth: 0.75" Minimum Width: 1.25" Maximum Width: 3.0" Using Medium Arm Side Clamps: Maximum Depth: 1.25" Minimum Width: 1.5" Maximum Width: 3.5" Using Long Arm Side Clamps: Maximum Depth: 1.6" Minimum Width: 2.25" Maximum Width: 3.5" The long dimension is more or less unlimited depending on whether you use the top and bottom fences.
6 inches
Yes. Look at the quick start guide that came with the computer. It has pictures of where everything is located, including the SD card slot. It takes several different types of cards too. Have fun!
I've had this happen on other non-Acer computers and the only thing I can attribute it to is programs running in the background take an active blip for a second, thus causing the cursor to move/disappear. Then, I must shake the mouse, or tap the pad, to resume control of the cursor.
Personally I put in a 4 GB SDHC card and it can hold ~500 pictures on the highest quality setting. I don't think you need much more memory than about 8 GB with this camera.
There are cameras in your price range that can do HD video. This one I believe only does standard definition. I believe one of the other Panasonic models does HD for a little over 200.

no - the machine supports no more than 2GB ram
I bought the camera through Amazon and did not get a case. I saw the set at Sam's recently - with the case and photo software - for about what I paid this summer for just the camera.
Yes, I find the sound quality just fine for my needs with this camera. Voices sound very true-to-life.
Not sure of the size of your binos, the Lg. is 8x10 with the elastic opening of above Lg.
Just look here on amazon for brackets and they will tell you how big the tv should be. look at the back of the set then look at the pic of the bracket. I think this is the one I used http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00155SXZ8/ref=oh_details_o09_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
This TV does NOT have an HDMI port.
Nancy, sorry but this not an item that I would buy again or recommend. I have bought a bunch of these and they are 5 star for the price. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VZS2EU/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1 I tossed my Rokinon M71 in the trash heap.
Hi Alex, Thank you for your reply. Our ClearGuard MB (99MO029101) is a universal fit for all current models of the MacBook Pro, and is compatible for use with both the 13" and 15" models of the MacBook Pro Retina. Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns. Best regards, Vanessa Springfield Customer Service Representative moshimonde.com
Yes, It should! It fits perfectly on my MB Air mid2011 (the last model just before yours) and, as far as I know, the keyboard didn't changed in the newer one. Moreover, please note that the keyboard is exactly the same for both MB Pro and MB Air, regardless it is 13 or 15-inches. ;)
I am not 100% certain. I believe the Bose speakers have a different back connection and that you will have to purchase Bose brand brackets.
We have ours with the back against a wall, and its never once fell over, even with a very hyper and curious black kitty.
No, the CD will slip off easily.
No, the case is not made of leather.
The owner's manual only makes reference to cell phone charging by crank, so I can only assume it cannot be charged by solar power.
May seem too much of a lame answer, but, have u ckd eBay by battery type?
You use the same cord that you use to charge your iPhone. The radio has a UBS port.
Yes it will! I put it on mine....but I also upgraded to 2gigs of memory before installing it. The hard drive on this puppy is 160 gigs...plenty of room and speed too!
According to this: http://www.dz-tech.com/asus-eee-pc-1000he-blue-netbook-intel-atom-n280166ghz-10-led-wide-svga-1gb-memory-160gb-hdd-win-xp-p-1115.html?zenid=025ecdd977bf8b366d57ef250c7e3ffb They will be shipping the 16th. According to the Asus rep on the facebook group - Their US distribution company will be receiving them on the 13th, and they should be in retailers hands by the next week - so the 16th through the 20th would be reasonable... Amazon usually gets stuff early so I'm crossing my fingers for next Monday/Tuesday.
Yes it can. I use at home with a 230V AC input. enjoy
It is V2.1r
I have no idea ! Don't really do anything that requires it I guess... The most keys I press at any given time would be 3... I do really like the KB...solid feel...low profile...very quiet...perfect angle... excellent key contact...not a lot of clutter & 'fluff' keys...basic KB with good layout.. solid / quality build...like the feel of the keys...Very pleased with this purchase... Hope this helps...
I don't think it has a touchscreen, if you mean it's built-in touchpad, it works like a mouse pointer, single touch.
5mp stills. No sound recorder
Hi Nuria Rodriguez, I work for HP. If you need help locating the correct battery, please send me your product and contact info to PSGSocialmedia@hp.com Attn: Scott. Please include your user name when responding. Thanks
Dear Danny, I work for HP. If I could be any assistance to you please send me a email with your product and contact information to PSGSocialmedia@hp.com Attn: Scott. Please include your user name. Thanks
I got it for my Inspiron E1505 laptop. Not so about the probook 4530. Hope this helps.
Yes
to be honest ....I got one for my XP Media Center but it turned out to small for my casing so had to return it .......... Check on it at @http://h20565.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/template.PAGE/public/kb/docDisplay/?sp4ts.oid=3688699&spf_p.tpst=kbDocDisplay&spf_p.prp_kbDocDisplay=wsrp-navigationalState%3DdocId%253Demr_na-c01475840-22%257CdocLocale%253D%257CcalledBy%253D&javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken Looks OK to use........
It fits perfectly.
No case is included. You should salvage the cover and case from the notebook HDD you are replacing, being careful to also save the screws.
No inline fuse. The cable length was more than adequate to fit from my dash to the transom with 5 - 7 feet of extra cable on my 190. Works well in average depth bodies of water, does not read well in deep waters.
It had to be wired to my boat battery through a fuse
Dual 2 ohm coils can only be wired to either 1 ohm or 4 ohm
Sealed: 2 cu-ft, will be it's loudest with a 40.5Hz tone. Ported: 4 cu-ft, (2) 4" diameter ports that are 11.75" long, tuned to 29.7Hz, with an F3 of 28.1Hz. The Fs of the sub is 24.1Hz, I personally usually tune 2-3Hz below the rated Fs of the sub, which would put the tuning frequency around 21Hz. They've updated their specs on site, I'll adjust the specs I listed accordingly.
Lower ohm allow you to put more power into the sub without blowing it. A 2ohm amp will work fine for anything higher than 2ohm as well. I would suggest getting a amp that is 1 or 1/2 ohm stable so you can wire the two coils down and get more power into in. If you are going to use your amp either make sure it has 4 outputs or youll have to wire the 2ohm up to 4ohm. Regardless you always want lower ohms but your amp must be able to handle it.
I would call and ask them (1-800-233-8413) because I just received it and learned too late that it's not compatible with the 8gb ipod touch 2nd generation. It sounds great though.
Accord, year? One thing Issam I don't recommend this unit at all, the OS that came with this model is useless and the sound isn't good either.
No and it's junk
Not that I know of. There are a few different models but I'm almost positive you can't remove the screen.
What are cfm ratings?
No it only works with 120 volts.
Works perfectly :-)
Yes...
yes it do
Should not change the ability to have backwards compatibility.
yes
Should work fine. It's the right connector and size.
It's just the drive, you'll want to purchase a cable specific to your needs with it
The answer is yes, it should be a plug to plug replacement. Your Mac book should recognize and accept the new capacity of 500GB.
Yes, it would but it's big and heavy.
yes
30"
Yes you can still use the letters/numbers on the keyboard with this plugged in. Our laptop does not have a num lock so I am not sure if that would interfere or not.
No
Yes that is exactly what I have and I purchased this very same memory. It was over 1 yr ago so I just hope nothing has changed in terms of the actual memoey sticks being sold.
Mine has 3 pci slots no AGP slot
When I ordered the lite version I recieved the plus version of the software.
Yes, I have a Brother SE-400 works awesome
I'm sorry. I don't know. I don't know anything about the Bernadette Deco
no
It is the drive model number. Each hard drive has a different model number when manufactured.
I used it as an external drive. Even if you can take the HD out, you still need a sata connecting cable ($8.66 for 2). It has a USB-3 cable which is faster than the conventional USB-2. I wonder why you would pay the price of an external drive and use it as an internal drive, which usually costs less for the same capacity. I bought a WD 4 TB internal drive as D:
You should login to the Western Digital website and pose the question to their customer support or tech support.
Yes it has great volume on ipod cd and radio and yes it's easy to use
It is a CCD
Go to Crucial.com and download their scanner tool and run it. It will tell you exactly what type of memory you need.
Just visit www.crucial.com. They have the Crucial Advisor tool which shows all compatible memory, when you pick your specific system off the list. There is also a System Scanner tool that will analyze your system and determine all compatible upgrades. The latter is better if you have no idea about your system specs.
you'd have to buy an adapter for the plug, and as long as you don't have an iPhone 5 because it doesn't work on the clock no matter what country you're in
Yes, according to Crucial's website, this is the memory for your laptop. This kit will put your laptop at the maximum manufacturer's supported amount of RAM
Yes , Dont go for 600 ! I have both of them . I will give 5 stars for xb500 and 2 stars for xb600
The 500's have a wider frequency response and greater sensitivity, so they win the spec game and (since I won them) sound great to boot. However they are more expensive than the 400's. The MDR-400's have a driver that's 10mm smaller (30mm vs 40). The ear pads are on-ear, unlike the 500's, whose ear pads are more luxurious and wrap around the ear completely. These seal out more noise, so keep that in mind.
Hello, according to Sony, yes! Officially, the EPEX10A Hybrid Replacement Earbuds are Compatible with the following Sony Models: MDR-EX33LP, MDR-EX34SC, MDR-EX35B, MDR-EX36V, MDR-EX56LP, MDR-EX76, MDR-EX300, MDR-EX500LP, MDR-EX700LP, MDR-XB20EX, MDR-XB40EX, DR-BT160AS, DR-BT160iK, DR-BT100CX
Not sure. It depends on the diameter of your phones. You could buy the generic from amazon and if they fit then the sony's will fit also.
Headphones are headphones...Ear buds are ear buds.These will work with all ear buds.There are different sizes in the pack for the user to fit for comfort.Headphones are something else.I hope I helped...Good Luck!
Mixing memory on iMacs is a gamble. The responses below are not specific enough as to which RAM they are using or combining? Hynix was original iMac and works in unison at 2X2 GB. The 4GB + 2GB combo is my issue also and I insist that the seller guarantee it will either work with other memory or NOT?
Yes, it should. To be sure, search Amazon for thinkpad t61 ram or google it.
Never tried but would think if the connections are compatible that it would be doable.
Once you make the dvd, you can take it to a kiosk and print the photos or load the photo s into your computer and order the prints. It might be easier to just use the memory card and do the same thing.
Sorry, I don't know the answer that one. But here's a link to the site, that may help. http://www3.pny.com/NVIDIA-Quadro-NVS-450-x16-for-Quad-DP-P2738C364.aspx
Still working over a year first 10 now like 7 hours hours I wish they all was like this
It requires a receiver to work. This is just the speakers by themselves.
Not sure what "tricking" has to happen - the detective does an HDMI handshake with the receiver and remembers it. For me, I need this as my HTPC lost the handshake any time the receiver powered off or switched sources causing me to lose HDMI audio and reboot the HTPC. The detective does that job perfectly including sending 5.1 audio from the HTPC to the receiver over HDMI.
I suspect it would, but I doubt HDCP would work.
It is designed to provide constant TV information regardless of the power state. If you look enough, I think there is a way to edit the information it stores.
Yes, depending on what you are trying to accomplish.
no, only black
This camera is terrible. Don't buy it.
No
No, There is just 1 RCA PLUG for video, and one plug for power.There is no jnput for sound.
You have to find the reverse light wire. Mine came from under dash. Hard to find don't know what color it would be on your car. Look it up online
The input on your screen would determine if the camera is compatible with you factory system. The camera has two RCA plugs that may or may not plug into your car's.
Yes, they do work with any smart phn. It has a headphone jack that u plug into yur phone
It will work on any bike. You decide on the location that you want to install the amp then run your wiring to the battery or an accessory connection. Mount your speakers to the handle bars and you're all set. You can listen to music from any device that has an AUX connection. It's very easy to install and should take about an hour.
I wired mine direct to the battery and installed an on/off toggle switch. $2 from ace hardware
I don't know what that is...
no purchased from Zeiss usa
You really can't base it on whether they look similar - not sure the picture is always the actual piece and not just a stock picture. You should use the manufacturers configuration to determine what you need. Since you are looking at Kingston memory you can find one at www.kingston.com/memory.
Yes, at Advance Auto parts.
No they do not.
When I purchased this item it was a single speaker not a pair. And I am not the one selling this item. I was simply a customer purchasing on Amazon.
It does not come with wire. Few speakers do. But, there are two terminals available for attaching (soldering) leads to the audio source. This is a heavy duty speaker with a significantly sized magnet. Be sure your application can accommodate the large magnet.
Yes, it works perfectly fine with just one slot in use. I only used one for a 16GB microSD, it worked very well.
RCA 16 gauge works quite well
They have the connectors that you press in and push the exposed copper into...you could probably push in a banana plug if you needed to and get a connection, but I don't. I use these in my smaller room set up and I have banana plugs for the receiver end of all the cables that I cut, but I didn't bother installing them for the speaker end.
The Square trade listing says "Worldwide coverage". I would contact Square trade ( 1-877-900-7283 ) directly to confirm they cover your area.
I only have experience with this flash on the D5000, D300s, and the D700. It works but the connection is poor sometimes. I needed to pull the flash off and and reconnect it. Otherwise the quality of the flash was pretty good.
It should be. It's compatible with my Nikon D5100
We bought 2 pairs of NiMH rechargeable AA batteries, along with a charger. You can play almost 2 rounds on a charge. NiMH last longer than NiCad.
I purchased the camera for my daughter, we ordered film on line, it never came. I am going to check a local camera shop in Amityville; Cametta and Berger Brothers both in Amityville.
Yes that is what my daughter has and it works great.
I bought these speakers as a gift for my sister so I do not have them to look at myself, however, I asked her and she said they do have a jack where you can connect other speakers.
This was a great item--while it lasted, which wasn't very long. I'm now on my third iHome clock radio in just a few years. Anyway, from what I recall, this device was easy to operate.

Compatible with BD Video, BD-RE (Single/Dual), BD-R (Single/Dual), DVD Video, DVD-R/RW, CD-R/RW, Audio CD, DTS-CD, and HD JPEG Formats... In other words, yes :)
I'm sorry, I don't know as I purchased item as a gift.
It should work, mine is just over 6' long, around 6'-6"
Patricia, I don't know anything about the Cannon SX260 for size. But the case fits my Nikon Coolpix L24 perfectly which is about 4" long and 2 1/2" wide. It can hold a camera a little bit larger camera. Good Luck!
Compatible memory cards include SD Memory Card, miniSD Card, SDHC MemoryCard, miniSDHC Card, MultiMedia Card, MMCplus Card, MMC mobile Card, HC MMCplus Card, RS-MMC, Compact Flash Card, Microdrive, Memory Stick, Memory Stick PRO, Memory Stick Duo and Memory Stick PRO Duo. The following can be used with the addition of a special adapter sold separately: microSD Card, microSDHC Card, MMCmicro Card, xD-Picture Card and Memory Stick Micro.
No. Only up-down scrolling.
Mine is burgundy but color says red.
Basketball. While the depth of this question implores me to seek an answer from someone with greater understanding on the topic, I will nonetheless do my best to answer to the greatest degree that I am capable. If my answer does not fully satisfy you, I do apologize and will recommend that you contact Nikon directly. Here I go: No, it is not a basketball.
Yes. It works with Nikon D40, Nikon D40X, Nikon D60, Nikon D3000, Nikon D3100, Nikon D3200, Nikon D5000, Nikon D5100 and Nikon D5200.
The headset has two jacks or probe tips that connect to the PC. It does not have USB connection but I am sure an adapter could be used for USB connectivity
This amp is not 3D compatible.
One USB port is all that is needed.
Hi David, Yes it is possible since one can add macros (combination of keys) and functions to those programmable keys. You can look at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/237179 for further reference. Regards...
Sorry I can't help you. It literally broke in to pieces before we could ever use them. Perhaps I got a bad one but I wouldn't recommend this item.
Plug into your Sound output.
No but speaker wire is cheap the tricky part is hooking up to an Amp
Yes. http://www.geekylives.com/2009/04/asus-eee-top-ram-upgrade/
I went to best buy yesterday looking at Plasma TVs and one of the guys there highly recommended this tv because he owns it and hasn't had any burn-ins. Also, the tv screen doesn't reflect light as much as other TVs, so if you're going to be putting your tv in a bright room or near a window, this would also be better than other brands. I'm no expert, but the guy from best buy seemed to know what he was talking about. Hope this helps.
It works fine to connect two computers to a Samsung SC 4623FW Series printer, fax & scanner. One pc runs Windows 7 and the other runs on XP SP3.
I don't know.
There is no mute button however the instructions say if you turn the mic stuck upwards it mutes. I use in Adobe and that feature doesn't worn for me
Yes, the Sony DSC T90 is compatible with Sony Marine Pack Model No. MPK-THGB. These are good cases. I have three with over a thousand sixty-foot dives each and still going strong with their original O-rings. Make certain you properly clean, lube and store the case immediately after each use and I believe you will be very pleased with it.
View screen only.
a bunch of Fujifilm's P&S cameras does autofocus in movies, even the older models.
No, it requires a USB slot and at least windows VISTA.
For certain the Canon A1100IS handles 32 Gbyte SD Memory Cards, that's what I'm using. I also want to affirm that it will handle 64 Gbyte SD Memory cards but can't verify due to dropping my first AS1100IS into Sweetwater River and I'm sure that my 64 GByte card was in that camera. Couldn't fish it out in hopes of recovering the memory card. My wife also has a Canon AS1100IS, that's three of them we have purchased and are pleased with the results. I've had good experience repairing the A1100IS because Canon has a helpful U.S. parts department.
Don't believe it is a micro just an SD if your notebook has a UBS port it is easy to upload the pic, camera comes with a program to do just that. Mine came with a512 mb I purchased a Transcend 32 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card (TS32GSDHC10E) $29.87 I can get all the pic I want on that one. also up graded the battery, Sold by Eforcity: eForCity TWO Canon NB-4L 1200 mAh EQUIVALENT BATTERY two of them for $5.57 Condition: New
I have no idea what a Class 10 card is. Mine takes 32, etc., but I use regular SD cards. So I am no help.
Case Logic UNZ-2 Small Universal Pocket with Screen Protection fits snugly. Case Logic UNZ-2 Small Universal Pocket with Screen Protection (Blue/Silver)
The specs say it does --- I have an older Canon digital (about 5 or so yrs old) and the video on it is great. I would guess on the newer cameras, it is as good or probably much better. Hope this helps
How big is your memory card? Down load the movie file to your computer to see how big it is. If your memory still has a lot of room left, call Canon ASAP. If they say it needs to be repaired, I think you should return it to the place where you bought it from (if still w/in the return period). If not, you will need to send it to Canon (you pay for shipping w/ insurance).
You must sync it with the base, if that were not the case you could only use one in a 400 ft perimeter. It is an easy process, you need to read the instructions on this because I would remember from memory.
Agreed on AA batteries. I do a bit of international photography and can always find AA batteries. It's impossible to find specialized batteries in most of Africa and Latain America, and a charging unit for a specialized battery is just more gear to lug around, with the risk of loss.
I assume that you intended to ask "how well" it works??? You set the dial and frame the picture, and press the shutter button. You can see the timer light blinking until the shot. If you set multiple shots, the indicator light stays on. The pictures are terrific. Read the instruction book. You can download a copy on line.
Canon NBL5L 3.7v
Yes, though it may not always be exactly that much kept in reserve, it keeps a large chunk back even if you've reformatted the drive.
When you formatted it on your Mac, did you choose HFS+ (Mac format) or FAT32 (Windows format)? Macs can read and write to FAT32 formatted disks, but Windows cannot even see an HFS+ formatted disk without a third-party program like MacDrive. The solution is simple. Re-format the disk under the Mac's Disk Utility and choose FAT32. Be sure your data is not on the drive as it will obviously be over-written during the formatting process.
It is probably a software pre-installed on the drive that is telling you to do that. If you don't want to use it, format the drive before you start using.
I'm almost positive it will fit but don't bet me on that, I saw the back of my TV as well as the 33D420VX and it seems like the holes spacing matches up. It's worth a shot for $35 shipped!
I think it would work. But it doesn't technically meet the specs.60 inches is more than 55 and torque would thus be greater. The question is probably how likely would it be subjected to a rotational force and how close are the tolerances.
Shipping to Canadai s $42
There are two levers, with one bolt, but the center has teeth. To get the arm to rotate up or down requires one to pull the two halves apart slightly after loosening the bolt. Loosening the bolt also loosens the grip on the stand, so don't raise the stand to the full height until the boom is at the correct angle.
Not sure. Check the Crucial Memory site to see what type of memory that laptop takes. If it is DDR2, laptop memory, then this should work. You may need to update your BIOS first.
This camera bag has a deep interior pocket that can fit a camera with a very long lens. I can for my camera, my 50 mm, and my 24-135 mm all in the pocket comfortably which leaves plenty of space in the rest of the bag for other accessories.
I dont think so. It doesnt have a rain cover.
the screen swivels almost 360 degrees - when you mount it under the counter when you swivel to the left - it goes 180 degrees - when you swivel to the right it only goes 90 degrees.
Hmmmm I would suggest you ask in an ape store. My understanding is that both are unibody and same design outside.
I'm quite sure that it will. I have never had an issue sending files to or from the drive, regardless of the file or computer type. This product functions just as well as any disk or external hard drive.
Hi Ben, No it does not take that long. We have them in stock, so feel free to order from us, SystemsDirect on Amazon here:
Mine was red
I use it in my wildlife camera even though it says that max is 6 gb and it works great.
I dont have ange about thisy knowled
Hello from Mediabridge... Joshua, I saw your question and thought I would answer since Amazon doesn't typically respond to discussion board posts. HDMI cables are used to connect compatible components such as television and dvd player. HDMI cables will provide digital audio and up to 1080p throughput if they are "High Speed" rated. If you have a 1080p television and a Blu-Ray player, you should be using an HDMI cable to connect them, yes. Be prepared to be amazed. 1080p pictures are breathtaking if you haven't seen them before.
The best think to do is purchase Pocketwizards AC3 Zone controller. Check out this video by Pocketwizard. This should answer question perfectly. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HGyVhoW8iY
Yes, this is for the canon speetlights.
You need a monolight that's compatible with this beautydish because this beauty dish is a Bowens mount.
Yes
no usb port just A/V
It has the demensions in the description, measure it out.
I believe so, but not for the new style "lightning connector".
Yes, it would have no problems with iPod classic. Only the newest generation iPods with a different connecter wouldn't work. All iPods 4th gen and older will work just fine.
This is meant to dock with a pre-Lightning 32-pin iPods. You can still connect via the 1/8" port on the bottom of the speaker unit.
No it will not
no
I have stitched many pictures with the Canon stitch software (even this lense). Go to learn.usa.canon.com and enter the tilt-shift into the search. Watch all three videos by Vincent Lafaret, very good information. Enjoy.
yes
Depends on your sd card. On a charge 4hrs or so. They are pretty good.
The volume button on the left side you push it in lightly. I had a issue with the screen not lighting up after i had mine off for a while. Unplug it, plug it back in give it a second and then lightly off that button in. worked for mine.
Yes, actually just did it on front and back of Xbox.
Yeah but you would need at least a 10 meter cable Not a 4 meter one.
affirmative. I did the same with a Mac book pro.
These are pretty heavy cables, so they are stiff.
I know someone who bought it and had a 1920x1200 display. I don't remember him having any problems or buying another one.
Though not specifically stated on the product, we believe they are manufactured in Korea. That said, we have never had a product issue with the ASA headset. They do offer a lifetime guarantee with that headset which indicates a great deal of confidence in their product quality.
Put product name in Google and ask for replacement remotes
no motorized tracking.
Not unsupervised, no -- it's not a toy (any real, non-plastic scope is going to have delicate parts and breakable glass, mirrors or both). But this one is pretty simple to set up and use, and with adult supervision a 5 year old could get a lot out of it, not just looking at stars but looking at birds, wildlife, distant scenery etc.
Yes. I have my 50'' vizio HD smart tv mounted to it and it fit without a problem.
It is 23.6", but it has staggered holes so that you can mount it for various stud distances.
Not sure on dish but Directv works on home receivers, i have 2 different ones hdmi and the other is rca type.
No and it's not all that you think it is. Very disappointed
35
no sorry we do not have any extra tapes to spare.
No
not sure but its the exact same one that originally came with my tv
Idk for sure. I have a different model Sony tv. Worked great for it though.
There has been a ton of info online about this question. Bottom line, you'll need to pay about $80 to Samsung for a wireless antenna which plugs into this Samsung Blu ray player.
Consider this.....check out Amazon's customer/buyer review and decide!!! Our opinion, DON'T!!! Almost got hooked. Wish all the best!!!

It's the materials that the cone and tweeter are made of and the degree that you can adjust the tweeter. I have the aim 2's and love the sound.
I assume you meant November 20th instead of December 20th (unless you are talking about December 20th, 2008) since December 20th is like 3 weeks from now! Prices fluctuate especially this time of year so grab it when it gets to the lower price because the price would jump up the next half an hour or so.
You might want to ck out the LOGITECK. It works good for me.
Samsung's BD-P3600 is apparently a nice enough gadget, which plays Blu-Ray discs and DVDs and streams online content from Netflix,Pandora Internet radio,PC streaming,BD live,and other streaming services as well as Amazon instant movie.
The same length of time as the VHS taped. If an recording of 2 hrs. - it takes 2 hrs. to copy.
yes but only in a limited way such as titles, chapter names and playlists. You cannot for instance add subtitles or fades etc, for that use a PC based program.
No it doesn't and mines broke within a few months. Wouldn't recommend. Just buy. Blu Ray player better
Yes, it has an A/C cord and requires power to operate the switch.
Great question, I honestly don't know. Basically, you're saying you have some composite devices (instead of component devices). Unless you're going to use it strictly for composite devices, I'm not sure how it would work. Meaning, you'd have to hook it up to your TV to where you're using only a red/white (audio) and yellow (video) cable.
Yes
Yes there is. One can see the slider quite clearly in the photograph of it.
1 11/16 inches across the top, 1 1/8 inches tall and 1/2 inch wide. About the size of three double a batteries put side to side but shorter in height.
I read the number on my old battery and it matched the new one (this number)!
I believe that the statement above is incorrect . This device should record HDTV broadcast since it contains an ATSC tuner. However it will not play the broadcast back as HD since the media to which it writes (regular DVD & VHS tape) do not support playback in HD. Ergo you lose some definition in playback.
It works with Windows XP Home edition and XP Pro!!!!
No, I do not have a 3d TV to test but this receiver was made before the popularization of 3d pass through technology. My assumption is therefore that it might strip out the 3d.
I don't recommend Vivitar products to anyone anymore. The quality and reliability of their products is poor. I had problems with two different models of TTL flashes. One did not even last a week before dying. Another model lasted about 6 months. Their repair/warranty service is awful. i gave up on Vivitar and spent the money on a Canon flash, which is great. You get what you pay for.
If you order the NIKON version, yes. Each TTL (Through The Lens) hotshoe is designed FOR that camera, so the flash has to be the right version to get the fully automatic interaction.
If your camera is a Nikon you need to buy the Vivitar for Nikon flash, otherwise it won't work properly.
As long as your all in one has a usb port you should be able to.
Yes
yes it will .....
I come up with 9 inches...
I'm sure it will as long as you can slide the umbrella rode through a holder on your lights.
I just got it in the mail today. but sadly the clear seems to be the same finish as the standard :| bummer I had to break the packaging seal to check, now it's probably not returnable. oh well...now I have a replacement at least :)
It will work only if you have or get blu-ray playback software.It does not come with any.Most pc's do not come with it pre-installed.
Yes
Input:100-240V 50/60HZ Output:DC 12V=500MA
I doubt it will fit the 55-200. This is rather more in the small to medium size bag.
i have a canon t3i with a 300mm zoom lens and it fits into the case.
I have the Nikon D3500 which is not much smaller and there is still plenty of room. I would feel confident it will fit the D5000.
??? It should works well with my laptop Which has Windows 7, however you need two USB ports for power.
You can download VLC and set it to run from that instead. http://www.videolan.org/vlc/
Yes
Jamaal, Yes ans Yes :-)
Yes
It is a standard 3 prong computer cable. (US).
Yes
I personally wouldn't buy a GPS without multi-point routing. I am a casual driver (not business) and we use the multi-point function all the time - best for plotting a day's worth of traveling in the most efficient way.
No, it does not. I had to install "pages' which works pretty well.
We have never had any battery issues, so I can't give you first hand answer. It still works fine after all these years.
No. I bought this product a few months ago and it does not connect into my camera body. I own the Nikon D3200 and 2 vivitar lenses that I have never used because of how this converter does not allow me to use. If you have the lens that came with your camera the lenses should attach to the end of the nikkor lens. It will look a little odd though. Hope this helps!
no
Not sure about the d7000, it did work on my d3200. ( manual focus )
What the heck??? CyberMonday is coming and Amazon's price goes up????? This sucks.. I'm going to Best Buy too..
Not on its own.
If you need a card to fit a PCI slot, then this is your card.
No. At least mine does not. It does not have any "apps"
I just did the same thing - did you ever figure out the right size screw?
I think the step up from this has the computer compatibility......
It is not rated 3R
Yes I think so it's like any other computer
I have the 36 sleeves in my bin. Some have 2 DVDs in them. I probably have room for at least 10-15 more.
The kit came with an assortment of metric screws that should work for most if not all TV's. I used lag bolts to mount the bracket to the 2x4 studs. It's holding up an 80" TV.
Yes, I measured it to be 33'' end to end, so it might be a close one. But for cost, this has been a solid product.
Depends on thickness of tv. The distance between my wall and back of tv is 1.5 inches. The box also had extensions to increase the distance. Hope that helps.
I mounted the 80" sharp TV using this wall mount and had no issues at all. It works perfectly. I have several devices hooked up to it.
The listing title listed this mount for Sharp 80 inch LC-80LE632U TV. But this doesn't mean it fit all 80" TVs. This mount fit all VESA 200x100 to 700x400, weight less than 165lbs displays. We should not choose mount according to TV size, but need check TV VESA and weight.
Yes it has a USB port for external HD (like playing video from an IPod).
This camera is fixed at 3.6mm lens.
Make sure an HDMI or other video cable is connected from the receiver to your TV, select the appropriate input on your TV. Push receiver at the bottom of the remove. Then push Home Menu or Top Menu (I forget which one) on your remote.
They must. How else would you connect to an antenna for over-the-air transmissions?
I leave mine set on highway all the time and it seems to work good.
Cigarette lighter
I doubt it. I have never tried it, but don't think so.
Yes, this one is...but I don't think the newer model is.
Yes it does.
There is 50,000 sir!!:)
It's made for every device before the iPhone 5 so yes you will need to get an adapter but they are fairly inexpensive! Great sound and overall a great purchase you'll love it!
18.5" x 11" x 5"
Awesome. That's what i was looking for, sound quality not loudness, and it surpassed my expectations. You will love it.
If the CD disk is programed to show . most cd externals wont unless you have them hooked to a laptop or Desktop. also remember on a laptop or PC both USB's must be plugin to get surfactant power.
I would like to know this too. Is the screen excessively glossy? I know on some of the higher end ones they make the display very shiny which is incredibly annoying if you have even a dimly lit room. This set is priced in the middle range so I'm wondering how the gloss on the screen is. It's so hard to tell in the stores because they have the screens in a dark area and angled just so.
Yes. The 380s sound somewhat better in the midrange, which is Sennheiser's strength. The major difference is in fit. I own both and the 380s are far more comfortable, particularly when worn with glasses. I bought the 280s used and even with broken-in ear pads, they were too tight. A year later, I'd saved enough to buy the 380s and the difference was significant enough to make me regret buying the 280s. My son now happily uses the older 280s. Hope this helps.
Yes the stock cable is detachable and should be replaced immediately since it's very annoying to use: it's too heavy and too long. The side that plugs into the headphones is 2.5mm while the other side is standard 3.5mm. You can splurge on an HD380 replacement cable that has a mfr type connector or choose a 2.5 male to 3.5 male cable which will be much less cost. Just be sure the 2.5 side is slender since a wide plug simply will not fit in the headphone.
Yes
No
You would want one set of two, which is what this product is. You only need one to get both radios.
As far as I know you should be able to stream Netflix with this player, it works on a Philips blue ray player with no problem.
Look on the inside of your camera's lens cover for a marking such as LC-52 or 52mm that is the size of your lens. You could also check your camera's spec sheet for size of lens.
Sure, it can be because you can interchange different type lenses with your camera. My lens is a Canon 50mm f:1.8, but the Canon part is not what is important for this product. The 52mm size is what is important. So, if you want to order these, you simply look at the lens diameter measurement on the lens you own and want to use these with. Voila - a really great magnifying tool for your Nikon gear.
yes. Located on the side is the transmitter button. When not pushed the device is in listen mode, when the button is pushed it activates the microphone and makes that device the transmitter.
The threads appear to be a universal fit that include Nikon lenses
Bought this a long time ago, but have not used it much - CP filters are very "personal" - you like them or you don't - Some are warmer, some cooler, and the more expensive ones usually don't seem to change the relative color intensities like many of the cheaper ones (which can make the whole picture seem quite artificial). I'm afraid it's pretty much trial and error trying to find something that you prefer. Sorry I can't be of more help.
Yes it will. It works with any wifi enabled device. Although I plug my AppleTV directly in with an Ethernet cable. I also connect 2 playstation 3s via wifi, several tablets and iPhone and android phones. Movies stream without a glitch or Rebuffering.
No problem!! Fantastic!!
Unfortunately, this cable will not work. This cable is HMDI on one side and mini-coax on the other side. (ie Keyboard to sound boxes)
TV with its stand just sits on it. Not attached
It extends 12 1/2 inches out with the brackets attached 2 inches in from the edge of the shelf.
The arms are padded, so the minimum opening is 1.5 inches and maximum opening is 4.5 inches. I was rushed earlier and rechecked the maximum opening.
Not sure how wide a note 3 is but I have sg3 with an otter box and I still have plenty of more opening room . It opens to 4 1/2 inches max.
It works for sure on a D7100 as that is where mine is right now. If you go to the HOODMAN web site you can see which models fit which cameras. The difference will be either round or square and the size in mm of the eyepeice of the viewfinder. Looks like both take the same model base don the compatibility chart here: http://hoodmanusa.com/cgi/commerce.cgi?display=action&emptyoverride=yes&template=PDGCommTemplates/Header_Footer_XHTML/compatibility_chart.html
If you got this dash kit it fits a lot or rx8 models but they wiring harness only works for yhe 04-08 rx8 , best bet to go to your local audio shop and get with them but more than likely you'll have to buy one that works for the 03
Yes I am using with comcast
What's so hard about signing in?
I found this TV at electronics expo for $180 cheaper using their coupon "EMPLOYEE". best price i was able to find anywhere. it beat out pricegrabber.
Weird-must just be the number made. I'd never seen the 32" one. In retrospect I'm glad I got 40", but at the time I was thinking I'd probably go with 32 had it been available. (Dang...when I first got my 32 it seemed HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE, and now my 40" just looks 'okay', LOL)
I managed to order this before it was supposed to be released; it must have been a glitch on the Amazon.com site. I have a TiVo HD with the latest firmware and the device is not supported. TiVo support is not being very helpful and neither is WD. Disappointing.
Amazon's page still says it's not available, but I just received mine yesterday (from Amazon). So far, so good. Plug it in, restart your TiVo, and 5-10 minutes later you got a gajillion hours of HD recording (okay, I think it's 240 hours, but still). One little bummer, you can't cart the drive from TiVo to TiVo (or computer) to transfer your shows. It says it records some of the show in the internal drive and some on the external, so no complete shows are on the external. No big deal I guess.
No. It connects directly to the network router with Ethernet cords. No wireless access including bluetooth
Hi Brad, if you go to hp.com you will find the basic warranty is 1 year. This info is under Accessories. Additional time can also be purchased from HP. Also Hp does NOT list this item as Energy Star rated. Check the specs. I don't have this monitor but after some research I will be getting it. Possibly a Black Friday special?
No, not that I can see. I think when the monitor is attached to your keyboard, you can adjust the audio from there.
Yes. Make it non broadcasting.
I get it for Evoque and it's works well.
how about splitting the coax, so data goes to the SB6120 and phone com goes to the comcast hardware that controls their phone? your comcast central office has to provision the SB6120 for the data and do a separate one for the phone. then again, your comcast might be one of the poor Comcast service areas like a friend has had in Sycamore Illinois. I haven't had too much trouble in California when asking for changes in the service setting up... good luck
No dust cover, or top just what see is about what you get.
yes it plays all three speeds, you press both speed buttons at once to get 78 speed.
Yes
No this is not a keypad with a built in receiver like the 6128rf
I would say probably not- the door bell is a wireless door bell and this is just a magnetic switch. but you should call Honeywell and ask them to be sure
These contacts are recessed and can be connected to a wireless transmitter. What type of alarm do you have?
Magnets should work if you just use the magnets with wireless sensors
If memory serves me, no pun intended. If you have four slots they all have to be the same speed otherwise it will perform at the lowest speed, I have put 3 GB in 3 slots and 256mb in the fourth and had no issue. You will also want to see the maximum gigs your motherboard will support, if your motherboard only supports 4 gigs and not 8 gigs then adding it to what you already have would be pointless.
I bought this for my Alienware M11xR2, which is PC. Have had it for about a year now with no issues as far as I can tell.
You will have to strip about a 1/2 inch of the insulation to make your contacts. http://www.diyaudioandvideo.com/FAQ/Wiring/ That's a decent article that covers most everything from car audio to home audio.
Garmin sells GPS maps for around the world. I just did a quick search, and indeed, I see a map for the Garmin that covers Israel.
Sure
Start out by trying with the biggest eyepiece and practice in daytime aiming and focusing the scope on objects like lamp posts trees and once your comfortable try at night by finding a bright star or the moon. Make sure the amount the focus tube is up is around an inch above bottom and just keep scanning till you find it. Then you can fine tune the focus to get crisp image.
Just got off the phone w/ LG tech support and they confirmed that you have to manually set the box to 720p (or presumably 1080i) when you want to use youtube, your own media, and netflix. This seems to be an issue w/ the latest firmware, b/c it was working w/ *auto* before the update. Pushed the tech person to understand how silly this is, but got nowhere. My goodness, just set the output to 720p or 1080i when streaming any of the services that can't support 1080p. Hopefully a new firmware update will be forthcoming.
It does tilt a little bit, mabe only between 5-10 degrees but it does tilt, at least the one I just got.
There is a setting to keep the player from stretching the 4:3 picture. Why people like to watch stretch-o-vision is beyond me.
yup i have the same issue apparently its cause of the tv drawing lot of power dur to its fast start up . try plugging it in to the wall direcly ie with no other devices plugged in. i also notice that it only happenes if i have had the tv off for a while eg over nigt and not if it turn it off wait a few mins and turn it on so it must be some thing with the power. i would still call samsung and see whats up.
Haven't tried that but I don't see why it wouldn't work. It just splits the signal. There's no noticeable lag time between the monitors.
Yes
since it uses the coaxial input on the TV, you will need to tune your TV to channel 3 or 2. and that will have to be ANALOG channel 3 or 2. remember, this is to connect a new device to an older tv that does not have AV inputs.
Yes it is and this device makes it happen
we have just put a gt120 into a mac pro MA356LL/A 1,1 and it works fine, the original 7300gt is faulty.the osx was 10.6.8
Hi do not buy it this is a piece of junk, works Fine for two months, buy sony products i already bought two and last four years with two kids , hope this help you yo seek for another dvd player
They are long enough to put them each on one side of a monitor comfortably without problems.
Not that I recall....no.
Yes. It really doesn't care. It is just taking a video signal, amplifying and sending it to four outs.
go to www.displaywars.com and plug in 26 versus 32 display - it will show an overlay in color and dimensions so you can visualize the difference. If budget is a consideration then consider as an alternative the panasonic viera 26x1 being price promoted as an amazon special
remember, it's a fake camera, is to try to scare away thieves and scare a little, not more.
It is only black
I would make sure the receptacle is working right and is wired and polarity is correct. Dennis
It should fit an EF-S or EF Mount. There's no Auto on this lens. If you are looking for National geographic shots. I would not purchase this lens. Acts more like a telescope, good for shooting the moon. That's all I use it for. You MUST be on a sturdy tripod. Difficult to focus but it gives a pretty good image of the moon with a little practice. High contrast subjects are best. Good luck.
I have one of these Anthony, it is the 150ma-300ma
The Magellan Roadmate 1470 does contain a subcatagory POI for Indian restaurants. It also has subcategories that are quite detailed. For asian it has Filipino, Indian, Korean, Thai, and Vietnamise.
The only major differences between the 507 and 607 is that the 507 is 5.1 while the 607 supports 7.1. Also, the 607 has a Faroudja chip for video upscaling...but most professional reviews recommend using the passthrough feature and letting the tv do the work. The Faroudja chip was revolutionary when it came out about 10 years ago...but time has passed it by and most tv's these days do a better job of processing. If you don't need 7.1 then I would say the 507 is a better value..
Usually refurbished means that it was once in the hands of the consumer who returned it for some reason, maybe it did not work, maybe they decided they did not want it. Either way, it is tested and looked over (usually my the manufacturer) and resold as a refurbished item. Usually Refurbished items are a good bet as they have been looked over and tested by a technician, where as only a few new items are tested.
I go on line for all owner manuals I need
No
I have ML Montage and all three sound excellent.
11.2 x 10 x 1.8 inches

I'm not sure, I think you should search by writing 900 picture album and see if there's one like that.
Unfortunately not
No
no, they do mot
Yes
No. Only a USB for the computer
Sorry. These will be the new II series. I'll get them to fix it. But if you buy from us you will get the new II series.
it will not fit the Nokia Mural 6750
Is your USB formatted in FAT, FAT 32, or NTFS? This TV only supports FAT and FAT32. If your USB device is an external hard drive, it is likely that it is formatted in NTFS and thus, not compatible. Let me know. (To find out what format your USB is, plug it into your PC, right click on it under Computer, click Properties, and you'll see.)
Yes they have this feature called auto volume, commercials and programing are played at the same audio level
Great Job, they raise the price for cyber monday this tv was $1699 three hours ago and i was going to buy it today i waited to see if they would lower the price, guess they took the other route i guess i wont be buying this TV today.
I actually just picked this TV up from Fred Meyer in Portland for $999.99. A deal they had since it's being discontinued. If you are in the Pacific Northwest give them a try.
If you are in Southern California, Ken Cranes has this for $1289, THEY pay the tax, and they deliver it free. Oh, and you get the DP1600 BluRay player free, too. A no brainer.
it either comes with the CD, or Win7 doesn't need it(pre-installed drivers)... either way i'm using it for my hard drives on a window7 64-bit PC. However it does not work with optical drives(dvd/cd)
I too have received V2 of this product. DD-WRT is not supported for V2.
Yes, it has the power supply cable, and as I recall an input line, too. It also compress, expands, and enriches the sound (improves it) as it streams it from your device.
Only from a laptop to a receiver with iTunes
Yes the Beo4 will turn the A8 on and off and control volume, but strangely the A8 remote won't work on any other B&O system.
NO!!

I have my cell phone number programed into the system. If you are trying to get an attachment to use when your land line is unavailable I can't answer that question.
GE Iinterlogix Simon XT version updates started from rev0.0, 1.0, 1.2. 1.3, 1.3.2, 1.4, then came XTi. They basically all works good. 0.0 panel is classic model, has fold-down half door in front. 1.2 update brought improved front buttons, eliminating fold-down half cover. 1.3 upgrade added supports for CO Gas sensor and 2WTTS Touch screen keypad. 1.4 upgrade added supports for RF-TS touch screen keypad and supports for alarm.com's G3 GSM cell module which has home automation feature. All versions still work very well as wireless alarm system, except above revision updates to accomodate added optional devices.
There really isn't any that I am aware of. Assuming you are replacing a broken one, its pretty much plug-n-play.
No you need to have a router. If you only have wireless available you can get an access point or other solution. But you need a way for your computer and the VortexBox to be on the same network. Having a tablet or iPhone on the network is good as well. You can control the VortexBox with your computer but it's more convenient to use a table or phone.
I've used this indoors albeit on a window ledge and I pick up my local HD over the air channels perfectly. So yes it has cut my cable out. I'm in Denver and mine faces the mountains...away from Denver itself band I get great reception. I'm about 14 miles west of Denver.
I don't believe it has that capability
I use it indoors so I would assume that mounting it in a garage attic is fine, so long as you can get it wired to your TV.
We have it mounted permanently on top of our motorhome with the cable running inside through the side of a roof vent. It works great, and we've driven thousands of miles with no problems. I was careful to mount it parallel with the roof to minimize wind resistance.
No grounding is needed. All you do is hook up the coaxial cable and the power source can be close to your TV.
Not exactly. But trunking systems don't work in a way that "regular" scanners work. If you understand the way "systems" (think of them like banks in a regular scanner) work, it's not difficult at all.

Hello, This is a UTP (unshielded) cable. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@mediabridgeproducts.com
It's 50 feet long, specs must have typo have had cable since 2012. Connects modem and router great cable
It will work with anything that takes a standard Ethernet cord
I have heard that this is the case...
The width is 16 inches, front to back is 12 inches and the height is 10-1/4 inches.

No they are two different camera's. Poloroid discontinued manufacturing film for their instant camera's. Fugi came up with their own instant camera that has its own film.
The short and sweet is the A is a 120 Hz screen and the B is 240 Hz. As with most newer models the B has better contrast and response time. You can compare both on Samsung.com to get all the details.
The radios are new and in original packaging. Not sure what is meant by "sertificates." If you are asking about certificates, it is still unclear what you are asking. There are no certificates applicable. If you are asking about an FCC license for GMRS frequencies, the answer is no. You must separately apply with the Federal Communications Commission and pay a licensing fee of around $90. You cannot legally operate these radios on the GMRS frequencies until you have received a license and call sign from the FCC.
Yup! You just have to set them all to the same channels. (The guide book that comes along will show you)
Compatible with: iPod mini; iPod nano 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G; iPod classic 4G, 5G, 5.5G, 6G; iPod touch 1G, 2G,3G, 4G; iPhone 1G, 3G, and 4
Don't recall if it did. We have had no problems with the telescope and all the neighbor kids use it regularly with my family. Great product for the price. The moon looks incredable!
Depends on the type of photo you're looking to shoot. It's a fairly slow film so most likely you'll be shooting long exposures. If that is what you are wanting to do then yea this film performs fairly well in lowlight having relatively few problems with mixed light sources and very little need for reciprocity correction.
Why waste good film in a camera that is not going to provide quality pictures. When you can buy quality used camera for about for less or the same amount of money. Take a look @ a Yashica Mat 124, 124g, 635 any of them. I have never used a flash with this type of film. If you are going to use a flash try ISO 400 a faster speed film.
Many as you want
Yes it does? It has a navigate to zip, cross street/intersection, city center and street/house number
Yes it accommodated my Toshiba MK1059GSM, 1TB drive - which is 12.5 mm thick. The case is really quite nice. If you plan to use the eSATA connector you should also know that an eSATA cable was not included (there's just the standard Y-type USB cable)
This is the harness adapter.
based on the fitting check on the right corner of the product website. It will fit. You can check it by yourself.
Absolutely.
I had a Dodge Ram that I installed DBALL remote start kit into. I checked the "directed" site to see if I needed the XKLOADER.
Requires removal of the screen. About 14 or16 screws to remove. Not a one man job, have a friend help to lift it off an put it back after cleaning. Once removed you have access to the mirror, optical eye and reverse side of screen you just removed. All were dusty on mine and after cleaning the picture will be brighter and clearer. Use any tv screen cleaner, they tend to leave no syreaks. I use pne mabe by monster. Well good luck.
3D, but old school checkerboard 3D. You would need to get another 3D player of some type to be able to actually utilize 3D, like a Panasonic 3D blu-ray unit. The unit may experience a chip failure as the previous user said, but it is a fairly inexpensive repair and the picture is VERY good. I have seen some of these units advertised on craigslist for fairly low prices.
Did you ever get an answer or solution for this? I purchased 12 gauge speaker wire but have not installed it yet. I can return it if need be. Thanks!
Yes. it works.
Hi, I'm not sure but the battery is the easiest place to start. is it charged with the right charger ? It should take a while to charge the battery (generally a couple of hours) if it charges faster, it probably is the battery. you have to replace rechargeable batteries periodically.
Yes
No software comes on the flash drive
yes
Yes, it will store photos, music or any other file that you have on your computer hard drive. Just plug the SanDisk Cruzer into any USB port on your computer then copy the files you want directly onto the Cruzer. If you have any problems see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gPsmN0oKhM. Hope this helps. BTW, these are great drives. I have several available just in case I need to share files with others.
I believe one can format flash drives for FAT and this shouldn't be any different. Do a Google search and you'll find many examples.
Go to this link, it lists most of the Sony Cameras and the batteries they use. http://www.amazon.com/Sony-NP-FG1-Rechargeable-Lithium-Ion-Battery/dp/B00170MYIS/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1353685568&sr=1-1&keywords=NP-FG1 Scroll down the page to find the chart.
You can see the tab in this picture. It's the small tab in the center on opposites sites that fit in the hole in the fixture to hold it up in place. Not sure if that answers your question.
Sorry we do not sell that part number.
It works with anything with a headphone jack but your phone probably will not fit the tray. My little mp3 player is the only thing that would fit. The radio DOES NOT work for crap and and does not get reception at all. Ive had two after the first stopped working completely after 6 months. I would recommend you find a better alternative because I still regret getting this one.
Yes. To an extent.
Vega cable
You need to go to the SlingLink website and ask that question. Sorry, Ron
No it won't function like that
I don't have Dish and I only use this with my Xbox. However, my thoughts would be that if the VIP has an Ethernet port then this should work. All this is doing is using your home wiring to access to the Internet.
The 8500 is a FULL back lit LED as opposed to the 8000s edge lit LED. The full back lit is suppose to be superior and have a more uniform picture but it's also alot more expensive!!!!
I looked at both the UN46B7000 and the UN46B8000 and to me the 240mhz is noticably smoother during action scenes. The 8500 is the best LCD picture I have seen but not worth 2X the price of the 8000 series. I got my UN46B8000 during a previous promotion that ended on 11/7/09 for $1889. The Link-Stick makes WiFi internet acess a snap.
No
Vance, mine came with a very nice neck strap but not the harness. I believe I prefer it to the harness anyway. The harness looks like it would be a hassle more than a help. I hope this helps.
No it does not
I Use This On My Bushnell Binoculars For Hunting And It Has Held Up Very Well
I'm also a star gazer and, yes, the quality does translate to astronomy. Just know it will be limited by the 50mm light gathering power; given good, dark sky conditions, it will detect the brighter fuzzy M-objects (though small in the 10x power of the bino).
Yes, it is. I use it with that exact model of camera.
It does have the lense hood. I'm sure it's US but I'm not 100%.
New.
No. I think the UPC is 753218993403. Model is KP501E2.
Yes. Yes. 160Gig.
Yes it will. I use these in my cams.
The short answer is yes. The Nintendo 3DS supports regular SD cards up to 2 GB, and this type of SDHC card from 4 GB's to 32 GB. What I don't know is how much memory is suitable for your Nintendo use.
I pushed in and turned HARD. I installed eight of them and they were difficult to separate. I'd rather have it that way, than too easy.
I am not sure how big is the Canon Powershot SX130 but i guess it will be better of with the WP-570 (http://www.amazon.com/DiCAPac-Underwater-Waterproof-Cameras-similar/dp/B003UQPANI/ref=pd_sim_p_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=1JQEF53MDZJDMJ6YWF9S) but it will work in both housings fine.
Search website of brand of case and it should have your camera on there
The case measures 5.5 x 6 x 10 inches. You'd have to measure the camera to see if it fits.
you have to go to the DiCAPac site and search your camera.
All the connectors are separate so they fit most after market MBoards.
you have to go to menu/channel and switch from air to cable then auto program
Hi, i am thinking of purchase this too. and i'll use it as a pc monitor and watch tv rarely. so it is really m atter for me. did u fix this problem? is it good as a pc monitor? and which cable u use foir it? hd2dvi ?thank you.
depends on the added weight, there is like a 3.5 pound limit or something for the HD 1000, so measure the total weight added. Also I would recommend a Wide Angel Lens, or your shot movement will be very noticeable.
Please note both of N110 and N120 are glossy screen. You should go with NC10 if you prefer matte screen without any reflections.
Start, Run, CMD (drop to the command prompt). Then run CheckDisk with the fix command (chkdsk /f). Typically this fixes the errors on the drive.

Yes.
In file manager, you should be able to "drag and drop" a file from your "C" drive (or wherever your copying from) to the Lexar. Your front USB port might not be hooked up internally or the front port might be rated below USB 2.0. Try inserting the Lexar in a USB port in the back of your computer.....should work then.

It certainly should. 98 had plug and play, I believe. Should not need drivers. Pretty good deal, eh?
If your notebook possess bluetooth and it is enabled you should see the bluetooth icon in the system tray. Look at the bottom of the mouse, move the power switch to the on position then hold the bluetooth button until the blue bluetooth light under the mouse wheel starts flashing. Now on your notebook, right click your bluetooth icon in the system tray and click add device. Select Dell BT Mouse from the list of found devices, click next then close and windows will automatically install drivers for your mouse.
I'm sure it does. But I don't have a GH4.
Kind of an outdated discussion, since Klipsch has updated the Quintets to a new "IV" model, but it's worth pointing out that the Take Classic speakers are much less efficient than the Quintets and present a greater challenge for an amplifier to drive.
could be. I bought mine for $1460 shipped through a top-rated seller on ebay back in January. I'm glad that it's still not even $100 cheaper 4 months later.

Hello, 2008 was a transition year, is you have the same body style as the 2007 then it will fit, however if you have the 2009 body style it will not. Please feel free to call us if you have any further questions! Thank you!
there is a hole in the unit for the power plug
It wouldn't it just fits perfect for the full size rams
The dongle or wireless usb insert must be used in order for the Microsoft 5000 Mouse to be seen by your system. Just plug the small wireless atapter into any USB port and restart the Computer. Give it a monment or two for the drivers to be read, once your pointer moves it is installed. Ciao . . Sal
About 26 oz.
I do occasionally but it works better if you use it on a hard surface. Example placing a thin flat hard covered book on your lap then the air board on top. Hope this helps!
If your acer has a USB port, the fan will plug into that.

I have not used it for that, but I have used it for my Delonghi espresso, coffee, latte, and grinder machine. It works flawlessly. I upgraded to the heavy duty stu 2000 based on reviews from others, and was very pleased. Basically you can convert EU here and if you are in EU, you can convert it to US.
No
Should be fine as long as the oven doesn't exceed 750W of draw. Look on the back of the oven for the rating.
Determine your ref's wattage and multiply by 3 (just to be safe). Thats your ideal transformer wattage.
Not to my knowledge. Here is the companies contact info http://www.voltage-stabilizer.com.bear in mind they are 14 hours ahead due to the time zone. There is also an email contact form on their web site. They sell many different models but I did not see any advertised that we're servo-stabilized.

Yes. Fixed perfectly in my Canon t2i.
No. It's just the lens and lens caps standard, but you might find it from third party vendors in a pack with extras like filters.

For true surge protection you will want to run the coax through the surge protector.
Where to in Europe?
Perfect condition....tested and works perfect :-)
Yes, if the DVD is coded it will only play US.
Yes, we do but you'll have to add to cart to see shipping cost. thank you
I had no problem getting the rebate. It took a long time to get it but I did recieve it. I am not sure why people are having a problem with it unless they didn't follow the directions.
As far as i am aware of, the MobileMate should With most cards.
No, this is a storage unit only and will store digital data only.

If you do not care about the resolution or quality of the pictures then you may be alright with it. Just make sure the room of viewing is very dark as well. This item is very inexpensive but like the saying goes" You get what you pay for! "
It should, it is a PC.
LoL... where were you at all last week when it was -$200 off....
The question is the egpu card USB capable? Even if it does, trying to run the card thru a USB port would have very poor performance because of the USBs 480mb capacity. So I would say don't waste your time trying to run graphics thru a USB.
Don't know. I've only used it for SD cards
Yes the narrow end of the antenna points towards the broadcast point of the stations you want to receive. Probably in the largest city nearby. You can find your local stations location on antennaweb.org or tvfool.com
i baught a sub and it sounded bad from day one. only lasted a week and when i contacted them they said kenwood would replace it. kenwood said that discountsjungle is not a authorised dealer and it was there responcibility and when i called discuntsjungle they was rude and left me on hold 15 mins at a time and then told me they would not replace it. i will never do business with them again
Yes it does; I have owned this adapter for several months now, and it works great. If you do a lot of video filming and want to save on battery usage it is invaluable.
yes
No
No...it is a strictly manual focus lens
i think this will work in a manual mode only.
no, it does not lock in place. it is pretty stable/stays in place if you don't bump it.
From left to right is about a foot I think and it swivels top to bottom is about 3 inches I think.
Yes, looking into it, the E6510 is a slight variation of the E6500, in the family of Dell PA-3E Buy LEGACY UPCYCLER's- he tries to help.
Not sure, I didnt use it. However, pulling it out of the cigarette lighter was challenging every time because it was not a sturdy piece. It came apart at times and finally broke. Im looking for another.
Yes it will work with it. Arthur Satechi Technical Support
I would say it works for women as the medial strap has no restrain to the front of women's body. Attached the GoPro to the quick release buckle and that's simple. I would recommend it for any sport action or sight seeing to capture the scene and free your hands!
You will have to have the foot pod in order to use this watch indoors.
That's stupid when you can get the 4000 for $19.95 I use my for graphics illustration and it's a beast. You don't need that $199.00 unless you just like to throw your money away!
nope they wont cause problems because of MS's pairing
It's the same size as the &lt;Enter&gt; key but smaller than the right &lt;Shift&gt; key.
You have to get the one designed for cannon. Otherwise it will not fit your camera. Search for Vivitar 383 for cannon.
The head detaches with ease, I can't say whether the head you mentioned is compatible but if it's made for a 75mm bowl it should be fine.
We got the tripod, head and a relatively well-made nylon bag with an appropriate shoulder strap. Every thing necessary to use the tripod is included.
If you are very caring of them probably 6 months? the plastic its made of is Slightly fragile.
they will be the same size as the pic would have if taken using photo film rather that slide film.
Yes
It says here that it supports the 1.3b specification: http://www.port-ta.com/products/19.html This appears to support 1.4 (ARC and HEC): http://www.port-ta.com/show.asp?id=264 as well as this: http://tinyurl.com/3lhafrg (Google shopping)
Yep Wep works fine mine connected to a Samsung BlueRay
kim zook, The LinkStick itself only provides Wi-Fi capabilities to specific Samsung models. The Apps are not stored on the LinkStick. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
You can use rechargeable batteries just like disposable batteries.
i bought it for a MacAir and it worked very well but I don't know about Windows.
Yes you can, however the music files need to be in .acc format. The easiest and perhaps most common way to do this is to format them using iTunes. Copy and paste those files in a separate folder for easier management then import them to the DSi. Just remember you need to do this by inserting the memory card inside a computer first. Hope this helps.
Yes. Any brand of SD / SDHC card will work in the Nintendo 3DS XL.
Nope, i bought this for that but it didn't work
I'm actually not certain, but I wouldn't recommend it simply because I don't believe that a Belkin and HP use the same product form factor for their power inputs. Best of luck though.
Yes nice like original
It works on my Vizio HD TV, so I am thinking it should work on your TV. The splitter automatically will select the input from the numbers 1, 2, or 3.
self powered
Yep.
I used mine with my Vizio TV, Nintendo Wii U, Tivo and Sony DVD player. It works fine with those items , but that is all I can attest to.
yes
Yes, there is a backup logon, or you can bypass it by turning the feature off. Its so cool, though, you wouldn't want to.
ye and yes
I haven't got a clue. I put mine in a DLP television. As for instructions, I don't remember if they came with. It's been awhile. I just looked at a couple You Tube videos. It's not hard.
Srry I can not answer that as I bought a bulb OEM for a different TV then you are asking about. All i can tell you u is to make sure you open the tv with power off and remove assembly holding build and read the build spec's manufacture and model number. Order exactly what you see, sometimes the build type needed is listed on the side of the TV but in some cases the TV requires a different bulb then is written on the TV. Look at the bulb inside the TV !!
Hi Willy, I will answer categorically YES. But, here is a great article from MacWorld http://www.macworld.com/article/1143511/unibody_macbook_review.html where it confirms that 8Gb can be installed. On thing for sure, Kingston makes great quality products. So, after reading the mac-Article, I'm would get the memory. 4Gb won't take you too far. My macMini (with the same processor as your laptop) came with 4Gb once I ran PhotoShop I was swimming in glue!
I'd like to know i this is an isolated problem - that would be a major factor in buying this unit. Anyone? Can you get RM?
It was for a HP Pavilion DV 4000. Wicoo Li-ion 11 . 1v 5200mAh. I contacted the company and thet immediately responded to refund my money or replace the battery. They are sending a new battery. Hopefully it will work. Should know in afew days. Jim
There is no mounting screw holes. I think the only way you can get them off the floor is with a shelf. The base is 11 3/8" diameter.
No. You can install one or two. On my wife's computer she had 1 gig of RAM (2 x 500mb). I replaced one of the 500 mb with a 2 gig. She now has 2.5 gigs of RAM.
It doesn't look like it . This uses a special plug and an input named "Port" .
Hi, This product has nothing to do with phone line. It is used to extend the USB 1.1 connection over a CAT5e or CAT6 cable.
I have used this USB extender with a Logitech C310 web camera over a CAT-6 cable about 25' long. The camera seems to work as it did connected directly to the computer, and I've had no issues with the extender or camera.
They don't go through the ethernet. But I'm not 100% sure what the different setups can be. I would contact tripp lite tech support for details
I am not sure you are referring to the exactly same product I used. Yes, I bought one and installed at our church for about 120 feet, and it worked great.
This didn't work for my iMac because the frequency for the modules was different. I would go with something like this http://www.amazon.com/memory-Dell-Latitude-D620-D630/dp/B001SVEISU Looks like you would be able to upgrade the memory modules to 4 gbs in the machine you have. I did some quick research and found this do it yourself guide. https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Dell+Latitude+D620+RAM+Replacement/2395#s12592 Not sure if all of this helps. Good luck.
Yes it will work. Check this website for any model upgrade Www.crucial.com Thanks
according to mactracker it should, it work on my old macbook
Yes, it will work... read this http://computermemorydeal.dealproduct.com/2gb-memory-ram-upgrade-for-the-lenovo-thinkpad-r61-series-t60-series-t61-series-x60-series-and-x61-series-laptops-ddr2-667-pc2-5300-sodimm-big-discount.html
Yes, it is labeled as "UL listed" on the unit itself. It is not a charger, however, only a power supply.
It should, as a rear exhaust. Where did you intend on placing it?
No fan is absolute silent. This one is pretty quiet for the price range. If you want silent then you have to pay up. For around $10 you can't go wrong with this. It's very smooth sounding.
No - 12v DC - thru your power supply.
Here is a link to the info http://www.coolermaster.com/cooling/case-fan/sickleflow-120-2000rpm-blue-led/ They have been working 24/7 for 2 years now and still run perfect.
The keypad is the four buttons on the right. You can create a combo using those. The key part is under the handle. The handle is held on with a tiny hex screw on the bottom. You remove the handle and use the key to turn the lock. A bit difficult to open that way but doable.
I have and this on
I'm in Indiana and can pick up all the over the air channels available although I may have to move the antenna a bit to better receive some of them since this is an indoor antenna. I think I get around 20 channels.
I don't know the technical name of it but it's the standard 1/4 inch coax that the cable companies use. I went Big Lots and bought a 25' coax cable and then connected it to my TV. I think it's called RG6 and the female ends with pins are called F- pins.
Not really, im using the onw in my motherboaed and these headset are amazing. Just make sure you have 5.1 soundcard in your mobo.
Dude, i've configured it to hard bass, with help of my sound card driver (asus xonar) and i turn down all the woofers with the sub at max volume; in a 5.1 music the bass is trully hard, its awesome, totally worth it. Its durable, and excelent
Lily, I just jam them on, having of course removed the stock standard black buds that came with my Shure 825 earphones. I have experimented with the black buds and they are terrible compared with the flange ones, which you can screw much further into your canals, where they need to be for the earphones to work properly. But I am having a big problem with these splitting where I jam them on the earphone -- over time. I hope this helps.
not sure of that particular connection type. They work wonderfully on my headset "Midland AVPH3 Transparent Security Headsets with PTT/VOX " http://www.amazon.com/Midland-AVPH3-Transparent-Security-Headsets/dp/B000CNAEEW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1401912806&sr=8-1&keywords=midland+security+headset+replacement+parts With opening for sound tube being about 1/8 inch or smaller. Works great to blockout background noise
I personally am running low profile ram, so the height might be a problem for you or it will barely clear. To avoid that problem I would just stick the fan on the opposite side. There really isn't that much performance difference if that at all (2 degrees C max). Also it is only a 2 to 3 degrees C cooler running an extra fan (using 2 Noctha Fans) so running 2 fans isn't really worth it.
The Lowepro website has a "Bag Finder" page into which you enter camera and lens dimensions that may help determine if one of their bags fits your needs.
Yes it will, I have a 5D Mark II in it with the Canon battery grip and the EF 24-105 MM in it, there's also a side compartment where I keep 2 extra batteries and cable. It fits real snug but I believe that the 5D is a little wider than the 7D so you shouldn't have any problems, if you want to keep a zoom lens on your camera, you might want to consider the 75 model, it's the same width but much deeper. :)
Not a good fit with the grip. The bag is just too narrow. Fits about perfectly without the grip if that gives you any idea. It's a well made item, but probably not what you need. Hope you find what you are looking for.
For the OMW5 the price is per speaker.
Yes, these also come in black.
The 465t
Personally I cannot recommend this item. Mine failed. The replacement failed. The third one failed. None worked more than 3 hours. Honestly I do not know if it works with Linux, but my experience is that it does not work at all
Yes
no you would need a 120w adapter
There are many trees in my area and the TERK still gets about 20 channels. When there is a thunder storm the signal is a bit weaker but all in all it is a great antennae. The best part is no holes in the roof that could potentially leak!
Not exactly the memory stick I have but yes I'm absolutly sure it does.I have 8GB Pro Duo and was considering the magic gate but my device did not support the magic gate functions so it was just not needed.
I don't believe the this camera case is Waterproof.
The inside of the case measures 2 7/8" W X 4 1/2" L. x 1 1/8" deep. My Kodak camera measures. 3 3/4" L x 2 1/2" W x 3/4" thick so it fits. With camera stap attaced and extra memory card in pocket. Hope this helps
I don't believe the this camera case is Waterproof.
it should. i have used it with the website www.twitch.tv
Yes it would work on windows 8 and probably all the lower windows OSes.
Yes and also for a mic must have usb access.
Yes depends on the network strength of signal
Yes it would. It's made of durable plastic
Simon Your setup should work the only problem I see is that the speakers you have may not get enough power but they should sound good, when I setup this speaker it was a pain trying to understand what type of series should they be installed in, but the polk audio has 4 leads red, black green, and white please follow the instructions very carefully and try only one speaker at a time. When this unit is connect correctly it sounds great.
As convertor box is to convert digital signals to analog signals for use with an analog TV. Can't be many analog sets in use...
yes, it has it own power plug in to recharge it.
there is a push button on the side.
Touchscreen
Yes
Yes, I can fit 2 pro bodies, 300mm 2.8, 70-200mm 2.8, 16-35mm 2.8, and a third body(no motordrive) and a 50mm prime.
Should work fine. It's the right connector and size.
It's just the drive, you'll want to purchase a cable specific to your needs with it
The answer is yes, it should be a plug to plug replacement. Your Mac book should recognize and accept the new capacity of 500GB.
jnwarm, if you were referring to Seagate Momentus 750GB XT, unfortunately Amazon does provide info which item I purchased in responding to. I currently I have it in my Dell Latitude E6510 and working with no issue.
Should not change the ability to have backwards compatibility.
I have a intel motherboard. I am not sure if it will work with amd..
This plugs into a "PC Card" slot, or "PCMCIA" card slot, the same thing...these are on laptops only as far as I know. It converts the PC card slot into a 2 USB ports, but also requires a special very thin USB cable and converter to connect...not the standard USB connector.
200 a day.... in short ... no. If you get this you will definitely see how cheaply it actually is made and most certainly would not handle a per day volume like that. Second if you read my review from a while back the thing didn't fix any of the c d's I had an issue with. It does make them look better but if you do have a skipping disk or a place where it always stops ... I have yet to see this thing fix one.
I would recommend this for any camera from compact to entry level DSLR with lightweight short extension zoom, regards
It does not.
Yes
It is doing fine with my Sony 32 Inch. I had a really good installation guy to do the work.
it should but check with size of the camera and when you click the the camera case it will show you the size and if it will work.
Yes, The dimensions are exactly like my Lumix and my camera fits easily into the case. THe case also has the extra pocket for batteries in which I keep two. The case has enough padding to protect the camera. I have dropped mine several times and it has done a nice job. Its just big enough to give maybe a 1/4 inch around the camera when in the case. I hate cases that are too big. good luck.
Well. I had a setup with those exact components and it worked well for the money. Just make sure you set your gain properly!
1.25 cubic ft for a sealed box. 2 cubic ft for ported box (port 4'' in diameter with it being 12.25'' long).
Yes it will , I am using this remote with sony kdl-52v5100..
It worked fine on the Satellite A665 which I have. I don't know if works with the C50-A. Perhaps you can go on the Toshiba website to see if this power source is recommended for use with your computer.
It works on mine
while this particular part does not specify max wattages, similar parts specify 45w per socket ... as led bulbs are likely to be far below this i don't see any problems (i'm sure the manufacturer is simply trying to be clear that this part is NOT intended for high-wattage incandescent bulbs - and as these parts have been available forever - and as fairly bright LED bulbs are a recent development, the ad text probably has never been updated)
How would I know. I don't have own an Acer computer.
don't really know but i don't see why not. can't see there being diodes in the wiring bundle. won't hurt to try. interested if you do.
No
I have Windows Vista 64 bit OS and all I did was install it and Windows loaded the drivers and it worked great. I would highly recommend it.
They plug into the wall. I will tell you they have a Great Sound!! Even my son would like to get these also.
No you can't . Can play them but not record
I don't know, the thing broke too quickly to find out. Really cheaply made, the record player any way. Everything works great except the record player. Its really for show. I wouldn't recommend it. Do your research for sure. I had to buy a new record player
This keyboard does not have any external metal components. Excluding 11 recessed screws on the bottom, it's all black plastic.
I still have the card and it does not mention warrentee but the sellers page at Amazon mentions 2 year warrentee. The card has an address............ Kingston Technology Corporation 17600 Newhope Street Fountain Valley, Ca 92708
Please refer to the discussion board at avsforum.com. A Google seach for 'Sony HT-CT500 issues' should return relevant links. I too have followed the development and subsequent release of this updated sound bar (patiently waiting to replace my HT-CT100 with this model).
The 500 sound significantly louder over the 100. I keep the center channel to '0' and dialogue is crystal clear and loud on all sources like tv and blu ray movies.
No
Unfortunately, no. Black only.
It should have no problem doing that. I have one of my external hard drives connected to it, in addition to my mouse, keyboard, and an IR receiver (all of which I have constantly connected to my computer). I've had it for a while now and have had zero problems with it, and data transfer speeds are plenty fast for transferring photos. It's a good little cheap USB hub, and I do recommend it. :)
I did not use it with a playstation, but do not see why it wont work, its usb 2.o
No software is included with this peripheral, so I do not think it is programmable.
Yes. Any where in the world. Just put the drive you need in the basket and enter ship to address and you will get the total including shipping. We will ship the same day when amazon send the order to us. thanks....
The flexible neck is 6.5" long. The whole mike extended straight up measures 10.5" from the bottom of the stand to the top of the mike.
You can turn it an turn it on and off but you don't have to press a button to talk.....its good for gaming and with Skype. great deal for the price
I own OMD-EM5, previously Pana GF-1. As some say there is a purple flair on sunlight. I don't see it as a real issue. The combination is really good and the lens is pretty amazing
Yes. Covers most everything you would connect, DVR, Game, BluRay etc...
I had purchased this to replace the one that came with my monitor/tv. It seemed to cause some static in the screen but I am not sure if it was the adapter or the monitor was going bad.
I had plugged this in and it did power up my monitor/tv. I am not sure if it is the same monitor you have though as I left the monitor behind when I moved and can not remember what I had bought it for..
Yes it should work
You will need a separate phono preamp to hook up a turntable.
Cord is junk do not buy. I got mine and threw it away. Very cheap.
It is usually for gaming headset or headphone systems. It can be used for anything that needs to be a male to male 2.5 to 3.5 conversion
Dear Jorge, Thanks for your email to us about your question. We are a professional supplier for laptop batteries Our main products are replacement batteries. For Dell 1535 1537 1557 battery with 6 cells, we have replacement one not genuine battery. If you need one, you can contact us. For replacement battery, we can offer 14 months warranty. Thanks. Hope my answer can help you. Best Regards, Amy CRTECH
There are 2 sets of RCA outputs to a receiver, one after the built-in preamp and one with pre-amplification.
No, the turn table does not have these features. It has manual on/off switch and record speed adjustment. Also counter-weight on tone arm. No anti-skate device. But a very usable and quality device.
I put these speakers in my boat they sound great, Make sure you have enough depth for the speaker to fit in place.
I have a Reckless fairing on my Road King and these fit perfectly! No cutting or filing was necessary. I bought my fairing for the 6.5" application. Hope this helps
you can go up to-8-gi-sd card. hope this helps. this is the best little mini cam I have ever owned. I have 3-ove them, they are the BEST. JR.
I just finished a 5,000 mile road trip in a '75 maverick and saw no up dates, I get the same old "warning, possible speed trap, reduce speed, " in the same areas as I have from the beginning. A good radar detector is a far better choice.
i think that you can find them in some hardware seller or auto parts seller.
From HP website: 4.53 x 2.5 x 1.38 inch. Weight: 0.25 lb.
I am not sure. I also purchased one a while back, supposedly one that would work and I had no trouble at all with it. I would give it a try. Good luck.
It should just plug in and install automatically. When it does, you will see a bluetooth icon in the system tray, to which you can right click and add a device. Put your device you want to pair in paring mode and it should detect it automatically.
Your investment being a tablet or laptop, maybe not. It's got some padding inside, but not enough all around. What you could do is drop your device into a sleeve and then pack that into this messenger bag. The handle/strap is very sturdy. My kid carries at least 10 to 12 pounds in it daily. He has also used it to lug his Xbox system back and forth to visit family.
It'll depend on the size of the folders and notebooks. If they are just flimsy ones then yes but it will be a little poofy. If They are accordion folders and 200 page notebooks then you'll have some difficulty, and for the iPod and stuff there is a pocket in the front that can hold it or if you want a safer approach of robbery then there is a small but spacey pocket on the inside.
Almost 53 inches including the clasps. Hope that helps
I don't know the max length, but I'm a large man too - over 250 pounds - and there is plenty of length on this strap.
I believe you have to purchase a add on to activate the temperature feature.
There was 1 reader for the approx $87.00 purchase price.
Hello Adly. Thank you for contacting us here at Fulcrum Biometrics and would be happy to assist you. Yes, we ship worldwide including UAE. How many units are you looking for and do you already have software to use this device? We look forward to hearing from you. Thank you
I have a Canon XS which is 58mm. I had a 62mm hood so I purchased a 58 to 62mm adapter. I am not familiar with a SX50.
yes it is
Yes, the HVLF20AM will work with the A100. - Glenn
Any A-mount :)
Hi liz, filter diameter for this Sony SAL50F18 is 49 mm. You may check on any 3rd party lens hood that has 49 mm in filter size. -Ely
I'm sorry I don't know the answer to that question. I have a 18 to 55 mm and a 18 to 135 mm Sony which are great lenses. I just don't have any experience with a alpha a300. A call to their local distributor or the Sony website should get that information for you. John F
Hi jesshik_ee, Lens model SAL18552 can be attached on your camera but with the use of Sony LA-EA lens adapter. Vincent
This lens is an "A" mount and you need to use an "E" mount with the Nex.
It comes with several different sized screws, there should be some that fit.
Not sure what the question is here.
No
Oh yeah....... if ya got 300 watts per speaker... RMS I'm not sure. But they sound good, look good and are great for the money! I've bought much more expensive but these guys...... I can't tell a difference! Yeah, they kick ass!
I was able to do this successfully with my Logitech Harmony 650.
Yes, this requires AC Power.
Yes, these are rechargeable. I use the battery charger that came with the camera. It is a Lumix, Panasonic DE-A65 Battery Charger.
Is that a question or a statement? How does it relate to this product?
Oh yeah, mine is 50 inches and is just fine. Mine is also a Samsung
I don't know but it worked when I changed from Panasonic to LG
sure, it works on any physical thing that is water-resistant, pretty much. It just causes superficially attached small particles to be shaken loose by sound waves
Cleaned all my watches and my wifes watches. Just make sure the watch is waterproof.
These tweeters require a 1 13/16" mounting hole, with approximately an inch of space behind the panel. Simply because they are made by Infinity does not mean these can be readily swapped with factory-equipped Infinity systems. In fact, the factory-equipped Infinity speakers were awful in quality... I'm surprised Inifinty licensed its name for some of these OEM systems. At any rate, go by the speaker size of your sub to know what can be substituted, not brand name.
Check out Rode mics.
yes it is....
The jack is straight.
This pair does not. It has a volume control instead. The ones that do, say "with mic" somewhere in the title or description.
Yes. I think they would work fine for this. I bought them for bicycle communication and they didn't work for that all all. Too much street and wind noise. But in a building they should be fine. They worked well in my home and even outside. Just not for the use I bought them for. t
I doubt the batteries were guaranteed. Aren't they just watch batteries?
I'm not sure how many feet the range is I do know I walked 6 blocks away and talked to my grandson in the house. We also used them on a cruise and had not problem with the distance.
I don't believe it will fit in the cradle but you can blue tooth stream to it if you get that option. Fantastic radio.
The 2502d4 is a 10" speaker with dual 4ohm voice coils. The 3002d2 is a 12" speaker with dual 2 ohm coils.
Hi Patrick. I never really tried. I live a simple life. Good luck with your quest. Phil
it cannot be hooked up too a computer sorry.
The Owner's manual is available at Denon's site. You may wish to check it out.
Hey Balaji did you get an answer I'm shopping the same recievers and I'm stuck between the two I hear the onkyo runs super hot maybe the 707 is more comparable, anyway I'm leaning towards the denon 1910 Jeff Helmlinger
You need a Blu-Ray player
The 5.8" is without the plastic feet; the 6.7" is total height including the feet.
I purchased my replacement remote for my N2QAYB000321 remote. What's pictured matched my remote that came from Amazon and the number matched on the back of the replacement remote. The TV recognized the signal with no problem.
This mouse is laser tracking, it may need a mousepad if the surface is too much mixed jump colors.
The mouse requires two double AA batteries. It has a wonderful battery life. I have not had to change the batteries out since I purchased it and i bet it can go on for a good portion of the rest of this year. It comes with two batteries in the box. REMEMBER TO TURN OFF THE MOUSE WHEN NOT IN USE!!! There is a switch on the back for turning it on and off, allowing for an increased battery life. I only recommend this for laptops and tablets.
This is a very stable and well made keyboard.
Yes, as long as you have a HDMI or VGA Cable.
yes, you can hook it up to your computer using a vga cable
yes at the bottom of picture on the left.
No it doesn't
It seems to be Am\Pm
Because you turned on "num-lock" with the external keyboard and it reassigned your laptop's keys to their num-lock equivalent. Turn off num-lock either on the external keyboard or by pressing the appropriate function key on your laptop.
No, this does not include a camera. My suggestion is not to waste your money on this product - see my review for details
Yes in stock, thanks!
Go to their website support page: http://www.omnimount.com/support/ Select the "All Products" category, and then select the Modena 47FP in the right side panel. Download the Sales Sheet. It has all the dimensions.
we used our to hook up our Wii
In total honesty, the ZEN is good, The ZEN MX is junk, it has so many problems that it's not worth the money. Do not buy it without doing as much research as you can. Be well.
There are no laptop LED displays at this time, its an LCD. *TruBrite TFT active-matrix LCD*
I have used a Targus USB Bluetooth adapter in my laptop to print to my HP C6180 for years. Flawless!
Asus EEE PC 1005HA-V. there are a few versions of the 1005HA. the V is matte. best Danny
it depends on the network. N networks are so far the fastest, but in all reality, i HIGHLY doubt anybody can tell which is faster considering we are limited on our bandwidth anyways. im in the netbook market now as well and after my research i would go with the toshiba nb205 due to the keyboard. BUT i am now leaning towards the 11.6 to 12.1 inchers. not only bigger keyboards but also bigger screens and STILL extremely portable with long battery life.
sorry.. the NB205 does not have lighted keyboard.. You probably don't need lights as I found the typing is very comfortable and efficient..thus unlikely to get any typos/errors.. that's my own experience..
This device will convert any audio generated on computer to remote receiver through USB.
Asus EEE PC 1005HA-V. there are a few versions of the 1005HA. the V is matte. best Danny
The black version has a traditional non-chiclet-style keyboard. The chiclet keyboard's key's are a little smaller but there is more space between them (about the same as on a standard laptop keyboard), while the black version's keys are much closer together.
I currently have a Toshiba NB205-230 and the keys feel good, soft, and very quiet. My only complaint with the one a bought is Win7starter, but that is easily fixed. Even for what I used it for, which was long distance communication and holding data it was a great help to me.
I would contact the company directly. In my experience, their customer service is excellent- they replaced faulty batteries in the unit I purchased via Amazon, not directly from them, free of charge.
Good Morning, In a quick check of D620 power requirements(19.5vdc@4.62a), I would say that you should not use this charger. It is rated at only 65w vise the 90w requirement for the computer. Would look for another charger that has the correct rating. Best luck Andy
This pair does not. It has a volume control instead. The ones that do, say "with mic" somewhere in the title or description.
I've run around on the treadmill with these and haven't had a problem, other than obviously getting a little sweaty. Yoga, totally. Running, as long as you you're not doing really high impact. Weight lifting, no problem. They seem to hold into your head pretty well as long as it isn't something too impacting.
The cabling will depend on the hard disks you place in the bracket. The bracket itself mounts in place of a floppy disk or other small hdd in your desktop pc.
it should fit any 2.5in drive. Its a universal adapter to allow for proper mounting in 3.5in drive bays.
definitely not. unless you Mac Pro uses cables to connect the HD. most don't. you need one that can slide in, meaning mounts the SSD in the right place.
Thanks for asking&#55357;&#56833;... Yeah it will work and the picture is very good,but the auto focus is not good at all
Yes it will, it will work with any canon fit lenses.
It's a single DIMM of 2GB
Go to this link, http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/ It should tell you what type of memory you need.
Yes it does
75 watts rms. These are 2 ohm speakers. They sounded rather tinny at first, quite dissapointing. After a few months they mellowed out, and sound great.
As stated, they're 6.5". Check Crutchfield's, and Amazon sites. There is a section that you can put in your car type and they'll tell you if they fit.
There are input jacks for 1/4" and 1/8" microphones and an input for XLR microphone as well as the wireless. Mic Input #1 & #2 & Wireless all with separate gain control.
This unit consists of wired speakers, amp/mixer. No wireless feature included. You can connect a wireless system which conisists of a receiver (to be hooked to the mixer via its own cable; connexions provided for this are XLR, 1/4", and RCA), and a transmitter (ususally the wireless mic).
I relatively sure it is zero. In fact, I'm positive. Most all privacy filters I have encountered are very low on RAM; it's difficult to fit RAM on a 2mm piece of film. It does however have very nice polarization and a shiny gold surface, if you choose that side. I rated this filter very high, but now I am having buyers remorse thinking I should probably have bought one with more RAM.
Yes, you can use either side glossy or matte. I myself like glossy :) well worth money and your privacy in long run.
When I bought mine a few years ago, it did not come with one. I believe that attachment was made by the user. I usually let mine hang free when I need to use the flash. The connection to the camera port is pretty stout.
The unit has one infrared LED that is switched separately from the scope itself. That is the thing on top of the scope in the picture. It adds a bit of illumination when there is insufficient ambient light for the scope to work properly. It is only marginally effective, but it does help some out to about 60 to 70 feet.
I don't know anything about the model numbers, but the Y-USB adapter is for older computers that don't output enough juice to power the drive. If you have a newer PC or Mac, you don't need it.
I dont suffet from tinnitus, but the dialoge is far more clear for me with this product. I hope you find that to be true also.
This is a very streamlined product but only the user can determine if it is too heavy or loose for their comfort.
Simple answer... Yes.
They'll work great for front and rears. I personally wouldn't use them on the center channel. The center channel is your primary channel for tv and movies and would need to be more rigorous. Theater Solutions also makes a center channel speaker.
Wall cutout size is 7.125 inch X 10.5 inch. It is 2.75" deep into the wall too. It comes with a template.
It is designed for hang on to the drywall so it is ok without the 2x4. but u can if u don't feel safe.
No need for a subwoofer. I run mine through a sony receiver and I get good sound.
XLR cable male to female
The only cord supplied is the iec mains lead.
I haven't tried that, but I connect an external hard dive to a server with it and it's just like a USB on board. My only caveat would be that it sometimes disconnects if I let it hooked up for a long time. Might not be an issue if it's something like a mouse or pen device since you use it throughout the day.
I don't know that answer, but... for windows (7-64 in my case) they load a service that monitors the USB port and chews up so much CPU overhead that I ended up removing the device and giving up on it. So that will be something else to watch out for.
No, they use a physically different mounting. There are Teleconverters on the used market that fit FD lenses, do a search on Amazon and ebay for one. If you are hoping to make a FD lens work with a EF mount, there are good converters from Ed Micka, but they are hand made and expensive. The commonly available ones degrade the image. Canon made a FD-EOS converter, they are scarce and price is out of this world.
This amp has no video inputs, just analog or digital audio.
A late response but thought I'd chime in. The up-conversion can help with standard def satellite but little difference with HD channels. One of the best benefits of systems offering up-conversion besides better picture quality is that it will take the non-HDMI inputs and send them out the HDMI output. It is very awkward running audio from a device to the receiver and the video to the TV and having to switch inputs on the receiver and the TV.
Order directly from Apple's website. There you can fully choose what options you want.
I would highly recommend the MacBook Pro. As opposed to the newer version. in the event you have problems with this unit. you can, always reachout to Apple for replacement parts, and so forth. However the new the MacBook Pro with, retina display does not offer you that option. Instead you have to replace the whole Laptop:( Moreover you can do some amazing things with the older model. Hope I was able to help. -Essie
yes
Yup
The 5200 requires a separate audio connection - it doesn't pick audio off the hdmi pass-thru. That means an extra optical or coax cable - and neither of those pass 7.1. So you've got a 7.1 receiver with no way to get 7.1 audio into it!
NO. It is set up for a 1 12" threaded pipe. You would have to make some sort of adapter.
Yes, it will fit. It will also fit the new K-5 II and K-5 IIs.
You should be able to. This lens is a micro 4/3 mount and will fit any camera of that format.
It's a prime lens and a faster lens. It also comes with the view finder, which sold separately, is retailing for $100.
Probably not. 6x9's are usually back speakers. Either way go to the crutchfield website and they can tell you what size speakers you have.
It does! I bought it to take to India in October of this year and it worked better than the other adapters I brought with me to charge my iPhone and iPad. Well worth the price.
Unfortunately I had so many problems with it that I gave up on it and threw it away. I wish I had commented on it sooner but I actually forgot all about it. I hope you have better luck with it than I did.
They are mid level speakers. I think with that system I would use components. I had a 12 Fusion Sport with that system and it was excellent ..I put these on 08 F150 as a door upgrade and dont think they would handle your system.
No you have to get an adapter for what ever car you are putting them into. Make sure you measure your stock speakers to see if they will fit. I had to twik the speaker holes to have them fit
yes...it has two "digital audio outs" one is coaxial, the other is optical...of course you'll need a stereo receiver that will convert the signal to 5:1 audio, but you can do it with the DV-420...one thing I'd like to mention is the video quality from this player is terrible...I've played with all the settings, tried different HDMI cables, and had no success in making the picture quality to my liking...I wish that I had returned this unit...my advice, spend some extra money and buy a Sony...
I'm not positive. My iPhone 4 fit in perfectly and snugly. But if the dimensions are identical I would think so.
Yes, it's non capacitive as well.
We do not have any shelf that can be attached to the ceiling mount.
Yes, I think it would be fine. Its made of painted steel which should be OK in a sheltered outdoor setting. I might buy some stainless steel bolts to use instead of the supplied zinc coated bolts though.
I'm sorry, I don't know what the Asus Chromebox is? I looked at the item and it says it is a male DVI connector. I am not that familiar with the display port portion of the equation, but the specs say it is a DVI connector. If you scroll down the page a little more from the basic product information, it gives you the specs of the cable.
Dear Sir, The installed 92mm fan is held in place by (4) long standard X style screws. You can replace the current fan with any 92mm x 25mm fan. The fan controller is a completely separate item and can be used on a different fan, if you wish.
Passive
Absolutely
Well mine lasted less then a year I wouldn't get this item again myself
I ordered this battery for a Compaq CQ 30. Works well still.. AGPtek has many batteries listed, I am sure they have one for your laptop. The one that fit mine may fit yours, but it's best to look for the listings for your computer..I see there are many listed.
To my understanding it's 25W. Mine was bought 2nd hand and runs a pair of 100 W 6 Ohm bookshelf speakers just fine, add an active sub if needed. There's plenty of settings and EQ to get you satisfied. One major surprise i had was, that you must have have a TV connected for both setup and use.
Its about 4 inches long. You attach one of the ends to your regular headphones.
5.3oz
Yes u can
Yes
I've not had a problem with blurring due to vibration when using my lens and besides because of the nature of the beast lenses with that short of a focal length don't really require a Vibration Reduction feature because they are used for indoor shots or landscapes when you would most likely be be using a support of some type.
Yes it will - the "HSM" stands for Hyper Sonic Motor - which means it has the built-in motor necessary to autofocus on ALL Nikon bodies. :)
Yes, I have the same netbook and this keyboard works perfectly. The OS does not matter.
I am using this with an AT&T 2 line landline model 993 telephone. I don't know if this would work with an NC-185 analog headset. The headset I am using it with is the Plantronics Audio 326 model.
You've probably already purchased a hard drive of some type by now, but the Hitachi 1 TB Deskstar HD31000 IDK/7K is a standard size 3.5 internal hard drive. It should fit in any PC.
Don't know about the HD429, but you might think about getting headphones with more treble response than the HD428 for use in transcribing. Depends on the tonal balance of your audio source. I know our VOIP phones at work chop off the top end of the audio.
It has HDMI. UNFORTUNATELY, depending on how you configure it, you either get mandatory sharpening (with fringe artifacts), or brightness all screwed up. It's impossible to connect it to a PC and have proper brightness with sharpening disabled.
This Mini-DisplayPort DVI adapter will NOT work with a DVI-VGA adapter. You need a separate adapter for that. I test it myself because I needed it for setting up a presentation and it did not work.
It works on the Macbook late 2008 model.
13"
The answer is no if you expect to get a dial tone by just adding the adapter to an Ethernet cable from a switch. This adapter kit lets you use a single Ethernet cable like Cat5e to establish an Ethernet connection and phone line connection, but You need to have telephone service first.
There are two. It worked well.
The battery is junk will not last 5 min
No it't not the same battery. The high capacity/extended life battery is larger bulbouse looking cell. CB
I don't use an iPhone adapter but a flexible one that fits my iPhone. I think it is called a jellyfish adapter. Anyway it has a standard tripod screw in adapter on it, so if your iPhone adapter has that screw connector in it it will work.
I've read that others have experienced this (not only on this model). Contact Garmin. They either need (or will have) a firmware update or you should be entitled to a new unit (Garmin usually pawns off reconditioned units to their customers that want an exchange).
Cherie, This device has special features like traffic, weather, news, movie times, stock prices, etc... Those services are provided via MSN and when MSN stops their service in 2012 those features will no longer work. However, all of the GPS functionality is independent of MSN and will still work just fine.
It's a discontinued model by Garmin. You get more bang for the buck when buying this model. I just updated it to the latest 2010 maps and operating system.
Hello, yes, you can mount this as you wish too. The manufacturer suggests mounting the 2.24" side against a wall vertically, however if you mount the 2.24" side horizontally it will work as well.
No you can't record at all this is a professional playback machine only. If you need to record you will need to look at a CD-RW900 designed for record and playback it will cost slightly more. I should also mention if you are recording an acoustic piano you will need a small mixer and a set of mics as well otherwise you should be able to use the outs from the keyboard and send those to the recorder but a small mixer setup is best in my opin.
Yes I can be replaced. Though it has a twist lock mechanism so I don't know if you could find a satisfactory third party replacement.
Very uncomfortable. The headband hurts because the cushion is too thin. I can feel the two plastic bars behind the cushioning. I bought some headband cushions from Sennheiser and attached them to the Shure 440 with some zip ties. The ear pads are terrible as well due to the lack of cushioning. I would recommend buying the SRH840 ear pads which fit on the Shure 440 headphones.
They do not fold and they do not have a volume control.
Yes. It's pretty universal among Toshiba Satellites.
Yeah it has a kind of textured rubber grip. It has a pretty good feel to it too.
no, it does not. It's also a little slow if you work on CAD programs.
The front is a plain, matte black and the inside pocket can fit either portrait or landscape. However, it's pre-folded to have the front flap cover your photo. It can stand on its own vertically in a portrait orientation for a tabletop, but in landscape the front cover will block the picture. If you need something to present a landscape picture on a tabletop, this won't do the job. I'm a photographer and I use these to have a nice cover for the photos that I print and sell at events.
Insert a 4x6 photo.... Frame is 5x7
your shipping cost will be discounted automatically.
Yes. The button on the left of the mouse can be configured for a number of things including the back function.
Yeah it has a kind of textured rubber grip. It has a pretty good feel to it too.
AA Size Battery
3x5
3000w is good for el cooking stove and Thermomix T21 will use not more than 1700w. is ok
Probably, just need to see what the wattage is on the fireplaces motor or motors combined. Is this a pellet stove? I know an 8000 btu air conditioner is about 950 watts.
6th ave is all sold out, I ordered it from amazon for $499.00 but the whole 1-2 months thing is starting to piss me off. I will most likely upgrade to the next model up and purchase it from another seller besides amazon. Got the link from my son that said ships within 24-48 hours, but with the holidays and all I didn't order until four days later, Oh well I know it my fault but still rather irritating.
I believe the "Pandora" label is a bit misleading. Although it makes it easy to mess with your Pandora account, if you have one, the radio is a stand-alone and will access any internet radio station. A Pandora account is not required.
It is really quiet this is the smalllest quietest inverter I've ever had. Oh and it doesn't run constantly.
Is this a question? Yes, it comes with the Power Adapter 90W 20V. Thanks.
Yes
They do work well when connected to a stereo receiver, but I do not know if they can be connected to a PC.
The unit has to be hard wired in with normal speaker wire. Simple to do. Have mine in herb garden we can listen outdoors. Looks natural and has been outside thru wind, rain, snow storm and whatever, still looks & sounds good.
Yes, that's the main reason I purchased the Kingston. Not that I hate LED's, but fans wear out. The fans in the Kingston can easily be replaced when necessary. I should note however, that I purchased this YEARS ago, and the original fans are STILL going strong despite the box being used as a server. These things have had no more than 10 minutes downtime in their life, and they're still relatively quiet. I DO hear them now, but they are not in need of replacement yet.
It has an audio plugin. And the lights are controlled by a little dimmer on the cord, which kinda sucks.
no it does not...
Pretty sure it should be fine
My D3100 fit with the kit lens and plenty of room to spare. The D3200 is almost identical in size, so I am sure it would fit well. I replaced mine with a Clik Elite Traveler and love the Clik. Might want to check it out. Just a suggestion. The Case Logic is fine though.
Most certainly. And if not, you can always remove the grip and place it into one of the pockets.
crap! no, the person selling them will mislead you as well because you only get half as many as there are
How to turn off parental controls?
Try to keep 4' between the antennas.
I have two TVs connected. Works Great
The case I purchased recently had two full layers of the pluck foam that filled the space. I was able to pull pieces of foam to customize it for my equipment. The removable foam pieces are approximately 1/2 inch square by 4 inches tall. There is about 1 inch of foam all the way around that is not pick'n'pluck foam. It has a separate piece of foam for the lid that has the egg carton shape like in the picture.
Not at all. I don't note any sound modification.
I've never tried to use mine that way but I see no reason why it shouldn't work.
No. The mount is for the Minolta A-type lenses/bodies.
i believe this is a manual only lens. change the aperture by turning the aperture dial on the lens itself.
Threaded but accept standard push on grommeted fittings as well
Yes. I got one for my portable setup and have used it with a model D12 standard def receiver.
Best to check that on your favorite search engine.
This LCH-NB-4L/8L battery charger is compatible with A.C. 100V - 240V 50/60Hz so you can use it in Europe. You just need the appropriate adapter to plug it in the AC socket where ever you are going.
My headphones broke (again) and I spoke with customer service and they said they ran out in all of their warehouses so they issued a refund. May still come with a warranty, not sure, but either way they are out of replacements and the headphones are almost guaranteed to break within a year.
The O-ring seal on the battery compartment is not designed for heavy immersion in water. According to the Garmin site: The Foretrex 301 is rated IPX7. --Withstands incidental exposure to water of up to 1 meter for up to 30 minutes. --Indoor/outdoor use in the presence of rain, snow or brief splashes of water. --The unit is not suited for any immersion of more than 1 meter, regardless of duration of immersion, or any immersion of more than 30 minutes, regardless of depth of immersion.
Yes
Yes, it's in the settings, you can also change the speed to KPH
It will measure your horizontal speed, yes it will tell you your maximum speed
This is a format for audio. If you google the term you will get a good explanation of it.
This is a measure of digital sound levels that charts are available for, different dba numbers will indicate what dba sounds levels are acceptable in different areas. The living room. the bedroom etc.
NO, save yourself the trouble and get yourself a Logitech webcam which has 100x the voice quality as well as a camera to boot. I recommend the Logitech C170 for only $10 + Free Shipping on Ebay: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Logitech-C170-Universal-USB-Webcam-Camera-PC-MAC-5MP-960-000880-/351070050805?pt=PCA_Video_Conferencing_Webcams&hash=item51bd67d9f5
I believe so, the majority of the windshield mounts are universal.
Yes it worked with mine. Great quality!
Yes it does
No. The burner will only accept SD cards recorded on a Sony Handycam. This is not mentioned in the advertising. It is buried under troubleshooting in the manual.
yes, but thru usb , there is a tiny lag for videos.
Yes this right one. I am using in right now
It's a real d-link jta0302b with 5v 2.5a.
As long as it has the standard tripod screw it'll work. And, honestly, you'd be hard pressed to find a camera without tripod mounting threads.
It does! I have a Kodak Z990 myself and there's no issue with compatibility. HOWEVER - you have to be pointing it directly at the sensor. If the person using the remote is going to be in the picture, it is nearly impossible to keep the remote hidden in the picture and still have it work.
No, this is USB and you can charge iPad or iPhone with the cable.
as long as it has a plug in or the port for it to plug in
Sorry, I'm not familiar with any of this.
That would depend on your intended application for the device. Personally I found the "Belkin Conserve Socket with Energy Saving Outlet" better suited to my needs. (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003P2UMQ2/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
You have to install the CD. It didn't work for me without the CD.
No it does not to the best of my knowledge but I do not have speakers on my second monitor.
It should be fine as long as you use the manufacturer drivers. the edition of Windows XP you're using doesn't really matter beyond the fact that you have service pack 3 which is the best you can have. Not sure what adapter you used before, but it would be strange indeed if it cared about so minor a detail as the edition of windows xp you're using.
Yes I believe so!
It isn't battery operated, you'll have to plug it in.
I don't think there is an advantage, and I think they are only without grill for the looks. I've had these for some months now and I haven't had a problem with dustiness. The only real issue with going sans grill is the possibility of like accidentally poking them and messing them up or something, but personal experience and reviews say that these things are tough and can handle themselves. Happy shopping!
I would think that amp would work fine. It's on the lower end for power output, but not much below the hybrid tube amp I use....and they sound great for me. The speakers are rated for amps with output between 10 watts, and 125 watts.
Yes
i don't think so
Thanks for your question. You will need a receiver for these. It is a wonderful sounding speaker system.
Unfortunately, it does not accept 240V; only 120V. Nevertheless, if you are really interested in the product, buy a voltaje converter along with it. The "Simran SMF-200 Deluxe 200 Watts Step Down Voltage Converter for International Travel to AC 220V/240V Countries" worked just fine for me in a trip to Europe several years ago.
If your TV has an RCA 2-channel jack (RED and WHITE) then you can use an RCA red and white 2-channel cable (NOT included with the Z323) for the hook up. A five year old TV may not have the RCA jack.
Yes. This is due to the charge rate of the charger. Any batteries used will get hot. This is not a healthy practice because it reduces the life of the batteries. However I knew this when I did the purchase. I really wanted the DC charge option. I use a cheap Sanyo one at home. So I only use this charger if I am on the road or in a hurry at home. La Crosse has great chargers BUT you got to pay the extra dollar for them.
I'm so sorry - I have no idea. I know this works for 200 amp service - but me saying that just shows that I'm not an electrician. :(
The cord is a little over 5' long.
It should work fine.
Yes
The TrendNet 300 provides wifi N for all my devices (tablets, phones, laptops) when I have used it no problem. I don't have a Nexus 7, but I don't see why it would be a problem. Wifi is Wifi as far as I know.
You can take the cover off and check to see if there is a fuse inside that it may have blown. I would think it would take out the fuse before it burned up the unit.
Yes, it does. Black, with Velcro covered ports for power.
I have 4s and just tried it again. Paired on second try using 0000. Make sure you have ST in pairing mode.
My wife has the Iphone 5 and it works with it.
Yes it will
Yes. LGA 1150 socket chips have the same architecture for cooling options as LGA 1155.
Yes you can punch in Coordinates to find your requested location.
The one I have does.
These speakers are power hungry, I would not recommend running them without an amp, I fear you would be disappointed. The also sound a lot better in a sealed box. I had them mounted in my electra glide, and since the speakers are not air tight they did not sound nearly as impressive as in my boat in a sealed box.
I have had no trouble with this keyboard and using Windows 8. I love the quality of the product as well as the design.
I've used the keyboard only with a Dell PC, so I'm afraid I can't answer your question. The one recurring problem with the keyboard is that the letters eventually rub off. I'm on my third Dell SK-8135 keyboard, and it's happening again. Otherwise, it's the best keyboard I've had.
I have a standard TV antenna on mine and it has handled all the weather SW Florida can throw at it. No problems with it over the past 5+ years! I get great free HD TV.
I think its designed more for a horizontal or slight slope than a vertical mount. Try some chimney strap mounts. my .02, good luck.
Having used a tablet and a UMPC before I can safely say yes. A touch works just like a left click on "normal" apps like excel. Since this device uses a touch screen you can't really hover the mouse pointer over things but everything else works like you'd think.
10' x 13'
Dear Christine, The Travel Battery Charger works great for the EN-EL12 battery
They are 4 ohm
no drainage on the CPU at all. It is an USB device but you are not using it to send/receive data you are only sending and the box is a converter. So you will be good to go.
no
Yes they fit comfortable over the ear. The bow on the glasses does not interfere with its ability to stay on the ear. I wear them while cylcing and have not issues with them falling off. I highly recommend them
Yes, my mum is using it with Time Warner. Follow the instructions to find the code - it was a bit of a challenge, then remember to hit the "ADD" button once you have both the TV and the cable box figured out. It has been working perfectly for the last few months. Make sure you keep the old cable remote out of the hands of the user.
Not sure. I think the r had the remote control and the N doesn't?
No idea. never tried this.
Yes, but you need some other hotshoes and a gadget to hold them inside. I used up to my three SB800.
Setup was super quick and easy! There should be a detailed instruction manual in the packaging if/when you receive it. The microphone itself is extremely light! Just a heads up though, my friends and I originally bought this for a fan film we were working on, but soon learned it is *NOT* meant for DSLR Cameras (We were using a Nikon D90). It does, however, work when we plug it into our laptop, and the sound difference is amazing. I hope this helps!
I dont know if you have a mic input on the Ipad? If you do then yes, If not check if they sell an adaptor that you can plug in a mini plug.
The unit comes with Audacity shareware/software but will work with most audio software. You can manipulate the files as wave, mp3 or as needed for your purpose. Save to file then load into whatever you require.
Yes it can, we have hit hooked up to a sony soundbar and it works nicely.
You can hook it up to powered computer speakers or to a stereo receiver. It should come with the appropriate adaptor cables.
No, it hasn't . The only switchers it has is a phone/ line and a speed selector of rpm. I bought a voltage transformer and everything worked greate, i don't think that you could have any trouble with it
yes, you can use a tipod whit this camera, have a universal hole screw
Here is one: http://images10.newegg.com/User-Manual/User_Manual_30-144-245.pdf
Works very well and picks up channels . However, 4.3 inches might be too small so I would go with at least 7 inches minnimum.
I do not believe that this will work for your 5g iPod. The remote works great but the receiver plugs into the charging port and I believe that your iPod hase the newer lightning connector. This remote is for the older 30 pin style connector.
Not sure if it is advertised as waterproof. I have had it for a few years now and don't ride much in the rain. Never had any issues with it though. I would also leave on my bike if it were raining. Probably wouldn't use it for underwater activities though. Hope this helps you in your decision.
Hardly think so, maybe with fasters lenses, but I don't think with those ones, in my d7000 can only get good focus with the 50mm 1.8
It should. All Nikon bodies have been using the same F-mount since 1959. It also has CPU prongs that will transmit exposure information from the lens to the body. However, I would not use this on a D90. I just tried it on my D70 and it will not auto-focus. Other discussion forums also note that the D90 has a very hard time focusing with this attached. I had to switch to manual focus and focus by sight because the in-camera indicator was not accurate enough.
mmmm, it will try...but given the fact that it multilies the f by two...i dont think it would be really precise for focusing...
This teleconverter is compatible with the Nikon D50. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact our sales department at 800-991-3350 EST. We thank you for your time and consideration!
Draws about 5 watts - not very wasteful
yes
From the product description (you decide if will work): Product Description Quality Sound For Web Chats, Voice Recognition, Dictation Or Interactive Gaming ; Clear Stereo Sound For Any Music Type; In-Line Volume Control; Microphone Rotates Up & Out Of The Way; Earcups Swivel; Compatible With All Brands Of Computers, Audio Devices With A 3.5Mm Jack
Depends on who you buy it from
This is not a DSLR (or digital single lease refraction) camera, it takes film. It is a regular SLR camera. That means it retracts through the lense to the film exposure location and through the eyepiece. There is no screen to display what the picture will look like.
Yea as long as you are able to "pair" the speakers to a blue tooth device and if it is a Bluetooth speaker you should be able to.
http://www.mitsubishi-tv.com/ I have changed many of these and the best is actually from Mitsubishi itself. It's about $100 but worth it. There are other sites that sell them that are less expensive. The following link has some that are cheaper. Good luck. http://www.electrified.com/default.aspx
Yes, but no photos in color. Only black and white
I do not know about the graphics card,because we do not have this PC any more.
Samsung BD-E6500 3D WiFi Blu-ray Disc Player
Yes.
I don't know, I gave it as a gift!
I would think it would. I was using mine for recording my outdoor program and we had pretty good success. One time, the camera microphone acted up while we were on the lake in my bass boat and we positioned the Audio-Technica ATR-3350 Lavalier mic to finish up the segment. My boat is almost 20 foot long and the camera was in the read of the boat. EVERY word I said was heard crystal clear with GREAT sound quality.
No you hd
I suppose it could, but the mounting is designed specifically for an HP monitor that doesn't already have speakers. I would guess that the built-in speakers on the TV would be just as good.
And very little is said about speed of focus etc.; no high speed/sports mode . . . how fast can this take a picture compared say to the Sony HX1?
Yes, with a standard VESA bracket.
Hey, I don't have the same problem after connecting to a computer. But when I'm in review mode and delete a photo/video and turn off the camera directly without going back to camera mode, I've noticed that the screen stays on, but black and none of the buttons, not even power, will work. You just have to simply remove the front cover, take out the battery and put it back in. I've had to do this 3 times thus far and it's not a consistently occurring problem, but the solution works every time.
I don't know. I am using it for Nano.
I'm not sure what the question exactly is but if you're asking if you can still use the touchscreen on the phone then the answer is yes. However, be aware that the phone needs to be repositioned often.
It will not be held with the stand but it uses the 3.55 mm jack... so it will work with any device that has a 3.55 mm jack.
Yes (my lumix FP8 which is 2.4 x 3.8 x .8 fits, and looks like the S3300 is 2.3 x 3.7 x .8). It's snug, but it does fit.
Yes it does!!
I, belive its the size of the power supply not the box how ever best ask the seller to clarify.
Hello - It is 12 x 8 by .4 inches
Yes it will. Just remember, you may have to go to sound settings and change from internal speakers to your external device. Very happy with mine.
You will also need an HDMI cable from the display port to your TV (or monitor). Hope this helps!
No
I just received it. It is V4. (brannon is wrong)
Great product, It's so good I purchased 3 It works perfectly with Chromebook and any PC Plug and play, no installation of drivers required
The Duet tunes in over the air digital TV broadcasts. It supposedly also tunes in the Clear QAM free cable channels but I don't have cable in order to verify that. I have never heard of Gol TV so I can't help you with that. If that is an over the air digital TV broadcast then you should be able to get it. If it is some sort of pay TV package or system then I doubt you can get it. It's probably best to contact Gol TV and see what are their requirements.
No. They will not interfere with each other. The receiver is paired with the individual mouse. It's kind of like if you have two of the same car parked next to each other, and you hit the button to unlock the door, the remote will only open the one it's programmed to open.
The Klipsch packaging labeled it a 5. I've had it for 2 years and it is the best system I have found anywhere near this price.
I don't think they were meant for it, but I do know there is speaker wire that goes into a 3.5mm that the klipsch pro series uses, i don't know if you could use that to plug right in or not, and that would depend on how many connections your computer has
No
No it would need a wireless kit. $60 at best buy easy peasy to install took less than 10 minutes to hook up
Yes but you would need a 3.5mm splitter that both plug into then it has the one for the PC or whatever your using it for
No, there is no bass control. There is only one volume control on the speakers.
I purchased it a very long time ago so I don't remember but I'm sure you can just call and find out...sorry.
I think their policy is that you can because I did. As long as you do it within 30 days, you should be fine.
Through square trade I believe you can insure anything as long as you have a receipt. But it is best to check with square trade to be sure.
I ended up buying my product from Target after I couldn't get the one from amazon....it was covered!
It is supposed to cover anything. I was assured if I accidently dropped it in the ocean it was covered but you can e-mail them and ask anything. They were quick to answer during business hours.
sorry I have no clue on that one... I have not had time to even finish the whatever it is to get it... have a son that just got home from hospital and has to have in-home therapy... have not had the time to even finish getting programs on the computer.... life has put me on hold for a while....sorry I couldn't help you.
Yes. I purchased a refurbished notebook and square trade 3 covers it up to purchase price of the refurb, not the original price of the computer. Hope this helps.
In their terms, they state they can decide whether to repair it, replace it, or reimburse you to purchase price of the item. Also, they are not responsible for data loss, time loss etc. I think their policy is as fair as you can reasonably expect.
Yes. Recently purchased a laptop and added the warranty.
Square trade has always been totally awesome in customer service. You would need to have it delivered to where square trade can service it and then have a way to have it returned to you. That will be the only trick.
Hi and GOD Bless you. Accorsing to what I've read, it will in case if accident, not negligence.
mine is no deductable and its the accidental coverage so just about everything is covered
I purchased this warranty for my Surface Pro 3. They also told me over the phone it will also cover the "type pro" keyboard that goes with it, because they are both kinda necessary to use the product correctly. Just take a few minutes to register your product on their website after you get an email from them (just need the model and serial number of the item) Any other accessories like audio devices or the docking station would not be covered.
Don't know maybe that's the reason why it didn't worked when the technician try to instaled it!!
Works great for mine ;)
Yes. You can play any Original Xbox Games that are compatible with the Xbox 360. This is the best list of compatible games I could find: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Xbox_games_compatible_with_Xbox_360. Have fun.
The Inspiron n4110 has the standard CD/DVD player/recorded so yes, this replacement will work with it.
It will. It has a good range of sizes that it can fit. This is a very good headset for the price, but the only problem is that the size adjuster is a weak point. I was rough with mine and it broke, but if you are careful with it it shouldn't be a problem.
This headset also gets heavy after a while. One workaround that I have found is to wear a ski cap and then put the headset on. It doesn't slip and you don't get the pressure on your ears.
The wires are probably gone bad. Or broke a bit try adjusting. Or could be feed back from your environment. The microphone is sensitive
It works with iPods that have 30 pin cord , it won't work with new lightning . It might if u get an adapter but not sure . I use it on trips and works great
Yes. The cable does not come with the speaker though
It has a 30-pin connector so the only way to use an iPhone 5 would be to have a 30-pin to lighting adapter or use the aux input (like plugging earphones)
not that I can tell, and certainly not one on the remote.
No this is for android not for apple
Yes, it has 4 screws. I hope this help you.
It's AVCHD so when you do post production you would output in either NTSC or PAL depending on which you want.
Yes, it comes with an adapter that plugs into the camera. The other end of the adapter plugs into the battery charger and the battery charger plugs into the wall. It's more complicated than it needs to be, but the answer is "Yes", you can power the camera from the wall.
Wow Dorothy that's terrible! Not certain if you intended to ask a question as you did or leave a comment. This unit has worked perfectly for me.
I have the Harmony One remote and the only difference is it's IR and yours is RF. (infared and Radio freqency) It controls everything on my Directv DVR, Sony DVD, and Onkyo sound system. I love it. I would purchase the Harmony one if I were you for 140 bucks and invest $63 in an IR to RF converter like mine. Here is a link to the one I bought. You've saved yourself 80 dollars and you don't have to worry about the apparent distance problem. Hope this helps http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q3AKDI
Yes, I have a Sony Bravia LCD TV and a Sony Blu-Ray player - all controls work perfectly, they are programmed into the Harmony setup software and website. I used to have a Sony amplifier until I upgraded, but the Harmony remote had all functions auto programmed into it as well. Plus, if you have something that is not in the Harmony database, the remote can learn commands from other remotes. BUT, since you have Sony products, I'm pretty sure ALL Sony products are pre-configured in the Harmony setup software/website.
Currently out of stock in all other colours. As new cases come in stock, these will be added to the selection. Kind regards
No Arnold, thats impossible.
Yes this product is window 8 compatible, and you should only need to do is plug it into the usb port on your computer using both usbs, and once the computer install the drive just put in the disk and finish the installation.
Not sure, I have not tried it yet. Sorry!
No.
If it is Bluetooth, it will work with it. Great product!
3 prong
Yes.
actually quite a lot with the GF1 ! I upgraded to GX1 which has a smaller battery and then I stared to notice that GF1 had great battery power... You can always get a non brand battery for great price!
There is a new one. http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-H-H020AK-Olympus-Thirds-Cameras/dp/B00DJS830Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1408767654&sr=8-1&keywords=lumix+20mm New version says "A new metal finish replaces the original 20mm lenses resin body, and combines with a durable metal mount for a sophisticated premium feel." other than that the only difference is the new one is now cheaper.
no It needs to slide into a hotshoe. The GF3 does not have a top mounted (or otherwise) hot shoe.
Just the usual stuff! Manuals, charging cable, and wall charger. No card or cover is included. The unit is brand new.
1. It's a SONY. 2. To justify #1, proprietary card and cable. Of course battery too, but no one complains because every manufacturer sets $ traps there. 3. The "opinion leaders" in the circle are drugged by the Canon Kool-Aid although Canon is loosing market share left and right.
i am interested in purchasing a sony mp3 16gb #s545 walkman. can this mp3 download podcasts?
I don't know - this unit stopped working last year. It was my son's and we found the volume was just automatically go from whatever setting to zero after about 30 seconds of playing. And you couldn't get the volume to change unless you powered it off & on again. BTW, he just got a iPod Touch 5th gen - and he loves it.
It does not have Bluetooth but it does have internal speakers
Yes we can arrange to ship internationally, please keep in mind that all international shipments require additional shipping charges.
you can check this out. http://www.inon.co.jp/cgis/news/En_html/WebNews218_En.htm
No Sir, Madam, it only works with apple ( Macintosh ) Mac only, windows doesn't recognize it.
No, you can't control the iPod/iPhone from the speaker.
I don't know, but do NOT buy this item! Mine stopped working the third time I tried to use it and the conpany wouldn't give a refund. Stay away!
Yes, they do. Also, I've found that if you put a piece of foam or rubber behind the lower part of the speakers, they don't touch the wall and produce no vibrations. :-)
that camera is smaller in just about every way than my Nikon that I put in the bag and so it should fit just fine. The sling will suspend the camera in the case so it's safe even though it's not as large. Generally the biggest worry is if you're using a very long lens and in that case you'd carry the lens separately in the provided side pocket =)
it depends on the dock that have your iPod, I have an iPhone 4S and it works perfectly. If the iPod have the lightning dock you'll have to buy an adaptor.
The DIN sleeve is an option for the BCT15 and BCT15X, whereas it is included with the BCT996 (digital) version. A back-of-set antenna is included. If you didn't find it, check the packing (which I hope you kept!) in which the bracket and power cords were stashed. It should be in a plastic bag and stuck through a pair squared loops in the cardboard.
No. Push Pins
I am sorry, I can not...
When I get home ill measure it. It needs a receiver.
You have 5 separate channels on the back of the speaker. You could only connect the center channel but it would be a waste of the other speakers enclosed. There are much better choices if you are only looking for a center channel speaker.
one
There is no such thing as overkill when building a home entertainment sound system. I would buy these and a powered 12" subwoofer, my wife would agree.
The LiteFuze is treating me well. I work mostly in South Korea and the USA, so I keep it near and dear.
Shipping with US is free. The price includes shipping.
I have a different model than you do. I attempted to look for information on it, however was unsuccessful. Sorry I couldn't help you. Gene
Yes, we do. Please send your question to info@semsons.biz and our corporate sales team will provide you with quote.
yes.
Toggle switch on the lower right of the camera.
Yes i'm certain, as long as you have clamps
I've used mine with both a large muslin background, and also a large roll of paper background (aprox. 8'x10'). The paper weighs at least 10# and there has never been any sag or other stress on use system. For ordinary studio applications this is a good and stable product.
Sorry, I used this for something else and didn't use a backdrop.
You can, but it requires external software. Try using vjoy, x360ce, or joy2key, each one works in a different way.
Yes it will fit late model radios
Ok the antena &#128225; conector is the same are your car &#128663; no need any more but is no the same you need a antenna kit connector to resolve this problem this kit is very low price my apologies my English is bad.
I do not know. But if you bought this item. Return it. It is a terrible product and I would not recommend it.
The large back compartment is 16 inches wide, 13 1/2 inches high, and 6 to 7 inches deep (6 at the top, more at the bottom), but the pockets on the front of the bag go into this space if they are stuffed full. I don't know the size of a large tote purse, nor what parts are stiff vs. flexible.
Sleepmute? You mean sleep mode?.
6' is the largest image I've tried, and it was crisp and clear.
I have pc's not sure about apple...very easy to use works well
I do not know as the FM reception was very bad so I did not keep it.
Yes. This case will fit a D830.
Yes, if the aisle is clear (big if). The bag is compact and rolls easily.

Yes you can use it with Skype. It picks up pretty well and you can always adjust where you place it in relation to your mouth because the mic arm is adjustable.
yes it does, very well will even fit a bigger store bought plastic reusable bottle. Only complaint is that there is not much room for books.
It comes in a sleeve which you can attach to anything. Mine is attached to my diabetic supply kit. Inside the sleeve you can put a reminder note. I wish it would tell me exactly what I am to do because my headaches make me so confused at times I am not sure what I have done or should do. With the "Note" written as a check list, I never forget what is next to do. Good luck and peace upon you and yours.

It will definitely accommodate your Sony TV.
Power but will run in a battery pack, they are worth the price www.urbanimages76.com for samples using these lights
No, You have to buy the cable seperately.
It's only 120V.
No, not even remotely.
The speakers are 41 1/4" Height, 4 1/4" Width, 7 1/4" Depth. Base only adds about 1/2" to the height.
the images you see is for 0ne speaker
The Nikon D3000 does not have video unfortunately. However, the D3100 does.
Yes, there is a built in pop up flash.
Yes, a pop up flash. small and powerful.
Besides a few features, and the lack of a internal motor for focusing AF lenses, the D3000 is superior in every way. The D3000, though it's supposed to replace the D40 it's two steps above it and about half a step above a D80 when it comes to image quality. See the DxO comparison... http://www.flickr.com/photos/bizzyb0t/4711236246/
I'm going to be honest, it really does not. There is significant noise.
Hi, camera is US model however it does not carry any warranty since it's a used camera. Plus the model is old.
I'm sure you can I use mine for music and gaming and they sound great.
Yes it can work with the CE-15 however your receiver preamp/processor must have a dedicated LFE or subwoofer OUT.
Probably. This has built in amp...
Not that I know of. Mine does the same thing. Bothersome.
Depth finder
A standard copy of Windows XP 32 Bit. That is all.
Sorry but it doesn't and there are other things it doesn't do.
Sorry but do not know.
It is built in and works well as long as it is in the open or close to a window.
In Internet Explorer go to the cameras home page then Select Tool form the Menu bar then Compatibility View Settings then Add, IE will restart and the video will load. This needs to be done for anyone using IE10 and IE11
Yes I can.
You could try searching for the software online on Panasonic website
I could never get the camera to work with my computer
I own the lx5, and it works fine on that. However, I have been told that it will work on the lx7 as well, and have seen the lx7 and the hot shoe looks identical. Hope that helps.
I am not familiar with the LC1 but have used the flash on a DMC-FZ150, Leica V-Lux 2, DMC-G5, DMC-G3, DMC-G1 and DMC-LX5 and a few other Lumix brand cameras. I imagine it will work but you should do further research on the Internet. It probably will but might not work TTL with your camera. Good luck.
It does not take photos. You can store photos by downloading them off your computer like you would a music track. You are only downloading them for display, like if you wanted to show people baby pictures.
No, I'm told only Apple products download itunes
It comes with a built in FM radio but I never used it because I returned it, I couldn't make the thing work
Yes, but you must use a swing away camera mount. You can not couple the camera ring to the eyepiece
I truly do not know how many songs it holds as it was picked for a gift as a donation for the Holidays. I am sorry I cannot give you anymore information.
No. You have to buy a additional wall mount to get those features.
Economics of any device centers around supply and demand. Because it is such a great product and they do not manufacture them anymore, demand is high and supply is low. Enough people are willing to swallow the costs to get their hands on one.
Yes, its compatible with all mp3 files.
Try going in to system section of the Zume and change into A/V Mode. This should do the trick.
Negative. Different charging/ sync ports.
It would seem to me, that without a Zune player in the dock, there is no audio signal to output through the Zune optical output (or the HDMI output either).
This AV Dock is for the newer Zune HD 16/32/64GB models. Unfortunately, your original Zune 30GB is not compatible. However, depending on your stereo system, if it has an 'Audio In' jack, then I would recommend buying 3.5mm Male To 3.5mm Male Stereo Audio Cable.
Bought it for my x1 after i sold my kinect, works with the tv, the xbox itself is the one that changes the channels so as long as your cable box is supported by the x1 then you should be ok.
Hi Gail, I am not sure where you can buy just the inserts, but I have plenty as I only use the envelopes, I would do a swap but I live in Australia. Regards Jan.
I believe 25. Each sleeve contains room for the cover of the dvd And two DVDs.
MC80 is superior in sound quality
I own 3 pair of the MC60 they sound great! I assume, since they have similar specs, this would be a better sonic match than say adding another brand in ceiling. Is this for center channel? If so definitely fine choice as it's typically voice so no other speaker to compare it to in the system.
It does not have a separate "light" button however once any of the buttons are pressed, all are lit for a short period of time.
this won't change the functionality of your camera. almost any canon camera now (which this is for) can do long exposures
The first stet I purchased approx 1yr ago worked fine. No complaints. Purchased a 2nd set and these were unusable. Absolute rubbish. Not fit for purpose at all. Took up this issue with Fotodiox. 3 months later I received an email yesterday confirming they would replace them. Others have had the same issue which was the lens would not engage it's pin so that the lens would not come off when pulling focus.
Not really. The way the hood mounts.to the lens would make it difficult to put on the other direction, but it would depend on your lens.
It should work with Windows 8 just fine. It works well with Windows 7. As long as the "Surface" has USB ports it should work just fine.
The hood should not interfere with the normal lens cap. At least it doesn't on mine. I am able to use the cap that came with the lens.
Bayonet has usually three clickpoints and locks, screwed is a full 360x3 fixture
i do think so but as i dont have an vixia r50 iam not 100. percent sure.
yes you can, just need to have plug adapter to fit the socket you want.
No.
well its small so it doesnt give off too much light but it deffinently getd the job done, and its nice and small, it would be good for a go pro
I agree, i think my husband finally figured it out but I was ready to throw the darn thing out.
yes it does , it has several recording modes.
From azzo solano manuf. Website. Or if you are real handy, you can find replacement on amazon. Otherwise, the documentation for the case is included with a wealth of information for replacement parts.
Yes
I have the T5i and it works just fine.
Yes
Mine did not work at all. I returned it.
I dont know
Yes, I did exactly that last summer while photographing fireworks. It will work in exactly the same way as the shutter release on the camera.
I use this battery in a dv4000.... but the battery will not charge in the HP dv4000 laptop. I use an external charger.
Larry, It's probably too late for this answer to help you but maybe it will help someone else. It should be the same battery for all dv43xx series laptop. To be sure the battery is compatible with your system, take out your battery and look for the HP SPARE number. Look for that number in product description, if it is not there, then I wouldn't chance it.
As far as we know they would be. They are a nice size.
I do not own a PS3 but from what I have read the PS3 should have internal wireless capabilities so you shouldn't need this. You do have to have a wireless router, which I would guess you have since you are looking at this product. To set the PS3 up, look in the settings in the system menu and, then, find internet settings. There should be a place for you to enter your wireless information in that area. Hope this helps!
No
it works with mine OK....
12 VDC, but don't waste your money. This equipment is junk
I don't have the mini, but I've read all over that i will play .ISO files just like if it were in a DVD player. I have the regular WDTV and it will play .ISO files, but will only play the main movie (or the longest file, i.e. when I select The Aristocrats .ISO file, it plays the extra un-edited joke video and not the main movie)
Yes, several times along with other problem. None of them have solutions. This is a terrible product.
Yes, it works on batteries AND has a cord to plug it in.
Yes I have! I have a 6 year old Netgear router (need to get a newer one) and a $30-40 CISCO USB wireless adapter plugged into the WD Media Player. My computer is in the back of the house connected to the router/internet. My video streams perfectly, no skipping or buffering, just continuous uninterrupted streaming. I don't know what I can say to help.. You tried the automatic detection? Must be that your network has an issue. Is the YouTube software working but not able to see files on your computer?
I cannot confirm if it is because the packaging mentions nothing regarding this issue. Sorry
No don't saw it off! Remove the lencap. Then twist counter clockwise. And finally give it a slight squesse and pull. It doesn't come off easy but it does come off.
This lens fits on my Rebel T3 and the XS shares the same EFS mount. So you're good! When I first got the lens new out of the box, it had such a tight fit on my camera body. At first I thought it didn't fit, but after a couple uses its perfect. Just letting you know so you don't freak out like I did at first.
No, this Sony MPK-WEB Marine Case only works for: DSC WX1/ W290/ W230/ W220
The 2597 Nuvi GPS is 4 3/4 " wide by 2 3/4" high. mine is a 203 Nuvi and it is 2 3/4" high. It should fit without a problem.
Needs the amp
Yes, and/or to the suction cup, just make sure the ball diameter is the same as your arm.
This ball should bolt onto the cradle for the NUVI, then a RAM arm connects this ball to a ball that is bolted onto the handlebars with something like the RAM U-bolt base.
No. It is the RAM 1" diameter standard. You need to use it with RAM mounting devices.
I installed them in other car, 97 Nissan Maxima. The speaker are great at low and medium to high volumes. But at very high volume the clarity degrades. Bass and treble sounds are great with these.
The camera is at an angle. I was able to shim the opposite side of the smoke detector mounting base to increase the horizontal perspective by several degrees. I can see an extra 15 feet or more by making this adjustment. This is a low end camera with no night vision. The resolution is diminished over greater distances. I still like mine anyway.
You have an option to get a bluetooth adapter for the front pin or you can get a aux in bluetooth adapter for the back.
Everyone has their preference, mine is the Bose, next person may prefer B&W. Visit a Big Box Store and compare both.
Fits most 15 to 15.4-inch widescreen laptop/notebook computers. Chances are yours may be to big.
This headset was designed strictly for Mac or PC and will not work on PS3 or other gaming consoles. When hooked up to PS3, the headset will only transmit voice but it will not be fully functional as the routing for audio in PS3 is entirely different from the way audio is routed for computers. Thanks, Tawnee Kendall Social Media Mgr Creative Labs
Hey there. The range is about 30 feet through walls. In an office environment you can typically get about 40-45 feet. 100m is about 300 feet...so you're going to need some serious transmission power for something to cover that large of a distance with good sound quality. It CAN be done...but it will cost a lot more than $159.
I can't find the g5 as a PC or smartphone anywhere, who makes it, what is it?
Yes, but I thought I was just going deaf--I'm older probably, at 68, and enjoy listening to my iPodTouch for audiobooks, and it is frustrating to have the sound only periodically when you are listening to a good story. I am sorry to hear that the problem isn't me, but the product.
I have the Nano but I dont use it for a radio connection in my car or outside of my car. The battery without being plugged in to a vehicle lasts for around 6-8 hours depending on how much the battery has been used before you purchased it.
The small round switch on top left side of iPod locks out all of the controls on the round face. Example, your listening to music and stick the iPod in your pocket, slide switch to right, to prevent accidental skipping of songs, changing volume, etc. Hope that helps.
Yes. This is the 5th gen model.
I think the reason that Amazon is selling the 5th Generation iPod Nanos for $20 less than list is that there are newer (6th Generation) ones. (Note product titles which clearly indicate product generation.) On Apple's site, the only new iPod Nanos for sale are the 6th Generation ones. Any 5th Generation Nanos that you see there are refurbished ones.
No, it doesn't have Bluetooth.
First, make sure you have iTunes on your computer. Open it up and insert your CD of music. iTunes should pop up a little window asking you if you want to import the songs. Once you tell it to go ahead, it will take the songs from the CD, convert them into the format the iPod uses and save to your computer. Then, you can hook up your iPod and sync your music to it. Hope this helps.
It froze on you. You have to press both center and up arrow buttons together and hold for about 10-12 seconds. Once done, it will reset and work fine afterward. Hope this helps you, and that you still have the ipod.
Yes as long as you have itunes downloaded then you can sync to pc.
No, it doesn't have Bluetooth.
You need to ask the seller that question directly.
It froze on you. You have to press both center and up arrow buttons together and hold for about 10-12 seconds. Once done, it will reset and work fine afterward. Hope this helps you, and that you still have the ipod.
it wont fall off the clip is strong and u can disable the shake to shuffle feature so if ur running thats not a issue
The classic 160GB. Huge capacity, great screen, easy to use. Wish is was available in other colors, but that's my only complaint. It's also quite a bit cheaper than the largest touch model, which can't touch it for capacity.
Depends on where you're buying it, if it is a friend I think theres no problem. If it is from a seller here at Amazon the best thing you can do is check his reputation.
Yes- the one I ordered was the older generation but brand new in factory packaging
it does not have the monitor, this ws a replacement camera hope this helps
Sorry, I don't know
I do not know that. I use it with Embroidery Digitizing. Sorry. I use Windows OS.
Likely difficult to match what you have. Probably have to replace all four to match them. Try a craft store, they have a rather large selection of self adhesive black rubber feet.
Yeah, I agree with you. For my use I'd not buy a Touch now even at $150 as a discontinued product. Luckily I payed only about $200 and have had years of great use of it, with years more coming. My guess is that many of those buying them now at outrageous prices are doing so as backups to their existing Touch's as there really is nothing else out there in form, function, features, sound quality even at those inflated prices. Many have compared the Touch's DAC alone to standalone DAC's costing $900.
Smartphone audio out is usually limited to a small headphone plug or docking station. The SqueezeBox Touch has two digital outs and an analog RCA L/R out (including a very well regarded DAC). High-resolution refers to higher than CD resolution like 24/96 or 24/192. CD is only 16/44.1 Pandora Premium is 192k (higher resolution as mentioned above), free version is the standard 128k. Pandora does not currently allow access to the 192k streams via SqueezeBox players. I don't know what (if any) restrictions they impose for other hardware players.
I'm a beta tester for the Touch. The hardware is manufactured and stockpiled. Only delays in the software (SBS 7.5 and TinySC) is holding up it's release.
AHA!! Figured out how to upgrade 7.5.0 to 7.5.1.... I had issues with ipersistfile being read only and the install crashing. THE SOLUTION: boot your PC into safe mode, use the Windows "program access and defaults" routine to do a clean removal of 7.5.0 and then WHILE STILL IN SAFE MODE, download 7.5.1 and install it. Install then works like a charm! AND 7.5.1 is also working beautifully. It is a good release! BE SURE all your music libraries and squeezeservers are updated to the SAME version, or unpredictable things can happen!
Yes you can transfer calls from the headset, if you go into settings and enable the feature to do so. Choose option #3.
From the FAQ (http://www.jabra.com/support/Jabra-PRO-9470-_9470-66-904-105#faq) - No, you can only pair the headset with a Jabra PRO 9400 base (it is not Generic Access Profile (GAP) compliant). This is because Jabra PRO 9400 uses an enhanced version of the DECT standard, thereby enabling many of its advanced call-handling features. These enhancements are not supported by third-party manufacturers.
Does not require your original TV remote unless you need to program specific buttons to your universal remote.
no the usb is for maintenance
I do not know about Mac OSX but it does not require drivers. I just plugged it straight into my computer. There are a couple of "misplaced" keys that you need to get use to: There is a "home" key right next to the backspace key and a lot of times I will hit the home key instead of the backspace key. Also, the delete key is way up0 on the top row on the right side.
* Samsung TL225 / ST550 camera * Lithium Polymer battery * Wall charger with USB port * USB adapter cable * Wrist strap * Software CD * Quickstart guide
Yes.
Don't know about Linux. I've only used it with Windows 7 & 8.1 & it works fine with both of those.
Foam rubber and a velvety type of covering. Very nice.
No
You can adjust the angle, but i dont believe you can create a wider angle. Though it does cover a lot of area. Never had a problem with the coverag .
No hardware provided for such a mount and the weight of the display may cause problems with existing mirror attachment
Well when i bought this product it was 2x2gb = 4gb. If you buy two of this you will have 8gb but divided into 4 corsair memory, so you will have to check if your motherboard alows or of ot has 4 slots to put the 8
No, this is desktop memory for desktop systems, The MacBook Air memory can not be upgraded, it is soldered into the motherboard, Apple way of forcing you to over pay for memory when you buy and configure the MacBook Air and other laptops they sell.
Fan has only one wire that goes into motherboard or your fan control unit. LED will feed from that. If you need to disable it you will have to add a switch or cut translucent wires on the dan itself.
Had to look at a review for your case. It doesnt look like it mounts any differently than the stock one for your case, I believe it will work. Edit - had to check a review cause I was surprised a case would fit one to begin with
Yes. The top fan in the Antec 900 is a 200mm fan. The Antec fan does not move much air but the cooler master may do better.
I just installed half life 2 on this and it plays smoothly (25-30FPS even during combat) at 1366 x 768 with a mix of medium and high detail (Looks great!). It can handle games just not the newest and most graphic intensive ones. Mind you I haven't upgraded to 4GB of memory yet so I'm sure it will be even better then.
It comes with a free basic trial Office package but after 60 days you have to pay.
Yes - battery and charger are included
It' called Orange but is actually red. I don't get it but it's not important.
I leave my kybd on, it lasts at least 2 mo, but then again I do not do a lot of emails.
I don't think you can do anything to fix that yourself. Try contacting the manufacturer and see if they can offer a solution for you. Mine has been working great for over a year. If you get a solution make sure you post it in case mine goes south! ;)
The 1 is the magnification. The 24 is the lens size in millimeters.
On the vertical edge of the camera, next to the shooting button and dial wheel, there are two rectangular/oblong doors that can be levered up at one end by a fingernail. Do this gently as each door is connected to the camera by one small tab. Very faintly imprinted on one door is 'A/V Out DIgital'. This is the one to open. The connector is inside.
Hello Danny, You may change the language to Pilipino. Many of the GPS's can load international maps, but they cost extra to have them loaded and those are available through the manufacturer like TomTom, Garmin, etc. We hope this helps, and thanks for your interest!
The G11 has likely been discontinued and replaced by the G12. Some third party sellers on Amazon seem to believe they can charge any amount they want for obsolete cameras which are no longer being manufactured.
A lot of cameras have been returned because the pop up flash is broken. I vote for built in flashes and viewfinders to comliment the LCD screen.
according to the manufacturer, no. it is designed for TVs from 25 inches to 40 inches.
what is a pfs Sorry. I love my camera and the pictures I take with it. It is easy to use but I'm not very adventurous when it comes to changing many settings. I can if I need to. If you tell me what the pfs is I may be able to help
I used it to make a few short videos while on vacay...they are clear. Im pretty sure theres no editing.
Windows Media Player plays .mov, you probably just need to download the most recent version. It's Apple Quicktime format fyi.
Yes I use it all the time with my iphone 4 inside the my otterbox
Make sure your aperture is as high as it can go if you want the most light
I don't really have an answer for you. I guess the difference is in the zoom factor between canon and Nikon.
This lenses does say canon on the box. So I don't think it's compatible with that camera but it works amazing with. My canon t3i.
Yes. I own the a55 and this fish eye works well the camera. You will however have to go into the menu and activate shutter without lens option. Certainly not a deal breaker. I use the lens all the time and it takes decent images.
I would imagine it should since its made for the sony alpha bodies and they share the same mount.
USA 110v 60 cycle household current.
I think there is no different, it is just ur prefer and i didn't know they make blue displays in redline detector. The redline detector is always red.
You need to purchase the escort Live smart cord (sold seperately). The Escort Redline is not compatible with the app. By it self.
Yes. Escort uses the same cord. I had both and now 9500 with gps.
You would have to purchase a separate mobile communications kit through Bose's website. The kit will allow you to take calls while listening to the headphones. Here's a link: http://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/accessories/qc2_commkit_acc.jsp
No. Since this is so important you need to get helicopter pilot headphones with stereo and ac input. Also he needs to play the same music he listens to while studying durring the exam.
i have charter cable and it works for me. you might want a docsis 3.0 because they are phasing out docsis 2.0. hope i helped.
Sorry, Zikar, I don't know. I don't use my Shuffle any more because it is inferior to other iPods.
I have the exact same problem, my 2nd Gen just broke and the new shuffle appear to be worthless. Some people recommend buying a reconditioned 2nd Gen from Apple but they appear to be out of stock. Not sure where to turn! Ipod Nano is popular but heavier than I'd prefer. Bring back the 2nd Gen Apple!
The classic 160GB. Huge capacity, great screen, easy to use. Wish is was available in other colors, but that's my only complaint. It's also quite a bit cheaper than the largest touch model, which can't touch it for capacity.
Yes- the one I ordered was the older generation but brand new in factory packaging
I am not certain as I didn't use the shuffle for that purpose. I found the shuffle to be inferior...spotty performance, headphones not working properly. The shuffle is currently collecting dust while I use an older but more reliable iPod. I would not recommend you purchase this model shuffle. Best of luck to you.
no, the only speaker is the one built inside, just like a cell phone

Hi Michelle! I bought this to use when I went jogging. I found the performance to be poor. I had much better luck buying an ancient 16G and although it is bulkier, I am much happier with it. Yes, even the 16G speaks to current Apple software. I thought the size and capability of the shuffle were what I wanted, but I was disappointed. Hope this helps.
Yes you can !!!
What you mean
Yep. This iPod nano has it.
Yes, it will. DG lenses are designed for cameras with a 24x36mm (Full Frame) sensor, but will work equally as well on a camera with an APS-C sensor. Sigma DC lenses are designed for cameras with an APS-C size sensor and won't cover the entire image area of a 24x36mm (Full Frame) sensor.
There is a lock somewhere outside the lens near the body. This might prevent you from changing the focal length.
No.
I no longer own this lens.
Is the Cleaner Unit part of the print cartilage because that is the only thing that is on this little printer -- I have used mine for years and love it.
No.

Hi sean doyle, this Sony SRSNWGU50 works on Sony Walkman Type A (A and S series) and Type B (X and S series). It will not work on your Sony Walkman NWZE 585. -Ely
The DVPCX995V has no such capability that I'm aware of, and I specifically looked for that feature when I bought mine. I also see no information in the manual, nor any copnnector(s) on the rear panel that suggest this capability. My Pioneer DV-F727 has that capability, and even comes with the necessary cable to link them up. I've seriously considered this, since the Sony is miserably slow at everything. The only reason I put up with it is the 400-disc capacity.
Hi, please send us more details about your concern at socialsupport@am.sony.com, give us your contact details so that we can assist you further. Thanks. Ely.
Is it connected to a surround sound system? Via HDMI, coaxial or optical ports? If it is connected via HDMI, try connecting via coaxial or optical cables. I believe that may solve the issue.
I looked for one, but I counldn't find one. You'll just have to use the auxiliary input tha's on the back of it. Just buy a cable that has the same 1/8" plug on both ends, it looks like the plug on your head phones that you use with your iPod. Hope I was of some help Bonnie.
Kristofer, the battery that you will receive is a different brand but has the same size and identical specs to the Yuasa one. it is also warranted for 6 months. Thank you for your time.
Electrically this will work fine. I believe the S is a typo and should have been a V. They only differences with this battery is the terminal size. either .178" or .250". You have to determine this to purchase the correct one. http://www.yuasabatteries.com/pdfs/NP_7_12_DataSheet.pdf
A little sticking is normal. Make sure they are clean. You can season the grates with some Olive oil. Try med to low heat. We think the grill grate is the best!
It should fit with the proper dash kit
Yeah it runs LoL fine, especially w/ a good graphics card, I wouldn't be running 20 programs at once while trying to play LoL, honestly ive had this for about 6 months but instead you should think about the FX8350, Im about to get it as well. its more money but its a investment and literally like 4x better than this
Yes, it will work. I am using it in a p6257c computer that uses the same motherboard. Referring to the HP Website, http://h20565.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/template.PAGE/public/kb/docDisplay?javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&javax.portlet.prp_ba847bafb2a2d782fcbb0710b053ce01=wsrp-navigationalState%3DdocId%253Demr_na-c01959720-25%257CdocLocale%253D%257CcalledBy%253D&javax.portlet.tpst=ba847bafb2a2d782fcbb0710b053ce01&sp4ts.oid=4079858&ac.admitted=1398996468469.876444892.492883150, this is the same processor that is on the motherboard now. Hope this helps.
Yes.
I don't have a SD card with that much memory. I don't see why it would not work. The songs go into the Disk so it doesn't affect the SanDisk Sansa Clip itself.
I really do not know. Sorry.
My experience with these is that it needs to be reset. For my 8 gb I have to hold the on button for 20 seconds and then turn it on as usual. Yours may be different. I googled how to do it and it sent me to Sansa's website. I'd try that first.
As long as those speakers have a standard headphone plug (3.5 mm) at the end, you should be all set. Just plug it in the headphone jack on the Sansa, and you're all done. You may want to turn up the volume all the way on the Sansa, but control the volume on the portable speakers. This assures maximum sound quality.
I ordered a separate cable so that I could connect my MP3 player to a wifi speaker. This same cable can be used in my vehicle so that I can play my MP3 player through the car speakers. This cable is about 2 feet long.
Sorry, I do not know the answer to your question. Have you attempted a net search?
yes
yes, mine supported hd ready 1630*768, it is called hdmi auto
18" wide by 15" deep.
.312 dia X 2" long they come with drywall inserts but would recommend finding a stud if possible. If you mean the ones that connect after you mount to wall I believe they are metric contact cheetah and they will provide that Info. I disposed of the instructions. They will also send you replacements! Great customer service!
It is only for components only. I have it below the tv. Good product, easy to install.
Yes sure, you can buy this battery. Dont worry about it, i have a dell inspiron 1545 the same model as you and works fine and i buy a new charger too, both cheaper than original and do the same work :)
I will say its a battery not worth buying.
Who cares? It is 1/4 the cost of what Dell wanted, and I got it the next day, as opposed to a week and a half for 'overnite shipping' from Dell!!! And it works great!!!
Yes, it works. But only at the new series Etrex 10, 20 and 30
If you have Pl259 connectors it will work. Look up pl259 connectors to identify what you have if you aren't sure.
Not really. The basic keys work but the configuration software is Windows only so you can't program any of the other keys. By 'other' I mean anything that is not a letter or number or punctuation. No function keys, no pgup/pgdn, no fancy extra keys (zoom, volume, etc). It's too bad because the old corded version works just fine with the Mac and it's reasonable to assume this version would, too. But it doesn't.
You may need to re-sync it to your computer.
Yes it will fit. Luckily with MacBooks, the size of the screen will not change the size of the trackpad. They are all the same size.
Use the included proprietary 8-pin USB. A wall-charging attachment will charge the battery much faster than plugging the camera into your computer.
Yes, Definitely that's what I bought it for. My son is 12 my daughter is 10 .They have been fighting over it so I guess it work's pretty well. I'm going to order another 1 very soon.!!
Are you asking if it can be used with a mac? I'm typing this on this same monitor hooked up to a new Mac mini - the monitor was left over from my dying Win 7 HP computer, so since I had no monitor yet, just hooked this one up with the HDMI cable. BTW, most monitors will work with both Mac & Windows, so get the best one that meets your needs and fits your budget.
I had to upgrade the software that came with mine, but haven't had any problems with it once windows 8 recognized it was plugged in.
Yes it will. It works with windows and Mac.
It should fit any camera that has the threaded hole on the bottom to accept a tripod mount. I am using it with a Cannon R40.
I believe you would be using the 46mm filter for the 20mm pancake: http://www.amazon.com/46mm-Clear-Haze-Multi-Resistant-Coating/dp/B0000BZL1P/ref=pd_bxgy_p_img_y
Apparently the first DMC-GF1s have shipped - we got ours: just on time as birthday present. We love it.
I think you might be referring to a card that would allow your computer to connect online through a cellphone network. It is a more elegant soloution than a clunky USB "dongle" that many cellphone companies use, but the very best soloution for portable surfing is in the newest cellphones that allow "tethering" wirelessly. That often is much less expensive in per-month charges than either the dongles or a built-in card.
Packaging states: Windows 2000/XP/7 and MAC OS 10. Hope this helps.
This will work with either SATA or PATA drives, connectors are included for both. I hooked up an old 250 GB. PATA drive as new motherboard had no connectors for it.
you do not need anything as long as your router has the standard screw on back, but it is hard to screw on the back of the router. Also it is heavy and keeps falling down but not separating from the router. Make sure yours does not have these deficiencies. I do have clear for my internet which is slow and this makes the difference.
don't know, but it did not help my signal. I then bought the Netgear range extender and it works great!
nd still work fine.
Yes.
It's 2.0 and not 3.0 if that's what you mean.
6 foot usb extension cable with two dash mounting options. the female usb connector can be flush mounted in the dash or use the enclosed bracket for under dash mounting.
Thank you for the question. It is said that it can use ordinarily although this product was sold to the Japanese living in the United States the other day. The thank-you letter came. However, by the catalog, it is 100V. Excuse me, I need your help by self-responsibility. Studio CIRCUS :Akira Katori

That is the issue. If you want really long endurance off the grid you need to consider inverters, charge controllers and deep cycle batteries. All these cost a bit more and occupy more space. I've used this APC unit for 3 years with my database server and it has worked flawlessly. It is big and heavy for a UPS, but it keeps up my sever for about 2 hours when new. Monitor is off and the other equipment is run from a separate UPS.
Celeste, That may be another dealer, it looks like the Amazon listing says 1 to 2 months, but I have 1 brand new retail box in stock ready to go and 20 more at distribution ready to ship as well.. I hope this helps answer your question.. Keep in mind there are many vendors to buy from on any given part, but watch the notes and details as each one can vary a bit. Ours is ready to ship if you choose to buy... Manufacturers Warranty Scott All Computer Parts
Yes, but it does not support iTTL (TTL) functions. Will only work in "Manual" mode.
No idea. Mine crapped out after 5 years of good use.
No.
3/2011 purchased a Rosewill RNX-N2LX usb N 300mbps and it works with anything. SURPRISINGLY! Has 2 adjustable receiving antennas. I'd never tried Rosewill before but have 3 of their products and they work! 2 portable usb harddrive enclosures. Newegg has this wireless adapter on sale right now for $20 including shipping.
Not sure, Linux does support smart card readers but whether that reader is supported I can't say.
You can easily find driver online.
Yes, had to download some driver. Works very well!
I had this Winegard professionally installed on my motorhome. We use Direct TV. It has worked flawlessly and I am extremely happy with its performance. It has worked from AZ to MT. My installer said it would work With Dish Network. Check out some forums for better answers.
Sent it back. too difficult to figure out. Don't remember dish size
The long one is the remote trigger and the fat one is the receiver that attaches to the camera.
I've purchased two of them, and the timing seems perfect. I would make sure that you're on the right setting, and if you are, I'd look into getting it fixed.
I do not know. Mine works fine. Make sure it is level.
No, the Canon Rebel XT, as well as all other Canon Rebel models, only take SD format memory cards.
Most likely not. I'm not familiar with that specific camera, but most newer point and shoot compact cameras require SD cards, not compact flash (CF)
The graphics card contacts and the heat sink piece are quite specific for only certain Dell models. Most likely it will not work.
The drive has a specific cable connection to the MacBook. It will not fit a PATA/IDE connector. I don't know the connections on the iMac, but I doubt it would connect.
No
Yes

Haven't a clue........scope thru charger products and locate "the Dell Dude" vendor. Excellent customer care, sells OEM Dell products affordably. Beware of look-a-likes as they may power up your Dell, will not charge, Dell has a third line recognition wire that most generics do not possess. Go Dell manufactured only.
2008
Yes we have had no problems thus far
The one I purchased included all software needed to get up in operation.
No
I kind of doubt if you could mount the two TV's together with the mount----most TV's have two sets of holes one set 100 X 100 and then a smaller set that is rectangular in shape---off hand I do not remember the sizing of these holes---I hope I was of some help
You will have to use a USB cable but it is compatible.
yes
Yes, the Canon ET-73 clip on plastic hood
I think you're right... if you were at the minimum focus distance, then a subject that fills a full frame image will be only partially visible for a crop sensor. To fit the whole subject in your cropped sensor image, you would have to go further back. Electric Boogaloo is wrong, because the pixel density of an 18 MP crop sensor is higher than a 22 MP full sensor, meaning you get MORE detail, not less. A ~35 Mp full frame sensor would have the same detail as a 18 MP crop sensor.
I have both this 15-85mm lens, and the wonderful EF-S 10-22mm. Since getting the 15-85, I almost never use the 10-22, even though most of my photography is on the wide-angle side of normal. I recommend both lenses, but get the 15-85 first, and you may find, as I did, that it is very adequate all by itself. If you do need extreme wide-angle, however, by all means get the EF-S 10-22mm, which is excellent. Best, get both!

We used this on a base CB and it worked well!
I am Ham operator, I took this antenna shortened it to work on 10 meters. I have it in my attic and it works awesome, I have been able to work many country's. I'm sure your idea will work fine.
8 feet
Absolutely and I use it quite frequently when needed...
I can confirm it worked for me with the Nikon D60, however I recommend spending the extra few bucks to get the Nikon brand one. It really only worked for a few sessions then started getting really fussy and only working part of the time. The Nikon brand one I got is about a million times more reliable. :)
I am also looking for a remote for my D3100, but according to the Nikon website this one is not compatible with this camera. Look for it on the official website and you will see that the only remote for this camera is the MC-DC2, but unfortunately it is not wireless.
It should work with all Lumix Micro four-third cameras. I have tried it on Lumix GH3 and G5.
I have a dv6 and it did not fit so I have no idea how long the charge will last
I want to know the exact same information. I desperately need a keyboard for my PS3 and not sure if this will do the trick. Will gladly buy it if it does. Have you found any research that shows it would work?
Sony's published spec for this camcorder is 1920 x 1080 / 60i. You can find that and much more info at Sony eSupport - HDR-CX500V. The specific document is HDRCX500V_mksp.pdf. See page 2, left column, third item from the bottom: Video.
The V on the end of a US/Canada 500 series cam means it has GPS. I have a CX500V; it definitely has the GPS feature.
The warranty on these is 5 years but they've been discontinued. Monster/Beats have the worst warranty service in the industry. I have the same problem and was told I can pick any IEM form their current line up but they seriously lack in comparison to these. Apparently they're reintroducing the line-up late this year, so I'd say wait unless you absolutely need them.
It's a case, which completely covers a laptop, with a zipper closure. It will handle a pretty good sized laptop
Sorry, no strap or handle of any kind came with mine. Just a high quality sleeve.
Hi Barbara B., Filter size for this Sony SAL2875 is approximately 67mm. Ely
Well I keep it in the dark (closed) except when being used, so it gets exposed to very little light and should last many years.
1.5 inches isn't a problem at all... It should easily fit
The 15.6" should fit it easily.
The prints are 3.5 wide by 4.5 inches tall. perfect pocket size :) Hope this helps
Yes
I found this to be somewhat unresponsive due to a week wireless interface. I ended up returning it because it was so darn picky. For serious data entry, I'd get a wired numeric keypad.
Hi. No, this is not bluetooth ready. I would not recommend it. It sucks up battery power and doesn't have any range beyond maybe 4 feet.
Yes
No, you would need a deep well marine battery
Yes
with the proper player software it should work fine.
It will work great with that camera, as you won't need nothing faster for a 10mp camera. BUT if you are planning on upgrade to something like the D300s or newer, you better buy a faster CF card, like the SanDisk extreme pro (95mb/s) or a Lexar Profesional. I have one of each and this Sandisk Extreme is the third in line (second backup), as it can't record fast enough on my 7D (18mp). Good luck and good pics!
This card will work just fine with your CANON 5D MKII. Format it in-camera before use (Never format the card in your computer).
You can install windows 7. I recommend updating the ram to 2GB beforehand. The unit is capable of playing Blu-rays from an external player, so I imagine it should play the hauppauge files as long as you have software that will play it.
No.
Since this was a used item, it came with whatever the seller offered: two lenses. This particular model, the Pentax K-1000, was one of the best and most flexible, as well as the most reasonable in price at the time. In other words, any used item will be a "one of a kind" in terms of what's in the box. The addition of an almost new leather case was a perk. Did not have a strap, however.
I am not able to tell you that this chip would work. If you go online, you can look up your laptop and cross reference it. You could also go to the adapter property s in your laptop to get the factory numbers. Good luck with your inquiries.
Yes, but keep in mind that you have 1 axis of tilt and 1 axis of rotation, which limits you a bit. 2 axes of tilt would have given you much more flexibility in where you could position the camera, especially regarding placement in corners which give the most coverage.
Sorry am not sure
This radio has the standard ipod docking station, if the gen. 4 has the standard port and not the lightening port then the answer is yes.
Unfortunately, no aux/headphone jack.
Negative...
Yes
I bought this as an additional panel. I bought the rest of the weather station with the latest control panel. Look at the Davis web page to see the combinations they offer.
In the bottom of the unit. This is a good product. Works perfectly.
The Amazon page for this device now says "optimized for Europe and Asia. I have not had an opportunity to try mine "south of the border," so cannot assure you it will work, but I've found it works well in North America. (Not that that is any help to you!)
Not on board... I use the ones from my mobo
The manual never stated how to position it, but that is how I have mine with the fan facing down through the bottom vent.
I read some comments on dpreview.com of a guy who tested the Pentax k-7 with two different class 4 SDHC cards and one worked well (SanDisk Ultra II) while the other didn't (PNY). You can see the site below for more details. I would think a class 6 would work fine. http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/read.asp?forum=1036&message=33814313
Yes, I just bought it a month or two ago for 360 or something around there, 183 is a great price.
Yes, you do. Here's what I bought to hook up a 3.5" IDE HDD: 1. Syba SD-ADA50016 IDE/SATA Converter Bi-directional IDE to SATA 2. Syba SY-CAB40007 Molex 4 Pin to 2x 15 Pin SATA Power Cable (5.5 Inches) 3. C&E CNE11445 SATA Data Cable. They appeared at the bottom of the order screen as an add-on. I didn't have the power cable or the data cable, so I bought them all together.
sorry don't rember ever having that problem ?? but i'll look in the manual tomorrow!! doyou have a correct lens on?
Yes. Sounds like a faulty lens. It works at all f stops. Check if there's a ton of dust in the back of the lens, but that's about all you can do. Also make sure that the camera works with other lenses at other f stops, so you're sure it's not the camera.
No
It does not always work. Once in a while I am asked to take my laptop out, and when I asked, they told me that scan smart is just marketing used to get you to buy the bag. At that point, I wasn't interested in spending 30 minutes escalating the problem through three levels of poorly paid workers just to be told no repeatedly.
I am not sure what size that would be but mine holds a 500ml water bottle with no problem. It still has a little space but never falls out.
Yes it is
Don't get it ... its WORTHLESS...... I bought it and took it off the same day . My card actually ran hotter ! I would stay away from it .
I'd just like to mention here, since a lot of the bad reviews are based around this problem, that the problem is FIXED. I did a full free map upgrade, software upgrade, even added new POIs and voices. No errors, and everything is still working fine. The only thing I have deleted is the non-english voices.
My contractor had to run the wires from outside my house and along my vestibule walls to get in the house to hide the wires. You will definitely need the 50ft of wiring. I did not hook it up to my locks. I am still uncomfortable with that technology in my home.
It will only work with one monitor you can add another door
yes, http://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/products/accessories/mounts-holders-docks/one-xl-xxl-air-vent-mountkit-9UEB.001.05/
No
I don't know , it fit my 95 f150 fine
It's not listed as one of the model numbers for this adapter, so I'm guessing not. Sorry I'm not more help. We had a difficult time finding the right one for my son's laptop. Try searching by the model number. It appears that HP computers use very specific adapters. :(
It fit and worked for about 2 weeks. It was very flimsy and only lasted a couple weeks. I do not recommend buying this adapter. I had to go to my local Staples store and buy a new one, which is alot better. It is heavy and durable. Wish Staples had been my first choice !!
I actually bought this for my brother. He says it's held up well so far. Buying this was a much better alternative because dealing with HP was such a hassle for him. I hope this helps.
Im not sure I have hp note book
Yes
Great questions I would like to know the same thing. Does this dvd player run direct on 220 or does it need a converter?
you can use mouse or pen to navigate windows or any cad or paint program, I use jfdraw and vectorengineer it takes a little time to get the hang of it like touch pen to pad is like a left click and going to the corner of the pad to move the mouse to a corner trips me up a little ect...
I've used mine with Windows XP, Windows 8 and Ubuntu Linux.
Have you looked at the Wacom "Inkling"? I think the down side is that you can't draw in "real time" on the computer screen - everything is offline - but it would certainly allow you to do what you're asking about above. You can find it here: http://www.wacom.com/en/Products/Inkling.aspx Good luck!
the difference is just the size. if you have a big screen, bamboo fun would be a better choice. even your monitor is small, bigger tablet may offer more precision. but i believe most people would be fine with craft size.
Yes, so far it has worked very well on 8. I haven't had any compatibility issues at all.
these aren't made to fit in a vehicle. If you do buy I would always do a pair but you may have a hard time finding a spot for them.
this is a single-din, so you will need to buy a dash kit, which fills the hole in the dash with a pocket, and it supplies the hardware needed to install the pocket. Also, you need a wire harness to connect the sony stereo to your car's factory wiring
It should fit, you need a Multi-Kit Installation for Saab or you can get one at Auto Zone. 1. Go to
You could, as anything is possible with the right amounts of skill, time, and equipment. How would you wire it to the OEM unit so both would feed the speakers? When on the dock, your iPhone may hit the OEM unit and not work anyway. My phone ended up resting against the center air vents above the radio cutout. I ended up buying an extension cord and laying my phone on the seat anyway - if you have a case on your phone, it's not going to play well with the dock anyhow.
I don't believe so. We only used iPod Touch and IPhones.
I don't know, but I can tell you that my internal sata drive is a toshiba mq01abd100 with a 5V, 1A power requirement. It has two flat connectors: one power connector with 15 pins and one data connector with 7 pins. If your drives have these connectors then it's a good bet that it will work.
I would think so. I use it for 30A service for my camper. Not sure what amperage your motorhome requires.
Yes. Works perfectly
Yes
It's like 6 inches approximately. Sorry man.

Yes it is.
4 USB 2.0 ports, 2 on the right side and 2 in the back. If by sandisk port, you mean those SD (Secure Digital) Cards that you typically find it cameras, yes it has 1 on the right side. And yes to the cd burner as well; Its a CD and DVD R/RW drive.
The roller unit functions smoothly in rolling up large muslins like yours. The most important piece of equipment is the roller itself. You must use material that is rigid enough to maintain its shape and not sag. There is ample clearance between the three slot positions for 20' muslins. I can only answer the weight limit issue by telling you that I mount three 20' muslins on aluminum rollers with no problem.
Now they do, although it not a UL, called U30jc. A pound heavier, little less battery life, but has an optical drive and bluetooth.
The x4 has a smaller hard drive, and a 2 year warranty, and is silver. The x5 has a larger hard drive, a 1 year warranty, and is black. Both have 8 cell batteries, but I don't know if the x4 comes with the higher capacity one, or if it ships with the same one that the x5 uses. When the battery doesn't change the weight of the unit, and is the same number of cells, why change it? Just wondering.
How many bit your Net Book? If you're net book is 64 bits and your game is 32 bits. That is the problem. It will show' error not compatible'.
My hard drive was not packed well. Air bag underneath and on top but no sides so the packing had slipped to the side of it and the hard drive was touching bare box. I was very concerned when I opened the box but the drive appears to be ok.

I'm not familiar with the XTi but if it has the same mini USB connector type I would assume that it will work, sorry I cannot be much help on this one.
Yes. The SAS drive has a different connector. A SAS controller will run a SATA drive, but not the other way around. If you want a fast SATA drive just get a Velociraptor or an SSD.
Andrew, That's a generic Seagate drive but the Dell version you would need is Dell Part # W347K. Order that part # and you should be good. I hope this helps answer your question. Scott All Computer Parts
This is a card reader and doesn't depend upon your camera type as you remove the card from your camera and insert the card into the reader. FWIW, different Nikon cameras use different cards - my two Nikons each use a different type card. but both cards can be read in this reader.
Warranty for how long
No they're the Solo HD.
They're fake and don't last. Don't waste your time.
The booklet lists different ipods and some Blackberry models, but here is a website that lists music phone compatability: http://www.monstercable.com/mp3/controltalkworks.
How heavy is your microphone? This is a short and lightweight stand!
Yes it Records Audio...
We never used it at night to see, however early in the am when it was still dark out, with a light on it did fine.
It is 6 in wide at the bottom 5 1/2 high and 5 inch deep. It is a little pyramid shaped so it starts slightly larger on the bottom an tapers about 1/2 by the top
They do adjust so I see no problem for smaller heads, and they are a great product!
I would say they have limited range inside, and would not trust people's lives to their performance under fire. They work well enough outdoors in line of sight.
Only if you have what is called a "POTS" telephone system - a Plain Old Telephone System. If you get your phone from say cable or DSL then they will usually go down when the power goes out, but the Freedom Alert itself has a battery backup system. It's really a pretty good unit (helped my Dad out once when he broke his leg).
No you must press the button !!you can program it to call 9-11 first
The picture looks like the model I've had for several years. It is very satisfactory. No problems and it certainly gives me peace of mind.
If your car requires 6 and a half speakers they'll fit. You may need a bracket just in case. But the sound is incredible. I suggest you hook a small amp on them to take them to the next level.
I believe that they will fit both sizes
I no longer own this product. I don't think it did.
Should work. Majority of MP3 players use a standard 3.5mm/mini connector which the X-Mini has. I use with a Sandisk Sansa Fuze & Cowon D2 player & both work perfectly. This X-Mini pair also sounds real good for the size!
yes you will be getting two spaker
YES. That's what we use it for. Works great.
Yes, the Passport 21V headset is a USB model.
I don't know i have the Dell Latitude D630 which it fit. Unfortunately it only held a charge for 2 weeks.
I still average about 2-3 hours on mine. I've had in the neighborhood of 15 months. Been a great battery.
yes
Mine plugs into the wall. I can't recall about the car adapter. It works
No, only a DVI port on back but comes with VGA adaptor.
Hi! It is compatible with KODAK: Photo Frame Dock, Z1485 IS, C Series C1013, C Series C310, C Series C315, C Series C330, C Series C340, C Series C360, C Series C433, C Series C503, C Series c513, C Series C530, C Series C533, C Series C603, C Series C613, C Series. But you may need to download the Kodak EasyShare Software. Have a good day!
I don't know. I think so. I have an older box and am in a wooded area at the lake that cannot get an HD Satelite signal. I had to send it back for that reason
It will work anywhere with a 3" diameter flat with a 3/8x16x1/2 stud (and/or 1/4x20 with adapter) centered. Its value remains in its compact, but fully adjustable and secure, size; it can substitute for a much more unwieldy camera mount.
Yes, it will work with a DVD drive. However, in my case my computer's BIOS was not able to identify the card and DVD drive and so I was not able to set it up in the boot sequence. Once you get booted into the OS, the card and DVD drive will work fine. More modern BIOSes may be able to overcome this challenge.
Theere are two (inputs) on the RCA. I would connect one from the cable box and connect the other from the DVD. I would bypass the audio outputs from your TV if you use a cable box
I agree - I don't understand the "8 hours" in the title description.
It should have 802.11 G WiFi adapter.
Yes. Should be fine as long as you allow for at least 8GB of free disk space.
i only see 320 mentioned, but you can shop dell.com and configure one specifically - I just bought studio 15 with 500gb/7200 rpm hard drive
Yes
I use google maps, iPhone maps or WAZE and they all play through the cars speakers.
Yes , it does! It doesn't work for a iPhone 5, so I don't use it! Do you want to buy mine for less money then Amazon is selling it for?
THis basically for adding XM radio to a car that is incapable of receiving XM, but it can be used in house with a docking station which is an added expense. Its not want you seem to want. Look for a home XMradio.
I would not recommend this unit for a motorcycle. First, 90% sure it isn't waterproof or water-tight. Second, the display is easy to read in a vehicle cab, but would be hard to see on a morotcycle. Third, the control buttons are pretty small. Not bad in a car, but would probably be hard to press while riding.
Yes and no. As long as you have the radio tuned to an FM number that is not assigned to a station in the area through which you are driving you do not have to change the station. You will have to find another station if the number to which you are tuned is in local use.
I don't know because I don't know what that is. .. Sorry.
I don't think so, but I'll check when I get to my shop.
I dont know it comes w/ a stick on base it fell off so now I keep the radio in the ashtray of my truck
as long as it fits the lens you will be fine. it def gives you a different shot... I use it on all my shoots
Yes! It is compatible with the onyX EZ radio.
all 120m yes. I have one on the bottom plus two on the top and one in the lower front, it comes with. one installed on the rear blue led
This is my exact question. I bought the camera for video. We went to Costa Rica and although I switched back and forth between still and video, it only recorded video. The user guide doesn't shed any light on this problem. Luckily I also had my Canon ESO and a Nikon point and shoot. The still shots I took with this camera were when the other two weren't handy. Please, anybody, help!!!!!
I bought two of these cables for my DSC-W70 sony camera after reading the reviews. I bought two since they were cheap and I was worried about the quality. The cable fit my W70 perfectly and seems to be of decent quality. It works perfectly so far and I have had no problems with it. I'm not sure if it will work for your camera but if your model number is listed as compatible I'm guessing it should work and I would recommend this product.
HI Clarence I bought this for my DVD drive. It is a Samsung SE-506BB/TSBD 6X USB2.0 External Slim Blu-ray Writer Drive (Black). So if you look that one up (just copy/paste the product because I bought it on here so you will be able to find it), it might give you an idea, size-wise. It fit mine great with room to spare for the cord, etc. and it is very nice quality. Hope this helps. Cheryl
I use mine for my kindle. I measured both. That's my answer, compare the dimensions of the suede sleeve with the measurements of your device. I have been veryt happywith mine. I use the zip pocket for ,y smaller devices (MP3 and the charging cable)
Mr / Mrs Baker - The adapter that comes with the MOVE is 110/240. All you would need is a device similar to this: UK PLUG ADAPTER VP 20 - CONVERTS GROUNDED USA, EURO AND AUSTRALIAN PLUG TO GROUNDED UK This particular one might not work because the MOVE plug is not grounded. Try searching on Amazon for a Euro Plug / European Adapter etc. I'm sure a device like this would come in handy for other electronics as well.
yes you can. I currently have a windows 7 laptop, new macbook pro and my desktop is a running windows 8. works with all units.
The quick answer is yes. The slightly longer answer is while it can be used that way, it's set up as a standard headset with 3.5mm jacks for headphone input and microphone output (and an adapter to USB that also serves as a soundcard), and because of that extra jack you may want to consider another headset if MP3 players/iPods are all you intend to use with it. If, however, you're looking for a mic'd headset for you computer that you can also use with you iPod/MP3 player, this is a very good option.
USB virtual 7.1 surround sound controller card is included, yes.
It's just one knob for everything
It has standard 2.5mm jacks on it, so it is compatible with any os.
Yes, the 640gb is a direct replacement for your existing 500gb drive.
You can use this on a PC. You just need to buy an adapter for the drive cage and an adapter for the connectors. It would be much cheaper to buy a 3.5" drive instead.
I do not know what a marque m 155 is but I purchased them for my Plantronics (lettering is too small for me to read model no.) and they are molded to a hard plastic piece with two barbs on it that insert into the Bluetooth and lock in with a quarter twist. I do not know if this is helpful or not.
I use them on a Voyager Pro and they work well
Only one.
No I bought for my jawbone
I have had one now for about 9 months hooked up to my 24" iMac and am very pleased with it. No noise and runs very cool. It is on 24/7 and holds a lot of HD Videos for playback on my network. I highly recommend it.
if they lower the price to 69 I will buy it right now at this very moment
At this moment I am pulling data off an external USB drive that appeared to be totally dead. Clack, click, whiirrrrrrrr and never came online. I froze it. Not kidding: http://www.emergingtechs.com/posts/put-your-hard-drive-in-the-freezer-to-recover-data/ Mine works for about 1/2hr until the drive warms up again, then back into the freezer. Given this scenario it makes sense to know what is critical, get it first, and get the non-essential stuff later. All my important stuff is already recovered and now I'm copying over 40GB of "nice to have" stuff. As soon as this process is over I'm going to improve my backup scenario!
No, the only input/output is USB2.
I think the barrell plug is the same size as your car lighter port
I thought it was always recessed? Perhaps its worth checking with the device supplier or manufacturer.
No, it is not an add on, but a regular security system in miniature size. Works the same as a full size system. Only has one video & audio input and output which is a BNC connector used with professional systems. This product comes with RCA converter plugs so you can plug RCA type cameras to this system. The only things you have to buy are the memory (SD card) and a security camera with either BNC or RCA connectors.
Yes, you can install 2x4GB modules. You should be able to install a 1TB HD. I have a mid 2010 and I have a hybrid 1 TB SSD and this one seems to be a 2011 model so it should be okay. Here are the full specs. https://support.apple.com/kb/SP619?locale=en_US
No, you can not. that can only be done for the first year. When we took them to the Apple store, that is what they told us. If your system is less than 1 year old, then yes.
Yes it did. There was a wireless mouse and key board included. Batteries in both were fully charged. Like new when purchased. I would order from here again. We've had ours for many years and it still works great!
Windows software, including Microsoft Office, wont's install on Apple iMac. There is Microsoft Office specifically designed for Mac products.
Yes, I'm using it for the same reason (add extra sata ports). You can disable the raid.
Yes
Yep. I use it to connect my VGA monitor to my dvi graphics card
Sorry, but I gave mine away. I now have an iogear. It is one piece with the mouse included and a dongle (or whatever it is called), on and off switch, etc. It is worth the price and you can probably purchase on Amazon for a comparable price.
Yes :) you just have to point it at the DVD player.
Yes, this item should be compatible with that camera model.
Mine turns off when the car is off
Unsure if you lost power, but the dull buzz may be from the batteries charging. If it doesn't stop after 20 min., I suggest you follow up with the manufacturer. Here is their link: http://www.apc.com/site/support/US/en/product/BR700G/
Yes it can.
Of course it will!
Cloth
I don't know - I use it on a conventional screen. It is pretty thick plastic compared to a screen protector, and is easier to scratch as well, so it may not be best for a touch screen. Just my guess.
It sounds like you are using this with a T.V instead of just a computer monitor. This device will turn a computer monitor into a T.V. If using with a T.V. then try this: do not hook signal from any antenna into the T.V. only hook the computer DVI or HDMI or VGA cable (whichever) into the T.V. The signal from the antenna only goes into the kworld device.
do not waste your money. the other part of the unit does not work nor does the base unit.
No. I can't. You may contact Garmin and see how you can download map of Venezuela. A charge may be required.
I would guess not, u need to run a app. So a computer or smart phone would suffice. If u have specific knowledge that it can let us know !!
Yes.You can hook up any device that uses an HDMI or AV cables.
Not sure but this thing is total junk. I have owned two and both broke quickly. Buyer beware!!!
I disregarded the bad reviews and bought these anyway. It lasted 2 minutes before it stopped working. This was a complete waste of time and money!
Any MP3 player that can be controlled using buttons on their headphones can use this. It works the same way. I have not used it with the Nano, but there is no reason to think it won't work since it works with iPhone.
No, it doesn't
Given these speakers smooth response, sensitivity they should do well in most 5.1 settings.
No, these are not self-powered speakers. They need some sort of amplification.
I have not tried it as a 3rd monitor but I see no reason why it would not work as a 3rd. The Mimo monitor receives both data and power from a single USB cable.
You can put in the standard booklet and back poster that come in store bought CD's.
14mm
'course! I've not had that issue with this case buuuuuuuuuuuuut there's a few things we can do! Firstly, make sure all the power cables to the fans coming from the case are connected to MOLEX/4pin power connectors (or the relevant ones for the fan you are connecting) and if it's still not receiving power and spinning up either A) Send the case in for replacement or B) Try a replacement power cable to the fan. Not really much more help beyond that which can be offered I'm afraid!
It's 6 or 7 pounds, I'm not really sure. I generally ship these in flat rate priority boxes, and I pay the difference in shipping cost.
If you buying from the same person I got mine are wouldn't buy. He lie are still have the item with me. It does not work. Amazon should stop doing business with that guy or company.
No, mine did not come with any cables, just the CPU. Power cables (with shipping) average $40.00 to $60.00.
Won't work with a 8 ohm coil. I use it with a 12" single 4 ohm via bridge and the amps couldn't handle it. I think you should get a different amps or get 2 ohms speakers.

As promised the cord length for these headphones is roughly 3' 7" they seems very solid, the packaging was very nice, minimal and easy to deal with. :)
It depends on what you're really planning to run for your video card. I use this card with two Radeon HD 7790 1GB cards in CrossfireX and it runs fine. But if you were to go any higher than that with video cards, you're going to want a bigger PSU.
Yes. This has a standard 3.5mm jack
Yes, these are 3.5 mm audio jack, which is what the kindle fire hd has. Should note that most ear buds are 3.5 mm.
As promised the cord length for these headphones is roughly 3' 7" they seems very solid, the packaging was very nice, minimal and easy to deal with. :)
NOT.
Yes. This has a standard 3.5mm jack
I had a cheaper model from this company that were DOA. I filed a claim on the Jlab website and they sent me a replacement pair very quickly. I don't know how long the warranty lasts. You will need the serial number from the packaging to file the claim.
As promised the cord length for these headphones is roughly 3' 7" they seems very solid, the packaging was very nice, minimal and easy to deal with. :)
These fit pretty good and I have deep ear canals. Worked fine at gym and when trail riding.
Yes the power supply is 100V-240V universal which can be used anywhere in the world. The plug is 2 pin USA standard.
I wouldn't know sorry. I got it for my TL-105 camera, but with my camera, it works great. It seems like a fast charge and the charge indicator light works perfectly.
No idea. Sorry!
There's a place for the suction cup to stick to. I love the pad. Every once in a while you need to rinse the bottom off with warm water. I've done 3 times in a year.
Yes, it will fit a 9"-10'' arm.
It does fit, BUT it is slightly too big and so the transparent cover breaks quickly on the sides. I would recommend an armband expressly for the Nano 1st generation
The AT-LP120-USB has an isolated power supply, so no grounding wire is needed or necessary. The ground between the turntable and your receiver is carried through the outer ring of the RCA connector.
No
You don't there is only 1 audio in that's all you get. Unless you get a mixing board you are out of luck. Did u get the Samsung kit from Sam's?
You can use either 4-pin or 6-pin cables with this card. Use whatever cable fits the hard drive. I use a 6-pin cable tp connect my DROBO external RAID system.
No. You have to hit it pretty hard. My cats are always running into the windows and they never set it off.
Well I can't say with 100% certainty, but I would say most likely not. I can bang on my window softly and it doesn't sound, but if I hit it hard, it goes off right away. I don't think the vibrations would be strong enough. Hope that helps!
No
R. I am not an expert on this but mine seems to fit ok. The poles are 12 ft so that the actual useable space is ten. I've never measured the width or length of the sheets. I just seem to have more than I need.
Yes. Haven't really measured but it is HUGE! Comes with black, white, and green.
You could do that, but it irons really well, so I would suggest that with some steam.
The stand should work well considering I do use a 10x20 muslin on it. My only concern is the weight of your backdrop. It may bow if too heavy. As for the grommet top, make sure to check the specs of the top tube that it is thin enough to allow your backdrop to move freely. I have to reiterate, the stands are durable!
Yes it does. Excerpt from the product description: "It is comprised of two tripod stands and four 3' cross bar sections and includes a heavy duty carry bag. The four cross bar sections allow for the stand to be set up in 6', 9' or full 12' widths. The cross bar interconnects are 6", the longest on the market, providing ample support for heavier backdrops. The tripod stands use air cushioned shocks, instead of spring shocks, allowing the fully extended stands to smoothly and safely collapse to their minimum height."
They are pretty strong connections.
Dimensions: 3.75" w x 1.5" h x 4.5" d (as written in the Amazon product page). I use one on my desk - it is stunning how good the audio quality is. We also use one in a conference room; works great. Highly recommended.
It will not charge the iPod but you will be able to hear the audio
Yes you can add your own backgrounds to the folder where all of the selections are held
I believe i may have one, but it doesn
It is 32bits
No s-video. And the proprietary video port on the side doesn't actually work with anything I've found
The surface is flat and can accommodate any size laptop you have. The fans beneath the unit can be snapped into location wherever needed so there is No configuration that cannot be addressed. We have four different types and sizes of computers using the same base. Hope this helps. I found these bases to be extremely helpful with our HP laptops (that are hot as the hinges of hell)
This particular one no. But I bought a similar version that did. so you have to ask the buyer

The Kymera Magic Wand absolutely does work with our Direct TV. It should work with any components that are programmable. I will say it takes a bit of planning to program the wand; then a little practice ... but once programmed it is soooooo much fun!!!!
Maximum capacity is 105 watts, and light socket cords 9'5" long.
No this is all for 110
Yes. I often use the headphones to hear all the dialog on some drama shows while my wife listens through the TV speakers. The volume on the TV can be adjusted separately from the headset that has its own volume controls. You can even mute the TV while listening on the headset.
I don't know 'cuz i use it for my iPhone & iPod
There are a lot of great songs on this card, and I wish that I could tell you what thet were. However, the card stopped working after only one month. That was a few years ago, so I don.t remember the titles now. When the card stopped working, I e-mailed the manufacturer several times regarding the issue. They never answered me. I think that for the price, the card should last longer than a month.
no, only American male/female voices/accents. however, you can purchase other languages. not sure how but it can be done.
If you are talking about 340TM unit (Lifetime Maps and Traffic), it does not have the Live services capability. The traffic on the 340TM unit comes through an RDS/FM receiver which is built into the car power supply. According to my experience, the traffic information is quite useful, e.g., it avoided closed roads in Boston. I have seen slow traffic reported only on highways but never on local roads (however, I've only used the unit for 2 days).
not sure
No
No. I am disappointed.
Mine clicked when i zoomed (i gave it one star), just fyi.
We use it with a Sony HXR-NX70U NXCAM and it works well at a fraction of the cost of the Sony remote.
Yes
Nope they don't . Just have to adjust the volume on your device. I use them on our TV and the sound quality is awsome! As a matter of fact I have to turn the volume down to 21 with them on and 47 with just the TV speakers. That's how good the sound quality is. And the bass sounds awsome!
I followed up on their site here is what is listed EZbackgrounds digital backgrounds can be used with most mid-level image editing programs. Compatible versions include all versions of Adobe Photoshop, Photoshop Elements and all versions of Corel Paintshop Pro. You can also use the free program GIMP. Sounds like it won't work for Lightroom 5.
no flash, therefore no batteries needed. You can buy one with a flash elsewhere.
You need 1/4" lag bolts 2" long to properly mount your tv mount. You want at least 1" - 1 1/4" into the wood stud. Do that and your tv will never come down.
No. Mine were very basic. No volume control, just earbuds.
they do not have any in line controls if they do they will be in the description of the product
I think the filter could be used for any kind of flash and Int/ext you just need to find a way to fix it.
No, but they give you a free link to get it from them so you can get the software no problem for no extra charge.
This may be more of software issue, rather than a hardware question.
No, you have to buy on separate
They sent the M2s to me. Hope this helps.
Yes it does. Im using it on my windows 7 and its working perfectly
yes it does
You can!
can anyone help in this ? im interested to get this too but living in asia
yes, should fit no problem
Perhaps if the tablet inside is in another protective case or pouch. This case is a convenient way to carry a small tablet and maybe a charger but offers little in fall protection.
I don't know the actual size of the Samsung Note 10, but it fits my IPAD with a keyboard cover very nicely. Sorry I couldn't be more exact.
It holds my iPad 2 very comfortably. It has nice cushioning and is very durable. I'm glad that I bought it.
No; You may compare it to an antena which helps you reach the router with ease. It provides you a longer reach than with the regular one in your computer.
I would think so. I have an SB800 and it works, so as long as the size difference between the two flashes isnt huge, I think it would work.
Honestly I don't know if it would work on your computer. If it's an Asus notebook maybe . Just look for the model number on the back and go from there. Good luck
Yes, it will.
Yes, it will
If by "actual" you mean the literal, physical camera you'd receive if purchased, then the answer is no. However, it is a photo of a Canon EOS 1D Mark IV. If you were to purchase this camera, you'd receive a Canon EOS 1D Mark IV camera as specified in the description of this listing.
Short answer is yes. They have a stand by mode, but shut off fully after a few minutes. In stand by, you can use the remote to power on or back into stand-by. I wish they would stay in stand-by, but it is probably designed to save batteries when not plugged in. I usually just leave them powered on and turn down the volume.
They light up where the clear is on top of the black at the bottom. These speakers sound great and are truly wireless. I would buy these again.
The Mount on most TV stands with VESA 600 x 400 have extra holes for 200x200, 200x400. 200x600 and 400x400. If yours is like this , you don't need an adapter. If it only has 600x400 the adapter should be able to shorten the distance between tv and mount. You may have to adjust the mounting screws for clearance between tv and mount by putting the head of the bolts towards the tv. Walt
4 3/4" x 5" tall, tip to tip straight up and down (not diagonal).
Yes. At least I can with my tv. I had to buy an adapter for my specific tv that only has Red & White audio outputs. So I bought the Red&white to headphone adapter. Plug red & white into tv audio out, and plug the headphone/aux cable that comes out of the subwoofer into the other end of the red&white cable. I was assume most newer tvs have just a headphone/audio out, so you may not need an adapter like I did. Amazon has the adapter: http://www.amazon.com/30S1-01260-Stereo-Female-Y-Cable-Connector/dp/B000I23TTE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1386790546&sr=8-1&keywords=AV+to+headphone+adapter
They should work with just about any device that has either RED/WHITE RCA output jacks ... OR ... a 3.5mm standard stereo output jack ... your ASUS has the standard stereo headphone output jack (3.5 mm) ... it will work, and YOU WILL LOVE THEM !!! !!! !!!
Yes, USB port is required.
There is none that I've noticed and we have wifi here in the house
Yes. The divider is attached via velcro. All dividers inside the bag are removable.
No. You can R and L click. It doesnt have buttons, so it appears that you can't Click left or right but you most definately can. Its a pretty cool mouse!
This SVAT VIS-300-7M2 intercom & video doorbell does not provide controls for the lock on your gate. You will need an electric door strike lock system installed by a locksmith/door security systems installer/expert in order to have that capability.http://www.securelockdirect.com/Electric-Door-Strike-s/72.htm
In the picture there's a top view and a side view if you put a coin or a screwdriver in the side you open it up and you put about two or three batteries a side of it
Sorry this is not possible. All GPS units are proprietary.
It's sturdy enough to type on and it wouldn't break if you rested your hands on it but it will lean a little bit not enough for your laptop to slip off but enough to notice that should be expected though.
Yes, the lighing still shows. Not quite as bright as it would otherwise, but it works great in the dark.
It can fit but not perfect.

I am sorry I don't know. My husbands is a new one and I don't know anyone with an earlier model.
Are you wanting to know if the Phenom II X4 955 comes with a soundcard? No. This package is just the CPU and heat sink/fan assembly.
yea itll work you should probably have a pro do it since you failed so many times theres no need to rid the world of these processors because someone keeps buying them and damaging them
The specs on Iogear's site say 1920 x 1200 @ 60Hz; DDC2B. So my guess is no.
You would have to ask the manufacturer but I don't see why not. I am running Windows 7 on one PC and OS X Mavericks on the second.
Yes it will fit an E-P1 and all other cameras with an M4/3 mount. The only lenses that will fit on it are Olympus OM's (from their prior film SLR days). To fit lenses with other style mounts you will need other, appropriate adapters. You must manually focus with this and any of the other cheap adapters and you need to be able to manually set the aperture of any lens in question (such as by a lens ring with click-stops)
not without a video card. the guy at geek squad told me not to waste my money (which was too late). Apparently it's a very complicated (and spendy) project to install a video card onto the new laptops. I ended up buying a new monitor that had both VGA and HDMI ports and gave my one-year old VGA port-only monitor to my mom.
Yes
hello, Battery 25+ is lenovo retail part # 51j0499. We have stock on this item and can ship the same day you place your order. We do not believe sellers should be able to list product with leadtimes . When buying a laptop battery you should always ask the seller if they are selling a genuine oem battery but more importantly if the battery is in the original factory sealed retail packaging. Regards LPC
It will fit in the laptop, but if you have two memory sticks, it is best if they are matching.
Sorry but I'm not sure. I have a compaq laptop but it worked just fine. Hopefully the seller will be able to help with your question.
No I do not. Sorry
HI .... I only had this unit for a short time, and then returned it! I don't believe it had a "Flash Drive" - Capability. ............. Regards, JCN.
Yes it does, I use it at times with my TV to put sound toward the kitchen
no hdmi port on this model
On the wall. Suggest you find the stud in wall though. Good product at great value, have bought several.
I mounted it on a single stud with a 46" flat screen and it's solid.
I have the Galaxy Tablet and they work perfect, and on my Galaxy Note as well.
Yes it does I did use it with a mac book air
Yes.
It's an on-board chip, but its can be ordered in HD.
Windows 7 64 bit
It should
yes
Yes, it will work nicely. I have one and use it with my Nikon F lenses on a Panasonic GF3. You have to set your E-M10 to shoot in "no lens" mode. I use aperture priority, which will say the f-stop is set to "0", or something like that. The camera doesn't know what it is. You can use full manual mode as well, if you prefer. The light meter in the camera will still work so it will automatically adjust the shutter speed for whatever you manually set the lens f-stop to. Manual focus only, of course.
This kit is for off-camera flash. It can work with any camera. I don't know what you mean by a cord coming with it. You will still need extra flashes to work with. If you buy them cheap, they will be manual control and need transceivers. I suggest doing some research. There are plenty of tutorial videos out there on beginner off camera flash photography.
This kit is universal that fits with most double din head units, if the head unit you have is around the same size as other double din units, then it should fit.
I noticed the same thing on mine. It seems to snap into place on the upper half but hangs out about .25" at the bottom. The whole deck is easily removed though. Mine is installed in my 2002 VW Jetta GLS.
Yes. I love it in my charger. You should have trunk space if not take some items out that you dont need.
Not unlessits ext cab u wouldneed a truck box
Yes , it will work without any problem ;)
Hi. If your old adapter 3pin like this so it will wotk absolutely
The device is designed to be plugged into a 115-250 V AC outlet or a 10-24V DC outlet using the provided cables. It is not a battery pack
I don't think it has a recording feature. I've read you can buy software to help it record but I haven't used it that way personally
When properly working the two green lights and top red light on each side will be lit. any other combo will indicate an issue with power.
Yes you can by plugging a 30 amp adapter pigtail into the 50 amp surge protector. Works fine. The manufacturer supplied me this information
I found this wireless product useless with the other Canon Rebel cameras I tried, so I wouldn't expect it to work with the T3. For some reason they pack no instructions with it, so the buttons are all just guesswork. But I did try every possibility. Buy a wired shutter release!
Yes it will work on T3 no problem
Yes it is.
There are two call buttons and only one pager (that sounds). So both call buttons (the round discs), can ring the pager (the square box).
I bought one for my son for his 1500 and he said it didn't fit exactly like it should so it couldn't charge effectively but as inexpensive as it is, sometimes it is worth trying because some other models of the 1500 might work correctly. I am sorry but I am not sure exactly what 15000 Dell Inspiron that he had.
not many cars power plugs work with engine off so no risk of draining battery , power cord usually plugged in and used by someone in the car while driving
Should. Rated at 19.5 volts, up to 4.62 amps.
I see no "PA" number any where on the unit. The model number is i1 100-240 input at 1.5 amps, output is 16 V at 4.5 amp center positive.
It will not work on a 1" pole. It is too large and will flop around. As for tightening, there is a second piece (the bottom half of the picture) that has a plastic piece inside it. That piece fits into the groove on the adtek arm (separate purchase) and allows you to tighten it down. Will not work correctly without the arm.
It should work with any apple pod or phone device. However when attached it shuts off the audio so you need earpods or over the ear set or a head set. Hope this helps.
I don't know, but it does a good job, and there's no obvious static after cleaning. I also store records in antistatic sleeves.
This unit is for pro use, All outputs are non amplified RCA jacks. The output goes to your amp, and your amp will provide power and connections to your speakers.
This amplifier is no way 1000 watts per channel each channel has a separate output control you should have no problems
No. You may be looking at about 50 watts per channel RMS if you are lucky. It is a cheap amp, with fictional specs and a poorly written manual. Lower your expectations.
Yes, it has headphones, mic1 and mic2
the sound quality you would expect from a 300 watt system is not there. on the lg their is a single wire hook up in the back of the tv, the only problem is you will lose (sound quality) from the tv to the sound bar. i would recommend the vizio sound bar. even the 100 or 150 watt system will give you a much clearer sound and will save you money.
Qwerty son!

It comes with a little antenna that even has a clip for your laptop screen or a flat monitor. Works okay. I wound up ditching cable and putting an antenna in my attic, but I tested this USB tuner for a while using just the included antenna and so long as you don't mind repositioning it occasionally when you change channels it works fine.
Well I don't see any reason why it shouldn't! It works fine with any reflex camara and the Blackmagic is about the same size and weight if I recall.
I received everything, including the stand, to make the system work as you would expect. You should attach a weight to the arm, opposite the camera end, to balance the unit. I use an old milk jug with about one gallon of water. I am very happy with my unit.
It's very stiff. Doable, but not easy. Perhaps over time it gets looser
You cannot. One side of the Peltier stage will be cold but the other is hot. The element will consume electricity and the overall effect will be heating the surrounding. This is how thermodynamics works. Placing Peltier inside the case it is like using a refrigerator inside a house to chill the air inside. In order to be effective, the other (i.e., hot side) should be outside the case or connected to a radiator that would transmit the heat outside.
Any 12 V DC power supply with current capacity over 8 A.
The mainboard in the computer I bought is an MSI Z77A-G41. It has 1 PCIe 3.0X16 slot, 1 PCIe 2.0X16 slot, 2 PCIe 2.0X1 slots, and 2 PCI slots. Also it has 4 DDR3 DIMM slots for up to 32Gbyte of memory.
It will be the price on amazom
It should, I did it on mine and still work fine.
The old one has **PASSTHRU**. The unit does not decode the DTS channel by itself. It passes the signal to the audio receiver. The audio receiver decodes it and outputs it to speakers. If you plug your old WDTV to the TV and have no audio receiver, you'll get NO sound. The WDBABF has native DTS decoding.
Yes you can use it with the d7000 and I can't rememebr the size of the battery I just know mine lasted me 3 hours
Probably ONE of the STUPIDEST questions I've ever heard! Out of HUNDREDS of receivers on the market what could possibly make you think that ONE of them is the best via the PS3? This is a very nice receiver and works quite well with the PS3.
No
Just files.
Only know that Windows XP to 7 work with it. Not too sure about Chrome stuff?
They have a headphone OUTPUT for plugging in a headphone to listen and an input of the same size for a line in cable ( to add say a tape cassette player) and a USB port
No, they don't, however, always lower the volume when not in use to protect the speakers. A surge of loud volume could blow them.
No, they don't, however, always lower the volume when not in use to protect the speakers. A surge of loud volume could blow them.
No. It is 17" wide and 5" high. Like in the picture.
You would need to use a cord from your Ipad to the Ipod connection, or into the AUX jack. Of course, the cord is sold seperately.
No, they don't, however, always lower the volume when not in use to protect the speakers. A surge of loud volume could blow them.
Yes, there is an auxiliary input on the stereo. The record player should be connected up via an unamplified output or from a headphone jack.

I don't think there is and I looked at some other questions asked about this unit and one other person responded that it is not equipped to plug in a turntable and play records.

no, it doesn't have AM tuner, but I dont care, as long as I don't listen to AM.. I love my Yamaha Micro Component, it does what I was looking for, to keep it in my kitchen and listen to my music on my iPhone- my son's Droid, or a CD.. :D

Contact outdoor tactical.com, they helped me and very nice too!
I have a 4s and it works for that model. Sorry I can't be sure for the 5.
If your camera is a Nikon you need to buy the Vivitar for Nikon flash, otherwise it won't work properly.
The battery fits, but it doesn't come out easily once you've got it in. It's nothing like the original
Don't purchase. You will regret it!
It's a one deck cd, dvd player.
The iPad yes, the computer must have bluetooth software.
sadly I am unable to locate a source for replacement earpads other than ebay. I suggest you ck on there
Yes
Hi it is a docking station its whete the unit sits no ac vent clips unkess you buy entire set up. Not sure if it will fit the starmate 8 good luck
No. But I really didn't get that far. Their third party software is a kind of a joke and the CD they shipped was corrupt. I just boxed it up and I'm waiting for an RGA to return it. If the company fails to make good on it I'm going to pitch it in the trash. I have better things to do than to look for fixes on the web for known issues. Don't waist your money.
Hello.....yes the GoPro does record sound...lol
Yes. I run a 5.1 system with this card.
It is interchangeable between the right and left side.
So far I have not had any issues. I love it, it works great for me. I have a 17 in laptop and my laptop site perfectly on it. It also has the mouse pad which works great and is very sturdy.
the strap is very long, long enough to wear cross-body, but adjusts smaller as needed. There is also a velcro for further adjustment.
Yes
By "splitter" I hope you mean a USB hub... Those work fine for me for low power devices, just remember the repeater used some of the power of the port it is plugged into... so higher powered devices like card readers and battery chargers may not work without a powered hub with it's own power pack... Potentially, some fancy keyboards may not get enough power because of backlights or other extra features. (I have not noticed this with any mice) Hope that helps someone...
There is more then enough room to care the items you are enquiring about. Yes!
Inside the main compartment there is a padded slot for a computer. You can, as I do, put your iPad there, but it will jostle around unless there is something else in there with it.
Just for design.
Here's a photo of the back of my nearly 4 year old SwissGear Granite. I wouldn't necessarily call it an "airflow" back, but the center is deeper than the sides. The sides were more plush when it was newer. http://i.imgur.com/vGgsO3J.jpg
It work very well with blue ray as long as its a wireless ready blue ray player
It does have a power switch on the back. As for the fuse, I haven't looked that close at the unit. If it's not on the back I'm sure it's very easy to open up the unit and change out a blown fuse.
No. Just general purpose usage and my opinion has not changed. The problem is the keys hang up and typing is impossible without major disruption.
Unfortunately not...But you can hook it on the back. For me its better, it make the backpack not to move with every single step and hit your back.
Absolutely. The only thing would be you would have tons of room around it. It fits my full size in an otter box. But I don't find the case to big and bulky so you could fit the mini and the case with room left for other items. I compare the size of it to being similar to a average box of cereal or a school book. It also has a nice outside pocket I use for my ear buds & charger. I hope this helps
This fits an iPad mini, perfectly OR something the size of the smaller kindle e readers. Not sure about a 10 inch tablet. In fact, I doubt it would fit appropriately enough.
It should work with any phone, tablet or computer. The connection is the universal plug in for audio and the volume control just adjusts the sound to your level. It isn't only for Apple products. Hope this helps.
No, they're just slightly larger than a regular size headphone. It's nothing like the humongous headphones in vogue.
They fold nicely but are not noise canceling
According to this review you can't, though I'd be interested if anyone found out that you could... http://www.macworld.co.uk/digitallifestyle/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=3276167
black
Please do not waste your money, this thing is so cheap and worthless I threw it in the trash.
estas antenas es solamente para computador no para otros accesos
According to the specifications page of the installation guide that comes with the card, it can be used in any standard PCI or PCI-X slot with a bus interface rated PCI (3.3V/5V)... I'm using my StarTech 7 Port card in an OLD SOYO (motherboard manufacturing company is now extinct) SY-6VCA, AGP video slot motherboard, circa 1999/2000. It's PCI slots are PCI v2.1/v2.2 compliant, 32bit, 3.3V, with 5V tolerant inputs. Hope this helps...
Greg, It looks like StarTech uses 'standard' spacing between each port, so the card will accommodate most modern USB devices. Any device that is too wide (anything much wider than a standard USB cable "type A" plug) would have to be plugged in using a short USB extension cord. All standard/modern "type A" USB cords will fit just fine right next to each other in the 4 available external ports.
It has USB 2.0 but not the newer 3.0.
NO! I returned the one I ordered, it was worthless. Don't waste your money.
I do not know, I have not been able to get this thing to work. I have tried it several times and have not been able to down load any pictures.
VERY faint noise. You really need to look at the display of number remaining to see if it took. Sometimes you think you pressed the shutter button but it hasn't taken the picture
The M is the mode button to turn it on and off, S button is the shutter button to take pictures. The batteries are to run the camera. If you recieved the CD run the program and take the tutorial, it will help explain alot. No it does not take a film or memory card. You can also contact www.vivitar.com for support. The lens as you call it is actually a screen that tells you different things,like what mode you are in,number of pictures you have taken.

I just plugged mine up and it automatically loaded the scanner software. I didn't have to add another program and it scanned bar codes into my current financial software. We were very pleased with them.
Hi Michael - It can work with with Clover POS if they provide to you the information on how-to program the scanner to send data into their "gooey" custom software. You can Plug-&-Play on almost all native Operating System applications (examples: Notepad, Spreadsheets, Web Browsers, E-Mails, etc.), but when it comes to custom POS Softwares - barcode scanners usually require additional programming-&-setup to properly throughput the data into the software's gooey data fields. Thanks Michael! Sincerely, The EDR, Inc. Team
I t did not fit my so I returned it.
It should. The only issue I've had is with my Canon flash timing out. That makes me have to manually turn it off and back on. I've missed some shots as a result. I don't remember if my Sunpak flash times out like that because I honestly don't use it much, but that is something to consider. Otherwise this unit is very dependable and for the price you can't beat it!
No, it's not. The diameter of the 18-135 Canon lens is 67mm and this wide angle lens will only fit on 58mm diameter lenses such as Canon's 18-55mm EF-S.
No, it will not fit.
Not much extra room in the case for charging cables if that is what you are asking. It is just a wee thing like a case for spectacles.
It is an exact fit for my DMC-FH8. If the FH-10 is larger it will not fit.
Yes
I have done that successfully.
the headset can be used as a phone, but it will mute the mic on the phone itself. Honestly, I think the phone feature is weak ... I no longer even try as the folks I speak with can't hear me well.
Take it off autochannel, use a fixed channel (1,6,11) and reset. Some wireless devices don't take well to channel jumping. Worth a try.
They are super flexible and you can spread them out quite a bit just pushing the mount down. It is nice for a compact tripod but you will want to use a remote trigger, any touch to the camera and it will pick up vibrations.
Here you go. Next time just use Google. Google'd "ex-g1 underwater" and this came up. http://www.flickr.com/photos/akiko_photo/4342988849/in/photostream/
The specs list: Rechargeable lithium ion battery (NP-80) x 1
It's pretty thin, I think it is a definite possibility.
I am told that you can use it.
According to the description info this card SDHC 16GB will fit your camera
In a round about way. Before your recording was captured on tape. If you camcorder uses a SD Card it is recorded to it for replay in the camcorder or you can transfer to a computer or TV or any device which will allow you to view it using an SD card.
According to the description info this card SDHC 16GB will fit your camera
Hold it on either end and twist it back on itself. It's tricky, but keep trying and it will go.
Sorry foxy I don't know. I would at least try Garmin Support at U.S. Toll-free: 800-800-1020
I finally got mine open. I had to push in on the battery compartment cover so hard that I was afraid that I was going to break it, while sliding it outward.
2 amps, or 2,000 mA. 500 mA per plug
Hole pattern is too small (lengthwise). Assuming that you are talking about a wall-plate such as an outlet wall-plate.
There is a place for an auxiliary cord that I use for my mp3 but no fancy "docking station" or usb
According to the description yes it is either ac or dc. Please see below. Product Description Color: Pink Sylvania SRCS243- PINK Portable CD Radio features, AM/FM radio, CD-R compatible CD player, Skip Search functions, 20 track programmable memory, telescopic antenna and AC/DC.
no
Hi Whitney, I tried to locate images if the back of the speakers to see if they have the two standard mounting screws but i was unable to. But as long as the speakers are not over ten pounds and have the the threaded slots for mounting screws it should work. Sorry it took me awhile to get back to this and i wish i had a better more definint answer for you.
There are many adapters,screws, bolts, and nuts in the packages. It would probably fit anything you have. Just as heads up, spend the extra cash to get something good. These are junk.
It is orange
That's what I use if for, without any degradation.
Usure as I do not have a 3D Tv. Sorry. But it does work great on HD Tv's
Yes. That's exactly what I used it for and it worked perfectly.
I think it depends on what your DVD has as an input vs. what the output from the computer is. Sorry I'm not more help, but without looking at it, it's tough to gauge. Sometimes even when they connect up, the device to which you input won't record.
I'm not sure about specific phones. I have a basic AT&T phone. It appears that it would work/plug into any average phone.
NO! I WISH!
Sorry, I am not sure. My macbook air was bought last year. I need to find a late 2008 aluminum MacBook and try on it.
That is correct, each set has a straight-line detection pattern. As such you would need 4 to cover all edges of your property.
The mini-USB on the TomTom is for charging and not data - it'll work for charging but don't expect the USB from your vehicle to work like an AUX.
Maybe. I use mine with a 3GS and have to take it out of my Mophie. The bottom has the pins for charging and the top is just the clamp to hold it down. It was made for the TomTom software, so remember to add that too. It lets you play music at the same time as the navigator, which is great.
You would have to overclock it. P5G41T-M/CSM LGA 775 Intel G41 native max speed is 1066mhz DDR3. The memory will work but not at its maximum speed unless that you overclock it. Hope it helps.
You are correct this cannot fit on a hot shoe and has to sit on a light stand. It is very heavy duty and I have not had problems with mine.
Don't know. I have a MkI. And furthermore, these didn't work at all. DOA.
Looking for this information as well.
This unit does not have back up guide lines.
iPhone is not a question. Are you asking if an iPhone will play on this? It has a standard 3.5 mm audio jack - like you'd see for headphones, mp3 players, etc. If an iPhone can have an audio jack or aux cable plug into it, then yes, it will work. Also, try using your head and reading the product description, which clearly states that it is Apple compatible.
A short delay, I would say less than a second.
Can't say for sure. It does have threads to attach to a tripod, so I would imagine something could be done. It would be the same setup as a camera. Hope this helps.
Not sure if there is a paper clip reset on the dropcam, but I would remove the app on your iPhone and install it again. Good luck!
it powers itself. You just should plug it in...
Yes it does.
skully, I have owned mine since February and I have frequent power outages. I have not once had to touch it when the power comes back on. It's pinned at 70*
I cannot answer that - as I have a Mac!
Hi Fannie, Part number KVR1333D3S9/4G is compatible and should work with the Samsung NP-X430-JA01HK based on the system's required memory specifications. Thank you for choosing Kingston as your upgrade partner. -Jewel, Kingston US Technical Support
Depends on the machine you are running the accelerator on. Check the specs match. Runs OK on my Acer with the Intel graphics chip.
Yes it does.
should be compatible with any computer which includes a USB port. Don't think the software will make a difference Please ask the seller as I have windows 7.
From user reviews, it appears this is a Realtek RTL8192 (RTL8192SU, maybe?) I wouldn't bet my life on it given the rapid way circuit boards in the "same product" change, but one Amazon reviewer did appear to get an RTL8192SU. It should work with Linux as noted on https://wiki.debian.org/rtl819x but possibly with "non-free" (meaning $0.00, but with restrictive licenses) drivers.
Don't know. May want to contact StarTech's technical support. Sorry :-(
Yes
The ASUSs with "-A#" have longer battery lives than the ones with "-X#" The UL30VT has a better graphics card (dedicated card in addition to an intergrated one) than the UL30A which just has integrated graphics.
The silver one has a better battery.. 5600 vs 4400, although both are 6-cell
Wait for the UL30JT
I like the Incase ( http://www.amazon.com/Incase-CL57328-Sleeve-MacBook-Graphite/dp/B002N9NGR0/ref=wl_it_dp_o?ie=UTF8&coliid=IDBPX6TZ8EVTU&colid=1YBZH7I8M5HE4 ), they don't have them for sale here yet but I've seen them inthe Apple stores for mac book pro 13" and is slim and very well protected and has a zipper for the accessories instead of the larger velcro one that BB has.
sorry jesse, im not sure if this specific model would work for your tv. i have a sony kdf-e50a10 tv. im pretty sure in the description they give you the model numbers its capable for. if i can remember right, this lamp and housing can be used on a number of different models. sorry i couldnt help more.
The TV I placed this is in is a Sony model KDF-E50A10
Yes it worked fine for me, Actually, it revived the TV to a near new picture level & gave it several more years of service :-)
No we do not sell any of our quick release plates at Wal-Mart
Yes.
Mine say 9-2022
Hi Paul, yes, this product will work for that.
Yes it comes with the mouse and keyboard. Monitor was separate.
From my experience working with these units you can only have the access point in one mode. However you can link the Bullet to a switch and have a Nanostation M2 Rocket M2 on that switch, and p;ace it in the router mode to resolve you challenge.
You can go to the ubiquiti web site and read the spec sheets on all their products. As far as the bullet is concerned I believe the newer one has 28 dBm.
Yes it is...
no it will not the firmware is not compatible with it, but if u like it sure run windows 7
no since i bought it from Amazon a few months ago
Yes you can.
As Far as I know it will but not for sure. Its supports repeater bridge mode and WPA2 enterprise encryptions, don't know if PEAP mode works with it though.
Yes, according to the Manual and specifications. Download the manual at http://www.tp-link.us/search/?categoryid=1047&keywords=901ND.
This will work with the retina MacBook, however if you are looking to mirror the display onto the iMac our use it as a secondary display. It has to be a 27in mid 2010 iMac or newer to support that functionality
Yes
Yes
About 6.5 inches long/width. 4.5 inches high. About 4 inches deep (lens when closed). Lens opens up to about 1 inch. Hope that helps.
Not sure, but it is easy to tell which is a higher degree. We don't worry about the words andjust go with degree in choosing our setting.
No
This cap can hold any amount of wattage it will only give the boost of power to a certain amount of wattage. In other terms your car electrical system will be perfect if you buy this with your 1500 watt amp.
Yes to both.
Get a new TV!!! I reported a similar issue to Amazon, they replaced the TV and 6 months later it died. ProScan makes poor quality televisions.
If your cable box is HDMI compatible - then use an HDMI cable - best quality picture and sound
Most 13-inch and larger televisions manufactured for the United States market since 1999 and all units as of January 2000 are required to have the V-chip technology. Many devices similar to the V-chip have been produced.
Yes is the same model of mine and it worked.
Yes, it comes with software for you to convert your vinyl records to a digital recording. Installation and use are both fairly easy. It also plays like a "regular" record player.
Yep
Yes it works with all canon cameras. It is just an extension cord for your regular flash.
No, the volume is entirely by the device where you plug
no since i bought it from Amazon a few months ago
Yes, We can ship it today. It should be delivery in next 4 business day.
Does not have.
Yes
Hi, It shouldn't be as long as you have HDMI ports on your TV. Here is the link to the manual: http://www2.yamaha.co.jp/manual/pdf/av/english/FSS/YHT-S400_om_en.pdf Thank you.
The side bars are about 1" thick and the top is maybe 1/2" bigger.
I currently have 2 backdrops on mine, I suppose it would as long as the Vinyl is not to heavy.
Typically round go in ceiling and the rectangular go in the wall but we have seen customers use either in each application.
Yes they do
Yeah
1 round circular which would be like a shoot through diffuser , but comes with zipper cover to convert to black, silver,gold or white , it is very nice i like mine a lot , very handy , works very well and very affordable, I checked them out at my local camera shop and for just a shoot thru/silver one was $40.00, I am so glad I purchased this one, the quality seems of the same as the one at store, trust me you will like it and for an exceptional price , Good luck happy shopping.
Yes, USB plug and Play
All I can say is it worked on my Asus MB running XP SP3. Also, although it has 6 connections, it is a 5 port card. If you use the inside port then one of the outside ports will not work. If you use all 5 outside ports then the inside port will not work. The card is USB 2.0 or 480 Mbit/s However, the effective throughput is about 35 MB/s or 280 Mbit/s. This is the case with most if not all 2.0 and is considered High Speed.
Yes with any laptop as long as it has s-video out put
It will actually be based on pinetrail (single core) processor which will be a step back but increase battery life
It will if you get the EF-M lens mount (Canon EF-M Lens Adapter Kit for Canon EF / EF-S Lenses 6098B002).
It will if you get the EF-M lens mount (Canon EF-M Lens Adapter Kit for Canon EF / EF-S Lenses 6098B002).
Its a DC lens. Not made for full frame. It fits but the corners are gone. So no i wouldnt use it for full frame. Get a 17-40 canon
Hi Tim W. It is just an imput that is connected to the rear usb of a radio, but it all depends on the radio you are using. Some Radios are capable of charging a device others not. In my case I just use it for playing music stored on a usb flash drive.
I bought this along with a marine head unit for my dad's boat it is simply a usb extension cord and femal headphone jack to rca cable. So if your a4 has a usb on the back of the head unit(stereo) and rca inputs on the backthat you want to make more accessible then this will work. We use it to hook up phones and i pods to listen to music on the boat
No
I don't know the exact length, but I can tell you that they are WAY long. Longer than I needed to mount the JENAUX in the right hand glove box of my 2013 FLTRX. I have the excess cable coiled up and zip tied inside the fairing of the bike.
Yes
Desert50, How am I supposed to know? I just told the company what I had, a 2002 Dell GX280 destop. The first shippment were the wrong sticks so I sent them back. The second time they were right and my GX280 will take DDR2 or 3.
This is just one 1gb stick
oops - sorry - I thought this was the last order I placed - I purchased 4, each was 1 GB
I dont know for sure but if you ask the guys that are selling it they can help you out. They answered all my questions really quick and they were very helpful.
yes it is
For sure it fits the a33, that is the one I have.
No it will not. In any case that is not the application which was advertised. It is too bad Amazon works with third party vendors who debate customers as to whether the product has any value or application for them. It is a throw back to the old days when your money was not simply and cheerfully refunded. We find the process annoying and discouraging as to future purchases.
Jennifer yes please call us at 1-800-495-8148 and we can process your order.
I have owned a few different make KVM switches and have not gotten past the wireless issue. In my experience the PC's are unable to recognize the hardware due the conflict between the USB connection through the KVM and the wireless connection. If you have an extra USB receiver plug one into each PC and eliminate the keyboard/mouse hardwire connection altogether.
It should work fine. Better would be to send an email to Startech support and ask the experts directly.
Nope. Good try. Call Mixrosoft and see if you can get 1 transmitter for both.
Kinda late, but if you still need to know, I wouldn't be worried about compatibility. You might need an adapter though. I don't know what ports a mac mini has.
The answer is simply: not very far. If you use all The lighting units in the set and assuming there's no other significant source of light you'll need to be less than 8 to 10 feet max from the subject
No, yo can not, its rated only for 110v.
The base is fixed and it is not made for it but I guess you can pull it off with some Mcgyver engineering
You need to buy a harness specific to your car
Yes it will
Yes, it will!
The whole dressform is covered with a black stretch material. The foam layer is below the black, to give it some cushion and for easier pinning I would guess. My daughter loves hers!! I hope this helps.
The one I bought is a size 4 - you need to purchase (search) using the size you want. You buy them by size.
2 gigs
Yes, it comes with an AC adapter. With the right mechanical adapters, it can be used with European 240V without a voltage converter.
They worked just fine for mine
It should. I bought mine in 2011 and I don't think they change much, if at all.
Sorry I don't know.
I have a MacBook I'm not sure, sorry. Mine quit working. I would look at other manufacturers.
yes, with room to spare- since it can accommodate up to 17.3" laptops. 16.9 is just a little smaller, so you should be fine.
The entire unit measures approximately 25.25" and the cable length is approximately 21.50".
You can only use one of your inputs at a time so you have to manually press the button for the device you want to use.
It looks to right. As long as the numbers coincide you shouldn't have a problem.... The replacement battery I received a while back hasn't given me any problems. I hope this helped you :)
No, other than falling apart the sound recording quality left much to be desired.
I have no idea. Your model is not one they covered in the comparable seagate products. If the voltage is right then there is a good chance the plug that goes into the Hard Drive id the right size but that is no guarantee.
Sorry, I don't know. And I can't look for that hard drive with a serial number, I'd need the model number. If memory serves, and it has been quite a while since I bought this (for a HD at work and I've now retired) it is a circular plug which, as the ad states, provides 12V.
i bought it as a gift and have no idea. sorry. but many blessings from God instead.
I don't know. I've got two of these and have never had an issue although they do look a bit fragile. I'd guess at the ear piece.
No, if you l505 is intel compatible it uses an 800 bus cpu.
I believe their sold in pairs, you can use this for center rear if you have that option with your system.
100 watts each
Yes it will plug into outlets there but will not convert 230V to 110V so you need to be careful what you plug into it.
It's a normal 4 chnl amp. Ground and power it well, decent for the cheap price.
Hard to say as I don't know what your input power is. Its safe to say that the amp will not over drive your speakers. Note that the manufacturer says not to use a 2 ohm speaker. I've had my amp for 3 months with no issues. I highly recommend it for a 4 ohm load.
It should, Im actually typing this on that model, powered by this adapter.
Yes
Sorry i am on eastern time.
I wish I could respond specifically to the question. I purchased the FOFA a couple of years ago but don't recall battery life being an issue. I just remember that the device started becoming unreliable in being able to find my keys. I made various tests with it and found that even in "easy to find" situations the device's performance was inconsistent. So I gave up using the FOFA.
The FOFA has up to 36 combinations. You would need to set them up so they would not conflict with your friends codes; otherwise, yes, you could press a number and your friend's device could beep if it is programmed for that same number. I'm sure with the 36 combinations, you could work something out. Hope this helps
It will hang over as mine does, but it is so clear, you don't see it. Built boy tough.
The power adapter and software comes with it. The antenna is a screw in kind and is in a separate baggy
will it work outside. yes. will it handle weather? no. If you are looking for an outdoor camera foscam makes a few good ones that are affordable. They look like long gray/white rectangles. This one will not handle weather, but the other ones will! good luck.
It is primarily a metal lens. There maybe some internal parts that aren't metal or glass, but it is metal on the mount and exterior. I would say that it is a good focal length for portraits, but is a little sharp for such a purpose. Of course, you could always soften things in post.
It depend on the product, if it is second hands no warranty. condition new, have japanese warranty. possible to send to Brazil but take more time to get it. Thanks
not to many full size socket 775 mobos left out there. best bet is to find one on Amazon. Socket 775 are old tech.
No...
I used this CPU to replace my Pentium D 2.8GHz CPU. My desktop boots faster roughly by about 15 seconds. Also overall its is more responsive. Though its not earth shattering but that was a welcome change to this older desktop. Is it fast? Not very fast but I am happy with this cheap upgrade. Also it depends on which processor you are comparing to.
The top has a ledge that sits over the top of the TV. On the back of that ledge, there are two slits where a strap goes through (which cant be seen at eye level) that can then be tied to something (like the wall mount). This setup supports the unet almost entirely. There are 4 Velcro prices that attach the sheild to the front of the TV. They are more to add a spacer for airflow between the sheild and TV, and to prevent the bottom ledge from swinging forward if the TV is angled down.
Have you considered a Roku box? Designed to stream Netflix and Amazon content; does not appear to work with Hulu.
yes, there is a socket below the earpiece
Hello Douglas, These items ship the same day, as long as we have the order before 3:00pm that day of receipt. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
Yeah
It controls your device's like ipod and start phones. On click to play and pause, two click to fast foward, three clicks to rewind.
Sorry, I do not know if it works with I Mac. Can u email manufacturer's website?? Good luck
Ours came with Windows 7 Home
It'd be hard to since it is quite a small screen.
Ours came with Windows 7 Home
Better to be safe and not get it if it only says 65. There is a reason they put a size limit on it. It might not even fit on tv. Find the right size. Trust me. Not worth risking your tv breaking or wasting money.
thats what I'm using for one thing upset me though its not a pentium 4 3.2ghz its a duo core 2.3 still works ok for gaming for now anyway hope this helps
yes it will work.
Yes it will need a long clip on antenna for Short Wave. I use a 3 foot long clip on wire and move the radio around until you can hear the broadcast clearer. Typical for Short Wave. Keep the radio away from noise makers.
I haven't tried any gaming on this product, sorry
I donot exactly know whats the new QC3 you are talking of. could you please post a link for it?
mine has wires sounds amazing
Headphone splitter if u wanted the same audio stream, yes.
yes hard wired but with removable clips
If your Lenovo has a mini displayport, then yes.
If I'm understanding your question correctly, then I believe the answer is yes. In my configuration, I have a MacBook Pro laptop (undocked and closed) and a Dell laptop that is docked (also closed). Both laptops remained closed at all times while I'm using my dual monitors. If I happen to open the Apple laptop, then the laptop screen becomes primary and one of the external monitors becomes the expansion screen. I'm sure this could be changed or altered using your computers configuration settings also. Hope this helps.
Not sure about that but it works great with my X-E1.
I would say its not worth the gamble. For about $50 more you can buy the OEM equipment and install it yourself. Its a far better way to ensure you get a functional product and not deal with any potential issues.
I was not happy with how it worked with my iPod Touch. It almost had to touch the antenna to even be heard.
yes it does.
I was wondering the same thing..
This speaker will work with either a blue tooth enabled device and it also has an audio input jack and cable.
Yes. The posts are adjustable.
Better than fifteen feet. I don't know the maximum
I'm sorry Jean. I don't know the answer to your question, but I can tell you that it is very slow. I am a hunt n peck typist and even with my slow speed, it would miss letters because it was still sending the previous character. I liked the big, easy to read keys but gave up on it because of it's speed. Haven't had the speed problem with any other keyboards. Good luck.
I'm sure it will, I don't have a 4K tv yet, but I hooked this up from my new Denon 4K, 3D receiver to my Sony tv and noticed the picture improved. Even regular DVDs picture improved. I had an 8 year old HDMI cable I replaced.
It's suction Cup mount. It's NOT an antenna but a wire that you stretch out...you can buy a metal antenna for it (Amazon search "BC355 external antenna"). Hope this helps.
regular power cord and a lighter plug for the car.
yes this unit has a speaker. BUT I RETURNED THIS UNIT. TOOOO HARD TO PROGRAM!!!
Yes. I use mine on an 8560w.
Yes. Should work with the 8460. Works great 5 star rating from me.
This is a DX (APS) lens. It will give you full coverage on your D5000, but will function as a manual lens for both focusing and exposure. It will also work on your D800, allowing you to expose automatically using aperture priority. The lens doesn't give you full coverage with the D800, however, and the result will be a circular image (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Ken Rockwell has an excellent review on his web site http://kenrockwell.com/tech/8mm-f35.htm.
Yes it does work with the 60D.
Of course it does... I have a 7000 ;) Its a great kit. Just try to control the light and aperture and enjoy new limita! I felt in love with hdr using this lens.
Yes, that's corect.
Derrick, I'm not sure there is a 100% accurate answer to this. I imagine there are some places where you would not need one, and others where you will. I would recommend picking up a power converter, and if you need it great if not, you have it just in case. Sorry that's probably not the answer you were looking for.
No -- all 7 ports are usb 2. I doubled the RAM to 16 GB and added a 256 GB SDD drive and upgraded to Windows 8 -- makes it very fast. Wish it did have USB 3 ports.
can I up grade to 2GB I just want to know before I BUY IT thanks
Only if you had a suction cup mount for the smartphone. I used Elmer's glue to keep the suction cup adhered to the pad.
Yes, you can move it at any time. Make sure you remove the backing paper when you first use it. When not on your dash put the backing paperback on or use plastic wrap to keep the backing clean.
Probably need one size larger
Hogtunes website shows this model, Big Ultra Kit (4405-0210) fitting your bike. I would recommend you checking the website for yourself to be certain.
no.
2.0
I believe it did come with the power cable, cant remember though been a while since I got it.
Woops!
They told me, they will send the DRIVERS, if you need them. They never said anything about the SDK. The SDK exists, but it is not free.
I have the FS88 installed on Windows 8.1. Once you receive the unit, there is a paper that tells you to email the manufacturer. Once you've done that, they'll send you a link to the drivers. I had no problem installing and the scanner has been working without problem for over 6 months.
They might fit but i had to cut the sides to make mine fit. I have diamond audio d3s. Hope this helps
I have ran up to 300ft and it worked as long as you don't exceed the current rating of the power supply.
No, it has a hard shell. More for looks and protects it from getting dirty. But I do love keyboard protector that comes with it. Best one ever
It didn't work, first it only last for ten minutes and aftet it didn' accept charging and couldn't work on my laptop without plug it to power..I don't advice anyone to buy this product
Absolutely. Each is rated for 1875W. I use mine with a desktop PC, range extender, monitor, and printer running simultaneously.
No, they are on-ear and perched right up there, they'll slip off. Also made from brittle plastic, they don't take abuse
Bob, did you ever find out? I just ordered the camera and want to know the same thing! Thanks for any help.
A rechargeable one that's included with the camera.
Bob, did you ever find out? I just ordered the camera and want to know the same thing! Thanks for any help.
I just got a standard tripod and it works fine with my Bloggie.
I hated this camera and sent it back as fast as I could. It's a waste of money. It never did what I needed done and I sent it back years ago. Can't believe it's still for sale.
No and the camera often has trouble focusing. So lots of your photos will be blurry
Hi, this Sony Camcorder doesn't have any microphone jack (IN) for external mic. -Ely
I think it will hold up to a 32 Gb. It might be 64, but sure it isn't higher. The largest one I have is 32 that I've used.
The HDR-CX150 is made in China.
No this is a camera with a fixed lens attached
Hello. Yes, It comes with a wall charger. It also can charge by USB Cable (Included) Hope this helps you!
Yes there is.
I hated this camera and sent it back as fast as I could. It's a waste of money. It never did what I needed done and I sent it back years ago. Can't believe it's still for sale.
goto an electronics or camera store and test fit.
It has a LOW LUX mode.

Supposedly it can be a webcam and it is one of the reasons I purchased it. However, I returned it in a week or so. It's a horrid little camera. It was difficult for me to operate and many of the features were less than useless. Personally, if I were you I'd look for something else.
Pretty decent. Zoom looks grainy at times but sound wise id say this is a great little cam!
http://www.scancat.com/OnLineHelp/OEM_Radio_Owners_Manuals/PRO-163-164-OWNERS%20MANUAL_2000164_PM_EN.pdf After you download the manual take a look at page 4. The Volume control has another fatter knob toward the bottom of it that functions as a squelch. Good Luck Mike
I've found there is a delay when switching between ports. It goes black and there is usually a few second delay for my connection to be recognized then it will show on the screen.
It fits an Iphone 4 WITH a lifeproof case.
4 feet
should not have a problem, hooked up to my comcast hd box and marantz receiver works great. and you do have the ability to make hard copies unlike devices that just play back.
It does and it works well.
I would fix the problem by separating the audio track from the video track and shifting it as necessary to synchronize them. Any decent video editing software will have that capability. You may also want to consider recording the audio track to a separate file and then replacing the embedded audio track in the video. You can either use an external digital recorder to do that or use something like Audacity to create the audio track within the computer - no external equipment required.
Im not sure. Depends on how much memory is required. This netbook has very little & is more of a tablet type use pc
I'd like to know the answer to this question also.
AJB, you are correct that they are not the same, they are indeed quite different. You hit on almost all of the differences, here are the other two: - the 1005PE-MU17 has 802.11 b/g/n whereas the 1001P-PU17 has 802.11 b/g - the 1001P-PU17 has Bluetooth and the 1005PE-MU17 does not
I dunno. ..mine is slow so I abandoned it. Use it only temporarily
Yes you can, if Internet connection is over 5G or it depends of router data transmitting.

No connect it to a little repeater that has an Ethernet plug. Edimax is good.
I know that it works on 10.6. Not sure about 10.4.11
Hi Mina, please check on the link to check out the available batteries compatible with your camera.
Hi - video importing doesn't work for me. I'm using Win 7 pro....not home premium. I'm using the latest version of PMB (5.2), it simply does not recognize the camera connection at all. I've tried connecting it to 2 computers and used different USB ports. I'm out of ideas.
I hope its not to late, post was May 13th, and its the end of June. When the HX5V first came out it was $350, I pre-order mine through sonystyle, I got a discount though. I've never had any problems with my camera and I've had it since March 2010. I don't blow any pictures up, I just take them and put them on my computer, then a back up hard drive, I've never had any poor quality pictures. I can't upload photo's here, but if you want to see, I can send a few.
It did not for me.
No power cord like everyone said.
This box is ALL RCA or S-Video..so I would say "depends"..you would need your own volume control. In theory you could run it though one of the RCA outputs..but it is not really "logical". Not sure if the RCA output is strong enough for a headphone input. Since it goes through wireless and then a mobile headphone amp..it might be . You need to check your user manual , if the wireless send unit is RCA compatible.
How can I connect my Bose companion II speaker to P2770HD?
Hi Michael. Yes it will work.
I did not buy for high speed video movies. To me the meaning of high speed is more in reference to high ISO speed (~film ASA) that you get with Exilim sensor for low light. Very happy with that. The HD video in normal motion is excellent, but slow-motion video resolution is degraded. See http://youtu.be/U3JfGw8YfeQ
Contact Mutant through their website: Contact Us&gt;Product Support. Click on "New Ticket" and complete the online form. They are very responsive. I contacted them when I had a problem and they advised me to return the radio for a replacement. Service was very fast.
I don't know - I keep mine plugged in all the time and do not use the battery.
No. The device has a station list from which you make your selections. No access to Pandora, Spotify or other paid services. Music stations are available from several countries.
wifi was fine on mine but I had to enable it. The machine did have usb ports - and a dvd burner. I cannot recall about sandisk.
The distance is about 4 inches.
In my 2008 Ford Fusion there was an additional wiring harness (from Amazon) that I had to solder into the replacement radio harness. Not hard if you have the experience and a good soldering iron.
You should be okay with that. Just be sure not to overpower it or you will blow the sub. I've used underpowered amps on mine and they sound amazing!
No there isn't. I wouldn't even advise you waste your money on this item
Yes , most likely but Scoche usually sells great mounting kits. Check it out.
5 RCA jacks. 2 for Audio Output, 1 for Video Output and 1 for Subwoofer Output and 1 for Camera input.
I don't know, but I will tell you that the 3500 ndx is garbage it overheated on me stopped working I sent it back when it was returned to me,that same day I installed it and it started smoking. Do not get it, if you have one send it back that's just my opinion
This amp at 4 ohms is rated at 1500 watts max and 750 watts rms. Your subs are rated at 800 watts rms & 1600 max so this amp is perfect to push them with. Now how long will this amp last is anybody's guess. Remember you get what you pay for.
Yes and try not to go abovd 1200 watts that way you can get the best out of it. I bought a terminator series subs and my kia optima pounds like hell. Enjoy it!
Yes but ours didn't last long before we threw it away. Maybe we just got a defective one.
THIS IS ABSOLUTE JUNK. Stay AWAY from this product navigation or not.
This amp puts out 225W at 4ohm so im guessing you could run it in 2ohm bridge for about 300ish watts
Means it has 4 drivers also I have these in my car you'll need a amplifier to really appreciate these speakers
The JVC BN-VC 121 Data Battery will fit this camcorder. Try B&H Photography if you can't find it on Amazon.
Hi, It has inbuilt 8 gb flash memory. Additionally you can use SD card and select where you want to record. This is an amezing SD camcorder for home use.
I received this camera from my father, during a visit, and played around with it a bit, recording and getting used to it, then I tried inserting the mem card into my 2010 MacBookPro and it can not read it, I can't find the booklet nor the software, I am looking on amazon to find out more about it ....
Just tried it in my zs10 no go... camera powered up and said battery could not be used.. (yes I charged it first 8^) )
Yes - 2 prong American plug. I think the prongs fold. I am not where the charger is, but that what I recollect.
Yes, I use it with my Windows 8 Asua Vivobook and it works fine.
I bought an HP computer that didn't come with a CD Rome drive I tried to watch a movie using this product and it didn't let me however I had a text booked on a CD and it will let me to view what was on the CD it says in the description that it should be able to be used on any kind of computer however I'm not sure
USB printer cable fits any printer ... the problem I had was it was to short so I order a 10 ft USB printer cable. ... To short of a cable
Yes..... it'll work on 99 % of the printers manufactured in the last 10 years.
I honestly do not know if there will be any conflicts, but I have used the cord on several devices and not had any hardware issues with it so long as the devices 'recognize' each other.
It works with a SONY DSC-W100. It might be wise to check your manual or look on-line for information about the W710.
If it is a 32 inch tv, then yes. It should fit fine.
Yes
This is not for cell phones. It's designed to use with cordless home phones, and has a 2.5mm plug.
Yes, you are right. The 75 x75 holes will be used for the screws
I have know idea, I accidentally hit "No" in an email. Sorry for any inconvenience.
Yes it will. I was using it on my landline phone (Panasonic KX-TG7431). However as I said, the plastic headpiece will not last long. I would recommend a headset with a metal band, rather than hard plastic.
i have my ps3 and my cable plugged in to the splitter. works just fine. the only problem for me is that if i want to switch from one to another i have to get up and push the button on the splitter.
If it works at all. Mine was broken when I received it.
Nope. That's why I bought it, now it sits in the drawer--useless.
Yes
I am not sure. I think the Powershot needs to have an option where you can turn on the remote control in the programming. I use it for the camcorder because it has that option. Otherwise, it will not work. Why don't you send the question to the seller or manyfacturer. They should know the answer.
Really cannot say with certainty, I'm using it with a VIXIA HF M31. Seems to be doing the job.
Yes, I think so. However, the sensor in bmpcc is much smaller than normal m43 image sensor, so you might not get the field of view you want.
I doubt it. The Fotasy AMMD is for attaching old Minolta SLR lenses to micro 4/3 bodies, including the GH2. The Panasonic DMW-LW46 Wide Angle Conversion Lens is not Minolta or micro 4/3. It mounts onto a DMC-LX3 camera (with a DMW-LA4 Conversion Adapter), to give that camera's built-in lens a wider field of view.
Not sure what an FAT32 is, sorry. All I know is that its pre-formatted for the PS3 and that it backs up downloaded video, music, and photos. I think you you can back up saved game files but not game content. I hopes this helps.
This mount works with Dynex 32" DX-32L150A11
standard hardware include.
just a ballpark guess I'd say 10 inches tall. It is wide enough to hit two studs, provided you've got standard 16" spacing between them.
Yes it will, but if your TV is larger than 40" or heavy it will sag and not be level. I have a 65" TV mounted on it and it sags noticeably. I only pull it away from the wall to access the connections on the rear of the TV, then push it back against the wall.
It's a 4 pin connector. I do not know what the cfm of the fan is though.
The front of the unit has a fold down door with a lock tab at the top to hold it in place. You push down the tab and the door drops. Behind the door is a small piece of foam to act as a dust filter.
My drives stay circa 20-25F above ambient. The description notes 3 X 3.5 inch drives.
I have a card of 16 GB Class 10 and storage aproximately 4 hours.
Puede servir si le cambias la fuente de poder. Por que es de muy poco W.
I know this does not answer your question, but it works with Windows 8.1, and usually the problems of compatibility come with the latest OS. And it also works with Mac OS X Maverics. But, judging by their forum it works with their latest drivers V. 2.10: "Version 2.10 is the latest, and was written to address issues with Windows 7 and Windows 8." http://forums.contourdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=8 I hope this helps, and you can always return it if it doesn't work, but I bet it will, I love mine :)
Yes you should be able too.
Yes you cam, best way to use as battery life is on the short side.
I used a thumb drive since I had around 500 pics.
It works with my a205-s5804. I don't believe there will be a problem with it working for yours.
pc2-5300F is ECC RAM most commonly used in Server Mobo's. Does your pc intel call for PC2 5300F? If not this RAM will not work, and will not fit either. http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/311582-difference-between-pc2-5300f-and-pc2-5300p-memory
Yes
The stereo will work but I am not sure that the navigation will however I am not sure about that. I do not know if they have maps for trinidad loaded.
It is suppose to but on both my windows and mac machines it did not work.
yes you use a regular harness. you match the wiring on the deck with the existing wiring in your vehicle. the 2V outputs are additional RCA outputs for add on amplifier set ups
Yes, if you are referring to the RX100MIII with the Sony AGR1/AGR2 style grip. The lens is the tightest fit in the case and the small grip should fit fine. Especially if that end of the camera is set in the bottom of the case since the case tapers towards the top.
I can't imagine that it would. My Sony DSC-HX50V barely fits in there. Compare the dimensions of the two to decide.
I am sorry as I do not know the size of a DSC H20/B is or it's size. I would go into a camera store and look at the cases and try one with your camera. That way there is no guessing and you will be happy with your purchase.
Hi Victoria, this Sony DSC-RX100M will fit properly on this Sony LCSCSU/B. -Ely
The device I received is a true Sony part.
Yes you can. I used it in India. All you need is a Universal adaptor. Here is the way you connect. Buy World Traveler Universal adaptor. This has wall connector for any country in the world. Connect this first to the wall. Connect your batter charger to the universal adaptor. You do not need to worry about 240V or 120V etc. The batter chargers takes any input. Does this help?
honest answer I have no clue.
We charge $3.99 to ship the first module and $.50 per each additional part.
Sounds like you ether mixed the type of memory and your system does not allow this ECC and Non-ECC or you are using the wrong combination of slots or wrong memory for your MoBo
Short honest answer, I don't know (of course, that's the short honest answer for absolutely anything). However, if all the specs are the same, I've no reason to think it would not work. Dell and HP basically just put together stuff as opposed to making, say, motherboards. Or memory for that matter. If the specs fit, there's no reason why it shouldn't work in your system. And if, for some reason, it doesn't, I believe Amazon has a fairly generous return policy, altho (grid willing) I've never had to use it.
It just auto scan
THe Wrap 310 requires 2 AA batteries to function.
An RCA (composite) adapter and an iPod adapter (cannot be used with teh lightning connector).
I have no idea, sorry.
I purchased that kit, and it was the IS II
It should work fine, but it will be clocked down to 1333. On that board, you really don't need memory with big heatsinks like this if it's going to underclock, anyway; you might as well save yourself a little money and buy a couple of these: http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-1333MHz-PC3-10600-Non-ECC-KVR13N9S8/dp/B008CP5Q7M/
Don't know.
not compatible with I pad, it is not wireless it has a net work port for a hard wire,
Don't know.
If you shoot weddings, I'd go for the f/2.8. But, if you've been happy with the f/4 and never felt the need for the 2.8, I'd stick with f/4.
Don't know.
All Terrain Binoculars. Suspect it has more to do with marketing than anything significant.
Yes it does work, using it currently
... I'm wondering this also.
No, unless you're a student of Rube Goldberg. Better off finding the solution you seek, then buy it.
Recommended image size is between 80 and 100 inches however it can project up to 150 inches
this tem is not good for conferences. no light enough. you need to close all the windows and turned off the light. only way you could use it.
I bought one too, rain shouldn't effect it at all as it is made of a thick nylon thread
You cannot - it can only record the show in the resolution in which it is broadcast (HD or SD).
There are more detailed instructions on www.visibledust.com on how to use a wet and dry clean in pdf form. I did receive a brief explanation on how to clean on a small piece of paper that came with the product, but the online instructions are better.
Yes.

Yes I have the radio plugged in
It works.
The PTV1000 is only compatible with I3,I5, and I7 2nd or 3rd generation Intel processors with Windows 7 OS. I don't think the Ipad has any wireless display capability.
I don't know what configuration you have in your laptop. However, I can tell you that you need to have Intel Wireless Display Technology (Intel WiDi) chipset in your laptop in order to make it work. Although my laptop has the chipset to use Netgear Push2TV, the quality is not acceptable. Therefore, I do not recommend to buy this product. After I purchased this product, it worked for few days. Slowly, the graphics became worst and annoying to clone my laptop to TV. I think it helps you to make the decision.
I purchased, could not get it to work. I suggest buying an Apple-TV and Air Parrot http://www.airsquirrels.com/airparrot/ The combination works great.
I wouldn't buy it again. the power jack inside the laptop is crappy. Yes ASUS honors the warranty and than god, but each time it's like a month without it. For the current price, I would consider it, but be ultra ultra careful. with the power plug, and inserting, removing using it with the laptop,,,,,get it....It rocks but be careful very carel=
Not that I know of.....
Hi. I don't know about a DS, but it's all we use for our iPhones and iPads in France, Italy, and Turkey. Happy travels!
it will
I used it in Germany and turkey. Have fun.
I have only used products that I purchased in the USA and have our standard plugs. If the straightener you bought can be plugged into a plug in the USA than I believe you can use this adapter.
Yes it does. I was able to set it up with my godaddy account.
With the 480 TV lines that come with the cameras 50 ft day and 20 ft night. You can purchase by from E-bay or Amazon some 1000 or better TV line cameras and double or triple that distance.
Yep. That's what I installed it on.
There are 4 outputs on these LNBs. They are not "SWM" which would be a "Single Wire Multiswitch."
Please look for another model which supports DDR3.
Y shouldn't b
I'm pretty sure that some of the older 5100's needed a update from Yamaha to play the formats your after. I thought mine would need the update when I got it, but all was good.
What type of load are you attempting to power ( welder , 1hp compressor, etc) ?
Correct. You have to purchase cables separately. Does include power supply though.
No. This is going from RGB/SpDIF/Coax input to HDMI output. I think you'd need to be going in the other direction. Something like this: http://www.amazon.com/E-More-Component-Converter-Supporting-Coaxial/dp/B00T2MLNBM or http://www.amazon.com/BestFire-Component-Converter-Supporting-Coaxial/dp/B00N9UEVNK
Hello, The correct part # according to your model should be BP47-00037A. Thank you
It may work well for that but it's not very stylish so I would just caution you with that!
I believe it's less than three feet
That's what I used mine for, worked just fine.
I have installed this modem for my mother-in-law as a replacement for a CenturyLink DSL modem. It works great!
I wear glasses when I run and have never had a problem.
Our apologies...the Learn More content is fixed now.
It does, but not big enough to carry all of the components in the kit. I bought this a few months ago and like it for it's economy, but it comes with a carrying case big enough to put the reflector, it's wire frame and diffusers in and that's about it. The light socket, stand and bulbs would not fit in it alone or together. If you're going to be transporting this a lot, it's pretty light duty and would take much care. Hope that helps.
There is a helpful video on YouTube for this. Just enter product name in the search. It was helpful to me that they showed best way to mount the reflector: put it on the socket first with logo positioned on the side as when the light is in the upright position. Then add the wire rods with the velco'd corner one going last.
There compatible with Cokin "P" Series. They come with everything you need, except star type
The light I bought went out after about 10 minutes of use, and it hasnt worked since. The halogen bulbs seem to be very fragile, and I am currently seeking other lighting technology that will be more reliable. Sorry - I dont know whether the bulbs can be replaced or not. I am not going to bother trying.
If the Manfrotto has an extended piece at the top to go through the lower area of the hot shoe, by all means do it and tighten as needed, however, I have a Manfrotto monopod that doesn't have that extended piece to it. I use it on my Cowboy Studio flash Stands that comes with the top to tighten it.
Yes because not only is the top part the cold shoe adjustable but it can be removed and there is a screw mount for the flash Stand as well
If you cant get the battery to charge there may be a problem with the camera, the adapter or the cable. The easiest thing to check is the adapter, about $$35 from National Camera Exchange. If it is not the adapter it may be in the camera circuit in which case you may need to purchase a different camera from amazon like I did.
The button below the wheel toggles the wheel between "smooth" scrolling and "notched" scrolling. It's mechanical and is not usable as a button for computer input.
I have had it for almost two years withthe original battery
After making some research over the dell website I find very interesting that the charger fits your laptop model and mine. I do recommend checking on the part of the adapter that plugs into the computer and compare it to the one you see in the picture of this part. If it looks like it will fit then you have no problems on purchasing the adapter. Hope it helps.
Mine only had a standard USB connection.
Yes indeed it will
dont know
The one I bought almost 4 years ago is set up with both 32 bit and 64 bit. I cannot say for certain that a new one would be set up the same way as they sometimes upgrade to the newer technologies. This could probably be better confirmed with ASUS directly.
Confirmed @ 116.44GB. It also has an unlabeled partition of 14.65GB for the backup.
No..no Blu-Ray on mine.
It should work fine.
It should work with no problem, as long as you have ps2 connections, which are purple and green on the back of the computer.
Yes, the mic can be bent in any position and also can rotate up and around the earpiece.
I can't say that this is the latest and greatest version, but at the price and what it did for me, I have been completely happy with it. With this model, you're not sharing 1 Gb/s among all ports, each port has 1 Gb/s dedicated to it. Just make sure your computer network cards are 1 Gb/s and not 10/100, otherwise you won't be making full use of this. Even with the 10/100 cards though, this product works just fine. If you need 24 ports, this won't steer you wrong.
Yes they do.
I have used the 12 foot horizontal galvanized posts that you would use for a chain link fence (2), they are cheaper than the "antenna mounts". I used a post hole digger to bury the bottom down 18" or so, concrete optional, and braced near the top of the house. I have a ranch house, so you may need to adjust for a taller structure.
It comes with the transformer.
Yes it is. And the bottom plate attaches to any monopod or tripod.
Around 6inch high and probably around 2 to 3lbs. Its heavy duty indeed. Able to even hold my Sony VX2100 dvcam this past wedding weekend.
Not sure of the question. If U mean does it work on a vehicle that is traveling yes.
TuneCast Auto Live has two programmable preset buttons and a PRO setting for optimizing audio and boosting volume. You can only listen to your iPhone music and charge your device, but you won't be able to set your iPod nano to shuffle when you're listening to FM radio.
Yes the speakers will work plugged in the headphone jack. I have not done it on a monitor but I have used the speakers via the headphone jack on my cellphone.
Not so much, about three and a half to four feet at most.
Try googlin the vendor name to get the address and phone number
If it's an 8" woofer then it will fit all subs have the same foot print
No it doesn't -- I had to buy one.
My research tells me that this battery fits a Hp Mini 210-1000 series computer and is a much better battery than a the one you ask about, at least the one I purchased was twice as good as the original battery as far as battery life was concerned. It also raised the back of the computer and made typing much easier. Harold
Yes it does. It worked perfect for my HP Mini
Wow, I don't know. I'm sorry!
Yes. There is an antenna device that connects to wifi.
Yes. Ive just bought this system, plays all
No you cannot. It needs to be turned on.
Any brand will work. But, DON'T BUY A SONY BRAVIA TV!!! We bought 2 of them, both developed terminal picture failure in less than 3 years, wasted a fortune on these TV'S...if you insist on buying this brand, spend the $$ for long term extended warranties.
do you have a question? I don't know what rhapsody is other than classical music. Try more words in your sentence.
That's the dimensions of the package.
Yes. That's what I have. It's a GREAT speaker!!!!
Hi Bridgette - I bought this for my husband as he goes camping and fishing a lot. In fact, he just got back from a trip. He used the iHome product - outside and just loved it! Said the sound was amazing and plus it is such a convenient size. Hope this helps - would highly recommend it!
It uses the older, wider, Apple products connection. If using a newer Apple product, such as an iPhone 5, you will need an adapter to the smaller connection on the newer Apple devices. I don't know about Android. You can call iHome and ask.
I think it's the earthquakes and floods that have destroyed some of their factories.
I know this sounds elementary but check the settings. I could not get a flash and it was the settings. Also if taking a lot of flash photos sometimes the flash seems to shut down. It takes much longer than you might think to recharge flash to flash. Hope this helps.
Go to the canon website. The pdf manuals are sure to be there. Or google the name model number pdf it will probably pop right up.
you will need an sd card size adapter and it should work.
Have the same problem-seems my auto lens cap is NOT opening automatically. I have to tap it to open and tap it to close, losing the shot some of the time...
Yes, the flash will automatically pop up... but you also have the option to spend a quarter of a second to push it back down, which then turns it off. Frankly, this is a better option than not having it pop up automatically and having to lift it up.
from Wikipedia---+++A chipset is a set of electronic components in an integrated circuit that manages the data flow between the processor, memory and peripherals.+++ In other words, this little device has all the necessary internal parts and software to perform wireless function according to the latest standards. No more, no less.
I love my wifi extender, just not this one. The construction of the USB was horrible and the weight of the antenna quickly broke the device. Look for ones where the antenna is on a base separate from the computer.
No, just the camera.
Just insert the batteries into the charger OBSERVING PROPER POLARITY (battery + to charger +) and wait until the charger LED goes from red to yellow to green. When the charger LED is green, the battery is fully charged.
No, it is more of a keyboard replacement than a mouse replacement. It will handle the click events for a mouse, but nothing else.
The version that I got doesn't - if I remember right the HP Envy has a very thin plug
No I was never able to get two headphones to work at one time without a splitter. We actually bought cords to connect them because they worked better. The wireless aspect didn't work out for my family.
Yes, it does. Both the downloads and the subscription.
Yeah they do. Not entirely, but most of it. Any audio book or song will be perfectly hearable with the proper volume
Range cover 14-40mm and pictures quality are the major difference
Yes it does
Yes it does
PL1 takes a 40.5 mm lense.
Sorry I don't know.
Panasonic sd 60k get more picture wide len and more zoom and &lt;&lt;optical&gt;&gt; image stabilization. I got them both and in the end of testing, I return sony cx 150. there is one down side thou the 3.5 hour battery is expensive for panasonic. and sometime the auto white balance is a bit slower but in the end it all good.
Manual says IMovie '09 is supported. The software that comes with the camcorder is Windows only. I don't know anything about MACs so I don't know if this really answers your question or not.
Yes a usb
Actually, the up and down keys on the front panel dial control volume. The left and right keys control song scroll forward/back.
The reason you cannot talk between Citizens Band (CB) and Family Radio Service/General Mobile Radio Service (FRS/GMRS) is because they operate on different frequencies. CB radios operate within the 27MHz (11M) frequency. FRSGMRS operate within the 462 and 467MHz frequency.
yes, sure
The data needed for the Coby MP3 to operate was already located on the MP3 player. I purchased two at the time. Not knowing any better, before I downloaded my music to one of them I deleted the firmware and that MP3 player would not work. I then copied the firmware from the second MP3 player onto the first one, and now both work.
Yes. We have these Access Points running off of a Netgear 24 Port PoE compliant switch and it runs beautifully with no need for an extra injector.
I do not believe the TRENTDnet has the capability to run an authenticated access though a webpage.
There are various adapters that will go from vga to hdmi also might use a vga male to vga female adapter
Yes it is compatible. This mounting system is just like hanging a picture on the wall using a picture hook on the wall and a wire on the back of the picture.
I don't know for sure but, I have used this mount for a few Tv's...., LG and Samsung and they always have different size to accommodate my tv's. For the price and guarantee, its worth a try.
I can understand you being nervous, I was also! I used this mount for a much smaller 42" LED TV and it worked out fine. Trying to hide the cables and power cord in the wall actually was much harder. Just make sure you have something very substantial that the lag screws that go into the wall can "bite" into or screw into. No way will ordinary drywall/wall board be able to hold the weight of a TV. If you can attach to the studs, or concrete block or brick behind the wall this mount can work. Good luck
NO, Connection must be made via rca or headphone jack.
Color
No it is a zero ink printer that uses special paper containing the needed chemicals to make prints similar to a Polaroid camera from the good old days.
No. It has a plug
i have 2 of these and have not encountered that, hopes this helps.
The Z30 has been around over a year, are you confused with the Z70? those are now released.
Just received my Fuji Xp10. I'm finding the LCD display is not clear...there are lines running through the display making it difficult to see. When I take a picture and take the memory card out, the actual picture is clear...it is just the LCD. Are all Fuji XP10s like this, or did I get a bad one?
It's available here on Amazon:
It comes with an over-the-head band, as well as an around-the-ear adapter.
Easy. You need any radio with an auxiliary in and a headphone auxiliary cord. Plug the cord into the player, and plug it into the radio system, and jack the volume up! Voila! Or get an Ipod Nano 7 or any player with bluetooth and a bluetooth compatible radio.
No. This mount is specific to the Nuvi 500/550 series, and the Zumo has a different power supply plug.
This link suggests that yes, it does. I have not attempted it myself. http://watkositaram.com/powerstrips/search/
Yes, I have one...it works great!
No,It's only for 120V,
Yes, they will work with rino radios as long as they are on the same channel.
I believe so, I have used the walkie with several different cobra models.
As I do not own any DVD Audio discs, I am not certain, but do I remember hearing something to that effect a while back. A good place to look/ask the question would be on the AVS forum. Those folks in there will definitely know. Seek out the owners thread for the unit, the answer is probably somewhere in there.
My adapter is only 110.
I don't think you can.
John, I couldn't get mine to connect so I called Samsung and was told that my router's security setting must be WPA2. My router couldn't do that so I replaced it. The new router worked well 1st time. The default password was 8 numbers but I later changed it to 10 characters. It worked both ways. Paul
Seven. I believe he needs seven. I hope that helps.
Mine is also 45" tall from floor to top of top shelf.
it would have to be an external card reader.
Yes. You can repack. The critical thing is the screen. It is tricky to roll it back in the original packing (it always goes cross when you roll it) but, it is doable.
It is excellent for gaming and 3D. The amount of gain on the screen is perfect if your room isn't pitch black.
The frame is about 2 inches thick all the way around. It hangs up just like a picture frame. I recommend the cinewhite screen. The power gain and cinegrey have hot spots in the picture. Great product overall. Looks really nice and preforms well.
yes
Yes
Yes, it is.
I have similar question. Does it work with nokia e5? Thanks
If you would be able to make it work, possibly. We are waiting for our 3 rd replacement now. It usually works for few days then lcd panel stops responding. Good advise look somewhere else!
Yes this microscope has bright and dark field illumination that works pretty well. It's not the greatest at this price but does the job.
No these are good woofers I have two of them in my Cadillac escalade.They have deep bass
No, this is a laptop, unlike desktop you cant just switch processors out. but this laptop has a 2 core 2.0 Ghz processor by intel
I don't think so. These are just colored cellophane and a black light is a special kind of light that allows some of the light spectrum through while blocking other rays...this is what allows the light to pick up only on white or light objects.
Yes they are flexible enough to be cut with scissors or Xacto Knife.
I really don't remember because the one I had was faulty and was returned. I bought something else. Sorry I can't be of more help.
It depends on if your in dash t.v has wireless headphones with it or its compatible with headphones other than that it won't work
you have to make sure the radio that you hook up the tv to is comp. with dvd and cd The Tv does not have a dvd/cd slot.
I think focal makes a good product, but not in this price range. Also not a huge fan of coax, i prefer an external crossover. Plus the JL Audio c2's can handle double the watts for the same money, and arent made of plastic.
It comes with a 110v transformer only. However, similar panasonic phones are available in shops which sell phone for overseas uses.
You cant
No, but I would call Vizio. Friend had a problem & they replaced the TV..
Sorry I do not know, I am using the remote from Verizon FIOS
No it is not. The keys are just stamped with letters. There is no lighting used.
JUL, Most on the market - and almost every Samsung Audio Bar - will work just fine with your TV. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
No
Total of 4
if the earpieces around such as one finds on an airline set, it should. The various sizes help.
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't. I've never encountered that
Price is for 1 speaker
Works great but will have to cut out some of the factory box
Peaks at 500 watts per sub
The description says 150w RMS ... If it is more or less, I don't know; I don't have testing equipment to verify power usage. I use 2 in a sealed enclose that wouldn't fit under any seat. If you want a compact sub, you may need something designed for small spaces like a bazooka tube or something else. This is for1.75 CF enclosure.
Yes. It will play right where it left off
Yes....the poles retract to fit almost any headrest...they also come with a bunch of couplers...
Well, this unit (TCD748000 Premiere XL) records 150 hours of HD, so it will record about 500 hours of SD programs.
Don't see why not...Using mine for a 42"
No problem on mine. The only problem I have is on the remote is that I cannot lower the sound, but I believe that is my fault.
The switch on the back of the woofer is fragile move it around a few times turn it on and off.
Brandi, I can't tell you about your specific computer; however, I have the HP dv7t-6c00. I purchased this power supply in March 2013 because it's said it was a 90W HP adapter. I use it every week-day without any problem. Just so you know, my computer complains every day that is it not a HP smart adapter and warns me that it may not be sufficient for my needs. In spite of that warning it works just fine for me. I imagine it will work for you.
no, only disk
Yup, exact same thing.
The description of this product tells the device have AV outputs...
That I'm not really sure about. I've just been using it for its mp3 capability. I think you can also use it for a dvd, but I'm not sure of the screen aspect ratio.
If it's the same model and everything, I don't think you'll need to
Desk only - The base requires a horizontal surface and the rest of the mount requires a vertical pole.
There is a 40 lbs capacity so it should be fine.
Yes. Here is the info from Netgear.. http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22057/~/xav2501-faqs
It works only for HDTV's. It won't come with a built in converter box inside.
Yes, this is perfect for the SD750 ELPH
No Video light, it only has a Flash used by the Still Photo mode. It has the high-gain mode, which brightens the footage. But you will need decent/extra lighting when shooting indoors for best results.
Yes it does come with USB cable. Personally, I prefer to just insert the SD memory cards into my computer directly, it's much faster, and simpler. Or if your computer can't read the card directly, one of the inexpensive card "readers". Transcend P8 15-in-1 USB 2.0 Flash Memory Card Reader TS-RDP8K (Black) It's much faster, and simpler.
Yes we use it with a MAC
This is the 2nd radar detector from Cobra which is an upgrade. On a straightaway this detector has picked up 1/2 mile our with hills 1/4 mile. Although there are many phone apps such as Waze, those apps drain the battery life of your mobile phone.
I haven't done it but need to I love this radar detector thought best money I ever spent
Yes
Sorry but I don't think it will work. Whenever I tried recording on my VCR to test if this works or not it failed. But if you are trying to record a wii, XBOX (360 or reg.), PS (1, 2, or 3) etc. try connecting it directly to the EZG2. If this doesn't work then I don't know.
dont know never got it working. tried too
I bought this bag simply to protect the camera from getting banged around when carrying it; it does the job well. The bag is well made with good quality materials and very well padded. It has a divider that can be moved due to it using Velcro for attachment. The bag is fairly small, but is big enough to carry a spare battery and SD card. However, it is not big enough to carry larger accessories. If you're looking to carry the camera, another battery, and an SD card, this bag is a good choice.
No
no, it can't do it
I'm sorry, can't through the orange button to shut down the computer.
No it is not. I would recommend the n5902. I have had both and the n5902's features make it well worth the extra few bucks.
Yes, all you need is a mini to RCA cable, assuming your CD changer has RCA out.
This amplififier is good for spekars like the same brand like this: http://www.amazon.com/Pyle-PCB4BK-200-Watt-Bookshelf-Speaker/dp/B000MCEL1K/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1418844929&sr=1-3&keywords=pyle+speakers Other ones are difficult to connect, because use only a single speakers wire.
I'm not familiar with those speakers but since this amp is 120w and the speakers are 120w as well they'll work great. Just don't put the volume at max, just little by little. I have 2 90w monitors and it sounds great half volume. This amp came only with the power cord and no audio cable. I bought them here for like $3 dollars. Good luck
I have not used digital audio.
not sure...might try the seller or manufacturer for info...I've got six speakers on one base but they are pretty close together
No, just a stereo receiver or other music machine such as an iPod that has an earphone jack. These speakers come with an adapter that can plug into the large earphone jack on a stereo.
Katy if your tv has RCA plugs(red, yellow, white) on the back of it the unit it will hook up with the included wire. It's ok it's a simple hook up you can handle it. Just plug the red and white wire into the corresponding color hole on your tv and the other end into the transmitter and your good to go. Oh and enjoy!
Ships from california
Yes
Besides no Wifi, the 550 does not have DLNA & USB only plays music & photos from flash drive, no movies & no HDD support. 570 has much better feature set.
2ms, see the Samsung page for this TV for all specs
A lot of us are waiting on this set. It is already out in Canada and Mexico. Check out this thread to stay up to date and to find settings when it comes out: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/showthread.php?t=1244484
Yes
Grace, We recommend against putting your TV or any electronic device over a fireplace. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Did you check if the vendors were the same? Amazon lists different vendors for the same product (I assume Amazon runs out of stock and then partners with other companies which also offers the same model). The price varies quite a bit from different sellers. I'm in the process of buying a new TV and have noticed the price fluctuations also. Even Amazon's own prices go up and down but not as much as $400 from what I've seen so far.
yes but it doesn't give you access to internet like the newer ones! They give you all kinds of apps to download through samsung, you get facebook,you tube,yahoo, but you can't browse internet
I just unwrapped mine yest. and fits comfortably on my old 27 inch CRT TV Trolly, with about an inch to spare on both sides.
Only 2 AAA batteries.
Yes, but you may need an adapter for usb to micro usb.
It does not, although we don't know how hard you stab the keys. It's not a "clicky" keyboard otherwise.
No. Just the 17 E series. Notice the numpad.
will this power cord also have navigational capabilities?
I don't know I have a panasonic gh2 and the lens has an adapter that fits my camera. However it will not auto focus and I have found it to be difficult to get a clear focus with the lens i will probably return it.
Yes, I have nerve loss of hearing and I have benefitted greatly from using the Sennheiser 840. Hearing aids do not work well for me, but the Sennheiser device has electronic sound enhancement that is adjustable to suit the frequency loss pattern of my hearing. It can increase the amplification of the higher frequencies and improve word recognition.
Yes. Rechargeable battery. Lasts 2 days on a charge
Mine is a year old and takes less than 2 minutes.
Sometimes electrical lines will pick up noise from other electrical devices, EMI electromagnetic interference, or radio frequencies, RFI, that can affect devices plugged into the electrical outlets the EMI/RFI filter is to help keep this from happening.
computers, digital computer chargers and external drives are made to use either 220 or 110. You must use an electrical adapter to accomodate plugs however.
The cord is 173 sm.= 68 inches and it is 3x14 wire (2,08 sq.mm.)
Yes but at 10 meg limit.
I'm not 100% sure, but I'd be very surprised if it didn't. It's a pretty universal chipset.
Theres nothing good about this little TV
No
Nope.
Nope.
It is compatible with laptops and desktops. You need to install the program or have Windows or linux install it.
It will to an extent, it's made for a laptop screen but if your screen is small enough, there shouldn't be a problem. But my screen has a curve, it's a lg laser something, so I folded a piece of cardboard, tacked it to the computer plastic with some sticky tack, and clamped the camera to the cardboard. Also note that the USB cord is pretty small, so you might need an extender of some sort. Hope this helps :)
I use it for everything, Skype, Google Hangouts, video game live coms and it's always been wonderful so I say yes.
No audio through the HDMI, must use the sound card for audio
That card never worked in my machine. It was a waste of time and money.
The battery pack, with intergrated volume control switch is slightly larger than the batteries themselves. Since the electronics for the volume control is also intergrated into the battery pack, it takes minimal room. I have not found the battery pack causes any annoyance or interference because it clips onto anything like your shirt pocket, collar or an airplane seat belt.
I'm not completely sure of the type of usb port that is built in to Venue 8 Pro Tablets, but based on the specifications I pulled up Venue 8 Pro Tablet's only have a micro-AB USB port. This bluetooth adapter fits into a type A usb port (i.e. the usb ports you'd see on a desktop). So, assuming the specifications are a correct you cannot use this bluetooth adaptor unless you get a cable that converts a type A USB port to a micro A or B.
It uses a Micro USB Wall Charger, several available from Amazon for about $3.00.
Yes but it's a tight fit
They should be able to, although with a slight impedance mismatch.
No requires a receiver to operate these speakers
Yes, it downloads the entire contents of the card regardless of whether it's already been previously downloaded.
This is not a very good modem, I have sold four of these to different customers and three have been returned because they quit working. Get a US. Robotics usb modem, it cost more but it works.
As a Mac user, I had no issue re drivers. Plugged it in and it worked.
It looks that way. I bought a Latitude D810 (Windows XP) from Amazon a couple years ago and it looked just as I am seeing in this one. Hope this is helpful
I am not sure as to the year. However the one I bought (and am still using) had Microsoft Office preloaded).
I have an early 2006, when this model first came out, and the replacement battery fits nicely. The only advantage I have found for the $100 replacement vs the $20 replacement is that the less expensive replacement only last for an hour and a half to two hours as it has six rather than eight cells.
if it has a sata connection, you should be fine. i put mine in a 2008 mac pro intel quad... problem is, it crapped out after 3 yrs. i now have the comparable Asus...
Yup!
Yes this is a 12" sub
Yes, it does. Very descent
No it does not the dual means it has 2 voice coils and or drivers so you have to wire it differently but no it does not come with 2 speakers or in this case subwoofers
You get it within 2 to 5 business days
One of the best precision lenses and one of the priciest. Hate to say it, but if it arrived in that condition, I wouldn't take any chances - I'd return it
Yes it will "work", but on a crop sensor camera like the D200 it will have a field of view equivalent to a 36mm lens. There are certainly cheaper options in this range for a DX camera. That being said, the 24mm f/1.4 is a great lens with outstanding image quality.
I think that it's a great lens, but more well suited for a full frame camera. If you goal is wide angle photography I would suggest that you go with something wider, such as the Nikon 12-24... http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-12-24mm-AF-S-Nikkor-Zoom/dp/B000092M1T/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1390416530&sr=8-2&keywords=nikon+10+24 ... Good luck, I hope that helps! Don't forget to also grab a slim Polarizer which will help you get dramatic blue skies.
This remote will work with a Canon 6D Camera
I have an older 2008 MacBook and so far, it's working just fine for me! &lt;3
It should work fine, it looks like the stock hard drive on that model was a SATA II at 5400 RPM's. So this model should work just fine as a replacement.
Yes it will. Connector bridge and capacity limit should allow it.
If it was made after 2012 it should.
Yes.
This HD I installed 6 years ago in my Desktop and still working. Great in my server. Thank you.
Don't know. We put it in a latitude e6400 hp laptop
2 1/8 " HIGH ///3/4" WIDE///1/2" THICK (+-1/16")
i wouldnt bother. it looks cool, but I found it just wasnt worth the trouble. look at the gopro models instead.
Yes. At least my Samsung TV UN65C8000 remote controls it. Mute and Volume. You will have to disable the TV sound as the sound bar and TV sound is slightly out of sync.
In checking your info with another stereo install database it looks like you would need 4 speaker mounting brackets (Metro 82-3412) if you were going to change out all the door speakers. You might also need the speaker wiring harness (72-7800) depending on your particular installation requirements.
It plays both standard dvd as well as blu-ray.
No it does not light up.

This is a lap top case. There are better choices made specifically for a camera and lenses.
Yes, works great after installing the UC Firmware from Snom. Have them in 2 remote locations also, can page from HQ to either location as well.
Type of system will determine if that is possible. This is a sip device. If your system is sip it will work. If more traditional pots lines are connected to your system then most likely not. In that case a viking or other type device would be needed.
You cannot upgrade the processor but you can upgrade the Graphics Card to anything that will support the PCI-E 2.0 X16 slot
I believe the 745 Optiplex takes 800 MHz PC2-6400 DIMM 240-pin. You should confirm this for yourself. Amazon does carry these for about $30.
For me it's a 3 step process ... Cassette to Flash drive, Flash to computer, computer to music CD. So, for you the last step is computer to ipod.
Left and right RCA Jacks for input and output. The USB port is only for plugging a memory stick to record on.
No, there are no video inputs or outputs. I already replaced mine, it only lasted 1 1/2 years.
Yes
Oh it's not all that good with 12inch it will go off n on but it also depends on if u will have fan or something else to keep this amp cold
No ...it is a mono amp , there are 2 speaker hook ups but that is just splitting the power ...say if you had 1 2ohm sub it would run 900 watts if you used 2 4 ohm subs it would give them 450 a piece , it is 1 ohm stable and I have even taken it to half an An ohm With No Problems By Hooking Up 2 Fosgate Dual Voice Coil Subs That Were 1 ohm A Piece ...Hope This Helps
Yes, this item has a tripod mount and a USB port as well.
I believe they dont need to be sealed within a box. Open air is fine.
If you mean indents, yes. It also has those "ticks" or stops when you scroll. I had a mouse without those once. The scroll wheel would just fly and not stop. This is much better.
No, typically ( read never ) aftermarket radios do not come with the necessary harness and antenna adapters. This is what your shop will look up for your particular vehicle and charge you for, as well as labor. If you did not know this I would think twice about doing it yourself. It can be done but you MUST research it first for your particular car and then use general knowledge to buy kits and parts and adapt them to your particular case.
I looked and mine does not have any USB slots. That would be great if it did. I still really like my keyboard and would buy it again.
Control it? This little beauty will OWN your slv-n750. This handy dandy little remote picks up slv-n750's, spreads a thick slathering of mayo and mustard on them, eats them for lunch and then craps out a flawless shiny slv-n750 whole. Seriously, this remote will change you and the life of your circa 1992 VCR. Oh wait... why are you still using a VCR??
This remote couldn't sync my sony bravia with sony blueray player. Good Luck to you!
Try Radio Shack.
Yes. It come with an adapter that plugs into the antenna port. I use mine as an external monitor for my on car gps

I just looked at the Dell Inspiron 1525 manual at dell.com and the slot for the Inspiron 1420 looks very similar to the 1525. My laptop had a full-length wifi card and this is a half-height card.You will need to buy the half to full height adapter. Your laptop should already have all the necessary antennae. Good luck!
I would ignore the message, I used to get the same message and it went away after some days.

According to my google-foo, your model is covered by this lamp. However I suggest you verify this for yourself before purchasing. Just type "PT52-lcx15 replacement lamp" and hit enter. If Amazon doesn't remove the link, you can also just copy and paste this: http://www.projectorlampsworld.com/panasonic-pt52lcx15-tv-lamp.html and it shows that this lamp, TY-LA1000, is the correct lamp for your model.
yes
I love this crossbar. I bought it to replace the crossbar that came with my stand because it was hard to take it apart once it was "hooked" in. This bar simply twists to the desired length. I would definitely recommend.
it holds 10ft backdrop.
Yes it does. It has the orange coax input which plays on video 2 setting and the optical input which plays on video 1 setting (this is the one I use for digital audio). Hope this helps.
It fits perfectly in our 2013 RZR S 800. I have been very happy with it!
The remote is included with the Toshiba SD4300 Progressive Scan DVD Player
Product Dimensions: 11.6 x 36.4 x 26 inches ; 28.9 pounds - sounds too wide So here's what I did. I took a tape measure to the Store I knew had the most TVs. Started measuring... I found a TV that fit within the space constraints I had by half an inch.
The samsung blu ray player, much cheaper now than when we got it, is what we use for our Netflix streaming to our HDTV its flawless.
I just bought this model after Christmas and it doesn't have any flashing corners. Sorry, sounds like you might need to return it. I believe there's 30 day return policy on TVs from amazon.
It was my understanding that PS3 produced 720p or 1080i images. The Pana BD85 is 1080p. As far as accuracy of color, the BD85K is much better than my brother's PS3. We both have 720p sets, but to be fair, he's on a 40" Samsung 60hz LCD, whereas I have a Pana Viera 600hz plasma. No comparison there, so that could be the difference.
No the case isn't waterproof, but the material that it is made of is pretty strong and should you spill some liquid onto it the laptop should be protected.
It is not metal but it appears to be quite sturdy. It is also very comfortable to carry.
16.0 inches by 11.5 inches
This model can't. You need the BD65 with ethernet cable or wireless adapter, or BD85 which comes with wireless adapter. You also need an internet router and internet service, of course.
I guess my question is: will this blue-ray player, play regular dvds, as well as others? I'm not that big into the movie scene, but it would be nice to watch my reuglar dvds, in HD quality. I do have an 1080p HDTV with all the works if that helps...please...I don't need a top of the line, just a decent blue-ray player..thanks! Note: I don't do streaming & special downlaods for movies, I just need something simple to use, yet that is good quality. I'm not a techno-person!
I bought the 17" one. There is room for my 17" laptop.
MY 17.3 LAPTOP FITS PERFECT IN THIS BAG!!!
Says right in the product description: " Convenient, top-load access to a quilted laptop compartment suited for most laptops with a 15-17.3 inch screen. Fits devices up to 16.1' x 12.2' x 1.8' "
Yes
Yes, it will work in Iceland.
I'm actually not sure what adapter you can use in Israel the one I bought is only for Europe , but I'm am pretty positive you need a middle east adapter
Yes it is, and it works great.
They do work in Croatian outlets. They won't work in Italy, either.
Probably about 60. It doesn't make a full 90 degree turn. It turns enough for me to see from the driver seat if the movie is playing.
I wish I could answer this question in order to help you, however, I think an electrician will give you a valid answer.
Yes, I successfully used the software on OS X, 10.8 and 10.9
The tape unit is just a cheap cassett player uith a USB plug. I could not get the software to work enough to even get to the point where I wanted to name the song. The software SAYS it has provisions for naming, but I never got that far. Oh by the way, this thing runs off AA batteries. Buy a carload.
I do not know. I could not get the product software to work properly. It was poor quality in terms of durability and sound. I returned it and Amazon was great about the refund.
USB output port to connect to the computer (like the digital camera) and the 1/8 inch for headphones
Yes, you can customize it to turn all on or off. Or you can program one to stay on all the time, such as a SAT/cable receiver so everything starts without delay. Really happy with this product and the programmable devices seem to be endless. I actually have a weird brand SAT cable box from overseas and it found it with no issues. Buy the product and don't buy the higher-end models since this does a lot to begin with. Hope this helps
YES
I am not familiar with the magic remote cursor, but likely not. This remote can only learn the basic keypad functions of the remotes, and does not appear to feature an accelerometer like the previous version. You'd have to find a remote that supports touchpad input AND probably motion control....probably designed specifically to replace that remote.
Yes Windows 8 and 8.1
I believe it should be $5.20 for shipping
I don't think so, there isn't a switch or any option menus, it's a pretty simple device.
No
Im not 100% sure but i believe it will be compatible
I found a couple of options.... my easiest one is to use ChromeCast (Google Device for $35) but the only problem is that you have limited access as to what you can watch on the bluray player. I believe iPad makes a special connector too but don't quote me on that.
Yes it will. I have mine connected to my Pioneer SFCRW240LS with no issues at all. Go ahead!
Yes they do, I have small ear canals and these fit perfectly
1.3. It is not a 3d receiver so 1.4 is not needed.
I'm also looking at these two models, and would appreciate any comments as well. The DH810 is newer and will upconvert video to 1080p, while the DN1000 only upconverts to 1080i. Is this a big difference? The DH810 also supports Audio Return Channel, so you only need one HDMI cable to your tv and your tv can send audio back to the receiver Also no on-screen menu on the DH810 I'm still on the fence on this one, especially since the price of the DN1000 will continue to drop.
They work with the iphone as headphones only; they do not have a mic or controls for music.
I have not noticed a hiss. I don't turn my tunes up that high unless I'm mowing the lawn or something and in that environment is doubt I'd hear a hiss
yes it will block the noise
yes, it's is.... i would recommend this to anyone... it's a nice system...!!!
Yes
Not really sure, but I use 3 and pick up the basic channels plus an out of state one.
It's 6 key rollover in USB, NKRO requires PS/2. Check out the product site: http://steelseries.com/us/products/keyboards/steelseries-6gv2
The cherry red is a newer product. Steel series tends to release minor updates to existing products and increases cost. The Siberia V2 headset is a perfect example of this.
Colors
If you indicate the wiring in more details - what is connected to what - , I may be able to help. Is a HDMI to DVI adapter used? What is "elgato"?
It Will not play Ultra-HD. 1080 P is no problem
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.
I have one for converting records to mp3 through my pc with windows 7 and it works fine.
no u need to get rca plugs converter with an aux end...then u can hoop up ur ipod or smart phone.
I received (2) two with my purchase. aloha
I own the panasonic 54 inch vt25 but just from looking at the store's display models, the sony is a superior tv. It displays less cross-talk, deeper blacks, and there is (to me) by far more pop in the 3d. what bothered me most about the samsung led 3dtvs is how the image feels very "wet" or extremely glossy when viewing 3d content. I didnt get that effect when viewing the sony led. Thats my two cents. cnet reviewed the tv and compares it to the sammy and panny in a brief article here http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-20009377-1.html?tag=hotTopicsBody.1
Bought a 32" Vizio from Amazon had NO issues with delivery. Amazon is the only way to go in my opinion. Also ordered a blu ray player no delivery issues.
Yes, it have 3 HDMI ports, 2 ports at back and 1 at side.
No. Just 110 volts.
no
A Viera Cast software Update is now available (August 11, 2011) which expands Viera Cast widgets and adds the Viera Connect marketplace. Who knows what may come next.
Remember, Amazon will credit you the difference within 14 days; I'm thinking of picking it up in about a week then watching it to see if it goes on sale. I'll have it at my home, and I'll get the Black Friday pricing if it ever happens. If it doesn't happen, then I'm 2 weeks into a purchase I would have made anyway.
Mine had water damage while under warranty. I send it back and they replaced with the next generation Pentax WG-1. I took a while for them to send the replacement. WG-1 version seems to hold much better. I just used it during my vacation and did not get damaged by water.
Donnie: Next to the left of the volume control and the two inputs that are for headphones and "line out" there is a switch that says "Hold on" and "Off". Make sure the switch is in the "hold off" position. That should solve the problem.
It is rated for 88 lbs.
Yes it is rechargeable. Works great!
Camera size is 4" wide by 2.5" tall, and 1.25" deep with lens closed. About 2" with lens open. The screen size is nice, about 2.5" wide and 1.75" tall.
I'm using a CaseLogic SLDC-202, which I purchased from Amazon. Besides the camera, I can also carry (in a second zippered compartment) the battery charger and a spare battery. It's a nice looking case.
Didn't work for me.
1 year is standard. You can get another 2-5 years additional warranty through dell.
Battery lasts a really long time. Several hours at a time. Looks like you have a bad battery or charger.
From what I can tell the outer covering is not the lens, but rather a UV filter of some sort. The lens itself is far behind the outer covering. So the lens is protected by default. I don't know the camera (yet) but I have been researching it a great deal and am knowledgeable about cameras.
On the basis that it is a camera and not a fashion accessory, buy it in the cheapest color!
Yes it does thanks
I do not understand the question....we bought this item to use on our slingbox to change channels from another room and it performs the task just fine.
Yes. It works perfectly. I've brought it over 1 year ago and I've never had a problem with it.
Yes
Sorry I'm not sure but I believe there is an online manual with wiring specs.
No. This is only to have the steering wheel controls.
No
No, works with usb cable only
Yes it is
Probably not since windows 8 is garbage operating system. I would suggest you completely Wipe windows 8 from your computer and install Windows 7 professional 64 bit, or ultimate 64 bit. Windows 8 is designed for what the majority of americans have become, poorly educated mindless sheep who have been programmed to obey.
I wore it to a waterpark recently
That is a good question. I believe you can only install it on one computer. But I do not have more than one computer to install it on to confirm that.
I have it and used it for my older Nixon D80. For some unknown reasons, It did not work with my D800. Whenever confusion arises as in this case, I look in the manual on line where they have information such as this. In Amazon, I usually get a used one, because they often a 30 day return for what ever the product, and have had never got a lemon.
It can only control three items so,as long as you don't have a blu ray/dvd player, you could manually program either the cable or satellite box under the DVD function.
Sorry to hear that, I had no problems with it, it is working fine.
It's made to replace an existing antennae. If your router has an antennae, unscrew it & see if the new one will screw in. I used it to replace an actiontec/verizon router antennae & it fit that way.
I am using a usb mouse and a usb keyboard their are 2 usb connections on the KVM
Not without modification.. The magnet on these speakers are huge. Get urself some polk, jbl or infinity speakers for that vehicle..
At the very least, the Beachtek provides what amounts to a "Y", giving you two XLR inputs plus an aux. In addition, it gives you the ability to vary the volume of those inputs independently. I can't recommend it too highly.
Yes!.. there a screw on top of the unit that attaches to your camera and there is a screw thread underneath where any(Standard) tripod screw will fit.
The LD450 does have two composite connections. On a side note you can get HD component cables for the wii for about $7 shipped. Purchasers state that they did notice improvement on their hd tvs. I'll have to wait till my tv arrives to confirm. Cable located here 6FT. HD Component Cable for Nintendo Wii
Yes. On the LG 37le5300, the LED is an edge application of LED as the back lit device, rather than a full LED back lit application. The LCD is the Liquid Crystal Display without the LED application and is usually back lit by florescent lighting and is not nearly as efficient. Combined LED LCD means you will have a Liquid Crystal Display that is back lit by Light Emitting Diodes, either full screen or edge. Hope this helps.
I have the same question - I've tried two different wireless keyboards via USB dongle but both trigger the "USB device not supported" error - tried Logitech & HP.
They aren't common, gratefully, but some recent DVDs don't have CC. I was greatly disappointed to find that there is no CC on Dune (Sci-Fi Channel version,) for example.
yes, it does.
according to their spec sheet, it's 110/220.. these speakers have been around a while now but mine still rock..!
From my experience with this battery grip, it does show the accurate battery charge. However, I am not 100% certain.
Yes, you can set it to wake you up with a buzzer sound, or with any song on your iPod/iPhone.
Rintha R., I regret that I cannot give you an answer. I purchased the router and needed tech support from At&T and Foscam Techs, who both told me after we were trying to configure the router for over 2 months, that the router was defective (no wan signal). Doesnt mean that these routers are All defective, I just got hold of a defective one. Go on line to find a phone number to the manufacturer, and I am confident they can answer your question. ron
Inline is inline. The closer you can get the amp to the antenna the better.
It isn't an even 30db gain on all channels, none of them are. It does vary, but 30db is max. The control can reduce the gain up to 10db from the max it's capable of on any given channel. It's a good amp, improved our reception and we gained a couple of channels.
Sorry, can't help you. But having difficulties doesn't surprise me. First the iPod connection stop working, then all the hdmi connections wouldn't work, and then 1 speaker started to cut out, and finally the amp started turning off after 5 minutes. All of this happened in 18 months. Got a $200 5.1 Yamaha now. Works great and sounds better than the Pioneer! Good luck.
I'm having similar issues with the hdmi. My Acer tablet and my ps3 won't connect properly for some reason.
This is a LED product and not Lamp based. At 50 L, you have to be in a fairly dark room for a 60" screen. It can do up to 120" in a really dark H/T room. The advantage to a LED is that it`s small enough to fit in a suit pocket and the LED lasts up to 20,000 hours. 2,500 lamp lasts upt to 3,000 to 4,000 hours plus the size is too large for your pocket.
I could not connect to my iPhone4 or my iPad. my 201projector did not come with the appropriate cable or adapter. I ordered the apple connectors for another $40. I hope they work. This projector is at it's best using a micro memory card.
Sorry to hear you got suh a short use...I got only about 12 hours total use when the same thing happened. I contacted optima and was told it would cost $100+ to repair plus shopping..what a rip-off. If anyone else knows of a substitute that will project as wall as the pk201 does and NOT made by optima, please advise.
I believe it is done by using the media converter software that comes with the projector.
Yes it does. It took me a while to find it, but if you click on the display button twice it should be on top. You can zoom 2x or 4x. Hope that helps :)
I am not sure I understand. It opens fully to reveal the iPad or whatever, but it does not fold completely underneath as designed. You can force it underneath the bottom (where the device is kept) with little effort, but I am not sure of it's stitched integrity.
Well, if the soft shell case fits very tightly, it may fit inside. There really isn't any reason to use another case for the inside, because the Hard Candy Case protects the iPad very well.
There's no reason that it shouldn't
I am not sure I understand. It opens fully to reveal the iPad or whatever, but it does not fold completely underneath as designed. You can force it underneath the bottom (where the device is kept) with little effort, but I am not sure of it's stitched integrity.
This is a very poor product that I consider a waste of my valuable resources. When I bought it I tried using it but it never came up. I attempted to rescue it by replacing the battery but it's same result. I have since abandoned it. Best of luck.
There is not. The system only has video. Picture quality is ok but not phenomenal. HD has ruined us for good! We have not had issues with it at all though and it has been running for 3 months.
Both the T2i and T3i use the same battery, so it should be compatible. The one I got is a 5 or 6 foot cable. Beware though, i got two of these that were import models I wasn't comfortable with. The battery was a super tight fit and the full light was always on. I suspect they were forgeries. Returned those, and the third one was still not as good as the original that came with my camera, but the battery fit correctly and the charge lights behaved as the original did.
It works perfectly for me.
Price is for each..
es uno solo mi pana, todos los productos que ofrece lanzar es por unidad.. asi que pendiente con eso
No
No it is not . Company called WNC Winston newer manufactures directv branded equipment. It is swim lnb which receives all orbital slots 99, 101, 103, 110, and 119W
Yes
it worked fine for me.
Yes. It's actually what you would call an "upgrade" (last longer). Compare the life of the original supplied battery to the other three (choices) sizes, below. Battery Pack: BN-VG107U (Supplied): Actual Recording Time: 40 m Continuous Recording Time: 1 h 5 m BN-VG114U: (1400mAh/Rechargeable Lithium-ion) Actual Recording Time: 1 h 15 m Continuous Recording Time: 2 h 10 m BN-VG121U: (2100mAh/Rechargeable Lithium-ion) Actual Recording Time: 1 h 55 m Continuous Recording Time: 3 h 15 m BN-VG138U: (3750mAh/Rechargeable Lithium-ion) Actual Recording Time: 3 h 20 m Continuous Recording Time: 5 h 45 m
YES
Hello, I bought this battery for my JVC camcorder GZ-E300AU and it is great! I am not familiar with your model #.
Yes.
The Sigma 17-50mm is an all-purpose fast lens, great for portrait to get good DOF, and fast enough for HS indoor sports. I would recommend setting you ISO to 1600 or higher on your Nikon. The quality of glass is excellent for the resolution of 16x24 prints. I am very impressed with the quality of workmanship and lens quality.
No. It is only for aps-c canon cameras. (Ef-s) It will NOT mount on the 5D
Contrary to a previous answer, I on the other hand bought the lens for it's outstanding photographic capabilities, and I am one satisfied customer.
What type of system do you have in terms of how many channels, or are they audio capable or not. I am assuming that you have a Revo system. I would also like to know if you are attempting to connect BNC cameras to your REVO system?
Hello, A quantity limit is the maximum number of any item that can be purchased. These limits can't be increased. The quantity limit on the item you mentioned is 3. Items with quantity restrictions have very low prices and/or a limited supply, and we want to ensure that many customers are able to order them. As our prices and product supply change, these limits may change too. We look forward to seeing you again soon.
I haven't had an ounce of trouble with the eMachine, I play games all the time. My only problem is the letters wear off the keys.
Not a DVD duplicator. This piece basically allows a Serial-ATA motherboard to read an IDE device, like a hard drive or DVD drive. It also works backwards.
Don't know - never tried it, but I doubt it. It's infrared which requires line of sight. It's a straight replacement for original DirecTV equipment, not any kind of an upgrade.
There are 2 open PCI Express 1x slots in the HPE-250f, so yes, you can buy a card that will provide two eSATA ports (and even IDE support for a floppy or older DVD-ROM drive ...). Such a card would typically cost less than $25. Check out the link below http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16816132014 Sixteen Gb RAM is huge. The HPE-250f appears to be a good value, but realize that there is only room to add one more hard-drive inside the case, and adding cooling to the case is not possible either.
Hi, I have this computer connected to 110 v grid. However computers as this one can work in any grid from 220 to 110 v. The AC to DC transformer can handled both. I hope this helps. Regards

I can't tell
Not really. These are made for star-gazing...there are better brands for that...I recommend going to opticsplanet and looking under the tab of "law enforcement" and then narrowing your search to "surveillance binoculars" Hope this helps!
It depends on the size of your pictures or videos per the quality you select. This was purchased for a Trail cam that takes up to a 8gb card and it took about 250 pics and still had about 80% left space with hi resolution HD pics.
I am not familiar with the L22 camera, but it should as long as the L22 requires an "SD" card. I have used mine in my Nikon D5000.
Yes
no clock
We own a Go Video dvd/vcr combo and the remote works fine for that device.Hope that helps you some.
oh yes, it has a mic, and a good one too. I live in an area that can be quite windy at times, in the past I couldnt make phone calls from outside because the wind noise was too much. Now I can, on most days, still make calls because the mic somehow cuts the wind noise down to a reasonable level and people can hear me just fine, and i can definitely hear them because the earbuds are so snug and the sound quality so good, so clear.
Yes it's built in. but be careful with the cable at the jack do not bend or twist it too much most headphone cables break inside of the insulation.
No it does not. You need to use the mute on the phone.
Sorry... but I never used the Movie feature of the G2. I shot a lot of RAW/JPEG Stills and was very happy with the camera. I am now using a Sony NEX-6 and am happily shooting movies and stills.
I've had it on the x1 and it flips after 30mins to a different input. I only have the x1 and a wii u hooked to it. I had my pc hooked to it and it would switch inputs on that as well.
Yes that's what I have
Yes, I have the Onyx EZ and it works great with the dock. I have also adapted Onyx EZ for use in a 2002 mustang and a 1993 GMC.
This remote is for the WD player and as far as i know this has nothing to do with the TV
Sorry have no idea
No
no...
No it does not.
Most suitable for manual mode. Will fire the flash but No other flash functions are controlled.
Works with my YongNuo YN-468 II and Canon Rebel T3i, MOST of the time.
No, the plate is welded to the ball hinge. However the 1/4" thread can be removed from the plate.
It will fit any camera with a tripod mount. Should be a 1/4" 20 socket on the cam. Look for it in the specs.
absolutely. It held a Kodak Playsport to the outside of my semi-truck at 60 mph with no shakes... It's a wonderful mount
Yes, it is possible. I have both active now. I only use the roller, but just in case a non roller user needs to show me a computer trick, I have the mouse available. I love my rollermouse!
you only replace thermal paste if you notice unusually high temps consistently over a period of time. It is not something you should ever actually have reason to change. as for expiration date, i don't believe this product carries an expiration however it is wise to put it in a safe dry location that is not exposed to high temperatures or direct UV light as this may reduce its effectiveness.
Hello, I'm not sure if you'll need an adapter, from the product description, you shouldn't. The device should work, especially if it's working in other cars. I was not able to plug the device into my phone, it was not a good fit. If your able to return it, that's what I would suggest. I'm sorry, I wish I could help..
Yes
Download the app L5. And play round with it.
The E2000 router should use a power adapter that is suited for the European electrical standard which 220V to avoid electrical overload. This usually happens when the router will be used in Europe.
Yes it has a cutter that will cut tape to the size of the print job.
You have to use 12mm one and select the colors of the tapes to set your colors setting
The film comes in a black plastic holder. However, the back of the camera has a door which when closed, holds the cartridge inside. Hope this helps.
Yes
IF it has an infrared transmitter, then yes, these will work.
Neoprene is my best guess.
No, you can not program routes, however you can recalculate as you're driving and it will provide an alternate route.
I'd just like to mention here, since a lot of the bad reviews are based around this problem, that the problem is FIXED. I did a full free map upgrade, software upgrade, even added new POIs and voices. No errors, and everything is still working fine. The only thing I have deleted is the non-english voices.
Usually refurbished means that it was once in the hands of the consumer who returned it for some reason, maybe it did not work, maybe they decided they did not want it. Either way, it is tested and looked over (usually my the manufacturer) and resold as a refurbished item. Usually Refurbished items are a good bet as they have been looked over and tested by a technician, where as only a few new items are tested.
My guess would be a toll gate.
I just plug my TomTom into mu computer and follow the onscreen directions to get updates.
The problem with TomTom in general is that the maps have to be updated and is not for free. Plus the internal memory is very small. It may stop working just because there is no space. l already bought another one-Magellan with free maps update for life.
Hi Itsawrap. Yes, you can. Here's how you can do it: http://www.linksys.com/us/support-article?articleNum=132275 However, we also agree to what the other user said.
Can't comment on the Canon but it works easily with my HP 8500 wireless officejet. I did have to set it up manually as the browse function wouldn't find the printer on the network for some reason.
yes
I can't answer that, but I can give you some information. I am using it on a PC running Windows 7, and when I spoke with Cisco/Linksys customer service, the rep said that this model was not intended for Win 7. The problems I have had with it overheating don't seem to be an OS problem but rather an ambient temperature issue. So it might work with Win 8, but it wasn't made for it. Good luck!
Yes. All the ones I bought have speakers built in.
The monitor has both DVI and VGA inputs. No HDMI, however.
First type "http://192.168.1.1/" into your browser. Next leave the username blank and enter the password "admin" into the login field. You will come to your routers settings page and if you click on the "status" tab on the far right you will see your internet MAC address listed below. Hope that helps.
Ceton InfiniTV 4 Digital Cable Quad-tuner Card The dimensions are actually on the Amazon product page: Product Dimensions: 6.6 x 0.7 x 2.5 inches
NO idea !
Yes it is. I have same tv. Works great!
I am not sure if it will support any of the high memory games out there but it has worked for every thing I have used very well. I have had no problems with my D630 I am very happy with mine.
Yes, this case will hold it no problem. I have a D5100 with an 18-55mm attached with plenty of room to spare; the 18-200mm is about an 3/4" longer than the 18-55mm.
i dont own this receiver yet just ordered it but i can go ahead and answer your questions since i own the older model of this baby and only upgrading since i plan on getting a 3dtv sometime soon i hope. 1. yes it will encode all the past formats and since it includes decoders for dolby true-hd and dts-hma you are good there 2. in the audio options of every bluray it will give you option for the loseless audio codecs and the older lossy formats like dd+ and dts.
It should have come with one. Thin piece of black(maybe white) wire about 4 feet long. Check the owners manual packet. It is a sneaky way to make you open the owners manual.
Try to check if you are at the right corresponding HDMI input. If that doesn't work try to go to &gt; System preference &gt; displays &gt; click the HDMI output. Hope this work cause mine works fine.
no...It dose not works.
You might just put it in the Boogie Board holder on the back side of the board after the board is in the case where it can't hurt the writing surface. My case is a stretchy pocket with 2 magnetic snap looking latches to hold the flap closed.
I really don't know
Hello dear valued customer: Good day Thank you so much for your letter Please kindly tell me your order ID then I can check it for you? Have a nice day
Not that we carry. Banana plugs are 4mm and all come in that one standard size. If you need something much smaller than that a bare wire might be a better fit.
Aluminum
No this is not a writer. You insert a company issued ID card with a chip that allows you to access the company's domain when you are working virtually.
I don't know.
the drive comes preformatted for windows so your mac can only read but not write you need to call seagate and have them provide you with the paragon driver for you mac.
Yes - it's compatible with Windows 7, Vista and XP http://sdd.toshiba.com/main.aspx?Path=StorageSolutions/ExternalHardDrives/Canvio_External_Hard_Drive
are you still interested in purchasing the item? if you are looking for shipping dimensions due to cost of shipping, amazon's shipping rate for the buyer that you see is flat, therefore I will be paying for most of the shipping to you. what city and zip code are you at?
1.75" H x 3.75" D x 19" W. I've had it for a couple of years and it has performed flawlessly.
4GB (2X2) http://www.crucial.com/upgrade/Dell-memory/OptiPlex/OptiPlex+GX620+Series+(Ultra+Small+Form+Factor)-upgrades.html
I purchased these foam pads for a cheap set of headphones that plug into my TV.
I'm not sure what you are asking. My PC speakers are silent when I have my headphones plugged in. Settings vary on different models. But I use these Philips ear buds with my iPod which has no built in external speaker. It would be nearly impossible for anyone else to hear my ear buds while I am listening to something.
Depends on what you are playing. I mostly listen to audio books and it is just fine for that...but Pono it is not! I noticed yesterday that Philips has some new ones out...haven't tried those yet, but they might be better. I really do like the sound quality of mine, however.
No. At least I have never heard it with the ones I have. But remember, these are being discontinued. I have been using them for years, primarily because they are NOT distracting and just do what they are supposed to do. I'll miss them when I wear out my last set.
Yes, better than any other earbuds I've used. My ears are pretty unique though...
Yes, it will.
I do not know anything about the history of this device. All I know is that it works perfectly with my iPod Nano and Plantronics wireless headphones but does not seem to pair with my new Samsung Circle headphones.
I believe it should. The ad does say it works with S4000. It doesn't say it works with s6500 but it works on my Nikon s6500 anyway. BTW, this week the price is even lower than when I bought it: only $2.24 + $0.99 shipping!
im not sure. you can search for it, im sure you'll find one
iI got this to recharge my camera from my computer as I had lost the recharge unit, It didn't work but I don't think that was the cord's fault. I think my battery in camera was faulty as I found my recharger & I still couldn't charge the battery up. I bought a bigger Cannon camera that I like but sure do miss the small pocket nikon. Sorry I couldn't be more help.
I honestly do not remember but I would honestly stay away from this amp. I bought one and it only lasted 2 weeks. Nephew bought one and lasted a week.
It should work for any 1.8" ZIF HDD, including the Toshiba MK8022GAA.
No, it is not a USB 3.0 connection. It is a USB 2.0 connection.
This is a Ziff-40 connection.
You probably have the sensor on for the camera, it will beep every time someone or something passes through the camera, it is a feature but it can get annoying, I just turned mine off.
The unit will operate completely on its own with no external connections of any kind. It only requires that you plug it in for power and plus the video cable into a TV so that you can set your options and make sure your cameras are all pointed where you want to monitor. No internet connection of any kind is required.
If any phone has internet access, you should be able to use them with the defender
They fit well the second you put them on (correctly r on right ear etc.) but you also have the freedom to adjust them.
Yes. It has a port for a flashdrive.
I do not know. I did not install the cameras myself. That was also over 2 years ago. They are still working and it is a great 4 camera set.
Yes it can, but I would not waste my $ for this system. I had one bad camera out of the box, another went bad soon after install and the DVR went bad a few days after the warranty expired!!
Nope only netflix
There the same thing, just depend's on who your buying it form.
Because these are closed back, they isolated very well for me... almost couldn't hear anything with them on... however, in terms of size... the earmuffs run a little on the small side... so for me they sat on top of my ear rather that over them... after a few hours of gaming they began to ache which caused me to return them and go with something different. the sound quality is great and the sound stage is expansive.
You can output to 2 devices. But it can only have 1 input going to those 2 devices at a time.
video yes......the sound will have to come from your macbook audio out to external speakers.
no they do not work on the the samsung or like any phone, they only work on the apple products well yea but u can use them to play music and pause music
I believe that it will trunk only analog systems.
Yes.
While I can't comment on TELMEX ADSL specifically, the TP-LINK is designed for the international market and therefore its compatibility likely is no more than a configuration adjustment.
If the printer handles AirPrint then it will work. The device does not make a non-AirPrint printer work with an iPad device.
I can not tell you that it will for sure, but I will tell you that it is working great with my Dell 3130 CN that is about 4 years old. All I did was set it up, plug in the cable and print it was amazing. I have been looking for a wireless solution for this printer for over a year and now I have it. If you want my opinion I am pretty sure it should work. Good luck!
I think that it would be a tight fit. I have a cover on my iPad and that fits with extra space, but the keyboard is thicker. If the keyboard is larger than the iPad It won't fit.
Probably, but the fit won't be perfect. The iPad 2 was much thinner than the original iPad. iPad 2 also introduced the cool magnetic hinge Smart Covers that also use magnets to wake/sleep the iPad when you open/close the cover. You can combine a third party case back with a Smart Cover if you want to protect the front and back of the unit. Just make sure the third-party case has a cut out for the magnetic hinge.
No. This is meant for the iPad one only. iPad 2 and 3 are not the same size.
Will work without issue.
I'm not a tech...Sorry! Ask Komputerbay about compatibility.
I don't know the difference, but I believe it matters. Try Komputerbay's web site (or other memory sellers) to get a match of memory compatible with your computer.
Try using just 1 stick. If that works then change the sticks and see if the second works. If you find one stick does not work but the other does then return the bad one for replacement. If they both work it is not the memory.
I don't know. Sorry!
Yes it does.
I don't think so. It is a rechargeable battery and last quite some time.
I think you would have to send it in for repair of bad battery to Sony. No way to replace battery with regular type batteries.
I would think so,no guarantee though
I am not sure myself, but send an email to customerservice@powerbridgesolution.com as I did need to ask them a few questions and they were very responsive. Good luck.
It would likely be a tight fit. The opening for the plug is about 2.5 inches, and the outlet is centered in the opening. Depending on how flexible the cord is, you might get away with it.
Do you know the measurements of your camera? (I checked...Nikon says 4.3 x 2.5 x 1.3) This case's main pocket is about 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.3...a tight fit, might be a pinch too small.
It should work for any camera that has a slot for a strap.
I'm not sure, but if its a 13" laptop type device it should be fine. You can always return it if it does not work out.
Doesn't work with my 256GB SDXC from Lexar.
I used this on my 08 Accord. You best and safest bet would be to ask the manufacturer for compatibility.
Not very well
Don't understand the question, but if you're asking about battery life, I get 4.5 hrs. Will show 6 available fully charged and no wireless on.
Yes
No, I have this headphone and it cannot use to make phone calls, no microphone, and no remote to control music. Yes, it can connect to any 3.5 mm devices, iPhone/ smartphone/ mp3 etc.
yes
Camera yes, but the battery definitely not. But I really liked the case, it protects the camera well and does not cover too much space. My wife carries it around in her purse all the time as the battery life is good. When we go to a vacation I put it in a different case along with the charger, batteries, SD Cards etc etc. So I recommend you to buy 2 cases including this one...
This case would not fit the Sony RX100 Mk II. Check the Lowepro Dashpoint 10 Camera Pouch for a really good fit.
This case would not fit the Sony RX100 Mk II. Check the Lowepro Dashpoint 10 Camera Pouch for a really good fit.
No, it is not waterproof. I'd say it is resistant to light rain, but it can and does get wet.
I don't know the size of the Lumix LX7, but if fits my Canon G16 snugly, which is what I wanted.
They don't receive any message. On their end, the phone just continues to ring and never answers. The nice thing is that you don't hear it ring, but their called id does show up on our tv. (we have cable phone and all phone calls show up on the tv.)
There is no battery backup, however the programming is retained when there is a power outage and when the unit is disconnected.
I would assume it would it is a solid sheet there are no separations, you have to cut the letters out to fit on your keyboard
Only one. But you can buy a "Y" cable at Radio Shack, Target, Best Buy, or even Amazon very cheap.
Looks like 60MM. http://www.samsung.com/us/photography/digital-cameras-accessories/lenses
The manufacturer only lists drivers for XP, Vista, and Windows 7 for this particular graphics card.
I put in an address close by, if I know one.
It does, but buy something else. These units are garbage.
yes you can enter cordinants and set way-points i would still recommend a better GPS I really regret buying mine
I bought it for geocachaing and it turned out ourbe a waste of money it is always pretty far off I get closer with a smart phone than that GPS ever gets. 60 to 80 yards off a lot of the time.
These come as pairs unless specified. I ordered these, and I couldn't be happier! Good sound quality with fantastic looks!
Sorry I don't know
Shipping weight of the crane alone is like 32 pounds. I also ordered the stand and the lcd monitor mount and the package was 38 pounds.
According to the spec listed here http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/SpecSheet/ENG/2879-701278.pdf , its 9.50mm thick. I had to look for a similar criteria since I bought it for my PS3.
Yes, I have the 750GB in my PS3. Works like a champ. I am thinking of switching it out and using it in my PS4.
Do you have Acrobat Reader or Professional? I'm not sure if Reader has highlighting ability, and I can't check since I have professional, but the highlighting tools should be under Comments &gt; Comment
I don't believe it is. I think they're different.
I don't know what that is. As far as I know it only works with Sony's
Yes it is.
This Installation Dash kit is 15.5 X 8 X 1.2 in. As for the opening it self I do not know. The way the kit work is that You will add the sides to the Double Din stereo, which allows the after market deck to secure in the holes in the dash. Then there is a outer cover to secure in case there is a gap.
High quality on both when taken with a high quality camera.
I use these for my broadcasting on a PC, You will need a USB mixer board with XLR inputs, also if your going to have more then 1 headset you will need a headphone distribution amplifier I have a 4 channel HDA and 8 channel mixer for sale if your interested let me know.
I bought these for my ipad 2 and they work perfectly!
Mine is an IPad two.
works great, my daughter had a camera that didn`t have the charger, she said that make`s her camera useable again. Thanks Glenn
Sorry, I don't know, I got them for a different purpose than setting up those kind of lights.
The headset does not have a full-mute external option. The only reliable way to cut all audio that is being output by the headset is to globally mute your audio settings in your operating system, or just take the headset off.
Hello no didnt work i have many problems to configure this wireless
seems to be available now
Someone wana test or mail me a packet to test? :) We cigar smokers use silica beads to maintain humidity in our humidors. When you soak them they release humidity and helps maintain a humidor at 65-70% relative humidity.
Each zone has the capability of selecting 1 of 3 possible inputs. Bus A, Bus B, or an input only for that zone. Bus A and B are available to all zones, the zone input is only available to the zone you connected it to. There is a gain level on each zone, so you can adjust it up or down on the back of the amp, but without any volume control between the amp and the speakers, the speakers connected to that zone will be on whenever a source is playing on the selected input for that zone.
I've only had mine for a few weeks now, but what you're describing sounds like a fan issue. From the looks of the internal pics on here (http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61A0j-QpddL.jpg), you'll likely need to remove the top cover to get to the areas where the fans are, as they sit between a coil and the heat sink. Worst case, they look like standard computer fans, so just replace them all with better fans.
It should. Ideally the second usb port is used, as it provides extra power, but it works with one. If your macbook air has a USB port, you are good.
No, I do not believe it is removable.
The list of brands it is compatible with includes Philips, so I would assume so.
Don't waste your money! When I tried it only limited functions like on/off & play worked. Had trouble finding program code. Best to look for remote that is equal or same as original equipment.
The camera recording rate is 2GB = 30 minutes. Therefore 16GB = 4 hours. This should be obtainable using Energizer lithium AAA's. Switching the camera off then back on will not shorten the battery life compared to letting the camera split the video itself.
no it doesn't. it does come with a sticky mount which can be used for helmets though. i strongly recommend just shelling out the extra couple bucks and get the newest XTC280, it's HD and just as durable and reliable as this one. I have both and love them, but the 280 is the best. check out my review on youtube. 'Midland Cameras Review - XTC100, XTC300, XTC280 - Part 1'
There is no wifi. This an older model.
A PC usually takes more than 100W. You meed a more powerful transformer. Type in "transformer 110v to 230v 1000W" on amazon.
You will have to contact Trisonic - Queens, NY www.trisonic.com I have had one in service for about a year - no problems - may not need a warranty - the thing works better than any other off air signal amp I have tried.
I don't know what the actual mAh is. but it works. and with brightness low it can easily last 6-8 hours with nonstop music playback.
If you want original ones that I cannot answer but try buying those cheap ones from your retail store and check if they fit. It looks to me that they are interchangeable.
Antenna yes. Converter box, no. This TV is digital-ready so the converter box is unnecessary. That's true of all TV's currently on the market.
If your in the States, and if you happen to have a membership to a Costco, Bj's or a Sam's Club, you might be able to pick one up for $239 +tx. Just picked one up at Costco for exactly that, not bad IMO.
I have a FE-280 and it works fine. You need to go to the Olympus website and there they will match up your cameral to the cable you need. That's how I was able to get the one that works for me.

So far, so good. I don't think they last as long as the Canon batteries, but they seem to be good for having backups.
Yes, just need a mini-USB connector/charger
Yes, a 2.5 mm stereo output. for regular headphones you need an adaptor. But can be use with old handsfree sets too.
Yes it does
Yes, I am using a 64GB SD card, I can't speak about the 128 GB SD card (I have never use one)
Yes
Hi, brightness of the display for this Sony Clock Radio has 4 settings - High (default), Middle, Low and Off. Hope this helps. -Ely
yes it is
Can you rephrase the question?
Yes, I use this set up and have had no issues.
No, this battery will not fit the Dell Inspiron 1420.
It doesn't list that model number in the description.
Approximately three inches.
Mine did. I also have a Westinghouse TV, but my original remote got damaged by corroded batteries. This one works great!
The dimensions are posted on the page, please grab a tape measure and check for yourself.
Yes but you would have to install the aux plug (connects to the red and white ends) I ordered mine at the same time as this.
The cause of the problem is that the hole is somewhat undersized. I had a similar problem with the screw snapping in the hole. Simple solution is to run a #6-32 tap through the holes. I returned two of these broken boxes to Amazon and got replacements at no charge within a couple of days. Other than that the product is great.
I am running it on Win7 for a few months now. I believe I had to load the drivers off their CD. Load drivers before plugging the adapter.
I own the 4th gen Ipod so I do not know if it will fit the 5th Gen. But if it is the same size then I would say yes it should fit fine. Hopefully this helps you out a little.
Yes, but the headphones doesn't fit as shown. It works as is for my workouts.
of course not, blurays will never work in a dvd player just like a dvd will not work in a cd player
They ship as a pair.
According to Sony directions , this is what they say to do. "ERROR" appears in the display and the unit turns off automatically. If this symptom occurs frequently, consult your nearest Sony dealer. Be sure the battery is fully charged and perhaps it will be a good idea to unplug the battery for 15 minutes and then plug it back in to reset it , and see how it works. Carl H
Yes, it uses a head ph connector. You can use the new iPhone 5 and connect with the headphone connector to your phone and the sony in the back.
your best bet is to do a Google search for adapters for your type of phone and then search Amazon.
If it has a hand held receiver that unplugs, I would think so. I just unplug mine and plug this in to phone then plug my headset into it. My headset has a mute button on it. I just put the receiver back on the phone when I am done.
Yes if it's a Canon FD lens.
yes it works/fits on the GF3 but what you may not be aware of is that there is no power for the lens meaning that you have to manually focus the lens. To my knowledge, there is no adaptor available that will supply power to the canon lens to auto-focus and if there is one by now, I am sure it is WAY more expensive than this one.
Yes
Not sure where it is made but I'm sure if you email the company they could give you more info on that. Here is their website. http://www.fotodioxpro.com/ I have bought 4 of these adapters (3 Canon FD & 1 Minolta) and they all work great. The lens doesn't screw in it actually just locks into place then you just mount the lens to your camera like you would any other lens. You can focus to infinity.
Yes you can but only in manual mode.
Here's what I know, I have multiple sources connected via HDMI to J-Tech and using the optical cable connecting to my Audio Receiver. This gives me surround sound from all my HDMI sources, exactly what I was looking for, hope this helps.
Tack one tells you to go to track 3, which is the cleaning track. You are told cleaning will begin in a moment and then some music is played. That is the cleaning. Track 2 is just filler to put the data of track 3 in the middle of the CD where the brush is. Track 4 is to make sure you get proper stereo separation from your device setup.
You will need to fold the wire over to get the screw to crimp it in place, but it should work.
This should work just fine in that computer.
It only comes in the color you order. The LEDs are not switchable and they do not turn off. Just an FYI here: I've been playing it hard with mine on Star Trek Online, SWTOR, and the Sims 3 with no issues for almost a year.
On my computer this lets me drag windows back an forth between two monitors. Sounds like it is what you need.
1U Rack-mountable chassis 30.4" (77.2cm) D x 16.7" (42.6cm) W x 1.67" (4.26cm) H with bezel attached Rack Weight 35.8 lbs (16.3 Kg), maximum configuration
is Gen. II
Yes it does. My brother has the Galaxy S3 and it worked just the same.
Yes.
Not sure what exactly you are asking. The 3 wire hook ups are terminated with a screwed termination at the housing. The Cable wire to the antenna would need an end connector but, I think your question is about the 3 wire only. It's just standard 3 wire inside a PVC jacketed exterior shielding. No terminal ends included
yes
It's right in the item's description, but somewhat disguised. Assuming your computer is newer and equipped for eSata, its a great item - and fast. Although it's less flexible than my USB 3.0, it runs faster on my PC. http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003IT6PH2
This keyboard works fine with a MacBook Pro.
Yes. I have tested it directly attached to a laptop and connected through a KVM switch. In both cases it works fine.
They should. This pair of Panasonic earphones uses a standard 3.5mm stereo jack, and most tablets (including the Kindle Fire) have a standard 3.5mm audio jack, so they should work without problems.
No
No, there is no volume control. The volume control should be on the device you using them with. Hope this helps.
Yes they do work on iPods, iPod touches, and iPhones I personally use them on the iPhone and I have my setting to bass boost and they sound amazing. P.S they have no mic.
Nope. These have no controls whatsoever. They are earphones only.
You need a esata cable and an encloser with an esata port
No this is a Female E-SATA to male USB 3 connector.
no. It's one player, but two screens.
It comes with long cords, you can mount it to either side of the headrest. It is a great player! We bought head phones for each screen, so only the boys can hear the movie.
Complete set with dvd
I am actually not really quite sure, most electronics that have rechargeable batteries you can buy batteries for. You will just need to search around your area, search the web or ask around your local area that specialize in electronics. I am pretty sure you can, you just have to make sure the battery matches the model number of the electronic that you have, and want an extra battery for. I hope this helps you.
Usually, the longer the cable the bigger the gauge wiring to help ensure a better signal and possibly the more shielding it has to protect it from electro magnetic interference (emi). That said, usually a signal doesn't degrade, at least enough to notice, at 15 vs 3 feet. But hey, bigger is better. Hopefully you didn't need a super playable cable. As for normal, it's up to the manufacture at that short of a distance to up the gauge. Hope that helps you.
Well, correct me if I am wrong but AWG is only used to measure bare wire. In this case, the cable has a outer radius of 0.25 inches, that Gauge is approximately close to #2. However, without taking it apart, I can't tell you the individual wires inside the cable.
Nope but I know it could or should be. Best OEM cable I ever bought.
Yes it will. As long as the player and the tv are 3d capable you're all set!
I assume both
Bought for the same reason. It works, actually worked for 2 weeks and then stopped working. Buy another brand if you ask me.
As long as the respective ends are able to connect to the tv and tablet. I'm assuming Hdmi to tv and mini Hdmi to tablet. It worked fine when I did it.
As long as your device has a micro usb jack it should work its six feet long and I checked for you only found it in black as is with most things that come with the Amazon name on them . I hope this helped have a great day
if your printer has a micro usb port, it should detect it
Dear Reb, It depend if your BluRay player have a composite RCA for AV output, then it will work. HDMI can only provide HD AV, NOT analog AV, therefor the 3.5mm plug can only provide analog audio. but an additional 3.5mm to 2xRCA Y-cable required on your Sony TV end. If your BluRay only have HDMI port, than this cable wouldn't work for your applications. Please see link for BluRay back panel details. We hope this have answer your question. http://www.amazon.com/Sony-BDPBX39-Blu-ray-Player-Wi-Fi/dp/B0091VAHIO/ref=sr_1_18?ie=UTF8&qid=1404257822&sr=8-18&keywords=sony+bluray+player
I'm not 100% sure, but it should work for what you're needing it for. I used it to hook an Xbox 360 up to a tv that only had the dvi, and used the audio cable to connect to surround sound. Hope that helps
Yes, you can use this for 220v country. I am using the same converter for my heater in India.
The instruction sheet says it works with heating type appliances up to 1875 watts, including curling irons. However, I have never used it for this application. Yes, it does convert 220 to 120 volts. Thank you.
net gear has the device you need...also your internet provider can get it for you as well...
I bought the 16 gb scandisk that said "xbox" on it, it worked fine. to save money I bought a regular scandisk , also 16gb, and it seems to work fine also. I think any flashdrive would work, as long as it fits in the usb port
you can put muic on it but your phone would need a USB Plug adapter
you sure can do that.
No its just the ring .. works for alien bees!!!
Yes, you can but speed rings for various moonlights that will fit on this soft box. It will not work with a speed light.
This kit comes with a speed ring for Balcar / Paul C Buff (Alien bee, Einstein) etc. I don't think that speed ring will work with Godox. If you go to fotodiox.com you can search for speed rings that goes with Godox (http://www.fotodioxpro.com/index.php/speedring-chart)
Mine were velcro, but VERY hard to tell/open the first time. I'm not sure if the heat had bonded the velcro or what, but I could NOT get the rods through for the life of me! Hope that helps.
Yes! Any strobes with Bowen connector. I have Calumet lights with Bowen's fittings.
NO there is not, its just RCA only, which most TV's have. the picture quality is just as good to be honest, and this unit is only Twenty something dollars, you cant really beat the price, I've LOOKED EVERYWHERE. The unit works fine. Just like any unit, you can buy a $5,000 player and still have to return it if it doesnt work. This unit was well worth Twenty bucks and change
NO
I have never had a problem with any dvd's unless they were copies Sorry I cannot help you
Sure here you go: http://www.amazon.com/White-Female-Dress-Tripod-Wooden/dp/B004COAO38/ref=pd_bxgy_ac_img_y
you can turn the body easily
I am sorry but i dont carry anything in that exact size, you can try the child dress form that might be the closest to those measurements. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GNHK4QO
we can only ship to USA currently.
Yes, you will need a SAS controller if you want to use SAS drives
It should. I shoot a 5D3 which is the same generation and it all works just fine.
Yes it does support true surround, rear right/rear left (stereo), and it does it perfectly &#128077;
Because it's special keyboard for professionals and for blind typing
Yes
Check the compatibility chart at http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/support-info.pl?&info_id=12&mdl=DSCTX1#m2 I think the HG is faster and supports 16GB and 32GB that is not supported by the standard Pro Duo.
Hi Jesse Porter, yes this Sony 8 GB pro HG duo HX memory stick will work on your Sony DSC-W90. -Ely
Ido not know, I use it in a Canon................
No, as far as I know it shall be Wi-Fi. Val
Will a LG product work with a Viszio is a better question.....
Should be if u have what looks like a usb port on back of t.v
I think I bought these batteries in 2013. They show an expiration date of March 2019.
I'm not sure.....it didn't work for my Toshiba so I will probably say no.....but u can always get another opinion on it.
I don't think you need this piece of hardware for that desktop, since this tray is mostly for servers with hot swappable disks, since it's reachable from the outside, so you can take the disk in or out without turning off or opening your server, as far as I know in that workstation all the disks are internal.
This case will absolutely fit the iPad air. It fits like a glove with extra wiggle room too.
A good snug fit with iPad 2 and Logitech keyboard
Mine does ... and very well.
Absolutely - Weather Broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week!
Short answer is yes. But you must set up the radio to first the frequency of a weather radio signal in your area and turn on the alert feature. Note that you will receive only official alerts from the weather service, and they are normally in advance of any TV or commercial radio alerts.
Do not know. I have HPG72.
electric power wire? the usual positive negative connections
someone, anyone? come on suppliers!!!! people have to make decisions
It does have one HDMI input. You can hook whatever you want to up to it as far as I can tell. The thing that makes it bad for TV is the viewing angle. As long as you're front and center everything will look awesome. If you're too high or too low it won't look good.
I didn't get shoulder strap either.
The iPhone does VGA video (640x480); the Flip does HD 720p (1280x720), or three times the resolution. The widescreen format of the Flip HD camcorders, in addition to the HD factor, means that Flip HD video look much better on YouTube than iPhone video. iPhones are great, but not in the same class with Flip for video. I agree with the previous comment that the UltraHD is the best value.
Yes, it has .... But I would not recommend to buy it
Sorry but I don't have a IPhone 5 but it should work with any phone
Sorry we tried before but the cost of shipping is too pricy $ 112 priority 5-7
It comes with all the home type mountings. The one change is a RV has a built in directional changer if you are more rural that may be your only issue. The unit needs to be aimed at the signal source if your stations all broadcast from the same area you should be fine.
I don't know but, contact Camping World or King Controls for technical advice. They both would know for sure.
Gentle. Enough to blow a sheet of paper across my desk, but not too strong that a simple paperweight won't stop. It's a quiet, gentle breeze, too.
About 5" tall Maybe 3-4 wide
I don't have any experience specific to your question. You do not need to utilize an inverter for this unit. The power supply is 12vdc so you can power it from the vehicle 12 battery using a 12vdc plug-in to a source of 12vdc from your car and provide power to the transmitter in that fashion. I don't know about a hum if using an inverter as I have not used this unit in an automobile.
Yes, it is keyed front and back. I am very pleased with this rack, it is very well built!
No
Don't buy it. It shorted out after 5 one hour teaching sessions.
I am unsure, but "2-Din" is a double height standard for all radio/CD/DVD players. If the center-dash of the Explorer can accommodate a 2-Din unit (and most current vehicles can), then you should be okay. Check with your dealer if it is 2-Din compatible.
Absolutely. This is a phenomenal unit and you can actually install two of these in the same space as one. Doing that enables you to use the gps while backing up and you use the other one to monitor while you backup. I find the gps and rear view camera enable me to actually travel to work at full reverse speed since forward doesn't work in my truck anymore. I encourage you. Install 2!
is this compatible with VGN-CR?? if it is then i am getting one. thanks.
USA, Canada and Mexico in theory, but the maps are not of good quality... I had myself some bad surprises even in big cities (New Jersey and New York city)
Mine does this every now and again. In just over a year, I have had to re-load the 'home' software twice, while the seller website forgets about me too. I stopped getting reminders about newly updated maps too. I spent several hours yesterday reinstalling and 'reminding' the website who I am. Tech support have a record of me, but it is not easy to find anything about my account when I first connect. Most of their website is geared towards newer units, which is reasonable, I guess. Basically, just reinstall the software, and go from there.
It works with ANY IR remotes. It just redirects the signal inside of a cabinet. If cabinet is open it won't work very well as it basically just shoots it back at you instead of bouncing off a cabinet wall back to the device.
No, for PS3 you need to buy the Bluetooth specific module. http://www.logitech.com/en-us/product/5732?crid=1052
No, you shouldn't need a different remote to use the Logitech Extender. The system 'reads' the (infrared - IR) signal from your remote, sends it by wire to your enclosed cabinet and equipment, and rebroadcasts the IR signal near your equipment. It's worked with the half dozen different remotes I've had, no problem at all.
I would say no or it depends. My TV this would not work because it would not recognize this device. My USB port on my tv is mean for reading a USB jump drive with pictures and video and such and is not meant for audio transmission. However yours might. The TV manual may help determining this. But I can't say I even tried to do this, but I'll confirm what I think is true for my situation.
Hello - I am not sure of the answer. It depends how much the TV is "like" a computer that has USB ports. I recall the first time I plugged it into my laptop, the system went off and found and installed some driver for it, that took the usual 10-20 seconds. I am guessing this automatic driver install "just happens" as part of the way USB ports behave. Worth a try anyway.
From what I read about your board/computer, it does not state that the 1090t is supported. However, it does support other AM3 6 core processors. Like the 1065t would be your maximum upgrade. But keep in mind, that will push your board to its limits. Keep it very cool, and you should be ok. Your board does NOT support AM3+. Be sure you don't go that route ;) That's a whole other ball of wax. Not to mention, your bios might need updating.
Hi! You will run under carpet without any problem.... this a very well made cable, very sturdy! This specs form the cable: "A copper clad center conductor, dielectric insulation, aluminum braiding and 2 layers of foil shielding, for maximum protection against the hum/static encountered when multiple devices are in close proximity of each other".....
Should not be a problem with a fix outdoor antenna.
The shielding should be grounded for maximum effect in both indoor and outdoor installations. You should be able to achieve this by grounding at the connector to the household ground. However for an outdoor antenna you should also have lightning conductor grounding by using a grounding wire at the antenna end connected through a grounding block. Search on Amazon for grounding block to see what I mean.
Negative. The D3100 has a slightly different body housing.
The outside diameter is 1/4 inch.
Sound quality is good. Especially for an $8 adapter. Just gotta adjust the volume on your mp3 player and your car stereo to minimize the white noise. Use it everyday and am very satisfied.
I'd say around 2.5-3ft
Don't think the adapter will work for that. Sorry Maureen
No, it does not have image stabilization. The optics are far better than the kit lens and I've been very happy with the images.
We have a 40" Sony TV on it and it works fine. I think the plasmas are a bit heavier. You should check to see if there is a weight spec. It is pretty solid so should work.
No, But It Will Work Fine On Brick, You Will Need To Pre Drill Holes With A Masonry Bit.
About 3 or 4 inches. Its very close to the wall. And very sturdy.
Sorry, I don't have it.
There is between 1.5 and 2.75 inches from left to right. The difference is at the top and bottom where there are plates that allow two units to be mounted together.
I think it should be OK if you have to drill thru pole and use metal screw. Make sure pole are good firm from ceiling and floor. Can the place on beam to attach the 2 shelf, are more safety than pole. Good luck!
Yes, as long as you purchase the Sigma for Nikon mount.
Yes, as long as you purchase the Sigma for Nikon mount.
I can tell you that my recent order did not have iLife 11 installed. Apple offers an iLife "uptodate" program where you can order the update for a nominal fee. ($6.99) The problem is... Apple has not accepted the receipt i printed from Amazon because it does not include a part number. Amazon customer service has yet to provide me with a solution...
Both of mine are 2009 models and still working fine
has some crashed on the screen or anywhere? which is the final price and time that would come if I am in NY
My logic board went out - apparently there was a recall on 2007 apple laptops, so they replaced it completely. It was failing every time I tried to use it with a projector. The repair was free. I also had to replace the optical drive, which I had to pay for. It has been working fine since those repairs.
One difference I can say is that this laptop has an integrated disk drive and with the new one you have to have the external drive. I like the integrated!!
Yes it does! I wish it had an on - off button.
this is an excellent item - way less than the Nikon version - buy one!
they are all AM3 processors, it will work fine.
Recently got one for macbook pro 11inch. It was a wise choice, I would reccommend to anyone.Good luck and enjoy.
The adaptor doesn't have any affect on lens. The crop factor of the m4/3 camera will double the field of view of adapted lenses. The focal length will remain 75-150 but due to the crop factor of M4/3 the field of view will double giving you 150-300. http://blog.prophotosupply.com/2013/full-frame-vs-aps-c-m43-and-what-crop-factor-actually-means/
yes it should. mine does with all the primr lenses that I have.
I purchased this some time ago, plus it was for a work camera which I do not have at home. I can't honestly say...I just don't remember, sorry.
i think its 127.26 per speaker. not sure. i multiplied the 180 watt peak power by .707 hope this helps
Sorry, not familiar with Dynomat? These speakers perform great even when mounted on lower panels. The tweeters are rotational and can be adjusted pointing up with the high or low setting on the tweeter, your preference.
You can run them from the factory head unit if that is what you are asking. Of course $250 of external amps would make them sound better.
If im not mistaken a aftermarket/stock radio pre-amp is 45x4 or 50x4 meaning your slightly better from amp than running from headunit. Depending on amp actual power may be less than advertised. it will work but dont expect them to be much louder than stock speakers. i have a 2500 watt 5 channel amp running 100 watts to each to these(and they could have more, but plenty loud with just 100watts) and the rest for subs. Side note when buying amp/ speakers you want the amp rms at least 80% of the speakers peak for best results.
You should. I used it also to replace a weaker 4 amp hour draw battery. It's been working great for five months.
They snap on easily and I've never had an issue with them coming off. The only issue I have with them is on the cheaper cameras the images are soft when using the "Fong" as we call them.
Sorry, I don't know.
Hi It was a box approximately 70 cm X 40 cm X 12 cm Product is very good
You'll have to get a flash mount for that... out of the box is not possible...
Don't know, but I imagine it will pop into any spring release tripod.
I don't think so, reason being slot that iPad sits in is very thin.
Unsure how a ceiling mount works, but there has to be room to pull the cover over the top of TV. It will Velcro/zip around but the cover itself has to be pulled on from the top. Hope that makes sense.
I haven't, but I wouldn't recommend it. I would lightly hand wash it. My concern would be that running it through the wash my degrade the waterproof material or coating.
XF300 is a great camera, though, it has issues in low light situations. And the XF300 tops out at 1080p, so a 4K camcorder would have a higher resolution.
I think it will fit in about any HP laptop.... I called HP and they told me.
As long as you mean the physical "drive" and not the software driver, the answer is yes. I have played commercial DVDs using this drive that I retrofit into a Dell small form factor computer as I wanted a LightScribe drive. It if will fit in your computer, it should play DVDs with no problem.
Vizio confirms August release date. It's as firm as any Vizio announcement which means "maybe". It will likely be the usual best bang for the buck, but a 6 year old could do a better job handling their new product releases. P.S. Enjoy your last Visio TV. It looks like Apple will have a web-enabled TV coming this year (macrumors) which is expected to make roadkill out of this segment of the market.
Why are you touching the bevel? I think the screen is matte. I kinda wish it was glossy.
The Sv470xvt is Vizio's first 120hz 47" high end model, however it was released in 2008. The M470nv (I own it), was released May, 2010. The M470 has internet apps via Wifi\Ethernet like Amazon Video on Demand, Rhapsody, Netflix, Hulu, TvGuide, etc. It also has a smart Bluetooth Remote\Keyboard. The m470 is 899 on Amazon, and is competing with LG and Samsung's similarly priced (about 100-200 more) thin LED Internet App Model TVs.
Go to ebay and purchase another remote.
The cut off frequency on all 5 speakers is 2500Hz. This information is found in the manual which can be downloaded from the Jamo web site. ( www.jamo.com ) Enter "S 426 HCS 3" in the web sites search engine and the line will pop up. Click on manual for additional info.
Hi Virgil, Some Skullcandy earbuds have what they term 'nylon braided cables'. Here is an ASIN: B003CVU59K. They seem to be the 'Titan' series from Skullcandy. We do not have any in stock, but there are many merchants on Amazon that carry Titans. Thanks James from Labrador Creek
They are OK earbuds for their pricing. I wouldn't call them the best but they have good sound quality and they seem to last a while. As in on most cheaper headphones, the wires inside the connection get yanked out and you lose sound in one or both ears. These I didn't have that problem for a long time. They lasted probably 4-5 months with everyday use.
The CGate1000S Identifies a pre authorized number like any caller ID, thus when a caller that his number was pre-programmed into the CGate1000S calls it the callers number is identified first, then the call is denied (that's why the call is free) and the gate is opened. CGate1000S operates on a 2G GSM cellular network such as AT&T or T-Mobile. First validate on these companies website that you have good quality 2G GSM data signal and then purchase the CGate1000S.
About 8" by 11". They fit nicely in a three ring binder. Each page will hold two 5" by 7" pictures or postcards.
Yes!! It's not exactly double sided but its big enough to put your cards, pictures..etc. it works great with my cards and I put two in each pocket to display them..hope this helps :-).
Will fit cat 5/6... but Cat 7 dont know.
It does support enclosures with port multipliers. However, it only supports 1 port multiplier. I have a http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YFHEAC/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1 connected to it and it works fine. However, if I connect a second one, it doesn't see the second one. You can connect a single eSATA drive to the second port as long as it doesn't have a port multiplier. So, the short answer is that you can only connect one device with a port multiplier.
Yes. Plug and play.
Yes, that's what I use it for.
Yes, but it's always better to have more than what u need than not enough.
A good brand 8 Gauge should be good for this amp, if(I don't know how you could)you added an extra $10 on the purchase, I have some New 8 Gauge Rolls, I could put together a pretty nice wire kit and ship together! And I can Print of the 18 Page Manual to send along also. Or email it to you!
Standard amp Install kit was fine for me. And yes comes with instructions.
This is an all-in-1 setup. The amp is wired and set up to work with these speakers (or similar speakers in the same Ohms range). It's not built to pump out the low frequencies of a sub, nor does it have the power for it. You could use a spliter to run RCA cables to both this amp and a separate amp for a sub to "add" one to it. Or you could bridge and rewire and run one with very little power with this one, but you will eventually fry it.
Most people need a 3/4" spacer to make this box work. I had to grind out a small space (about 1/2") to fit a kicker speaker I bought from best buy. My friend had to do the same with a different speaker.
Yes it should...it's rated at 700 watt rms at 4 ohms Bridged
I also wondered the same. I now have the unit and it DOES NOT display album art. Also, the ipod controls are OK, not great. There doesn't seem to be a search feature, or anyway to advance through long lists (I have 1000 artists, so to get down the list 5 at a time takes a long while). I also haven't found a way to control the ipod through itself.
Yes
If you have OnStar you will nee a Antenna Adaptor, OnStar interface to keep you door chimes and system and you will need a installation Dash kit and if you want to utilize the backup camera feature you will need a camera and a bypass for your DVD and Navigation features..... Very easy to install once you have all the pieces laid out
It has all the RCA and high inputs, but there are no outputs.
No. These are junk. Go to hardware store and buy something else.
If it's got two 4ohm voice coils and you wire it for a 2ohm load to the amp, it should sound great. I have one 10 in a sealed box rated at 700w rms I'm running at a 2ohm load on the amp and it sounds excellent.
You could as long as u have a ground wire and have a good ground and positive wire con
Yea and its still banging like it did when i bought it. Email me and ill make a video for u. Devarisridison@gmail.com
What is a non inviter generator? Are you talking about a square / non sine wave generator?
Yes it is but we recommend RAM upgrade or best upgrade the hard drive to SSD.
An old version can be a model made 3 or 4 years ago. My suggestion is buy newest version on apple products
The battery should be inside so yes the battery would come with it.
The 13-inch MacBook Pro is labeled "Assembled in China".
It's already been upgraded to Yosemite, but I still have the original disks that came with it so if you want you can start from scratch
Yes it will work perfectly. But these amps have a high defect rate.
Gotta run all subs to one out put like in a a series
Yeah. Single 4ohms and even dual 4 ohms. I game mine to my son and it works like a charm. Cheap amp. Just keep in mind that there are some defective ones out there . But P.A will repair it for free. Minus shipping and handling.
As long as you currently have DDR3 it should be.
Yes, it has worked with every camera I own, rebels, canon 60D, 70D and 6D
regular shipping You will get it Monday no maximum regards
My Pentax K20D and AF360fgz flash can only sync at 1/180 sec. These wireless triggers worked perfectly with this sync speed on my camera and flash. I also used these triggers with my other speedlights (like old Nikon SB-15, Yongnuo YN460, etc.) without any problem. I've taken many portrait photos with these triggers without any problem. Not sure if they work higher than this.
No. If you're technically inclined and willing to take a risk, you could try splicing additional wire into the existing speaker wires, but the wires are very thin (high AWG, I believe around 28 AWG) so be careful.
Yes
Not sure about Otterbox, but it will not work with LifeProof case... iPhone needs to be out of the case to sit in dock.
According to the PocketWizard cable finder, the CM-E3-ACC is the correct cable for the 60D. As far as I know (all evidence would indicate), the cable should work with all Pocket Wizard models. I've only tested with the T3i and the PlusX (which worked flawlessly), so I don't want to promise, but I very strongly believe that this will work for you.
I belive it will im using rg8u,however it should take rg8x
Should be no problem at all
You should be able to use this in any DirecTV installation.
Thanks for your question. AV-Express storefront has these available for more than 6. Please contact them.
Since mine is already installed I cannot tell you exactly but I do remember that while it was tight, everything did fit.
If U connect directly to the speaker U will only hear the bottom end
Vertical antennas generally need base radials. With a mobile mount such as this one the metal roof of the vehicle supplies that. If you have a house with a metal roof it should work fine. My mag base antenna works fine on the metal roof of my porch, if I bring it inside and set it on the wooden floor it doesn't work well at all.
Approximately 6".
single iirc
I run my i7 and 780ti just fine. 60w idle and about 360w load? I haven't measured in awhile
Even though it's an ACX power supply and it's really tiny, it comes with an ATX bracket so it will work anywhere. However, the problem is that the 24-pin power cable is really short, so it may or may not reach depending on your motherboard and case layout.
YES
Not sure because computer has one spot for 3.5 plug and headphones come with two prong plug and requires converter for laptop. Hope this is helpfull.
6 ft
I'm pretty sure you can- just to be safe I would google the specs of your tv and cross reference the specs of this mount just to be safe-
I have an LG 55LM4600 LED LCD and it works quite well with that. Not absolutely sure if your plasma would work. do you have any dimensions you can work with to check compatibility?
No... because that isn't a usb connector you are looking at... it's a displayport conector
I don't think its possible with this adapter unless your android device has a standard size displayport connector which is just a touch bigger than HDMI....most likely what you are looking for is minidisplayport to vga Would be helpful to know which android tablet you have or are planning to purchase.
This adapter takes a Display Port and converts it to VGA. Do not confuse this port with USB to VGA. Your HP Envy Touchsmart should have a DP port. I purchased this very same adapter for a Touchsmart and attached a 2nd monitor to it. Hope this helps.
Sigma is a renowned lens manufacturer, this lens is probably one of their top of the range Zoom lenses. I bought mine in South Africa and it did come with a 3 year warranty for South Africa. It should be the same for you cause Sigma has operations in the USA.
This lens is great for low light situations especially without fast motion as the autofocus isn't as fast as the Nikon/Canon version. The f2.8 will be great for indoor/poor lit situations!
I have never had a problem with lens flare, but I have always used the included lens hood too.
Yes it has it's own auto focus motor that is required for a 5100.
Yes, I use a Logitech keyboard cover on my iPad and there is plenty of room...
Yes, I use a Logitech keyboard cover on my iPad and there is plenty of room...
Mine was black
works fine with my Ubuntu 10 build
I read another reviewer who had the same issue and found that if you connected the monitor to your computer via a DVI, rather than an HDMI, cable, the picture will fit the screen.
Yes, about the deck of cards size
No, I use mine all the time with isound 16000mah battery backup it has 4 USB and up to 2.5 amp out got charging high end phones and tablets.
It's not worth buying. Product only works half the time.
I don't recall it having a peer adaptor, but it did have a USB connector. I think I had to buy the firewire, but it's been a long time so I don't recall . . .
anyone?
I found there to be a bit of a green tint when I first turn it on, but it resolves after it warms up a bit. Not a big deal to me. Perhaps my green is your blue with a bit of yellow thrown in??
It does not come with 3D Glasses. Those are extra. I am reviewing different glasses now but haven't decided on a pair. I plan to try to find a good DLP link pair instead of the IR emitter.
Yes, the wireless trigger does attach to the a camera's hotshoe. It is a fragile piece; careful with it!
The power cable is 39 inches. The input cable is 69 inches
I required a charging cable after my dog ate into my Sony cable. This is a generic adapter and it will work on a VAIO. but first match the ac input and dc output with the original. The specs will be in the tech specs that came with the VAIO. (I had to google the manual since I lost my original.)
Of course we're buying it. Who wouldn't spend the life savings of 20 Steve Jobs on one sound system? Nah, just kidding. These reviews are all for fun. I have no idea what psychopath would actually purchase these.
No
I don't believe you need to BUY something to review it. You can just review it. But yes, you'd need to win the lottery at least 100,000 times to get this.
Maybe was my mistake, but it's not working to re-charge my cam.
No. Custom size.
I dont know. I noticed the same thing so i just went with this one and it works fine for me! Nice and solid and the arm extends out. I noticed it was kind of tight spinning in a circle so I took it apart and removed the grease that was in it and replaced it with some bearing lube lol now it spins real easy.
I did not need the card reader, so never looked at it.
Not sure.
No
I would call it full size. But don't believe the dimensions given in Amazon's listing. They're so large it must be the size of the box and not the mouse. By my measurements it's approx. 4-3/8" long and the width varies from about 2" to about 2-3/8". We have a couple of them... one for my desktop and another for my wife's laptop.
No, this mount will not rotate.
The support page for M305 says no replacement parts available. &lt;http://www.logitech.com/en-us/support/wireless-mouse-m305?osid=14&bit=64&crid=398?
This is the brand I have on my iPad and it's 1st generation, it fits perfectly.
It only work with iPad 2 generation and latter, the first generation don't work.
From the LG website these are the compatible plasmas: PK950, PK750. See: http://www.lg.com/us/tv-accessories/lg-AN-WL100W-wireless-media-kit, click on the Technical Specifications tab.
You need a light stand socket attachment such as http://www.amazon.com/LimoStudio-Studio-Socket-Umbrella-Holder/dp/B005D1OWEG These have a mount that attaches to the nub on the top of the light stand. Quality and price vary so be sure to research.
The size is not the issue so much as the type of softbox. You should probably use a Neewer brand softbox as those are made specifically for their strobelights. I mistakenly purchased a Godox softbox instead of a Neewer brand. The ring does not quite fit the strobelight properly.
http://www.marine-electronics-shop.com/garmin-gpsmap-78-series-comparison-table/
No clip, but there is a lanyard.
No the connect is to big. It is this one. http://www.amazon.com/Replacement-Adapter-Pavilion-DV1000-DV6000/dp/B001MQ8CBU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1411774850&sr=8-1&keywords=dv6000+charger
I can not say for sure as I don't have that model. But I can ask two questions; Does your phone have a seperate headset button? and does your phone block your talking in the earpiece? In other words you hear the other parter speak but when you speak you do not hear yourself? If you say yes to both questions then I believe this would work with your phone. The input for the headset is a standard 4 wire phone jack. I am very pleased with my purchase and use it almost every day.
Yes. It's a great value.
The motherboard user guide says that the AM3 socket is designed for AMD Phenom II / Athlon II / and Sempron 100 series processors. You may want to check the ASUS website for any updates to the vendor list or additional specifications.
Normally you can through your vendor/CDW ect.. You will have to send them a pictuce of the serial number. I had to do this for a Cisco WAP recently even though I didn't buy the device through CDW.
yes
Yes. I put the spare battery I received with my purchase of the TI Nspire CAS in the calculator to charge it worked fine.
My quick look at the Wacom site (Asia Pacific), indicates that the Art Pen is compatible with this tablet.
mine says ptk 440, its an intuos4 so give me 400 and itll work. ill take dollars, diamonds whatever.
Intuos4/5 & Cintiq 2nd Gen Airbrush SKU# KP-400E-00DBX Yes it will if the product numbers are the same as provided here this code is from the Wacom site the trick is it must be the second Gereration model.
The interior shelf depth on my unit is 17 3/4".
With the door FULLY open my cinder block sized Harman Kardon 7.1 AV receiver fits with 3/4" or so on either side. No tape measure nearby right now, but the Techcraft website has specs...
Don't know about the Wacom Cintiq 13HD. I have an Intuos4 but the case does include a nifty little loop for the stylus that fits just above the tablet but under the zipper. Good luck.
Your Intuos will probably fit in the small sleeve according to the dimensions of CTH680 and the small sleeve dimensions.
If your Bamboo is 13.5" x 9.5" or smaller it will fit.
My medium Intuos Pro (outer dimensions 15"x10") fits perfectly in the case.
No, you still need a computer.
I haven't even been able to get this device to work with linux. I think what you want is IPMI, which is a common feature on commercial-grade motherboards. You might also be able to use wake on LAN + SSH or VNC.
No straps that I am aware of. There is a hidden zippered compartment that I can store a few cords in but no straps.
Yes you can and there are many ways to accomplish it... I have four GPS units. One is in my Van, the GPSMAP for geocashing and kayaking and I have for my bicycle. All Garmin and out of all of them my favorite one is the 62St. I have though about selling it several times because I do not kayak anymore and it is really bulky for the bicycle but because it is very good when it comes to receiving from satellites I hold on to it.... Very accurate and built really solid......
Yes. There are TOPO maps wich are more for hiking and there are the road maps.
Yes
Man, you must have a ROCKING car wash business going. Also... pretty close. All commercially available GPS units will be about the same as far as accuracy.
Only if you have clear view of the sky !!!
Don't know if it works with an iPod. It definitely didn't work with an iPhone. In fact, the thing is a piece of junk--don't lose the receipt.
Yes it works with an ipod shuffle.
They will email you for the info they need, at least that's what happened when I ordered.
No, there was not an instruction manual. The product did not work either. Fell apart in two days.
The base has a slotted screw hole for wall mounting. The aray elements are on a 2-way swivel the lets you turn them horizontal and aim them.
Google online how to check your tower in your area it might be too far away for you to get certain channels
there are no batteres associated with antennas. you plug the control box that came with the ant. into the nearest 120volt wall outlet and the box puts 12volt ac out to the antenna through the ant. cable that hooks up the ant to the control box and this control box also has a coax cable that goes to the television antenna input
We have 15 CLP1040's and a CLS110 that work fine with each other. I believe both these models have 4 channels.
Sorry, I don't know what crossover means. I plug these into my smartTV or laptop (using the headphone jack). Sorry I couldn't help more. I like logitech speakers better btw. They have better bass. I have a set of those in another room.
Not really, glad you wrote, thought it was my computer,,lol it is what it is. I plan to buy something better in the future. Gotta get decent money. Good Luck
No, they are wired.
absolutely 100% compatible for all trim levels on 04 3 series
That model has no optical drive. Take a look: http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/704086-REG/Acer_LX_PTC02_087_Aspire_TimelineX_AS3820T_5246_13_3_.html#specifications I am also considering getting this model. How does Acer compare with others in build, reliability, customer service,...?
I can't say. I had to read my camera's model to figure out which adapter to buy, and this one worked like a charm
There is no sound card. It's on board sound. And the PC is way overpriced.
Sure ,even more,a protective sleeve
try pulling it back out and check the bulb. remember do no touch the glass. reinstall and secure the screws.
I think the casing is different but you can just swap the bulbs and use the old casing that's what I did..
As this is made for the Seagate FreeAgent GoFlex it has a cable with USB connections and an adapter to SATA. The Western Digital Passport has Mini USB, but the model called My Passports looks like it has the same flat USB 3.0 socket, so in that case you just need this. http://amzn.com/B005K6G7BU
Sorry, SecuirtyMan do not make this product with White background
EF not EF-S. I use them on my 5D mk2
It works very well with my T3i but I'm not familiar with the 7D.
I don't know about that lens specifically, but the tubes have electrical contacts that allow for communication between the camera and the lens, so it should work. The tubes work with our Nikon D50 and D3200 and both our nikkor lenses just fine.
The covers are a heavy-duty, thick cardboard covered with leather. Once you fill them with DVDs or CDs they feel pretty substantial and sturdy. I've purchased 20 of them (from a different website) and am very happy with the quality.
Not worth the price
The only difference I can see is that the 300i (from viewing Logitech's website) has a new glossy finish. The 300 has a black matte type finish. Everything else appears to be identical. http://www.logitech.com/en-us/remotes/universal-remotes/devices/6812
I should work fine; but anyways, you can go to logitech.com and look for the compatibility section were you can enter the model of the device and it will tell you if it is support... this remote is IR (infrared signal) as most remotes in the market, however there are some devices like the Roku and the Amazon Fire TV that uses Bluetooth remotes; is your tv uses an IR remote it should work
Not as I far as I know. Modify on flash and then trigger remotely
It can handle even 3 780's easily, maybe 4 if the rest of your build is not very power intensive.
This power supply does NOT have a 110-220 switch that I can see.
yes the model # is SXDPIPI
With a standard headphone jack, yes.
What kind of adapter? If you are asking about ac, take it to WallMart, Best Buyor one of those and have them fit one to it. Each unit has a different size
Wrong! The box it was shipped in was maybe that size. My 10 yr old granddaughter can easily hold it in her hand. Not much larger than size of a disc that you would play in it.
Yes, it has a threaded hole (toward the front of the bottom of the camera) for a tripod.
I have mine pointed out a window from my garage at my front door, and so i can see the mail (L-shaped house). It works well in the day unless the sun is directly on the camera which washes out the image and unless its night when the infrared lights bounces off the window and all you see are reflections.
iPad 2 is what I have. It works great with my 2 yr old
When I bought the remote it didn't come with the manual. It looks like the remote for your tv is a little bit different as it doesn't have the button for the 3D on it.
Hello, The FM Transmitter will broadcast digital audio from virtually any mp3 player or smartphone that has a standard headphone jack. The age of the vehicle does not matter, just plug it into the cigarette lighter port, synchronize the FM Transmitter and the vehicle's stereo to the same unused FM frequency in your area, and enjoy. Adjust the device's headphone jack volume to maximum then adjust listening volume with the vehicle stereo's knob. Please contact us at Grantwood Technology if you have any other questions, and thanks for your interest in our FM Transmitter! Regards, Grantwood Technology
Probably the best. I've played a number of horror games with these, which as any qualified gamer would know, requires a really great pair of headphones. These are no exception and perform OUTSTANDINGLY.
No idea; sorry.
I'm sorry that I can't help out with that - I remember it wasn't easy to figure it out. A friend of mine actually got it working but it took a lot of time to get it done. The manual is difficult to understand as well. If you can figure out how to sync up your remote with the console, you will get a prompt screen that will walk you through the setup process. Don't get too frustrated though - it's an excellent sound system, you'll love it.
is possibile use wireless for these system T20?
Yes, it's a 110 rated system.
Hello - we do have the later verson which is the bead blasted with logo. Thanks Dan
Yes.
I installed it on my mid2009 13" MBP and it works perfectly.
No. It does not.
No, it won't. Here's more info on why: http://www.command-tab.com/2007/03/11/upgrading-ipod-hard-drives/ Start with post 156.
No the HT2102WHV1 needs to be hard wired like a normal outlet in your wall using 14/2 or 12/2 non metalic shielded cable "romex".
This is just the plate for mounting behind your TV for a clean look. You will need a second plate for the bottom connections. Some rooms I just use the brush plate, which is what is on the right side of this box. My living room is a bigger plate with disconnects for the surround sound speakers.
Yes you can, if Internet connection is over 5G or it depends of router data transmitting.
AJB, you are correct that they are not the same, they are indeed quite different. You hit on almost all of the differences, here are the other two: - the 1005PE-MU17 has 802.11 b/g/n whereas the 1001P-PU17 has 802.11 b/g - the 1001P-PU17 has Bluetooth and the 1005PE-MU17 does not
The mouse plugs into a USB port. If you don't have one, you might be able to use an adapter for a different port. If you don't have enough usb ports, there are devices available that have one usb male plugin and four or more usb female ports.
Keep the battery installed but keep it plugged in whenever possible. That way you will (1) minimize the number of charge/discharge cycles on the battery, which is the main criteria in maximizing how long the battery will last before you need to replace it, and (2) you'll start with a full charge whenever you need to use it unplugged. Taking the battery out multiple times will also eventually wear out the battery contacts. Actually, I don't know if this particular netbook will even work with the battery out, some won't, but definitely leave the battery installed.
IDK, i bought it for an intuo5
Yes...you can...I am using it in India.
Possibly they don't allow updates. But you can buy new Micro SD cards with new maps in India.
I agree. I have the same problem with other items from Today's Deals.
I have the same set up so I tried it and no you cannot. The amp just gets real hot and the sound is terrible. Just get the black 800w Pyle hydra and only use 2 channels.
It's all a cap don't buy it!
Yes
One of the gizzies has an SD card slot, the other has a USB slot. I just tried plugging in a flash drive and the iPad said it demands too much power and so wouldn't accept it, which is really a shame! I'm assuming it is intended for USB camera cords to transfer photos to the camera, which of course has its own batteries.
Yes
This will shoot any Polaroid SX-70 type film, or any film from the Impossible Project's line for SX-70 foldable, or box type camera, (this camera you're looking at is a box type.) I think Currently from the Impossible Project the only type of film currently being made for this camera is PX-70 Color Film and PX-100 Black & White film. Hope this helps.
Taken Direct from the Alpine Website : "The MRV-M500 and MRV-M250 mono models are compatible with the RUX-KNOB remote bass knob (sold separately). Use the RUX-KNOB to conveniently adjust bass levels from your dash."
Sorry this doesn't answer your question but I had one if you are willing to answer it. I ordered the PJD5122 Projector and I'm wondering how you can hook up a bluray player to the projector if the projector doesn't have a HDMI input.
There is no filter ... you could open the lamp compartment remove lamp and visually inspect to see if any blockage of air flow, but if there were overheating there is a warning lamp on top of unit which should be blinking,red i think. Otherwise idunno...
I seriously doubt that this will fit on your camera. The A500 series are DSLR cameras (moving mirror). The A65 is an SLT (translucent mirror). The A65 is a different build.
Check the requirements for the OS you want, in this case Win 7. You will probably be Ok. The RAM in these machines are fairly easy to change out and upgrade.
I have them in the dash of my 4runner and they sound great. Not too bright at all and a huge improvement over the factory speakers.
I'm no expert, and don't know what they mean by 4 ohm topology. Generally, the 4 ohm amp would be underpowered trying to drive 2 ohm speakers. Should be ok at low to moderate volume but high volume could overheat the amp. You should ask on a car stereo forum.
150w rms 300w max. Not sure why its not in the description. Best sounding 6x9's I've ever heard, you wont be disappointed!
R u changing the head unit
I don't know for sure but I modified the opening on a Vette and they sound great. I also have a 2008 Camry with a JBL system and my guess is it has 6x9s in the rear. All you have to do is check what's already in it or check the opening if it doesn't have speakers.
They worked and sound really good at first and after about 10 hours of use they sound even better. Noticeably better, not sure why or what parts of A speaker need to be broken in but it is definitely noticeable and my son also said the same thing. About the impedance, I installed them in place of the stock infinity speakers that came from factory in my Dodge Durango R/T which are 2ohms. Hope this helps.
Yes they do, not like a subwoofer
Docking station for what? This computer over heats all the time and the left side needs to always be exposed. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.
Download "VLC" from the internet. Make sure you have the legit web page.
The Netgear Universal N300 is meant to attach one device that is not wireless, but has a Ethernet port, to LAN wireless network. You attach an Ethernet cable from your device that is not wireless to the Netgear Universal N300. The Netgeat Universal N300 will talk to your wifi router. Making your device wireless, but only to your LAN network. I hope this helps.
I haven't tested it but I don't see why it wouldn't work with a Raspberry Pi or any other host that speaks tcp/ip over ethernet - Once it's set up, it only requires an ethernet adapter, and no special drivers.
Yes, very easy. I did not even use their software. I just went straight to the switch's IP and use the web interface. Yes, good for VoIP also.
The stand is 30" tall. Depending on where you position the top monitor, you could exceed that height. I have a 24" monitor on the bottom and a 22" monitor above it. The top of the 22" monitor is 28" above the desk.
The lights on this unit are EXTREMELY bright. I have electrical tape over them to keep from being visible during low-light watching.
This switch may work but it does not pass through Dolby Digital 5.1 audio to the optical out.
It is important to note that the manufacturer of this product indicates they don't support the MAC os in the product description of this unit.
I have no experience with Ustream but if it is like twitch.tv it should because the streaming software, like open broadcast system, would just need to be able to use it.
It plugs into your computer via USB on one end, the other end plugs into the RCA ports on the device you're wanting to capture the video from. It's not really meant to plug into your TV, but to be connected to a VCR, camcorder or other such device to be able to transfer the stored video to your PC.
Have never tried, but if it like a regular cd/DVD disc it will probably work
I don't know, but it is pretty mild on BD and DVD. I would think it is OK.
This can be used on any optical CD, DVD, Blu-Ray, or HD-DVD disc
yes
Yes all the screws are included, along with all the other hardware. It was all still in the wrapping.
Yes, right now I'm using it with window 8.1. Tip will only do a left click; for right click you need to configure button on pen. (right handed)
No it does not split the video and audio from a single input. If you want input 1 split to output 1 and output 2 then both the video and audio will go to both output 1 and output 2.
Should be fine, I have a directv box, Xbox, hone theatre pc, and Pioneer elite blue ray to 3 tv's and works great. Only prob I am having right now is I have 50' hdmi cables and the 4x4 matrix doesn't have enough power to push the signal that far so sometimes I don't have sound or it's purple or red, if I turn on the tv and then the device seems to work but I'm gonna add signal boosters to fix the problem.
Yes it can however audio quality will diminish greatly. Surround sound will be lost. The best source of audio connection is SPDF which is optical audio followed by digital coaxial then RCA and lastly 3.5mm in terms of audio quality. Let me know if you have any other questions. Try to use the best type audio connection whenever possible.
These splitters of either gender are coaxial cable. Depending on your proposed application you may be better served with a two-way RF splitter that will keep your impedances balanced and reduce signal reflections. Connecting two devices of the same impedance will reduce the total impedance by half and reduce the available signal level by half. RF flows like water in a pipe.
? - broad question - may depend on your model. check your users manual. I have D3200 and this remote functions much like the shutter button on my camera - 1/2 press to focus and full for release.
Do not buy. Tried to get replaced for do not stay charged through a movie. Still have them, not working.
Hi Louis, it sounds like you might be wanting to use target disk mode. Theoretically it should work, however I have seen rare cases where adapters will stop the Macs from recognizing each other. There are several good articles on Apple's support site on how to do this including this one: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1661
It will work, I have the same computer. The problem is that this product is so thick that other nearby cables will not fit properly into your macbook pro.
just turns off automatic and within 30 seconds when connected to the electric car jack
Hi Karen. Yes it does, it has voice enable speak of street, avenues,etc.
Yes it will. When the where to menu comes up go to it. Arrow down on menu will take you to coordinates.
It does not. I have used it for walking before and it treats you like a vehicle
The 265w does have a trip log; I just received one as a gift.
As pictured, 13 inches high and 21 inches wide. Sticks out about 7 inches. I use it indoors and it works much better than traditional rabbit ears, and you don't have to plug it in.
I'm not sure I have a Nikolai D3000 and used my long lens (55-200) in the case and it fit . But it fit loose in it. It kept my camera dry and I got some nice pictures but it was difficult to use. But I will use it again. I think one of my main problems was the humidity. Kept fogging the lens.
If you plan to shoot inside photos with low light, the 4000 wins. Also, for continuous "burst" shooting of fast action--kids playing, etc. However, the SD series culminating in the 1400 is a proven, smaller, stylish Elph--better for all-around use, with unbeatable Canon images. If this was my only camera, I'd go with the SD1400 (and trust my steady hand for the low-light shots).

I noticed that too. They might have just really enhanced the compression practices of JPEG files. I wouldn't mind bigger file sizes myself if the image quality were improved....
It's 120 GB drive, it'll hold hundreds of thousands of MP3 files.
Yes, from the description provided for the charger,your model K53SV should work.
No it just a case that cover the iPad But it a good case if you travel. You still have to take you iPad out .
I bought this to use with a plug-in headset on my iPhone. It works great! Don;t see any reason why it wouldn't work on your phone.
It usually takes 2-11 business days to US after shipment.
I got the 1200mAh when I ordered it. Just wish it was really a LI-42B as advertised. They sent me two LI-40Bs. I can't really say the battery life is shorter than the Olympus battery that my camera came with though.
I'm using W8. Just use the install disk first before plugging it in. As per instructions. Otherwise it finds a driver for you that will be the wrong one.
Precharge but needs full charge
If it's the battery that came up as compatible under your model number search, it should. But better then that, search specifically by using all of the numbers on your existing battery, v and mah to make certain it's a match. The Color Of The battery Is not A concern also. Tip-They are really inexpensive and Amazon is great, so order it, and of it doesn't work just let Amazon know, I am sure they will try to help on the return, etc. Hope this helps.
It will cost $ 30-40 and would be used one as new is discontinued. If you want you send me your email and I will suggest you the links when I come across.
no but you can buy converterter pluggins off amazon with it http://www.amazon.com/Apple-Lightning-to-30-Pin-Adapter/dp/B0097BEFZE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1358399044&sr=8-1&keywords=iphone+5+converter
No, there are outdoor/weather proof cameras for that.
Well I guess every head is different, but I love these. The top has a padded area, and the foam completely surrounds and encloses my medium size ears. That is to say my ears fit right inside the foam, the foam does not sit on top of my ears. No outside noise comes in. The sound is also very good, nice and clean, good bass. I have worn these for hours at a time comfortably.
They're kinda tight on me (7 1/8 hat size) so they'd probably be perfect for you. They're also very adjustable.
Yes, it does. You have to go to setup...then time setup. then push the right direction button until sleep timer comes on.
No, it is not dual voltage. It's 110 only.
No, it only came with a USB cable. I had to use an esata cable I already had.
so far so great
I usually ship with the cord. But I will check and send it 5 you. Thanks
I do not understand the question, please elaborate.
I don't think it would fit. AmazonBasics case dimensions are: 5.2 x 1.5 x 4.1 inches Your product dimensions: 5.5 x 3.7 x 0.7 inches. So the 5.5 inches (it is the lenght of device) falls out! You need to look for a bigger case than this!
that would depend on the center of gravity
Yes they are compatible with the 2005 Toyota camry, I have a 2005 carry and bought these speakers and had them installed. And no, there are no special adaptations that you need for them to be installed. Hope that helps
Yes, it tilts quite a bit. We tilt it all the time so my parents can see little kids and big kids...maybe 45 degrees of tilt?
I'm not sure. I haven't tried it, but I can think of no reason why it wouldn't.
Yes you can connect this to the usb port and use it to skype. Mine works very well
No, I'm sure you can buy one as an accessory.
Let me say tat the company fielding Logitech problems, is fabulous. Asher and co. couldn't be more helpful. When directed to Logitech however, it has this neat way of disconnecting calls asking questions or registering complaints. The model I bought said it had a mike built in - it does not.
The Windows operating system will recognize it and allow you to use it. That does NOT overcome the fact that it is a piece of junk!
No auxillary input. This and no AM tuner are the only negatives I've found - but, the system sounds and works great (best bass of any system I've heard). Also have it linked up (via wireless) to a sony speaker in another room which can also control the ipod and FM.
I didn't install any software and it works perfectly
It takes care of both
The one I have is black. I'm not sure, but I think that was the only color offered. I'm pretty sure that it would hold a 15-inch laptop nicely.
It may fit exact so to be on the safe side, I would suggest getting one a bit bigger than 13 inch.
The 15.6" should fit it easily.
This is a lap top case. There are better choices made specifically for a camera and lenses.
Yes. The foam is a good thickness, deeper around the edge, soft, and the fit is comfortable. The ear pieces are 2.5 in. long and 2.25 in. wide, and swivel for a personal fit whether the microphone is used on the left or right. The headband is adjustable to aid in positioning the earpieces.
Yes it works perfectly
Hi its 150 watt per speakers (there is 3 distinct speaker's in the bar) :)
The RM-UC1 trigger is for Olympus models. You need the RS-80N3 found at the following link. http://www.amazon.com/NEEWER%C2%AE-Timer-Remote-RS-80N3-1DMark/dp/B005OUUFGK/ref=sr_1_13?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1406941047&sr=1-13&keywords=canon+remote+trigger+neewer I am very happy with this trigger. It allowed me to take some great Independence Day fireworks shots.
I did it with an Olympus E-500
I have OMD M-5 so I couldn
It works for my Canon T3i.
The TV requires a 12v DC power source and it comes with a 110 volt (House current) converter that converts your house power down to the 12vDC. Watts is the amount of electricity this unit draws.
When I bought mine in Dec13, it did come with a complete power adapter. It is heavy duty, BTW. I could not be happier with my purchase. However keep in mind not all sellers have the same stock so read the description carefully. Good luck.
hi, I actually have the Nikon 5100 and bought this studio strobe light kit and it does work with it. so yes it does.
It's an approximate guess, but I'd say it's about 30 lbs.
Only if it is not very windy and with a large extension or a battery pack. The stands are quite soft and will not withstand a hard gust of air.
I'm sorry, I don't know.
I can tell you that this battery is easily three to four times better than oem. In fact, the remote has not "died" since I replaced the battery. I bought it 3 years ago from CAMSDIGITAL. I guess that probably wouldn't be relevant now.
Yes it would. It acts like a regular dvd rom for laptop and pc
If it has a usb port.
For those of you tracking this thread for price, Amazon is selling it at $49.78 with free shipping. I just bought one today.
Yes. I have used mine with a bracket on occasion.
No. It records on micro SD cards. So add another $10 to $20 to the price depending on the size of the card you buy.
0 mine never worked out of the box...

I had read somewhere AMD Phenom II x3 processors are indeed x4 processors with one damaged or malfunctioning core. Thus, if the 3 remaining cores are still perfectly functional and good, AMD sells them as 'triple core' units. I am not sure if this is true or not- I just read a comment stating this on the net a few days ago. Maybe someone can verify or refute this please. Thank you.
Yep, It says it right in the description, about half-way down the page. 64 bit Windows 7 usually comes in 99% of computers that have at least 3GB DDR3 RAM, a processor speed of 2.0 GHz or more, and a minimum of 250GB of Hard Drive space.
If you use the cowboy studio triggers for your Sony flash it will work just fine. I'm a Canon user and the first time I used this beauty dish the results were amazing. I ll email you the photo if you'd like. My email address is lavarplummer@yahoo.com
No
about 5 - 6"
It is merely a powered headphone splitter. Your typical bluetooth headset or speaker does not require the extra power "boost" from a separate in-line headphone amplifier to power your headphone drivers. This would be for your upper end wired headphones.
Yes.
Nicola, I own the unit in the US and its great. I looked at the power unit attached to the ring and its 120v rated for 50/60hz. My hunch is it should work IF you use a better grade of voltage converter (120--&gt; 200v) to minimize any flicker. Cheers! Rick
no it does not it runs at the same input output as the ones built in
yes
NO it will not work. I do not know if the tip is the right diameter or length, but the voltage and probably the current are wrong. the charger cradle puts out 8.5 volts, and is charging a 7.5 volt 3 amp lithium battery, the USB port will only put out 5.5 volts .5-1.0 amp or so.
It works fine for 7d, but big and heavy. I prefer use single battery, light and can shot up to 700 shots with its original battery per charge.
According to WikiDevi (https://wikidevi.com/wiki/Edimax_EW-7811Un) this is a Realtek RTL8188CUS chipset
yes...
On the top of the camera, at the right side beside the shutter release there are three small buttons. The front one, that's the one with the lightning bolt, turns auto-flash on and off. It can also be turned on/off in the menu system.
I don't have one. No manual. My kodak zd15 broke. I would never buy another one.
I have the exact same DVR on Time Warner Cable. And it works fine. The DVR recognizes the Expander and works fine. Unless your cable company loaded special firmware in the DVR to prevent the use of expanders, you shouldn't have any trouble.
This will act as the controller. you will just have to leave the computer on and with the software running. if you plan to use the smartphone outside your house to control you will also have to open the appropriate port on your router.
Yes
Yes it will.
No. Mine were very basic. No volume control, just earbuds.
Had the SAME EXACT problem! I contacted the seller and we came to the conclusion that it was the wrong fit for my ASUS 1005HA-p. They quickly sent me out a replacement and now it works great! Good luck David
yes I use it with my kindle and it works great
They will but I will tell you that less than a month after purchase they stopped working...no sound nothing. Save you money.
As long as you have them in the upright position (on top of your head, not around your neck) they don't move. I relax in my chair and in bed with them all the time. Hope that helped/made sense!
Hello Mark, I like to use these working out or doing outdoor work. They have decent bass. I like think chunky bass, and these provided good quality. My only gripe is that headphones ( after a while ) stop working. I have tried Beats by Dre ear buds and they provide better base. The price is key factor in that equation. If you need them for travel, or around the house, either Bose or Beats (Over the Ear) are the best ones on the market. But for outdoor needs, these are the right price.
i think so i have a acer with windows 7 an it works just fine.but if it does not work you can just return it. but a friend of mine has mac but idk his o.s on it.. an he used it an he said it did just fine. i hope this helped you
we have upgraded the lighting system. the new bulb works from 20,000-50,000 hours and costs $45.
The difference appears to be a mistake. The battery is rated at 5800mAH as can be seen in one of the pictures in this gallery: http://nirslsk.imgur.com/1830t_battery
Mac OSX version 10.7.5 is what I have and it works perfectly. Phone Matias Tactile Pro for help if you need it.

Yup, works fine with Windows 8.1 and The Asus T100 and Dell Venue 8 Pro
There are no buttons on the headset you need to answer from the phone.
B. You are performing a bit for bit transfer from the source to the target USB Key. This device will not add to existing data, it overwrites everything on the target drive(s) in order to duplicate the data from the source drive. It is strongly recommended that you use the exact same make, model and size for all USB keys you want duplicated.
From my understanding, this is a bit-to-bit duplicator. I would guess, yes it would duplicate exactly. Maybe this is a question for the manufacturer.
Yes! Mine is heavier and it had worked!!
I show refresh rates can range between 50-75Hz for this monitor.
I have used it outdoors but unless the source device is also outside the range is pretty limited when the bluetooth signal has to go thru the house wall.
Your B-I-L is absolutely, positively wrong. 2D TV will work as they would normally. You will need glasses only if you watch 3D programming or chose to watch 2D using Stereoscopic 3D (an option of some 3d capable tvs). I have a Pany TC p54vt25 and 2D is one of the best I have ever seen (w/o glasses).
nope nothing like that sorry. send it back and get a new one, prices are droping all the time those days.
You can still use it, but I hear Vizio fixed that problem. My Ex has the 2013 model and so far she is loving it.
Yes we use it down there out of San Diego.
Mine is a V1917N. I went by the number off the old battery to find this one, not the number of the sweeper and its a tight fit just like the original one. Hope that helps.
No
No
The key would be to get an app for your mobile phone and make sure you point it in the right direction. I would guess it would not matter what you mount it on as long as you have pointed to the nearest tower.
The 813425 Model does NOT have the Antenna but 813426 does. I hope that helps!
yes it does have an off and on switch
I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. It was in new condition when we bought it.
aprox. 75 inches
I've installed it on my PS3 (original 60GB model) and the Seagate Momentus XT 500GB works just fine. Boot times are faster and so are read times. Installs (write times) are just as fast as any other 7200RPM drive I've used before. Before you remove your old drive, reboot it and time it just to get an idea of your boot times. Then install the new drive, boot it once then reboot it again. You'll notice a nice improvement over your old drive.
One of the Seagate forum moderators stated that it's the same drive: http://forums.seagate.com/t5/Momentus-XT-Momentus-and/What-is-the-difference-between-the-Momentus-xt-500-G-models/m-p/85644
Please be more specific in your question. Example: is the WDC WD5000BPKT-22PK4T0 ATA Device Manufacturer Western Digital Form Factor GB/2.5 compatible in a 3.5" SATA II installation. Answer: Yes. Please use adapter rails to install the device inside you computer.
I didn't need to use warranty yet. but as my friend told me shure company stands behind their product if there is defect. you need to contact them with the proof of purchase. hopefully that helps. otherwise it has been great product since the purchase.
Yes it works fine with my laptop and I have windows 7 also.
never heard of a "back" click button. Has a center wheel for up and down and of course you can right and left click the mouse. I bought 2, one for my business and one for home use as I like the size....fits my hands and is easier for problems with the wrist after long periods of use. I hope this help.
Yes- my daughter has Windows 8 on her laptop and it works well so far.
It should work fine.
It looks like it should work fine. This drive is the 2.5" form factor and your Dell has SATA drive connections.
Yes it works fine with my laptop and I have windows 7 also.
Yes- my daughter has Windows 8 on her laptop and it works well so far.
77mm
Yes it works fine with my laptop and I have windows 7 also.
It is a tiny bit noisy compared to a Canon 1.2 but in reality it's just fine. The auto focus easily detects the focus point but manual focus is still better.
Yes it has autofocus and it is good.

i am not sure what the problem is for you; my friend who purchased 6 of them had to change the channel but got them all to work.
This kit is not compatible, the one you need can be found at ASIN B008NATE5G.
I have the same laptop as you. I bought this battery because of the price and pretty good reviews. I DISAGREE. It will NOT stay connected and it died in record time. Total waste of money.
The main thing is to set up the port forwarding in your router. If you post the model number of your router, someone can probably find the manual and walk you through it.
We take the TV off and lay it on the bed while traveling; husband doesn't feel the mount is strong enough for bumps (we have a 5th wheel). And of course depends on the weight of the TV your using also....newer ones appear to be lighter weight. And depends on the size of the TV......and our TV also has a built in DVD player, which adds some weight. But we liked the swivel option and price and it's working great for us.
Power supply is 500 watts. USB 2.0 only.
If I remember correctly its a different brand
Yes
You would need some sort of volume controlled amplifier to hook the output from the converter to your speakers, such as a stereo receiver or integrated amp. The audio output from the converter is a low level signal not capable of driving speakers. Hope this helps.
yes the image is real time, and mine is currently about 15 feet from the front door and it is a great image and i can see far beyond that...to 40 or 50 feet. It is a superb product. the best on the market.
No it doesnt
You cant take shortcuts here. Every keyboard is different. Remove old keyboard and get original HP numbers off it. Can use Amazon search or Ebay, et al for replacement. Don't buy from China even if cheaper..returns are rarely honored. Save old keyboard in case you loose a specific key.
It is silver. I don't know o w how many notches because the motherboard died and I got rid of it.
No it did work
No you cannot.
Since it's not the "tough" I would say NO this won't fit the Olympus stylus 5010...
I have a Tough TG-1 and it fit. Check to see if your model is listed.
Hello, yes this is tied to the AT&T network.
Hello, this product is tied to the AT
Liz, I have a blue mouse and the original battery was obviously the same color. When I bought this item the battery was black, but works perfectly. When I get back into the office I can take a look at the specific numbers if I still have the blue one, but maybe that will be of some help until then.
Yes. As long as the card is formatted to fat32 (in most cases, SanDisk formats their microSDHC cards to fat32, including this one, from factory), it will work in the WX416. Just slide in the microSD (located under the battery, next to the sim card slot), power the phone on, and proceed as normal. I hope this helps.
as long as the tablet has the slot yes
Short answer, Yes. These switches indicate which of the speaker outputs on the back of the Amp are live. Depending on whether or not you wish to bridge, you may have both A and B selected.
You can switch to an "A" set of speakers or a"B" set. Or run 4 speakers at 1/2 the power.
No. Im sorry.
Yes it will work in the 5T.
It works with basically anything (since it acts as the cursor as well, you can use it for any instances.)
yes we have windows 8 and it does work
It comes with a standard usb ended cord. I'm not sure if it fits a mac
I do not know but it is not as dree flowing as U thought it would. I thought I would be able to draw and write on paint or the included software would be simple but the device doesn't function in a way that encourages a person to keep using it.
If it is an early to mid 2009 macbook it will not work because it has a mini DVI port However, if it is a late 2009 macbook it will work. If you are asking about the ChromeCast it will work You will need a: - HDMI port on your tv - wifi, and - a chrome browser. Pretty much you will just have to get used to using Google Chrome if you are not currently using it.

No, they are not Bluetooth, they are wired directly to the receiver/amplifier. There are two wire corrections a the back of each speaker. I would say that they work great outside and distribute the music nicely. And they have survived heavy downpours of rain. The price can't be beat. Hope this helps.
3 - two on left, one on right
The cable should be all you need.
If it has a CI-V port, which most Icom HF transceivers do, it should work fine. I use mine with an IC-706MKII, IC-756Pro, and a PW-1 with no problems. With a home made adapter cable (ICom HTs have a different pinout), I've also used it to program a W32A.
All I can tell you is that it works good with Apple TV. I took the digital optical audio out of my Apple TV unit and this unit converted it to analog (stereo). I am not using the HDMI out of the Apple TV unit for audio; I am using a HDMI to DVI cable for the video. Apple TV does send a HDMI and a digital audio out at the same time. Neither one overrides each other. I believe this answers your question. I hope this helps.
Yes, this converter will work for your soundbar, however the digital optical audio cable included is such poor quality that it may stop workig after a few week (as mine did). I bought a bluerigger cable on amazon and it works great.
Yes. It definitely work. Be aware that this type of power device is quite heavy,15 lbs maybe. If you are no going to move it everyday, it is a good choice.
I've never used the USB, but the onscreen "Inputs" menu lists the following: TV, AV1, AV2, S-Video1, S-Video2, Component1, Component2, HDMI1, HDMI2, HDMI3, VGA. The USB is not listed in the inputs menu.
Nope, but plenty of room inside for custom speakers.
Mine does NOT do that. Sounds like something is wrong with the lens.
Yes it is in full working condition.. are you looking for buying?
Yes, it has an external speaker jack. You can hook up to computer speakers, ear buds and even your TV. We have a cabin and use this to HDMI and audio cable to our TV. Great for watching movies on vacation too.
Sorry, I am not a techie person....I will try to be as precise as possible. According to the box listing...It is a AC/DC adaptor (auto switch). I measured the cord just below the in wall plug....measured 56". Like I said in my original evaluation. The cord is rather cheap as compared to other adaptor cords that I've used on my older dvd models. I always use the cord and not on battery since only use my dvd at home.
About 3-4 hours
Not sure.. I used for wd live
Yes, this switch has a lifetime warranty (not sure where the other responder saw three years). Check HP
Yeah it'll fit, It's a simple PCI card. I have two and they fit in my Dell XPS tower till I moved it, my ASUS M2N motherboard, and my GIGABYTE motherboard.
Go to http://www.tp-link.us/support/download/ and find your model number and you should get a driver.
Approximately 4ft.
Works either way
Most MP3 players, smart phones, digital cameras, and other portable devices that use a USB input to charge should work with the Conserve Valet(5-volt USB charge). You should use your device's included USB charge cord when connecting to the Conserve Valet. If your device did not come with a USB cord, check with the device's manufacturer for USB cord availability. The included Belkin USB cords are compatible with devices that have a Mini-B or Micro-B USB charge port.
I don't think so. I keep it set at 3 hours and the only way to stop it from working is to unplug it. (e.g. I only want it on for 2 hours)
Try connecting each speaker in series.
It works for my 32ld350, which is a 2010 model and probably older than a 42ld550.
It did work for ours. Yes.
I bought One of these computers for my son. It will take the card, because i've been inside the 755 and the psu sits horizontal in the case as you look at the computer standing, not laying on it's side. And that's the same direction the card will fit into the motherboard. If you are asking what size psu the computer requires, it depends on the wattage of the graphics card you are going to use. I would suggest at least a 450 watter. I believe the mother on these are the Micro ATX.
Yes, it worked well when I was riding my bike.
as i understand how it works it is only good for one antenna at a time. i wud call rca c/s line and present the same question
There are no adjustments for anything on the $100.00 piece of junk. Mine worked one time, then stopped working, charging, and videoing.
Hello Steven, yes the Opteka X-GRIP have a hot shoe mount on the top, so you won't need any adapter.
On the X-GRIP for the T4i, the shoe mount rests about 2 inches higher and about 2 1/2 to 3 inches farther in front of the original. So just kind of hold it there and see if it has any slack. If it does, then there ya go, it should work. I can go into more detail if need be.
You really only need that if you get the one with the USB connection to use it as an external burner connected to your computer.
Yes. It will hold the ring light. How ever. Try not to put anything over 5 pounds on this particular item. It has a decent build but not for everyday wear and tear.
I have ordered six of these and all of them have a built in Mic, but no camera.
It does have a 9 pin serial port and the OS I got with it is 64 bit but that varies with each unit they sell so inquire first. These are great people and eager to please.
Yes it can run Minecraft. To know if other programs will work, simply Google the name of the program with "system requirements" at the end.
The baby pin has a 1/4 20 thread on it. Most cameras have the same size on them. Technically, you could. It won't provide optimal results, but you can and you can probably get some cool effects. You can't really position the camera without at least a ball mount on it. That may give you more flexibility. Also, I wouldn't put a big rig on it. Just smaller cams.
I bought mine from Amazon, and it has a right angled 3 pin adapter.
We have not had to make 100 copies at one time, but we make 10 - 20 at a time and it does not need the master to be reloaded
It's 11 2/8" x 5 6/8" x 1/2"
It just copies what ever you have on the disk, no editing or saving data. I only use it for making copies of my kids stuff, dvd's. I have not used it for music or data yet. My understanding it should copy what ever is on the main disk. Works great for me so far, saves alot of time.
You can charge all iPods with 30 pin connector and it only has a 3.5mm jack that will play music only from other products but will not act as a usb charger. Thank you
About 6 feet
No. I keep it on 24/7
Yes, this will work with the OptiPlex 320. It will be the maximum amount of memory the board will support, and, you might need to install the BIOS update first - I did with mine. You can use the Dell support site to find and download the BIOS update. But, yes, this memory is compatible.
I don't know for sure, but it *should* work since it is a dual channel DDR2 and that's what your ASUS appears to support, to a maximum of 8 gigs.
My boyfriend had ordered this ram for me and we had a lot of issues with it so we contacted Komputerbay's customer service through their website, and they said the timing/cas latency was 7-7-7-20 @ 1.8v.
Yes - When you receive the computer you will receive the DVD install package You can re-install the operating system with windows 7 32 bit selected
Yes the machine has a valid COA
I have a different model, but it worked great for me. DSC-HX5, I've had it for several years.
no sorry, only the TA100C to can connect to an external bell. thanks
No. since each monitor has its own code and with that code the monitor pairs the camera.so one code one camera. Although you can use 2 monitor with their respective cameras as they arrive in the box.
Yes it can. You can either replace the whole unit or just the bulb. I replaced the entire unit (only because it seemed to be cheaper to buy the unit rather than just the bulb) at that moment. Prices change all the time. But if you buy the bulb do not touch it the natural oil in your skin will damage the lens once the power shines through it.
I have the same camera and it works great
It has an "N" mode which basically will shoot until the battery on the interv. Dies
Yes, if you configure it properly. Sounds like you would use the 'client' mode which makes the D-Link act as a wireless connection point for a wired Ethernet device.
it has a USB power cable in the package.It comes with 120 volt power adapter but can use 220 volt with proper adapter.
I would say instantly.
nope.
NO NO NO
Yes. It even works on glossy marble surface (theoretically it does not wok on glossy surface).
Yes. I use it with my Windows 8 laptop
Yes you can charge it in Oz. All the modern charges are international, like 110-240V. The only problem is you will need to find electrical cable compatible w/Oz standard outlets.
All I did was install the lamp replacement with the tv unplugged using the instructions that were in my owners guide. I plugged tv back in and it reprogramed itself .
I have a coolermaster HAF-X tower, and yes it does sit flush with the front of my tower. It does not interfere with any face door on my case, however I can't vouch for how it will fit on yours. I have had this controller for about 1 1/2 years now and it keeps on ticking. I do wish it controlled more than just 4 fans though. Other than that it works great for me.
You will know if the card that is in the slot now is shaped not like a rectangle, but like a rectangle with a rectangle on it. (The plastic card that is like a dust cover.) ***** ***** ******** ******** If like this, then maybe yes.
Sure thing. I use mine as a primary aiduo recorder for my Nikon D5300. I use the sound from the camera as areference track and then stnc the wave file from the Zoom to the video using Final Cut X. Works perfect with much better sound quality.
The lens looked new, did not appear to be used. The condition of its packaging was what one expect for a returned item. The Box was beat up and torn and not all information materials were included. I have used the lens for several months now and had no problems. It is a superior lens to the original lens that came with my D40.
I don't know. I use this with Nikon d7000
Basic port forwarding is all you need to get it out to the web there is no fee unless you get a static ip. Static ip would make it so you don't have to worry about re assigning the ip every time the power goes out. Yougetsignal is a helpful tool and then your port forwarding on your router hope this helps... Btw there are better cameras available for this price point. Check advidia a47's out... Allcampussecurity.com
This series of Axis cameras does support network shares. I do not have the camera configured that way, so I can't verify how well it works. My experience with the camera so far, however, is that it is very good and extremely configurable. It has been working 7x24 for months without a single glitch.
yes, i believe so.
Yes, if you have a mini display port. I bought a few of these to leave one at work, home and one in my bag. They work great!

Absoloutly !
No, neither. I had the fusible link in one fail after an (extended) accidental short, so I opened it up. It contained 7x 1/3 AAAs securely welded in series inside in a honey-comb-soap-bar type carrier. Unfortunately, the individual 1/3 AAA cells had no heat shrink over them, so it is more difficult to put the salvaged cells to good use. But, these 9V batteries are excellent, and out perform many competitive batteries that claim more capacity.
We were pleased with them initially but they have not lasted as long and some will only take one full charge.
The light was defective when's tarried. I returned it. I did not get another one.
Yes, it works on any flash system but make sure it's set up properly from flash bounce
Both speakers become warm to the touch on the tops. The power unit (left speaker) gets a little warmer but neither should be hot to the touch. You might want to try calling B&W with your issue. They have wonderful customer service and a toll free number found on their website.
I bought mine new. No problems. Very good speakers. Send your back and get new ones.
It's the right measurements, but because it's cheaply made it will likely loosen over time as mine did.
It's free and included in the newer fw if the one you have is too old
yes , I know it , many thanks
The remote does a lot, but not that. (Unless I am missing something...)
No. The volume control have no direct control with the output. Oldest player some times like Sony use to have this option. Also the the volume control is only for the headphone output. But does not work by the remote. Manual control. There is a new model also in this category the 5005. I suspect it's far better.
No
As I remember, the owners manual does not mention those file types. I would not expect them to work.
You can connect the analog outputs of the Marantz 5004 cd player directly into most headphone amps to drive appropriate cans. The headphone amp will have to have sufficient input impedance and a gain control and have sufficient output to drive the cans in question. For what it is worth, the headphone amp built into the Marantz will drive my Sennheiser HD 600s w/o problems but YMMV.
I am unable to answer your question. I have no experience with the yamaha cd s300bi. It is my belief that electronic components will not behave differently when used with other components that are supposed to be compatible. Perhaps you should just read the reviews of the two cd players and try to understand which one is simply the better one all by itself. Good luck.
Yes, a Dual Link DVI.
The system requirements say the drive is compatible with Mac OSX and Windows operating systems with no mention of Android systems.
It has 2 USB ports so it should be able to charge anything that can be charged using an USB cable. Have used it to charge phones and gps with the USB ports with no problem.
Yes, it works. It's been used in 2001 year car
They have no microphone, they are for listening only.
As I remember the box came w/ the headphones, the transmitter and 2 pairs of cheap batteries that you want to change for good ones. This KLEER technology blows bluetooth out of the water. You can order them with just the extra headphones if all are listening to the same device. Read reviews on-line to learn the product before it arrives. Mine came from amazonUK and I thought they would take forever but took no time at all. Also comes with a short start-up type manual.
Delay is noticeable. So I always have external TV speaker muted.
no.
Only when they are older than say 3rd or 4th grade, the headphones minimum size is too big for smaller kids. I suggest you buy one set and test it out with the kids before buying a whole bunch of them. Good luck!
Dear customer: Yes, this flash is compatible with the Canon Power Shot SX30 IS.
Yes we use it with a smart TV
Yes
The mitsubishi adapter will not work. The options currently are Optoma 3d-xl ,viewsonic vp3d1,vip theater. I've seen the optoma for low as $300 with 1 pair of glasses and the viewsonic for $250 the vip is more expensive.
i don't see why it wouldn't, but i'm not an expert 3D Mitsubishi guy. ;) If you have the connections and the TV says u need an external box then this might just be the one for you! If you do buy this you will need a couple HDMI cables to make sure everything gets connected and you will need some 3D glasses to view. (These are the glasses i bought, they don't carry them anymore, but a lil searching and you could find something that would work the same http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0053T9I42/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
I use these mainly when I fly. It blocks out the sounds of the flight attendants repeating the same message over and over on several flights a day! Have not used in an industrial environment.
Betty: I'm not sure what a "universal" router is but I've had this router working perfectly for about 3 months then it started acting up. I had to constantly reboot it. If you are strictly shopping price then go with a another name brand ie. Netgear. In the long run spending a few dollars more will save you headaches later. My review is listed here. I did not care for this router at all. It was made for VISIO tv sets and did not last. Good luck.
I live in a two bedroom apartment. It covers all the rooms in the apartment. Based off my past observation it got a good 100ft radius range without any medium interference.
yes
I have the FTV10. I found that by placing it about 12 to 18" from the wall and having it facing the wall it reflected off the wall and was visible from outside the house.
Try formatting the thumb drive. Try NTFS. If that doesn't work, separate the file into parts. I use WinRAR. However, there are several freeware programs that would do it.
The case slides back It's a little hard to slide
Yes
No
No, you'll have one half inch of extra cushion on each end. If you want it to look tightly filled, a half inch of foam rubber will do it.
There are no holes which can be used for mounting to a desk top. I think the two oval holes that you see in the picture are blind holes, that is, they do not go through the Docking Station.
I would not purchase. Find a clearence deal where you would still have a warranty. Mine died within 2 weeks and seller said too bad!
So so at audessy setting. You have to manually boost the treble and the bass to get a feeling of "using a relatively expensive" receiver. And if you manually increase the treble and base, it is changed for all inputs. A headache - that you have to change it back to normal for watching movies.
Yes. You can use it just as a display splitter if you don't need sound.
Peter, About 60MB/s write and 90MB/s read speed, iMac 27", i7 chip, 32gb ram, 1tb fusion drive, 2gb video card. On speed and write software, write was 59.8MB/s and write 89.7MB/s. I shot hours of video on a Canon 70d with absolutely no issues.
hi friend, appears removable storage
Yes, you should be just fine. Just dont format your usb, or else all of your data will be wiped. Your mac should be able to use the usb just as fine as windows would
There is a hole in the end where you can insert a string or a small chain to wear on your neck
It should no problem But you are basically putting your phone in a ziplock bag So use extreme caution
No
The top of the casing is wide enough to accommodate a 140 mm fan. Do note that if you are using a big CPU cooler, you may have difficulty putting in fans on top as the vertical clearance is quite small. I would prefer to skip fans on top and instead invest in a good 120 mm fan for the rear.
If u mean pci slots. The pci-e is replaceable. Pci slots are pull off but still have the notch to screw down so yes. They are re-useable
No fans cone with this case. Depending on the size of your motherboard and video card, it can mount intake and exhaust fans in the front , top , rear and bottom of the case. I transferred the components of a gaming computer into this case and was able to install four fans.
Thermaltake may be able to help you by calling customer support. If not, it's time to get creative and make something to fill the void.
I can't give you exact hours but I can tell you that my sons use their players at campouts for many hours and I have never seen them go off. I have never used mine for an extended time on battery.
Are you asking if the pistol grip can be angled in order to achieve a portrait shot? If so, the answer is yes. The head is very maneuverable.
The tripod weighs about 9 lbs. No max carrying weight is stated anywhere. I've usually use it with a spotting scope that weight 7-8 lbs and it handles that easily, it would carry much more.
Network drive has a public folder and two more folders per user (up to 4 users). You can copy directly from the old disk to the new one. Another option is to copy them to the PC and the run the new backup process. Hope this helps.
If you mean the flash drive, I don't think there is a limit. I've used an 8gb and 16gb with no problems. I assume it will read a 32gb as well.
Unfortunately the unit will not run games, and it is not wifi capable. This unit is good for loading pictures and MP3's, it's video capability is very limited. The low cost caught my attention, but in the end you get what you pay for.
Had it only for 8 months and it runs smoothly. It's my manual back up HD so I only turn it on when I needed to. It gets hot, ventilation is really poor I had to glue those little plastic things so it would get a bit of air flow.
This drive is not intended for USB connection. It connects to a router via an Ethernet port. It has a USB port for connecting a USB memory.
well.. i have windows, so iam not sure about mac.. the disk works like a lan hard drive.. so it should work with time machine. The software is useful to set the configurations, just that.
Yes it does fit my 13" MacBook pro with the dvd super drive and the power cord dock is accessible.
If the PS3 can accept Wi-Fi USB adapters then yes. But this device works with at least Windows generic drivers so unless the PS3 has a Windows OS, I have my doubts.
Yes there is an A/C jack. It uses a 3V adapter.
YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR
Yes. It works fine.
Hi, Steve. It has a 630 Joule energy rating.
I can only say this. It works with the iPod 4th Generation that still has the 30 pin charger port. I think the newer items, as well as the iPhone5s now have the Fire Wire port for charging. As a result, this unit will not work for you. This unit has the 30 pin charging dock. I have to say, if any out there still have the 30 pin port, this unit has beautiful sound.
Doesn't charge at all. Doesn't do anything. I bought a new one, works perfectly.
Yes. I have a 4. You'll have to have an adapter for the 5 only.
Sorry, I always start with Amazon.
The 9000 does not. The 8550 does.
Your radio head has to have an AUX jack.
Plz do urself a favor and don't do business with this vendor. Very likely you won't receive the item in atimely manner. 2 months for delivery.
Yes it will work, with the usual caveat regarding adequate cooling. These minis might not adequately cool a 7200RPM disk drive.
It will. We have one. The adapter that came with the purchase (it is not included with the lens itself but I purchased this as a type of package deal) is a bit tricky to secure to the camera but I don't know if that is a one-off issue or endemic to the adapter design in general.
No, the padding is flexible enough to fold up. I fold mine and keep it in my camera bag
I've never noticed it at all. Even on all-day trips with the camera slung, I don't notice that clip.
yes it worked, i used it a couple of times and i kept it in its bag in the cupboard, I was thinking to sell it if you are interested to buy one cause I am not using it anymore.
The ones I had could not.
I no longer have this storage device, sorry can't help
Yes I was able to not only charge my phone but transfer files to my phone
I use mine with an iPod touch and anything with mini and micro USB connections. The iPod is the only Apple thing I own. I find these convenient because I travel weekly and carry a pile of cords, power supplies and way too much other junk. These do save some space and weight. Most inexpensive ones I've found to date.
I don't know. I'm sorry
Yes! Everything works just as it did without the clips, but they stay on/in your ears without falling out. I got them for when I run and LOVE them! No more fussing with them the entire time.
The LEDs work very well, I have no complaints about them.
Don't remember the warranty on this turntable, I returned it right away. I don't know if I got it with a bad stylus or what, but if sounded like crap as soon as I opened it.
I'm not sure.
The short answer is "sort of". The connector built into the dock is the old 30-pin type. The 5th gen iPod Touch uses the newer "lightning" connector. You could possibly get an adapter or simply use the aux-in just for audio (although you will be giving up certain features such as charging and wake-to-ipod). As cheap as this is, you probably want to find another solution if you have one of the newer ipods or iphones.
These eartips fit on most earphones, they will fit on mils davis truimph
This speaker is roughly 4.5" x 3" x 2" (4.5" long x 3" wide by 2" tall). I believe the larger dimensions you quote refer to the packaging (retail box it comes in).
It has an AC cord. From memory, it is about 1 meter
No it will - this is plaback equipment Don W
I have not tried to connect my kindle but it does attach and play an IPod.
I don't think so. It is designed for the Parrot. It would be an expensive experiment.
No sir wireless
CPU: Single 1944-pin Socket G34 Support one Twelve/Eight-Core ready AMD Opteron 6100 Series processors,Support HT3.0 Link Technology
Same problem-different cause
We have connected two backdrops (one heavy two layer fleece backdrop to block light from behind with a separate muslin backdrop in front) on the full width crossbar with not problems. The manual for the equipment states "Notice: Once your background stand is set up please be aware that some sag in the cross bars can be a common issue based on the size and weight of the backdrop you are using." Additionally it is designed to support canvas backdrops.
It has a single output for headphones. It is not stereo so it will put out a single audio channel that goes to both earphones on the headset raising them both the same. No independent control for right/left.
Two heavy stands and four pipes that twist and interlock forming a twelve foot background holder. All you need to add is four spring clamps to hold the bacground on.
These are not 13' stands.
I'm quite certain it can, as long as you sandbag it. It's a pretty sturdy stand. I'd be careful if you extend it to full length until you test it out.
ready broadband has a few plans that you can buy, but i want mess with them there plans are not worth it try t moible thats what i useing !
Absolutely. I'm in the process of putting all audio on one so it can just be selected.
I have the 8 gb echo not the newer wifi Skye. The echo fits.
I don't know
This replaced a screen for a Acer Aspire 5749Z-4809 and fit perfect according to the # as is described; so yes this it should fit your Toshiba Satellite as well
Your buying from Amazon. Don't expect much. 30 days
It will not fit in U550
Honestly, when I purchased the screen, I took my laptop to the local community college. They teach classes in computers and one of the kids told me what I needed for my computer. I bought it and he put it in for me for a "donation" to their class. I gave the donation and then gave the kid a $20 tip ;)
I can't figure out how to attach a picture, sorry. but it looks like a new computer
just call them and they can tell you quicker than I could, very good customer service there
If the screen Panel shows the LTN number than you have the correct panel, punch the LTN number in and your choices will be available.
Reiser- you must focus manually with this adapter.
No. I have same model blue ray player and this adapter works wonderfully. Easy to hook up.
had win 7 clean install upgrade to 8 and still am getting a 2nd. works flawlessly
Works just fine with Window 8 and the Light Scribe program also functions correctly.
Compatible with Toshiba Satellite A660, A660D, A665, A665D, C675, C675D, L630, L635, L640,L645, L645D, L650, L655, L655D, L670, L670D, L675, L675D, L730, L735, L735D, L740, L745, L745D, L750, L750D, L755, L755D, L770, L770D, L775, L775D, M640, M645, P740, P740D, P745, P745D, P750, P750D, P755, P755D, P770, P770D, P775 and P775D series; Satellite Pro L630, L640, L670, L740 and L770 series portable computers
It works with my Toshiba Satellite L655.
No
I do not see the UL logo anywhere on it. It has the CE mark, as well as some sort of "Safety Mark" that I've never seen before, but not UL.
Yes!!
you need an internet connection. Log on,arrow over to the amazon icon (below netflix icon) then when prompted sign in with your ps3 password, not your amazon password. You may need to install and register your device first.
Do you have it mono or stereo?
No
Correct
Yes it does.
Yes you need to purchase your own clips
hi You can replace the current bulbs with another stronger as I did. I'm not used to video. I used it for photography. But I expect it served
Yes it is all adjustable, so easy to use. I have put heavy material on it, as long as it is balanced it does just fine!
I think you should go with 10x13 or 10x12
Not directly. You would need what is called a spigot. Manfrotto makes one with a model number 119. The spigot attaches to your tripod and the flash adapter attaches to the spigot.
No, it won't. Even though they both working on z wave, but my Vera 2 don't have security feature. I hope that helps
I used the hanging mount included. Flush mounting would be a little difficult, but just make sure the plate is installed completely or the tamper switch will be tripped.
We had that happen too. I think you must go in the tools or settings and change it to take the infor from the sd card. I believe that's how we fixed. We used in Dec1023-Jan2014 in South Africa and it worked AWESOME!!!!
It all depends of the brand of the batteries and weather cond, but on the average 4 to 6 months.
We have not had to use the warenty. Use the screen at least twice a week. Works very well. Easy to set up and take down. Very good storage case. Would have bought a larger screen
it is 4ft long, it folds up pretty compact, and the case is very high quality, especially for the price. It fits in the backseat, and trunk of a volvo S40 (for comparison)
Just one. It is a single user license that gives you an install code that will only allow one installation.
They should work if the new record player has appropriate amp output to drive your speakers. Wouldn't work for just a turntable without amplification. Chuck
Yes. You slip the photo in from the top.
No
No, once unlocked it works with all SIMs of the same size and working on the same bandwidth. Pablo Vitaver
Yes, each speaker has a switch to select left/right/mono setting.
The units automatically power down when you are not using them.
The silver 6 retail price is 750 each, this one is reduced to 599 from its 625 list price. And still the silver 6 might not make the recommended stereophile list as the RX 6 did
I know you can add an additional Audio Unlimited wireless speaker to work off one receiver. But a different type of wireless speaker I'm not sure if you can.
Yes
Not quite sure what that is, but I've been a Toshiba brand customer since 2006,and it seems that all their products switched to this cord around 2008. Price is so low on Amazon comparatively you can't really go wrong, but I'd say 98+% that this is the right cord.
Sorry, I'm not sure!
Yes it works on 4 series laptops from HP
Yes, that is what I have and it works well.
no. It is ASO7A31. I'm sorry it took so long to answer.
Yes, We ship internatinally
Dear Customer, Thank you for your asking.The ASIN B003U8EKG is the battery which fits for your laptop acer as07a41,the price of the barrery is $13.91 and shipping is $1.99,but we don't have the adapter for your laptop&#12290;Sorry for the inconvenience and have a nice day! 126
Thats the beauty of amazon, just type in charger for "Lenovo B560 Model 4330", on the search space, hit enter, and it will post a selection of options to choose from.
No
Yes
I found this one on Amazon.com & will work for you, there are a few to choose from at different prices. Just cut & paste this and put in the Amazon.com Search Box: NEW AC Adapter Power Supply for Compaq Presario M2000 V2000 V4000 V5000 by Systems Integration Business
Not sure the laptop name, bought battery last year for daughters laptop in college, she gave me info off the original battery and I looked it up for a compatible one. Still going strong! Worth the purchase.
Not sure I got it for my CQ50 and it worked perfectly
Yes, it is a zoom lens (hence '18-55mm'), of course it zooms
No, it just has handles so you carry it like a suitcase.
No you shouldn't as it records them as separate mp4 files (I think it's mp4). You tell it where to store the files so you can back them up if preferred.
I haven't tried it nor do I use Windows eight anymore. For me windows 7 is fine.
Look for or ask if you satellite box outputs clear-QAM. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QAM_(television) It's very likely that you will only get the broadcast networks. If you can plug the coax output from your cable/sat box into your TV and the TV doesn't have any special cable features like a cable card you should be able to use this to record whatever you could watch on the TV.
sorry. I use the cord on my 2011 KIA Sedona but I don't know about RIO
There is a DC power jack for a 5.6-16.8V power supply. The manufacturer e-mail is info@fvlight.com.
It should work fine, it's a plug-and-play device. But if it doesn't work, the manufacture's website should have drivers for it.
Yes, I have attempted several times to make it work, but it just won't. I have also tried with an older iPod touch and it still doesn't work. The battery keeps the ipod charged, but no go on the gps, which is why I bought it. If anyone can help me, Id appreciate it!
I wasn't using iPhone 3 but my iTouch goes in the case and attaches vie USB port to battery, etc., suspect it's the same with iP'3.
You can record only to an SD card or a zip drive. Then you take that to your computer, put in a cd and transfer from either of those to a cd.
I put it in my WiFi only one and it worked great.
LCD screen, external screen has to be purchased separately
Yes, you simply take the internal SATA hard drive and seat it into this device. Then connect this device to your PC using the provided USB cable. Assuming your PC is Windows XP or later, it should automatically detect this internal hard drive as an additional drive and you can use it just like you would an external hard drive.
If you have the correct version, probably not.
It's less than .5 of an inch. It fits in my Compaq without any issues.
I bought this for my dslr canon rebel t3 thinking it would fit, but it doesn't. Is the nikon d3200 a 55mm camera? I can't find any accurate descriptions on amazon that definitively answe what camera this lens is to be used on.
It seems fine in my rack. I guess the only thing to check is if you have all the screws in tight? There are three on each tab bolting it to the 1910, and then two on each tab bolting it to the rack. So do you have the total of 10 screws all in? If so then I guess it must just be specific to your rack perhaps.
Yes it does, but you don't need it. I checked in DHCP for whatever IP the device got and used a browser to connect.
Yes it fits great for my 2003 honda civic EX
You can buy an adapter, I do not know if it plays while charging.
The battery is rechargeable and mine came with a charger
Only works with the 58w Satellite in Rep. Dom.
GOOD DAY WORKS PERFECT
I'm not in front of it but around 14" x 9" not a bad size but the 3200 side of the light has a green tint to it if you are using it in videography.
It does NOT dim the LED's using Pulse Width Modulation or voltage dimming. There are four rocker switches on the back that selectively turn on/off sections of the lights.
This fixture is for 120v constant light bulbs - I use them with various wattage CFL Bulbs rated a 6500 k.
I don't know. As i mentioned before, you can email the customer support. They will honestly told you the answer. That was how I found out that camera fits.
I brought it into the ocean at only a shallow depth and my camera was ruined from the moisture. I would not bring it diving.
This works just fine in a psp
Can't answer that; I didn't like it on any lens on my D3100. - too much scalloping around the edges.
You can do a comparison by going to the Netgear website. Basically the 336 has 2wan/4lan, whereas the 318 has 1wan/8lan. The 336 has a significantly higher wan-to-lan throughput (250 compared to 350 mbps), more tunnels, more concurrent connections, etc. If you have a spare PC, you may want to look into smoothwall or PFSense downloads which can turn a pc into a powerful, customizable router.
Yes. Easy to implement, just use the VPN wizard and enter the local and wan IP addresses properly. Works reliably. I get 50Mbps/25Mbps throughput. I just upgraded to the Netgear SRX5308 which gives me 110Mbps/35Mpbs on cable.
I have used it with WoW and AOE with success. Takes a little time to get used to the stiff clicks, but now I find my other mouse too loose.
It is compatible and the cord is provided
Without the model number I cannot say for sure. This is a Sony proprietary cable I believe..the cyber shot series may use a mini b connector..looks like a squashed t..but not 100% sure.
I dont know, thats something you should try to ask the distributor of the product, or the manufacturer.
I don't think it will. It plays MP3 and WMA files (stored on CD or USB) and of course normal CDs. You can always convert WAV files to one of these formats.
Definitely not.
Yes, you can do both
It's compatible with almost everything that has a USB port. So the answer would be yes.
It is a noisy lens, but so is the 50mm f/1.4. When back focusing it sounds a bit like a small electric toy car (it doesn't have an ring ultrasonic motor) and when locking focus there is a small click like sound. That's perfectly normal.
I shoot Canon so I would not be the best to answer. However, I do know the lens will work on either Full Frame or APS-C Canons, I would assume the same applies to Nikon.
If you purchase at SquareTrade.com directly, you get the option to add accidental damage coverage. Check at SquareTrade.com for the exact coverage. I'm sure theft won't be covered.
It starts in the date of purchase. So it will overlap with the manufacturers' warranty.
The unit I purchased in 2011 was th Panasonic NN-H965BF Luxury Full-size 2.2 Cu.Ft 1250 Watt Microwave Oven. I have been very satisfied with this unit although the first unit shipped was defective and had to be replaced by Amazon.
I would think so you will need to send them an E Mail
I researched before buying the charger. I believe it will adjust, though Ive never tested it
yes
Yes it does and it works great
Any earphones or buds will work with this speaker.
Yes, as long as your TV has a USB port.
No
I just checked, I didn't notice until you asked the question! Maybe a hair smaller, not like my fingers are cramped, but slightly closer together than my laptop that I'm typing on now....and I have thick fingers. But then again, I didn't even notice it until now to even have it be an issue.
Yes. Lets just say the disk with the driver that comes with it is for W7 it's fine because when you activate it your computer is going to search for the most updated driver on line. Hope that helps!
That's probaby about as big as I'd go, but yes, assuming you're not trying to drown out people who are having conversations it should be plenty. To give an example, my son, 30 feet away in the living, room, often asks me to turn this down because he can't hear the TV clearly.
You have to go into your system preferences and select the logitech speaker as your audio output.
Yes, it works.
No you can not. Other model you can but for this one. You can not.
No, unfortunately this product is not compatible with MAC.
it is a 3.5mm female stereo to a 1/4 male stereo adapter...
I think it would a great way to go. I am extrermly satified with this sub. House shaking low frequency without any muddiness in the low end.
Just search google klipsch sub 12hg manual it will come up from a few different places to download.
I don't know about a warranty, but I have one that I no longer have the use for. I would be willing to let you have it for the cost of shipping.
It does not. It uses your Apple charger. It simply has a hole to feed your charger through.
I would check the Oyen Digital website as they have specific models for Xbox and PS4 which should be available through Amazon
No. It does not come with the lifter. We just have to take the handset off the phone base to use the device.
Yes it does wifi and Bluetooth, works perfect.
The default is 64 bit. However, we could install 32 bit OS per custoomer's request.
No, we do not. But you can get it from eBay (~$15).
Nope.
This is not the product that would for you then. It has a very grainy picture and if the camera is moving it loses video, and it only has a range of about 5 feet. I have two different versions of this device and neither are what I would call solid. But hey if you buy things at a cheap price, you usually get a cheap product.
The one I got is 2.5 inch round. I used it to replace an oval part. The minor adjustment was easy as there was enough room. It is 4.25 inch tall including connection tabs.
Yes
You should ground it. There is a grounding kit available from the manufacturer, but you can do it yourself. Another option is moving the antenna down. Mine is only 7 feet off the ground and it works perfectly. You may not need to have it up so high. Also consider an inline coax surge protector.
Not sure about Android but all mine have worked with iPhone no problems.
Don't know about Wii but it works great with Playstation I've had this tv for 3 yrs and it still is operating perfectly
if it has a USB then yes
The 780 will only allow 8GB DDR3 memory...Thanks
No, it comes with open office 3.3, which allows for writing and reading documents and excel. Any further questions, call 718-975-0609. Best, Jasmine
One of the best, IMO. I have a few different ultra wides and this is the one I keep pulling out for my star photography and star trails.
Yes it will fit but wide angle lenses are not what you'd use for traditional portraits. They make the sitter look fat. With a crop sensor camera, a 60mm lens, like the canon EF-S 60mm macro is a better choice. The rokinon 14mm is better for landscapes,...
The one I have has an orange strip and is F/2.8 stills version -- not the de-clicked cine version. I'm not sure what the difference is between the orange strip and the red strip version.
Yes, works great on my full frame canon and Sony bodies
I can not say it will work. the best thing to do is look at the serial number on the stick attached to you unit. It usually is a sticker and the model should be located below serial number. Go to 1800 remote and look it up. Once you have located the correct remote for your unit, look it up on amazon and order you brand new remote or a used in great or refurbished condition that would be best for you. Good luck..
Do you have the box or manual? Check with best buy electronic store for similar tv.
Yes, it will fit the PD31.
Yes, it does have a timer setting and it works quite well. Great little camera for someone that doesn't want a large complicated camera.
2 AA batteries. If you get rechargeable batteries they will charge when you connect the USB cord to your computer or plug into an outlet.
Yes it is the same remote control. Here is one, see under "specifications", it works with all the pocket video cameras: http://store.kodak.com/store/ekconsus/en_US/pd/Remote_Control/baseProductID.145068600/productID.145068700
i havent had the camera long enough to know if it is or not but i know it has a flash so from knowing that it might work ok in the dark
It's supposed to. But first you have to plug it into your computer and download the software for this. I never made it past this part, because I kept being diverted to "call the help desk for assistance." There is no longer the software for this feature. I got my refund and am sending it back this week. Plus the pictures come out blurry, FYI.
yes.
No it does not, you have to buy one separately, but they are very reasonably priced.
Hello, I think it has a very good battery life. It can go a couple days without having to charge it. I really like this camera.
It's almost 4 hours......Most of the time mine says 3:hrs and 55 min
It uses AA batteries.
I believe it does, but don't waste your money. The only "internet" that opens is "Vudu". It's not worth the cost. Get a Roku stick instead. It's cheaper and has a thousand more things to choose from than this.
Never got it to work. Had to buy an xbox instead.
Your hard drive should have already come with a set of cables (either HD/Firewire/USB). This case does not come with any cables and the picture provided by Amazon only shows how your cables can fit into the case.
The 445 is mainly an amplifier just setup to pair with Alpine equipment. The 445U is a Universal unit that can be installed with any factory or other make of head unit.
Yes.
yes, you can. However, you have to be in a very quiet spot because this microphone picks up a lot of background noise. It also gives your voice a little bit of an echo... however, you can adjust the settings within the software that come with it to make it sound better for your particular needs.
I've used it with windows 7 and 8 via Dragon and office and it works good
I don't own a Mac, but I don't see why it wouldn't. This set has a USB connection, and the determining factor is what your Mac Air uses for the software interface and that it will properly recognize the set by the interface software. I don't know what type of software interface the Mac Air has for headset setup, so I apologize for not being more help. I did find this forum which discusses this issue a bit: https://discussions.apple.com/message/23610983#24471966 If this does not help, I would advise contacting Apple direct. I hope this works out for you!
Yes
No but it is incredibly easy to do. You can find youtube videos or check out this website http://www.laptopscreen.com/ they have videos to help. The screens were cheaper on amazon though
20 inches plus an included 43 inch extension.
I'm using the device on Windows 7, it does a great job of controlling volume.
If you can't increase the volume for listening, you may want to purchase a small external speaker. They are inexpensive and pretty good. I bought one from Radio Shack for about $8.
I would limit to 2 as you are essentially daisy chaining off your source router. They will tell you can't or shouldn't but I have multiple appletv, roku, sonos, etc and these ports work great.
Probably. Mine is a Eee PC 1001PXD EU17 BK and this battery worked fine with it. I searched for a while and couldn't find references to a BBK304, but seaching for EU17 BK found all kinds of matchs, even ones for sale here on Amazon.
It does for me. THat's the phone my son has and this was a gift for him. He loves it because it's so much smaller than my daughter's iHome.
My problem was that the unit as a whole quit working.
no these are used for a computer that does not have Bluetooth to have it
they did not work for me either of them.
I have the same problem. Please help
This webcam is a plug and play function. You would just turn on your network program such as skype, MSN etc to activate it.
I didn't see any mention of that company you mentioned anywhere on the router, but as you can clearly see on the title of the router "Cisco Linksys Refurbished E1000" . So one can assume that it is a refurbish by Linksys by that clue.
Basically yes. There are a few requirements, there has to be a wireless hotspot nearby, if it is protected you must know the password.
Very nice and useable.
Not sure sorry
It depends. If you have a female micro usb on the camera and a female stereo mini-plug on the intervalometer (or vice-versa), then the answer is yes (note: you will need a cable with a male mini-plug on both ends to make the connection between this dongle and your device). Otherwise, the answer is no.
Will fit any Android cell phone needing a micro usb charger whether motorola samsung htc. Etc
It fits, but the battery that I received did not work with my laptop. I ended up buying a new laptop since I couldn't figure out whether the issue was with the battery or whether my laptop was done for.
Yes it will. It works great
Usps or ups
Yes
I'm a little over 5 feet. The cord is as long as I am with the adapter hanging over. My main use with adapter has been at night to cool off to get to sleep. it is long enough for me to place on or near pillow for that quick cool down.
If you really wanted to pack it in, I suppose it could fit - without the power brick. But in general, the answer is No. This one houses only the mac.
It is a pretty slim case so I would say if your laptop fits with a bit of room to spare (an inch or 2) then it should fit in with the case as well... But if it's already a tight sqeeze or perfect fit then it won't fit with the case.
The top of each stand has a standard stud with male threaded post (1/4 inch I think). The cross bar has a hole in each end that fits over the stud on the stands. The cross bar is tightened with hand-turned nuts to keep it from easily coming off. The stands readily can double as light stands if you don't need them to hold a backdrop.
Easy. This is a heavy duty stand. I love it and I use a GIGANTIC back drop on it. Also the tripods are very stable.
No. But they have springs.
The power cord or charger will not fit in to the case
I use it with an 11.6" Acer and all it fits is the laptop itself. There is no room for the cord/charger or anything else.
I use it with an 11.6" Acer and all it fits is the laptop itself. There is no room for the cord/charger or anything else.
This should be fine. The ipad airs dimensions are height 9.4 inches and width 6.6 inches so you will definitely have room. But this extra space could be utilized for ipods, or even a future laptop purchase. Considering the price and investment, the extra space is worth the price. Hope this helps.
good
The top of the front? The door should be on the upper portion of the front face.
Not sure of the size of the Kraken. I have the Corsair H100i with 120 mm fan. Fits easy with room to spare.
2 1/2" deep 3" wide 6" long
Measuring on the out side of the extended out poles, 38inches. Thats outside tip to tip.
The center pole or the opening of the stand itself? Center pole is 1&1/2 inches
I think that will work, but why not just by a 24 volt out transformer?
yeah that is the only thing holding me from the camera. any reliable rumours on the release date of the new one? I can only wait about 2 months time though
Hello LF, thank you for the inquiry. The A20 BT headset uses Hands-free profile, Bluetooth 2.1
I use them in my own home studio for video recording. So I can't see any resson why not.
(L - 85cm / 33.5") - (W - 18cm / 7") - (D - 18cm / 7") - this is complete with products inside
The sata is only if you want to use its external drive capability. It won't affect the usb or memory card slots.
This fan is not a cpu fan. Its not like a cpu heatsink but it is great for keeping your computer cool.
Yes and yes.
I purchased this device to have fax capability for my laptop which is running Win7-64. The laptop recognized the fax modem and configured automatically. I sent one test fax using Windows scan & fax and everything worked fine. I rarely have a need for fax but wanted a small USB modem just in case I needed to fax or use dial-up. Otherwise it seems to setup and work fine for my needs.
The receiver that plugs into the USB port on the computer is included with the remote.
No
Short answer: Yes. Fuller answer: A simple Google search of "Garmin Nuvi 1100 map update" gives details.
Yes, a usb cable to charge, and a holder to pu it on the wind shield.
If your radio antenna is removable it should screw off, I'm reasonably certain most antenna's are universal and a standard size until you get into high end radios. Even then is possible they are the same, I bought this product for a Exceed Volition helicopter and it fits perfect.
Hey, no bro.... It can be mounted but u will get heavy vignetting to the point it actually looks like looking out of a barrel... It was designed for the 16mm prime
No, it is designed to attach to the prime wide angle lens and does not go on the zoom lenses.
on 1920 x 1080 30fps no more than 45 mins, if the battery is brand new, 640x480 maybe one hour and 10 mins, never store the cam full charge this damage the battery ,you can get a extra battery on amazon for $8.99 good luck!
If i am not wrong the camera does not have a Mic input, only the built in. You shoul be able to capture some natural sound, if you need better audio quality i would recomend another camera.

About an hour and a half
Yes, you can transfer video easily by utilizing DVD making software like: Windows DVD Maker, Roxio Creator and many dvd burning software.
You can't use a traditional tripod, but might be able to use one that grips like a phone windshield mount if you can find one small enough.
About an hour and a half
radio shack
Depend on what you want. Panasonic has 4X zoom and an embedded light for obscure conditions. However, this is no water proof. Kodak's zoom is almost half of the Panasonic, no embedded light but it is Water Proof which is the main advantage.
Yes you can this unit is equipped av in /out.
very low and it is very difficult to recognize people thru the screen.
40 inches
I couldn't get it to work for anything, so don't bet on it.
yes, but it is minimal and easy.
The spike and rubber piece cannot be removed from the bottom of the monopod.
I'm having the same problems... googling the nets for solution and came across your post first.
How about a code to program a comcast remote?
Check the USB if it is not USB 3 Renesas chipset you can see it in attachment video the Blackmagic Design Intensity Shuttle for USB 3.0 does not work properly
Yes, as long as the input signal is supported by your monitor. The delay on the passthrough is very hard to notice.
First, you should be very careful that the computer you are attaching this to has a particular motherboard. If not, nothing will work. If so, then maybe the specification they gave you will work. I did not find out until after I purchased. I was solving a problem for a customer that grew into a bigger problem because of this unit. They sent my money back. This product needs to be pulled from amazon completely.
The product descriptions are, sadly, often inaccurate. I would also like it to be confirmed by someone who has seen the packaging for this item or talked to the company.
No...it is the size of a shoe box
yes
no. it has pages that you can insert photos into them but no space to put memos. you would have to put memos next to or around the photos before you insert them into the album.
I have one that is holding a plasma 65" for safety. I gave a little tug to make sure that it wouldn't tip and holds fine. I don't think you'll have an issue with a 70". Just follow the simple directions and you'll be good to go.
well, i have the 32oz gatorade bottle and that fits fine, just alittle tall so sometime it slips out. I dont think the bag will fit those wide Nalgene bottles though.
I have a Toshiba passport that is 4.75 X 3 X .5, and it sits inside the case with no issues, inside dimensions are 5.25 X 3.5 X .75. Very good case and like the inside net to hold the cable as well.
No. It's water resistant. As it states in its "Materials" section of the product description, "[...] Exterior materials are water-resistant. [...]"
The back pack is large enough to fit a MacBook pro "15 perfectly. To this day this back pack take the weight and has yet to tear or so any signs of doing so. Amazing back pack.
A coffe mug that is tall and skinny yes, and a water bottle with defenitly fit.
I guess it could be a file system incompatibility. Is the file system in your Sandisk FAT32 and in the Patriot any other (like NTFS)? If yes, format you Patriot in FAT32 and it will probably work.
Yes. You might have to format the drive though. It should be fast enough to run Linux without any issues.
Yes. I use them with my Razr Maxx.
You need the headphone adapter that comes with the case
The handset is wired to the phone and the phone needs to be wired to the network/internet. Hope this helps.
Yes
No
Your 50 f/1.8 will still open to f/1.8, but due to crop factor will function as a 75mm on the NEX camera. Note that the crop factor also affects the *appearance* of DOF, so f/1.8 on a APS-C camera will look more like ~f/2.5 (-ish) on a full-frame camera.
I record 30 days at a time.
Recently I added a drive with data to mine. and I was able to restore the data, Back it up and format the drive for a new use. it worked well. I was using windows 7, I am not sure of the format I believe it was NTFS.
Mine does not look foggy well with night vision is not as clear as with the sun out, you must like in a well lite area to get a picture at night without night vision. No zoom during playback.
As far as I know, there's no focus adjust. It's auto-focus, and everything in the FOV appears in focus all the time. I've never seen anything be out of focus.
This camera system runs on 110v only and cannot be plugged into a surge suppressor or extension cord. It must be plugged directly into a 110v outlet. The system CAN be set up to only begin recording upon motion sensing. There are a lot of options.
yes, it completely independent of your router, so no compatibility issues.
This item isn't a hub it is a switch and is used differently. Example... You run a long cat5 cable to your media room. You now have 1 connection, but you have 4 items to connect to the internet. So, you buy this switch. connect it to your 1 cable run and now you have 4 ports that can all use that 1 run of cat5.
Both are very similar. The DGS-105 uses slightly less energy, but the DGS-1005G has troubleshooting of the connection cables built in. it'll tell you if there's a bad cable. The DGS-105 has a more rugged case, but the DGS-1005G is more attractive. Very similar specs. and either one should work fine for general use. Both are switches which expand the number of devices which you can hook up to your internet, after the cable modem. Mine (DGS1005G) is used for the TV in the family room to provide the internet to more of the devices I have.
yes it does, teh adaptor is double voltage 110-220V
Yes however it alldepenton Yes. Qualty of signal may not be the best. If moving.
Yes it does, my company has about 12 of these and they work great for the most part however there is one thing to watch out for. If you are wanting to view your camera's remotely sometimes the DVR will randomly lose it's network configuration. We have 2 8channels that do it about once a week. But so far the 16 channels have been great.
Yes. You can separate the two components. It's much easier that way. It's a great mount. Easy to install and then maneuver the tv. I have it mounted on the ceiling over my basement bar.
It is a reflector, I hardly use mine. I usually take it off and use an umbrella or a softbox with the light. The reflector concentrates the light to a more fixed point instead of the light going everywhere. This will create a harsh light.
This unit will NOT convert Dolby
That depends on the tripod that you place it on. I use a Canon 5D3 with a battery grip and 70-200mm f/2.8L lens. I've not had any problems, but that's still not as heavy as your rig. Personally, I'd say that you are okay as long as your tripod can handle the weight.
It sure does. I pretty much never take it off my camera even when I haven't used my tripod in days.
Yes it is.
I'm 6' 2" and the viewfinder on my D7100 is right at eye level when fully extended. I need to stand on my tiptoes to be able to read the control panel on the top of the camera when it is fully extended.
I do not have a weight and I do not know exactly. It is not heavy.
Yes. That is what I have.
Yes as long as you use the appropriate adapter.
Pretty good
Sorry, but no. The speakers get their power from a powered USB port on the connected device. I don't believe that the ASUS Nexus tablet has a powered USB port. There's two cables that come from the speakers - one is a USB connector that plugs into the powered USB port of the device for power and the other is an audio connector that plugs into the headphone jack of the device.
I don't know. I have a 4 door
I wouldn't buy this unless your prepared to modify it and re enforce it also. It vibrated apart and I had to put it back together again with better and more hardware. It works now but it needed a lot of re enforcement. And the more air the better or things will overheat and shut down and take a break.
You may purchase Breeze Pro through Amazon or your authorized ARCTIC local resellers.
I purchased this scale over 1 year ago and it is still very accurate. Most scales are not very accurate over 200 pounds. I weigh about 350 pounds and it still works great for me.
I had a similar issue, contact Apple. They helped me out.
Yes it's
Yes.. If you currently have NP-FV 30 or 50, this will also work.
I am using this battery with hdr-pj760. Works fine no issues.
Yes you can use it but its not worth it
I wanted it for my phone to store pics and music but I lost my phone with it. So
I haven't seen any diminished quality from using this. I use it to go from my receiver to my tivo. Not had any issues.
It probably has something to do with the memory modules that were used. I also tried the Crucial 2GB you are referring to and it failed in a QNAP TS-859 Pro+ unit as well.
I do not know how long he warranty is, however I purchased two of these about 3 months ago. Both are used constantly for charging iPhones, iPads, ispeakers, etc...we have been traveling the last 6 weeks out of the country where we needed power adapters in order to plug them in and still no problems, they are still working perfectly.
Not surprised, the one I had started dropping the network connection completely and had to be restarted to get it back. After hours on the phone with dlink, they blamed my ISP. I called my ISP and blamed dlink, through all this I made several attempts to bridge this router with my modem/router, to no avail. I gave up and got switch and used my ISP's wireless connection via the modem/router.
We used it at the gym for quite some time (had a portable charger), and it still works if it's plugged in for anything else.
I'm unsure what type of vertical group you're referencing, but if you're talking about an extended battery grip you are unable to use both at the same time. The power adaptor sides into the place where battery goes and you need the battery door to be shut.
It came from a macbook pro. It should work but I can't guarantee it. You could return it if it doesn't work.
Yes, it will work as per the Lenovo X220 data sheet - shows Memory: Up to 8GB DDR3 - 1333MHz (2 DIMM Slots). FYI - http://shop.lenovo.com/us/ww/pdf/x220_datasheet.pdf
I very much doubt that the notch is on the wrong side;-) Most probably the memory module is not for your socket. And installing such things in the wrong way can lead to short circuits. Better read your motherboard spec what memory it supports.
Yes, this module would be compatible with your DV6-3225DX
No there isn't a plug for a headphone, sorry. I really do love it otherwise. But for a young person in their rooms they might want headphones, or at least the parents might!!
Yes
Yes, the dimmer control has 7 brightness levels, one of which is completely off - no display whatsoever and no button backlight. I use the lowest brightness visible display/button backlight with no problems. Here is the manual: http://www.sangean.com/support/download_content.asp?did=74
On the display, "PM" shows but "AM" does not. So by default, if neither PM nor AM is displayed, the time is AM.
It is a plug in.
No. Alarm will sound until code is entered. Alarm will initiate approximately 30 seconds after door is initially opened.
I'm not sure if it will because of the different models (tablet) but here's a list that may help you try to figure out if it's compatible or not. Sorry I'm still using my older CTH-460 model. I think it may still work though as long as it's in the Bamboo line. http://forum.wacom.eu/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=8037
I have not compared the sangean wr fi with lower priced sangean radios but I did compare with a I home unit costing over 100.00 and my sangean hi-fi radio is much better than the I home. the sangean is very close to Bose table radio. I hope this helps Ray Hostetler
The sound quality is poor, especially with loud outside noise like a motorcycle, mower, etc. I would go for something a little better.
I believe you have the option to set the time for different days of the week. I have not done this though as I do not use the alarm.
I don't know. We returned it almost right away for a long list of reasons.
I don't remember. We returned it almost right away. Terrible directions. Way to difficult to figure out. I don't need something clumsy at 5:30 AM. Also, the time so very faint, too hard to see.
Yes. I use a different brand for my left and rights. It sounds great!!!
Mohamed I weighed mine on a bathroom scale and they were 10.2 lbs each. They are a good quality speaker with rich sound for their small size. I've had mine about 1 year.- Stan
These speakers once broken in sound great
Yes.
Don't know about Panni releasing editing software, but there is a good freeware program available right now for 3D video editing: http://stereo.jpn.org/eng/stvmkr/ BTW -- Panasonic is a little late in marketing the first 3D consumer camcorder. Toshiba had one in the early 1990's. http://pubpages.unh.edu/~wfc/Toshiba/index.html If you want to get your feet wet shooting HD 3D video for a lot less money, check out the FujiFilm W3 camera. http://www.fujifilm.com/products/3d/camera/finepix_real3dw3/
For best result.transfer the file to your pc to play the recorded 3d
That would depend upon your TV. Your TV must have 3D capabilities. Different TV's have different glasses.
64GB is the biggest for that camera
Yes
I think it is. It said Sony on the package. It's a good battery.
Returned mine sorry I can't help
Hello Lawrence, I don't have the camera available to measure at this time, but an estimate guess after hanging one would be about 5 to 6 inches long.
Yes, it works with my 4S
I can't say that I think they are a ton better than others, but the unique design helps them stay in my ear better than any other in-ear headphone. I normally listen to TuneIn Radio so I'm not sure if the streaming quality is good enough to notice a big difference. I would probably buy them again.
Yes it does. It also has an "Aux In" jack.
It's on the top of the unit - far right upper corner - says "auto off"
I don't know if it will work with an apple, but if you go to the Magellan webpage it might tell you. If not, the website has a help area where you can either call them or ask a question on line. By the way, I am a professional archaeologist and I use mine with my work and I am quite happy with it.
Yes it does
I just measured it, the pole is 1 1/4" in diameter, not 2".
I think the ad says it only fits D-SLR cameras. I am using mine on a Canon 60 D.
Yes, because it has a firm grip to catch screen on its internal aluminium frame. Only problem is if it's a windy day, I recommend to put some sandbags on tripod. regards
If your Minolta lens fits a Sony A mount camera, the end cap should fit. I have several Minolta lens that fit my Sony A mount and the end caps fit.
The product description as of 5/8/13 is "Pro Grade Material". I called Fotodiox and they indicated it is a "nylon blend". Based on the construction if you stand it against a window then light will likely pass through.
Hi Joseph. You'll be pleased to learn that the answer is yes. I have a very similar Minolta 58mm lens and it's a brilliant combination with my NEX5. One thing you should be aware of, though, is that the focusing point of infinity will change. This is unlikely to be an issue with a short focal length like 58mm, but it's worth noting. Hope this helps. :-)
Not 100%, but as long as the camera has the port for it and Bulb mode, you should be set.
There were two boxes. One that perfectly fitted the equipment and the other overly big with all the protection things.
used them in a studio apartment, stands arent much wider than the entire lightbox itself, maybe 3 ft.
Yes
It should just twist off. In my experience, aftermarket caps are either too tight or too loose.
It's the small background light, not a backdrop support.
Are you asking if it will do video? Unfortunately it doesn't work like that. The remote only activates the shutter button, and if I remember correctly the video mode is activated by the center button of the jog wheel. Otherwise, you *can* set it to take 2 second exposures every minute, but that's probably not what you're looking for.
I recently bought this remote timer and it does works like a charm with my epl5
i don't know the type of ports on the omd em1. typically olympus wants you to use your smart phone and the olympus OI app to control the em1
my understanding is that this is just for apple products with the 30 pin connector. Are there any adapters that would work? I don't know.
Look at your current battery. If the model number starts with NP-FV, it should work. That is the battery type. The number after that simply represents the battery capacity and size. For instance, 950 is bigger than the 550.
If you have a canon 18-55mm lens, this one attaches to the top of it.
As far as I know it is like an adapter, for the 18-55
I don't use Garage Band but was able to monitor while recording using other software.
There is a switch on the side of the device that allows you to change from mic to line-in
I'm sorry but I really don't know as I use my Explorist in the Mts.for mining purposes Regards, Ron
No
I use this on a D200. I can't see any reason why it wouldn't work on a D600. I also want to add that for the money it's been a investment investment. If you have any other questions don't hesitate to ask. Sincerely, Tom Nolan
Hi, I have a Nikon d3100 and this thing was so hard to have it work. besides that you have to manually set the F number before you take the lens off to attach the tube. it was a hustle and had poor quality. I ended up getting one that was around 50 bucks,my advice? save up and get the one that can auto focus
I have a 5D Mark II and it fits very well with room to spare. The velcro arms circle around it to make it as tight as I need if I have a small lens on the camera. It fits well with all my lenses. I love this sleeve because it's easy to take the camera in any bag and I feel like it is somewhat protected.
You can can closer, but autofocus will not work. None of the lens-changing controls work when this "dumb" tube of metal is attached: no aperture change, no autofocus, no image stabilization engagement. To get these to work, you must buy a "smart" extension tube: the one's from Canon that cost twenty times more.
The top case IS the keyboard. It includes the keyboard, the white around the keyboard, and also the touchpad. It would be difficult to take it apart and separate those.
The MacBook I installed it on was a Mid 2007. I do not know if it will work on a Mid 2010.
I would need more information about the MacBook other than it is a 2008 MacBook 4.1. However, by going to http://www.powerbookmedic.com you should find out which keyboard is required.
You Sure can as long as you have a USB port
yes it is,but beware I had to return this unit twice,to many proublems with this company as they are in Canada,I switched to Lorex security system
4
WIDE ALSO CAN ZOOM.
The actual size of the camera lens itself is 2 centimeters by 2 centimeters
Actually, I have a laptop that reads an SD card. It is easy to just plug the card into my laptop and it plays the video. I have mine set to record when movement is detected. That setting is under the plate on the back. It overwrites the oldest recording when it needs to have more space. I just watch it when I suspect foul play. It worked right out of the box for me. Clay
I don't believe so. I guess if you could find out the broadcast code and frequency used, maybe. I highly suspect that their systems are proprietary in nature and would prevent other camera's from being used. I know that's what I would do. And really, for the price of additional camera's, it's worth it to just buy theirs.
There is a way to write over the card at the beginning when it becomes full. Occasionally I need to wipe the card clean and start over. I am using two 16 GB cards and alternating them between the defender monitor and the main PC to save the important files,
It works perfectly with that latest iPhone's so I would say yes. Additionally, I have not found any device that it does not work with. I used it on: iPad, Amazon Fire, Samsung Galaxy S4 phone, Mac Book and Samsung TV. The only one with an issue was the TV as I could not control the volume.
We currently only have matte finish instock
Yes, the speaker and wires are removable...
There is no screen.
It depends on the sata port you are trying to use with the adapter. Mine did not work with an adapter (I have an old motherboard, apparently the on-board sata ports didn't like being used with an adapter), I got an esata card and it has been working great for nearly 2 years.
The AC3 ZoneController works only on top of a MiniTT1 or a FlexTT5. (http://www.pocketwizard.com/products/transmitter_receiver/ac3%20zonecontroller/)
I am not sure. I used EZCAP.TV to transfer 8mm tape to computer and it worked great. Once in digital format I can watch on an ipad, PC or TV.
For wireless camera you don't need wire but need good network connection. I don't know how your wired camera now connect to view. For the wireless you can download free Apple or Android application to view.
There is two in the box.
Membrane. Dont' expect any luxury features on this keyboard. More importantly, even though this keyboard comes up as a result for a search under "wireless keyboard," AND all pictures of it omit wires, AND there is absolutely zero mention of it being a wired keyboard in the description, it is in fact a wired keyboard. The "USB interface" is about all it says about how it attaches to your computer, and that's ambiguous at best. I repeat, this is NOT a wireless keyboard.
Turbine Pros are way much better in sound quality. But these are decent
Presumably it will. I bought the lens for my Canon 7D. But because of your question, just now I tried it out using my old 30D body. It works; but on a dark, overcast day (as it is here in CT today), the 30D has severe limitations compared to the 7D. With the 30D, I had to shoot at low speeds; but with the 7D, I'm sure I could get acceptable exposures shooting much faster.
Yes. On a DX camera you will get about a 1.5x crop factor making it similar to a 105-450mm lends but it will work just fine. You gain some equivalent magnification but lose some sharpness.
I like to photograph nature, especially birds. It has worked great so far.
Yes it should be perfect for picking up signals from farther away. I used to use mine at the RV Park. It is basically just an amplified wireless antenna receiver. It comes with a driver CD, which I just checked and it has a MAC OS 10 driver.
yes , you need one alpa adaptor per device. i'm real happy with my unit, it works great. i can pick up wifi verry far away!!
Yes it does... But if the lock which holds the outer cover is broken, you may need the silver frame with this case.
If by "paired" you are referring to Bluetooth, I've used it paired with an iPhone5 and also an iPhone6. If you meant via the USB connection, I use it daily with both Skype and GoToMeeting, and finally, if you mean via the traditional telephone headset jack, it would work with any phone that has a headset jack - my phone happens to be a Shoretel VOIP deskset phone. Works well to switch as needed via those 3 connections.
Mine came with RJ9. It may have come with the usb connection as well. However, I did not get the range that I was hoping for with this product. I ended up using the GN9125 duo boom instead. It had better range.
The zipper opens up completely on one short side (top) and down about 1/3 of the way on the two adjacent long sides. In the pictures on the description page, the zippers are on the left side very close to where the zipper stop is.
I don't think so. It doesn't fit my laptop. It's pretty small case
Oddly, I did not find it in the documentation that came with the ue500vi product. However, http://support.logitech.com/en_us/product/500vi#warranty suggests they have a 2 year limited hardware warranty.
This is it. You can print 1, 2, 4, or 8 photos on 1 4X6.
No it brings separate ink but it doesn't look like the ones we use for the printers
it is not possible to just remove the head and put it on a tripod because of the way it attaches to the monopod. It's essentially a giant screw on system that is removable and interchangable between manfrotto monopods.
Yes sir. Yet it's not design for that. If you have the lens tilted it's really hard to balance it. 1 more thing... This is one awesome item.
I like the 561 better because of the legs at the bottom allowing you to balance the monopod without holding it. Also the fluid head is amazing! If I were to shoot a soccer game in windy conditions, id look at a tripod since its a little more stable than a monopod.
The mouse is very light, but sturdy as well. Just be careful not to pull the USB thing out too much, mine stopped working because of it
Noticeable, but not to the point where it gets annoying. At least in my opinion.
Not Sure. It was a direct replacement for my AO532h. Try contacting Acer.
With a USB cable(didn't came along).
I've only programmed one code at a time. Sorry
From the outside is what they mean. Goodluck
No
Sorry, don't know. We got it to use with a PC.
No, or win 8. I returned mine.
No it won't this processor uses a different socket
No
No , this is specifically for only a pc with a headphone and microphone jack .
This drive is not formatted. It is a standard drive and has worked great on my MacBook Pro, but who knew about formatting? Genius Bar did that for me, no charge.
It should as long as the USB port supplies enough power for the drive to operate.
try plugging it back to where it worked well. that's for checking if your hard drive is still good.
I believe so...it takes an SD card. Im not running one that big but don't see why you couldn't.
I believe so. I would not leave them exposed. Mounted under differ or eve will cover.
4 ohm
That tweeter much be a bit much because its rated 500rms where as the crossovers can only handle 150rms. The crossovers are really made for a good components style hook up, that tweeter looks like more competition style hook up and may require its own amp to push them to there full potential. :-)
There are no "points" for the frequency crossover. I concluded from the information available that the crossover was a linear function between 20 - 20K hertz. My installation drives a set of Sony tweeters with an obvious separation of the higher frequencies but I have no equipment to measure the frequency response.
So long as you have a wooden stud that the device can be screwed into. Nothing is absolutely unbreakable but it is very difficult to remove a TV attached to this device without ruining the set in the process.
No effect at all. Think of it as a cat5, cat6, or cat6e cable.
Yes, you won't have any autofocus or powered f-stop, this is for manual lenses only.
No it wont, Canon changed the MarkII just enough so that you have to buy a new one. the new ones have not came out yet. Send Neewer an emsail and see if they have any release date
Not 100% but I doubt it, I am fairly certain the DVI out won't support 4k resolution. The Apple specific (mini display port, or whatever it's called) will also most likely not support 4k out. This card was "New" nearly 3-4 years ago in terms of GPU power and chip architecture, so NO I doubt that it will.
no idea. It is working more than 6 months so far I think
Could you clarify your question? This item isn't made by Viewsonic; it's made by AU Optronics. It's not a glass replacement - it replaces the screen in certain netbooks. If your netbook screen is broken, you can remove it and look at the back to find the specifications. I'm not sure what a G-TAB is.
For splitting DirecTV Program, the answer is no. For providing Genie with DTV Program and the TV for of the air programming, the answer is yes. The idea of SWM is to stack multiple tuners set-up and share among other DTV box, either DVR or client. Also Samsung 6000 Series and above can act as client; this TV can get DTV programming without another box.
any 30 pin apple device will work
Yes, works on battery. Plays a long, long time on batteries but doesn't charge your ipod, iphone unless it's plugged in. I've had mine for years and love it. Also, unless they've changed it, it's is 30-pin. Can also plug in other devices via 3.5mm plug. Good sound with bass boost.
I have an iPod 4th generation and it works with this device.
it is designed for whole house not individual breakers
the main panel should be enough
NEC states only one wire per terminal, but the unit would work fine with 2, if you do not do it to code. It would have to be a very secure connection to avoid resistance heating. Try to do it to code if possible, extra breakers are only $15. Replacing some 15 and 20 amp single pole breakers with Tandem breakers in other slots would allow space to insert the extra breaker at the top of the lineup and keep it to code.
Yes this works perfect for your phone and TV
YES but again need install kits such as output converter and wiring harness or buy all new speakers.
What's in the Box W3 3D digital camera Battery (NP-50) Battery charger (BC-45W) Hand strap USB cable CD-ROM Owner's manual. I had to update the firmware to get the video to record for more than 20 sec.
maybe its the memory card or something do you have a fast one? check to make sure.
Yes, if you have the frequencies through somewhere such as radio reference, this scanner will receive them. It is a digital scanner and I use it to listen to my local police and county who recently transitioned from analog to digital. It has a learning curve but if you use programming software it is pretty easy.
the base is wired tp tje sound source, but the headphone has no wires so the answer is no
I'm very sorry to hear you didn't receive a base Station. Amazon or Sennheiser should be able to get that cleared up for you. I too would like to find a place to buy an additional base station but haven't been able to locate anywhere. Might have to contact Sennheiser directly. Wish I could be more help. I really love the 160 headsets and they sound amazing.
Both work at the same time. My wife and I use them daily when we watch TV.
No this won't work. As I recall, Petri lenses were one of two types. M42 screw type (like the old Pentax) and a proprietary breech-lock mount. If your lens has the M42 screw mount you can use the adapter "RainbowImaging M42 Screm Mount lens to Sony E-Mount NEX-5 NEX3 NEX-VG10 adapter Ring" sold here on Amazon. There is a Petri Breech lock to Nex-5 listed on eBay, so you might try that if your lens has that mount.
yes, just need to check which canon lenses you have before selecting the adapter. google it, fotodiox for instance offers them
I have the 170 and I don't have any problems with a signal delay mine work great
the xbox doesn't have wireless built in. you need to get the add on USB wifi adapter to give the device wireless capabilities.
No
Not sure. We have only used it with iPhones 3, 3S, 4 and 4S.
sure does
Yes it is, I didn't have to install any drivers or software. Just make sure you've downloaded the most up to date DoD certs from militarycac.
Two questions: is the charger functioning properly? And, is the battery old and no longer able to be charged?
Yes it does. That is the purpose of the 1.4 f-stop to let in the maximum amount of light. When shooting in a low light situation where flash is not an option this is the lens of choice.
The barrel feels very strong, cannot be sure if metal or plastic but is very sturdy, and has weather seals. I use it as my main working lens, and it has withstood plenty of rain showers and sandy beach dustings. It is a great lens and surprisingly light for its size.
Not sure. Perhaps with the right adapter ring. Nevertheless, the lens might have to be used in manual mode defeating much of the capability the lens has to offer. I recommend that you buy the right lens for the camera you are using to take full advantage of its capabilities. If someone is giving you the lens then that's a different story.
No, but before the warranty runs out (hopefully not yet). I would search Canon Warranty Repair. You have to fill out a form. If the Camera's warranty is passed, I think they give a rough estimated of what it would cost to repair. We had a problem with one of our Canon S95s, we have 3 in our family. Luckily it was still under warranty. We sent it in (minus any accessories like strap or battery) and they fixed it quickly. It was gone a total of about 10-14 days. Good Luck!
There's no chance that this underwater housing WP-DC38 will fit the SX50 HS Canon camera. Sorry. I did some looking and there doesn't seem to be a custom underwater case... If you're just going to be playing in surf, you might be able to get by with a generic underwater bag-type case.
To see HD samples from sd4500 IS, search you tube dot com for 'sd4500' there are at least 3 samples taken at an airport. Zoom apparrently DOES work during video. also one of the videos shows the miniature mode (Amazingly cool)
Absolutely. The tip is a soft rubber. Its easy to hold. Its very good for any touch screen work
Nope, it only works for xbox 360 console.
Yes
No the SWM replaces the LNB, so your SWM comparable equipment will work
We have two, one controls outside lights and the other controls rope lights over the cabinets. They are RF so you do NOT have to have direct line of sight. There might be a chance that two would be on the same freq, there are only so many. I don't recall if there is a method of tuning. I got lucky and didn't have to pursue that answer.
If it is a double din space it should fit fine.
no, the system does not have internal memory. it will display the file names of the music files on your flash drive and allow you to select them to be played.
You should be able to connect any relatively current feature phone or smartphone to this device.
Yes, there is a power button on the top. It has a fairly good battery life when charged but you'll need a charger once its depleted. But there are many times I use it without plugging it into the car.
Yes it does
It is powered from the laptop itself. I plug my (Dell) laptop in (by way of 110vt. adapter) and use it, otherwise you will be draining your laptop battery pretty fast.
Yes, It has Blue Tooth connectivity.
You can tell the RoadMate 3030-LM to display Elevation on the main page, as well as speed, time, direction, eta, time remaining. You can select the item you want always displayed on the screen by touching that option from the pop up. These display options are only available when you are in a trip navigate mode. Otherwise, only Elevation, Time, Speed, and direction are available.The only place that I think Longitude/Latitude is displayed is from the Menu and you select Current Location, and there you will see your current Lon/Lat co-ordinates
Yes, there is a power button on the top. It has a fairly good battery life when charged but you'll need a charger once its depleted. But there are many times I use it without plugging it into the car.
I got this package and the lenses were not usable. i would not recommend this set.
Yes
I have a single da 12 d4 and that bumps yo can't speak for the fosgate just can't wait to upgrade my amp and add another one of these monsters :)
It's not required but it delivers better sound in a ported enclosure
I had bought a two pack, because I was going to give one to a friend, but it wouldn't work on our equipment. I returned the set.
In my opinion, my through put data rate runs at its best with this 7 dbi antenna. My antenna runs fine for any video streaming, assuming your ISP provides you with a fast enough speed to stream the video. This 7 dbi antenna is directional, meaning you can swivel it to the direction of your router to receive the signal directly instead of your current standard omnidirectional antenna that has a lower range. I recommend this 7 dbi over the standard one.
Unless you are running an industrial powered amp, I wouldn't be too worried. A small amp pumping out a few watts shouldn't be a problem. If you need to go for a longer distance, you may consider repurposing a Dish TV parabola, as a satellite TV system utilizes the same frequency band.
No they are purchased seprately. You must make sure to buy the airflow that fits the pro or it will not go together.
Yes
According to Garmin's web site in the FAQ section, the ads will be turned off when you turn the traffic option off. You cannot disable one without disabling the other. Glad to have the option though.
You have to plug it in to your computer and then there
I just checked another seller's description of this device, which indicated it is compatible with a Mac with OSX 10.4 version or later. I use a IMAC too, and needed to know this information before making my purchase of this item. Hope this helps you.
Try turning off the traffic function. The newer Garmins work that way.
It comes with a normal car charger for use in the cigarette lighter/charger.
No I do not think so. You might just change the battery on your old one and it might fix it.
There was not a code that would work with it but I was able to use the manual program. However, I was not able to actually get the remote to work because it would register every number I entered 3 times. So if I put in channel 256, Nick Jr for my son, it would program channel number 2225. It was impossible to get the remote to work.
YES!!!(but i cant get it to turn on or off our DIRECTV box) i was able to program the tv fine and it turns on and off the tv but i programmed ALL the code twice and after that i was getting annoyed that the box wouldnt turn on or off,so i tried the next step to program the channels and IT WORKED! (one of the code i entered worked, i dont know which one!?) I hope that helps!
Save your money and get a newer and better lap top. You will like the camera. Very simple to use. The only thing I don't like about the camera is the mounting bracket doesn't have the tension to hold it secure on thin monitors.
It's come down about $50 in the last couple of months. However, I would not expect it to come down more. It might it, might not. But cameras usually do not fluctuate in price very much. $497 including card and bag is a good deal.
No. The unit uses GPS to determine speed.
I don't know email the seller, however the flash is weak.
If A65 supports TTL then yes. Its also written in description
Yes, its TTL
Yes, in fact you can gat a trade-in rebate for the Bluechart SD card if you have one: http://www8.garmin.com/cartography/g2vision/programs.html
Yes, it will work.
It works perfect with my canon printer.
Hi - I wish I could help you - I have a Pixma MG5420 and that is what I bought it for - you should give Canon a call - they are great help.
Yes, you can. The optional Logitech software that comes with it doesn't run on a mac, but the macs do recognize the hardware.
No. It does not come with an adapter to charge iPods, ipads , etc.
I don't believe so. The website from the company says that it is splash proof.
Im not sure the exact dimension but it is a perfect size for outdoor activities or just having it in a survival pack, its also nice by your bed.
No it does not have any usb slots. Still a great little tv for the price.
it is no good give me my money back..i am senior on a fixed income..i needmy monry back..leon goldsberry!!
Yes, as it states right in the title and the features section of the ad, you can film up to 2 hours of high definition video with the Flip Ultra HD.
The unit is not heavy, I mounted it using 2 3inch angles.
The inline brick power supply is a switching power supply so it will work on 110v or 220v, you would just need to purchase the proper cable to connect to the figure eight jack on the power supply to your specific country's power receptacle. The warranty on the system is only good within the United States, just an FYI.
No
Yes, the face plate is metal. Would make a great Christmas present for someone that still has records. It's so inexpensive, but really great and worth more.
Mine is a single. Works great.
I had power surges and never had to turn the strip back on.
plastic
I have no idea. I'm not using mine anymore because the cd player just quit working.
I don't have any modems to bridge - so the answer to this NO!
Yes. I have the original NEX-5 and it works with it.
it does not but it does work with nex 3 it was written that it did .
I cannot state with certainly but I understand that it does work with the Nex3. I know it works with the Next 5n as well as the Next 6
I use the "Shoot". I don't know if it is the best or the most but it works reliably and the price is about $25.
You will need a flash cord, its model varies according to tour camera's maker.
Yes you can use it in costa rica .If you have 3G SIMCARD
The equipment I bough came with 110 Volts supply so I needed to use a converter to use it in Peru (220 volts local voltage). You need to do the same in Nigeria since as far I know you use 220 volts there. I do not know if Amazon has some option in voltage for this router. Another note: the equipment comes set with USA Internet operators so you need to make that change to the one you want to use in Nigeria. I hope I was useful.
Go into the search bar and type in "Bluetooth". If you have bluetooth then there should be a program for you.
2007
Hi, no. This is a very simple am fm radio. You can use headphones, but it is not in stereo. Only mono playing out of both ear speakers.
110 Volts
No I would get something with a bit more power without spending too much more money...maybe 20-30 more.
It should work with Windows XP. Note XP is no longer a supported OS.
I bought these for my MDR-NC6, noise cancelling headphones with a small cable. The Headphone piece that goes against your ear is oval, the covers seem to be round. Provided you are careful mounting them with a little bit of patience (not my greatest virtue), they fit nicely and snugly. I pulled too hard with my first attempt and ripped one of the covers which are made of thin foam. I am happy with result though. I hope this helps...
amason.com
I'm not sure if you want to know if they are panasonic or if what they fit over is panasonic, but they do a very good job on our earphones which are Sony. Much better fitting that the original ones that were there. The pads just came in a plain brown padded envelope.
This is just a switch, not a hub. If you need it as an out put in will be an out put but, if you are using this for your TV signal than the speakers won't work.
Nope it is setup for the iphone 3 & 4, you would need a converter for the iphone 5
No, the doors don't open. It does not have storage.
No, it is not but you can purchase a wireless adapter for cheap and it will work. Our tower only lasted a few months before it went out and was cheaper to buy a new one verses getting it fixed. Beware!!
Yes
Hi Feng.. I have the iPad Retina....But I'm sure it will.....there's not that much differences from the Air iPad only the weight.
I use it with my Logitech Pro 9000 no problem.
yes it did, worked fine on pc......
Keep it up high and away from blocking objects; add another device like an Apple Airport Extreme.
Gosh. I have a canon speed light that I use this on. It is sturdy, way better than the one that came with my flash. Do they make one for the Nikon?
Hmm, that's really odd. My best guess would be the card first, I've taken a good amount of raw files in my 60 & I've never encountered anything on that matter. If the card was the issue then awesome, but if you try other cards and it seems to be the camera itself; then I would recommend calling canon directly. Here is the number & I hope this was helpful! : 1 800 652 2666 :D
Yes they do come with a nice grill that's removable. They sound very nice but they do need a sub woofer. They are also very small check the dimensions listed
I would say yes as long as it is an 8 ohm amp.
I've not tried it since I don't own Apple products but I wouldn't risk buying it for that purpose. There is no interface on the camera's side to do anything with this device; all it does is connect to a GPS unit with Bluetooth in order to tag photos. From the camera's end it thinks that it's directly connected to the GPS device. The manufacturer doesn't make any claims that it can transfer files either.
I actually bought it for something else. Do you want to have remote live view and trigger from your DSLR ? If you do send another question and I will send some details so you can have something like CamRanger but at around 40 instead of 250. Hope that helps. Phil
No. A spot for a memory card.
Using the "Aux In" RCA jacks in the back of the unit, you can hook up a cd player/changer OR an iPad (using a special cable)...there is a USB port in the back of the unit as well; however the manual states "play music from USB flash drive...". I have not tried to plug in my iPod and play through the unit, but I don't see why it wouldn't work. Hope that helps.
I believe its compatible with the whole line csx and cs its a micro sd so there shouldnt be a problem. Its worth the price as long as you zoom in till you see the topo lines
I have used it on both Garmin 62 and Garmin 60csx. I have to say the 100K is better for my purposes.
No. Eye-wear is separate.
Yes this headset is compatible with PS4. F540 works fine for audio and voice. You can only use the microusb cable for ps4 I believe there isn't a red/white audio connection port on ps4.
Yes but a lot of functionalities are not available. My advice is to buy the G930 instead.
If the keyboard came with the USB dongle yes you can.
Because it is purpose-built for GoogleTV. You can right-click by holding the FN button and left-clicking.
No, all it does is trigger the shutter. Hope this helps. :-)
With my Pentax K-x it well respond from about 50 feet away with no problems. Have a backup battery if you are going to be using it on a long hike.
Yes work
I don't know.
yes looks like the right one
No. It just will last 5 seconds and you will cry a million tears when your computer dies while you are writing a paper.
I ordered a battery that indicated it was a replacement for the PA3817U. it did fit perfectly. However, it would not charge. I personally ordered a replacement direct from Toshiba. Good luck!
It fit my macbook pro although I don't know what model number mine is. According to the Apple website, the keyboards for the two sizes of current macbookPros are identical so it should fit yours.
1. The lens with end cap, hood, and soft lens cap that fits over the hood. 2. The luggage type case. 3. A CD with instructions for EF lenses. 4. Warranty papers. My lens arrived inside plastic bags inside the case which was inside a padded Canon box which was in turn inside a shipping box. It had clearly not been handled since leaving the factory.
if you can afford the 2.8, get it one of the best lenses Canon makes--1.4 extender will get as good results as the 400 4.5 and you will not miss the 1-300 f4 zoom flexibility for birds.
if the lens is not around the $10,499 range then you need to ask the question. I purchased my lens from amazon. It was not a second, and no complaints.
No!
Yes it does include a hood.
There is such a wide range of lenses. The 70-200 II IS is a winner that will work well in low light. If you are in a well-lit situation then this 70-300 is a great lens with more reach and lighter weight plus less cost.
It comes with the one year Canon warranty, you can register it online or by mail
Yes it will, This lens is only compatible with fixed focal length L-series lenses 135mm and over, as well as the EF 70-200/2.8L, EF 70-200/2.8L IS, EF 70-200/4L, and EF 100-400/4.5-5.6L. Additionally, please see the lens and/or camera body manual for full compatibility information with the Extender EF 2X III.
Yes, it is compatable, but extender weakens F/ number 2 steps.
I bought it for a 400mm 5.6 & manual focus only...which is just as fast or faster than auto many times... I wanted the distance
Although I am unable to personally verify it, I believe it will work as well with iPod Touch 3G as with any other iPod. At worst, you'll need to connect using the stereo adaptor cable thru the head phone connection.
No Bluetooth on this camera.
Yes it definetly works with HK AVR 1700, but you won't be able to use the complete potential of HKTS60 because of the output power HK AVR 1700 has got. Hope this is helpful.
They eventually stretch out. You can buy new pieces for really cheap or just super glue them on.
Yes. The RF 62s are best used for front, especially if you have smaller RB 51s. RB is bookshelf and RF is floor standing. RB can be used as front speaker but you always want the larger speakers in front. Also, RF can be used as rear speakers if you want but then you would want the same in front or larger like RF 82.
It is a single floor standing speaker. Besides the Reference Home Theater System sets that several sellers offer, the only Klipsch Reference speaker that typically comes in pairs is the bookshelf model which should specifically INDICATE "PAIR": Klipsch RB-xx xx Reference Series Bookshelf Loudspeakers.
I have no idea.
About 7+ seconds. Not very long at all.
The Humminbird manual says extension cables are available to extend the cable length up to a TOTAL of 50 feet.
Yes, I did and loved the fact that I could work from bed!
The laser is dead on the system you would have to repair it then every week run the disc for clean up.
Not at all! One is power only. one is data.
Not the Y Adapter, rather a cable with two male USB ends
Roger, I don't think so.
The only difference is that the ASX02 is rated for 150 watts RMS vs the PCZXO rated at 120 watts RMS. I suggest buying the Audiobahn ASX02.Keep in mind this type of crossover is designed for a 'tweeter' and a mid range speaker, not a sub bass.They look nearly identical if you can trust the amazon website photos...probably manufactured by the same company only difference being year manufactured?
Yes
Yes, it does.
Hi Jonathan C. Cauthorn, Yes, when viewing 3d files you can switch from side by side, over/under and simulated 3d. You can adjust the following settings by pressing OPTIONS on the remote control and selecting "3D Menu" from the menu list then select "3d Format". The playable file format for this TV are the following: .mp4, .mpg, .mts or .m2ts. - Jerome
I just updated one to the current firmware. It does nit freeze up, but it still has that hopeless navigation that makes this nearly useless. All media files on the machine are listed in a huge, worthless intermingled list. So you can't practically load more than one audiobook at a time, and you can't play an album sequentially.
No, this model does not BT neither does it have USB 3.0. There will be a newer model coming out some time later with both of these features.
Yes, but I caution you. This device is not easily navigated. With music, once the device has played a song, you have to go all the way back to the main menu to get back to the song list. The swipe feature is ULTRA sensitive. I'd get it set up and it would jump 3 songs just putting it in my pocket!! Extremely frustrating!
Per the owner's manual, it can handle up to 40gb total. So if you have an 8gb player you can get a 32gb card and it is suppose to work. You can download the user's manual in pdf form at www.sandisk.com.
Mine did not come with a clip. I bought a neopreen case that works well.

This statement is no longer accurate. Due to BIOS updates, the full 4GB of memory is now accessible.
I don't think so, if it does then that option is VERY well hidden

It would work if your computer has a TV tuner card or a USB TV tuner device. Otherwise, no. There's no way to connect it to your cable box - the only inputs are a standard 15-pin DSUB VGA input and a DVI input. It will only connect to a computer, and the only way to route the cable TV signal through your computer is using a TV tuner device.
I'm not sure. I would caution that my experience with sansa mp3 players has been mostly negative. I had earlier mp3 players without a touch interface and these were pretty good. The players with touch were so dreadful that I'd never buy another Sansa device.
You can listen to all your music or select permade playlists. As well you can choose to listen just an artist or album.
There are many that will work. The base on my speaker stand is smaller than the footprint of the speaker but I just put the rubber bumpers that come with the speakers on the four corners of the speaker stand base and it looks and works fine.

Probably not...........it's a good fit for a full sized IPad but don't think the mini will fit and stay.
Hi, I can confirm the Headrest Holder does only come in Black. The case cover and flip stand that is needed along side the headrest holder does come in a selection of colours. Thank you The Snugg.
Honestly I would find a different speaker to use. If you've already bought this speaker for that purpose then I don't know of any bracket
yes. However, best for surround speakers.
With cover 5 3/4 without cover 5 inch
Standard
If you have HDMI then yes!
I had to buy one.
Yes. If you want to use while motoring, Marcum also sells a high speed transducer that attaches to the transom of your boat. I purchased my unit in January and have not had a chance to use in open water...yet.
Icould not get mine too work either.... You might have to call directv..
Yes
No it didn't when I ordered it
The SpyderLensCal is not camera specific. It simply provides a target which you can focus on to make adjustments to your camera's autofocus. The D800 and D7100 both allow for AF microadjustment.
it,s ok
I'm not familiar with the .43 wideangle but this lens has no fisheye effect whatsoever. Hope that helps!
I could never get it to do much of anything. I sent it back for a refund. I know this doesn't help with your question per se but I did want you to know that you were not the only one that has problems with it.
Yes, you scroll to the file you wish to delete and hold down the volume button. Then select Yes or No. My player came with the complete works of Shakespeare installed. Nice feature, but I deleted them all for more music room.
yes but on this player , its 'favourites'' instead of 'playlists'......to add songs to favourites,scroll to the track, album or artist and press and hold volume button and select add to favourite
Yes
NO you have to connect to your computer via USB to find your folders to upload & download from.
These will not fry your camera. I use three of them in my 5Dmk2, including putting two at a time in my battery grip. They act exactly the same as the Canon branded batteries, even allowing you to assign profiles to them in camera to track charge, capacity, and overall health of the battery.
My MacBook Pro is 2009 i believe and yes settings needed to be changed but it wasn't difficult. I watched a YouTube video to make sure of what I was doing.
I'm sorry I don't know. I only plug it to my macbook pro for the hdmi adapter.
Hi, It might be a bad on or maybe a cable? My works perfectly with my airbook. Send it back, some of these type connectors I've bought on Amazon weren't good- and I did get a FULL refund & one that worked!
If you have loaded maps into it - yes. If you have not loaded maps it tries then give you a message that there are no maps to give directions from. I found instructions and links to get free maps by googling dcrainmaker. He has a great web site where reviews stuff and gives directions on improvements - like maps.
Yes
Save your money it does not work... I sent mine back...
Includes one right, one left
The trade mark name on the packaging is StayHear. They are shaped just like the tips that came off my original Bose headphones and work very well.
No they are designed for the Bose headphones only not apple
Yes, Windows Pro x64, and Windows Home x32. Worked great for me. Just had to hook into USB 2.0 not 3.0 (may just have been my situation)..
Although I haven't tested it: I read the FAQ page for the wii u on Nintendo's website. This hard drive should work fine the wii u. However, because it doesn't have a dedicated power source, meaning that it powers itself from the wii u, you could experience slower performance. http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wiiu/en_na/system_external_storage.jsp?menu=general_info&submenu=wup-external-usb-storage
Yes. I am using it for that. Works great.
You need to plug them both in to your computer. Then use either explorer or finder to transfer the data. I recommend you copy the files and then paste them to the other hard drive. once they have been copied delete the originals.
it is USB powered

Yes...
If you still need the help, you may can use the "Disk Management" program in windows 7. Once you find the program that lets you reformat the volume, it should be simple to follow the rest of the instructions.
This WD drive works with the nomad rugged case, ASIN B00505EZZ6, $39.95 to protect it in extreme conditions, but for normal rugged conditions a Drive Logic DL-64 EVA HD Case (black), ASIN B003VVH8Y6. $9.95 w/free shipping, will do just as good. Check both then decide.
Yes...
I could be wrong but I believe it's varies but device. I know with my iphone 5 it's 50. But if they said if I paid in full for the repair that they would pay 100% back to me so that's what I didn't and they paid me back in a day or two. It was great I would and do recommend them to anyone I know
It's 50 through amazon
Yes it is covered.
yes, it comes formatted as Fat32. It can be used as is or reformatted using the disk utility in OS X
Yes, it stored pictures for us, anyway.
Umm, I'm pretty sure you can. You mean as transferring data or using it as a second memory saver?
It will show as new and will auto format or ask you to format depending on the Operating System you are using.
Yes, use it
There's a small amplifier in one speaker cabinet, that powers both. Not much of an amp though
Hi I don't think this will work as you do need to download drivers.
Their website says you need the UC-E6 cable, so it should work :)
Yes - if I remember correctly, I tried it first in the camera and it didn't work. I then charged camera/battery in Kodak Easyshare Dock. When I checked about two weeks ago, it was still holding (however, I use the camera infrequently). Just checked it and battery is low, so will recharge. Hope this helps.
Have left it in the car and still works fine through summer and winter
no
I'm wondering the same. I bought a Belkin case here, but it was too small (some reviews said it was big for their 17", so I thought it'd be perfect..).
We save files as FAT 32, on a small external drive, even though you run a Windows NTFS File system on your computer. You use NTFS if you are making a Recovery Drive.
I have an S95 which has is basically similar internally to the G12. It's far better indoors and in low light than my Nex 5 which produces very dull pictures lacking color indoors without a flash. The Nex 5 18/55 has a 3.5 lens therefore let's far less light into the sensor.
That's one of the big flaws in that drive -- after a while the USB connector in the unit itself starts to fail. for the short term, you may be able to jiggle the cord to get some connection, but in the long run it is going to become unusable.
I have used it with Windows 7. I do not see why it should not be compatible with Windows 8.
I have the SX1IS ad SX30IS. Going to sell one of them. I did a comparison of what I called final image quality. http://www.cameramike.com/cameramike/MEDI_1./Pages/SX30is_compare_SX1is.html Yes - RAW output is an advantage but when you reduce the noise of the SX30 image it is of equal or maybe better quality of the RAW SX1 image. Using my simple non technical setup. I did look at other setting but both like iso 80 the best. I do not need a high definition video - so that difference is not important.
Yes per speaker so 280 for the pair. They sound great
There is an "ambient light sensor" next to the camera, and this case has no opening to allow light in, causing the ipod to think it is in a dark room and dim the screen accordingly. Maybe you could look at a case that has the proper hole and try to poke a hole in your griffin case in that spot?
No. This Talking Touch Screen will work with Simon XTi and Simon XT alarm systems. For full details and compatibility please see data sheet in the following link: https://www.24incontrol.com/sites/default/files/2%20Way%20Talking%20Touch%20Screen%20Data%20Sheet.pdf
The power supply, touchscreen, two screws and two drywall plugs.
Yes
It is probably a kit lens they've taken out of the kit and selling it separately.
go ahead man.. these are the best speakers i have bought.. and i have bought alot of speakers in my life..
Do a Google 'image' search of dolby 5.1. This will help you. Should be on the side. Can do the same search for 7.1, 9.1.
Mine did not. I was lucky to see 120hz. Installations do vary but in my opinion the drivers are just too small to do LF well.
Never heard the 2000 but I can tell you the cs8040 is a really great speaker. Everyone that watches a movie or sports at my house is blown away by the sound. I have the cs8040 two 8040 surrounds and Bic America towers that I plan on replacing with definitive technology bp8b's.
The driver software supports both Mac and PC. It says it supports Mac OSX 32 and 64 bit.
MANUFACTURER ANSWER: Thank you for posting your question. The Plugable USB to RS232 adapter will work on any Mac running OS X 10.6 and later, including 10.8.5. Make sure you have the latest update installed. David Plugable Support
Yes. Use this monoprice switch to send Apple TV signal to projector and Samsung TV. Works!

Our G router works fine with the Roku HD. We use the composite (red,white,yellow) cable with a 32" tube-type TV.
I wear prescription glasses with a wire frame and have a pair of prescription sunglasses with a thicker plastic frame. Neither of them interfere with (or are interfered by) the earphones. The wires for the earphones wrap over the top of the ear and do not generally come into contact with my either of my glasses. The combination of the earphones and glasses do not cause a problem for me. That said, everyone is a little different and your exact fit may be different than mine.
Hi KQ... I do not know why this would not be compatible. If your tablet has a USB port, and is a PC or MAC, it should work with a tablet as with a desktop. But do not take my word for it. You could contact the seller or the company.
Since connected to your router, instantenous.

I'm looking forward to getting this one as well.
You may find the version by going to NikonUSA.com, and look it up under software version.
yes sir that cord is flexible as and 3.5mm aux cord...hope that dont turn u off it is still a solid heat set
Extremely good life! Whole day with heavy phone talk or five straight hours music listening. Battery lasts about 1.000 charge cycles. My last backbeat last three years because it broke, but battery was still good. Hope that helped you. :D
This is RG174.
Probably . . . from what I can see from the description of the adapter.
No this is definitely not a solid state drive.
Yes. I have a 32 inch monitor, PS3, and my computer plugged into it. It gives me 21 minutes of power to finish what I am doing and shut down the computer properly. It is a life saver.
After reading the WD forums, it is my understanding that My Book Live will work with Mountain Lion without a hitch.
I successfully use the 2TB My Book Live for backups until upgrading to Lion. Now it is painful. It takes 7-10 days for a fresh backup of 300GB using Time Machine over a wired network. And TM demands a fresh backup every few weeks. I've scoured the internet for answers, with no success. I regret I ever bought this drive.
It must be wired to your router. After it is connected to your router it may be accessed through wireless if you have a wireless router.
I've used it with Vista, 7, and 8. It works well with those OSes.
It's 5 feet long. http://www.cyberpowersystems.com/products/ups-systems/pfc-sinewave-series/CP1500PFCLCD.html?printVer=true
You can turn off the beeping when the power goes out (or any other time) by pressing and holding the Silence Alarm button (the middle button on the front of the unit). This will cause the display to show MUTE and an icon of a bell with a slash through it, so you'll know it's muted.
Definitely. It comes with a 1/8" adapter so you can use it with your ipod/computer or anything else that uses a standard headphone jack
Velcro should be fine. The retractable cable that come with the unit extend to about two feet
The unit is detected and recognized like other USB devices. It disconnects the internal speakers when running, so I believe it should work
yes it will, using it right now
no it is not!
yes it will.........I have it in 3 rooms
yes absolutly
110 volt. I don't believe there are many appliance like this available in 220 volt. Surely you know there step down transformers available if you need to connect 110 volt appliances to a 220 volt source?
Did not work ! don't know where the blue ,red ,green go .got to get the lines out.
Speaker cables 2 metres for each speaker, Electric power cable 2.5 metres, computer connection cable 1.5 metres
HK sound stick 3 no doubt
Yes, if that is all you hook up, that is all it will switch. But be aware, it cannot do dual outputs, just switch between single outputs if that was even in your thoughts.
Yes, that should work. I have the reverse scenario, a wired keyboard and a wireless mouse and it works fine.
Press talk button. You get on speaker by pressing speaker button.
Yes, it will work on any Sony Alpha DSLR. It is a great lens for the price point by the way.
Yes
Yes, simply pull up and out.
No
the mounting dock a car phone charger, not the phone I bought 2 the first one came in motorla packaging just like from the store new nice, so I decided to buy another one said it was to come the same why but it didn't,it was only manla bubble wrap and im still waiting for the car charger that was missing from the pack I was not to happy, if you get it right company its really nice
all I can find is "SECTION 2: INGREDIENTS DIAMOND POWDER Polyol Esters Trade Secret Polymeric Dispersant Trade Secret 1-Methoxy-2-Propyl Acetate Carbon Black "
I don't remember exactly (and I can't check for a while as I won't be near it) but the one it comes with is 3ft I think.
It is quite fast. I never ran any benchmark tests but it is considerably faster than USB2.0. Just make sure you have USB3 ports in your computer. In case you only have USB2 ports, the drive still works but with USB2 speeds only.
No. It has an AC adapter you have to use.
no,I reconvert to avi or mp4 format.
I have the same problem, and I understand it is to do with the way the audio was encoded when the mkv was made, and what the encoder was intending the file to be played on. There is lots of discussion about it here: http://forum1.netgear.com/showthread.php?t=56433&page=3 and it may be fixable. I have not tried yet. HTH
No- you'll need a 9.5mm thick or less 2.5" drive for PS4. This 3.5" way too big.
Yes, you can. It's not safe unless you have it plugged into a UPS though, keep that in mind. If power cuts or dips you'll have to start over.
Are you talking about transducers other then Hummingbird? If so, probably none because of the connections. However, Hummingbird offers two with this one. The difference is, the original one does not do speed of craft. This model is discontinued and they are now offering an upgraded one. Hope this helps..
Yes. Check out the humminbird website and they offer the mount kit. Still uses same transducer, just the mount is changed.
To go around your wrist. Idk if I understand the question correctly.
I use it mainly for importing VHS tapes fit video editing (it works great for that), so i have not tried it on any Hi-Def applications.
It only records the audio and video that the TV puts out, but not what you say. For that, you have to record yourself separately and sync the TV audio/video and your audio and/or video together yourself. I just record my voice using Audacity (free program) and then sync it with the TV recording in my editing program later.
For me i tried for like 2-5 days it never worked for me, i suggest getting a roxio!
Yup! Mines came with 2 sets of double sided composite cables, and one double sided s-video cable! As well as the usb cable to connect the capture card to a PC
If you go to the far right side of the task bar there is a small arrow that points up (the technical name isn't important here), click it once and a small windows with hidden icons pops up. The top left corner of this pop up windows has an icon called ELAN Smart-Pad. Click it and adjust the sensitivity of the pad to suite you, or turn it off.
The primary differences between these two models is 1) the PU17 has a better battery (rated up to 13 hours instead of 10 hours with the MU17) 2) the PU17 has Bluetooth 3.0 and the MU 17 has no Bluetooth 3) the PU17 comes in black, blue, red, and white while the MU17 only comes in black, blue, and white You can compare the differences between the ASUS Eee PC product lines at this link: http://commercial.asus.com/category/overview/17
I've streamed Netflix and YouTube plenty of times with no problems. I've also sent the stream to an external monitor with no problems.
Did you buy the ASUS netbook yet? I've narrowed it down to this model, and would like to get something other than the popular "Black" color. I think I'm leaning towards the "Blue" color. I asked someone that bought the blue ASUS and they said it's darker blue than the picture and has purple highlights. I think that's a color I would like. Whatever color you choose really comes down to your own personal preference. Good Luck in choosing if you haven't already!!
The cabes are included. No remotes are involved. This item comes with two pieces one goes on the the hot shoe and the other on the flash. If you want to trigger flash remotely this is not the product for you.
Probably not. This model is a network drive. I use it to store and retrieve data/music from many different computers on my LAN. The USB version should be able to boot directly to a computer.
Make sure your camera is in the mode to use the remote. I had a problem as well at first and then realized my camera was not in the mode for remote use.
Sorry, I don't know. I think you can select music. I suppose if you digitally record what you want to say, you could that for sure. But I don't know if there is a plug in for a microphone to directly records anything. I will look when I get home, if you don't hear from me than it does not. good luck.
Not sure. Need to check with Sony
Yes
I don't know
No manual focus like a camera lens. However, the auto focus does well. The clarity is also good out around maybe 10-15 feet from the camera.
I did not have any issues with LifeCam using Windows 8, the video size I can adjust at ease. Try uninstalling the software and re-installing or download the right driver for W8. It may help... Good Luck
Look up your vehicle and see if it has spots for 6.5inch speakers
Almost the same, I prefer pioneer, just make sure they are completely indoors at all times. Sony's don't hold up long in changing environments
In what way?? If you syncing up by Bluetooth, then yes...
It can be used in manual but you'd be paying a lot for the nikon automated creative lighting system computer powers built into the flash and not using it. If you want a manual flash, you can buy one for $300 less from a no-name brand.
Case, stand, diffuser, 2 soft gels. Great flash and in commander mode is great for off-cameral flash.
The boxes aren't sealed that I know of. If you are worried about it you can take a picture, press the play button to see the picture and if the title is the number "1" then you've taken the first picture.
Hi Tammera, you don't need an adapter. Everything is included and works great! Catherine
It does provide better reception.............depends on your surrounding stations and topography
Yes. I have same camera. Works great!
Yes. Screen worked perfectly. Still working!!!
No. The RAM mount is only good for the size of the iPad.
Inside the mouse battery compartment is a small wireless receiver that needs to be plugged into the computer's USB port. They seem to have left this important info out of the instructions, but once you do that and put in the batteries, it should work fine (the mouse has an on-off switch on the bottom also).
Hi I am looking for the same solution. I want to mount a slingbox 500 to the wall or back of wall mounted TV. THanks..
I would suggest you consult your instruction manual to be sure but the 1/2" tape is very standard and should fit all Brother Labelers. HOWEVER (!) I have 2 labelers and one of them cannot use the 3/4" tape. This 1/2" tape should be fine! I know there are much smaller tapes available. I haven't purchased those since I can't for the life of me imagine why I would want such tiny labels!
if you have to ask such a question, then my advice to you is to buy a completed system from Dell, Hp or one of the other brand names already built and ready to go.
USB only.

Im on same boat as you are but $200 + for a grip is way too much. let me know if you hear anything.
Yes
Each base will handle up to 4 sensors. Each sensor can be programmed for a different sound so you can tell which sensor is transmitting . I ordered a base and one sensor to try it out then ordered another sensor through Amazon later. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00436XL3U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Both vehicles moving, i have not ever tried..it can definately from stationary position..i suppose i will have to try
im sure it can, i have it pared with my galaxy s2 my ps3 and my computer
Mine arrived defective. Don't know answer to question.
I can delete but I haven't figured out how to mark and edit segments. I have been doing that in editing software.
You plug in your camera to a USB port on your computer and it will download the software. You can then use the software to download, or you can download the pictures manually to a folder on your computer by opening "My Computer" icon on a PC and then download the files individually to whatever file you want to use.
ICAN! 10" Tablet PC - Android OS 2.1 I also want to know if Skype and flash 10.1 are installed or can be installed and can I make Skype phone calls?
I've got the a55 and my brother has the D5100....Both are great. Video is tons better on the a55.
Yes, it has RCA terminals. Also can be direct wired if your head unit is set up that way. Volume increases/decreases according to adjustment on your head unit. Has gain and frequency response adjust. on unit. Super easy install. Another cool feature is that it will turn itself off if it doesn't sense music input for a couple minutes.
Yes, 1 AA
It probably will, but I found it to be a noisy mic so I replaced it with sennheiser mke 400; which I found to be much better mini shotgun mic, for only $50 more at the time. Hope this helps.
You can listen to music, however if there is any noise around you (ie outside, in your vehicle, or in the office) you will probably not hear much as the max volume is fairly quiet and almost muffles sounding for music. It is serviceable merely as an entry level ear piece. I've already purchased a jabra icon to replace this. Good luck, hope this helps!
Yes it is and 110-220v
I do not like this Bluetooth! It serves it's purpose for now. It has trouble with voice recognition and It is difficult to use. As soon as I can I will go back to using Jawbone. They are so EASY to use and they do have just a few extras. I have warn out two of them, but that took 6 years.
yes. it works after sundown. it is not bright enough under the daylight
Yes, we hung ours from the ceiling. We love it.
Mine never worked at all
It uses a conventional coldshoe foot. If the FS100 has one, it'll mount to it directly. If it has the proprietary Sony shoe you'd need an adapter of some sort.
Yes. It will take up to 2GB of RAM. I put a 1TB HDD in it and it seems to work just fine. Just make sure you jump the terminals
As an answer to your question I do not hook up an additional monitor to my iMac. The iMac screen is adequate for me so I wouldn't suggest hooking up in additional monitor unless you having problems thank you.
It was a present for someone else so I'm not positive, but I don't think it had too many instructions included, just some basic stuff about setting clock, alarm, presets. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
I am not an expert on the Downward firing vented port, maybe google that... but we have it standing on a carpet floor.No problem so far.
There is no way to mount this speaker to the TV. You will have to drill the wall. I have a built in wall system and mine sit in a little cubie hole that was made for it. I cannot send you a picture of it because this site will not allow it. Thanks Dr. Charles
This is one item that does not disappoint.. It even has a low power audio warning. I usually charge once a month and use daily. Commute is about 20 minutes each way, and another hour daily driving. One of it's best features. Best part, it uses the same charger as most phones, so if you have a car charger, you are set.
The unit does go into a low power 'sleep' after you've moved far enough away from it. If you're car is within 30 feet of where you are it will likely stay connected. This happened to me just the other day. Once you're back in the car just tap the call button and it will wake up and connect to your phone.
You can charge it with your PC and car plug-in charger to the lighter
When you use this device you pair the phone via Bluetooth to the Cruiser, then it acts as a speakerphone. The Cruiser has a FM transmitter so you can then have your phone's audio piped through the stereo, however in my experience I turn the FM off during calls and use the Cruiser standalone for the calls. I only use the FM for music.
i am sorry to hear that, but as for my unit, i charge for 1 night and use when ever i am in the car it for four days and is working perfect . Have not been charging since than roughly 1hr per day .i listen to music from my phone using FM . As for the FM button i realise that i have to press five times continuous than it will be activated. trust me this matter works. Hope this will help you.
It takes one SD memory card. I've used sandisk 8gb 45mb/s with this camera, works great!
I suppose. They will fit anything that any other normal earbuds will fit. Hope that helps
Never tried it but it may work if your computer has a combo headphone/mic port. Or your gonna have to get a splitter to run 3.5mm to dual 3.5mm that splits headphone and mic, and then you probably need a cable from the dual 3.5mm to your pc. Dual 3.5mm is usually pink and green, green being headphone and pink being mic. Hope this helps.
They don't have a microphone so they cannot be used for speech but you could plug them into your computer.
I have the K5 and I didn't order the 18-55 lens with it because I had one, and it works very well with it
Yes, I like to know the same, Is 18-55mm f3.5-5.6 Lens weatherproof lens or just ordinary ?
it fits like a glove.. not much room for much else though. I grabbed a few pens a notepad and a charger and wouldn't imagine putting much more in.
Yes it will accept a 1 1/2" pole.
I think it would be really difficult, unless you are sitting in front of your computer. If that's what you are trying to do, I believe you could... &#128540;
approximately 2 1/4 inches wide by 3 3/4 inches in length
Do you have a filter on the lens? If so, try it with no filter. Something might be interfering with lens movement.
Sorry, but I don't understand your question.
Robert - Only had the lens for a couple of hours - it had quite a bit of distortion at 18mm.. plus the one I received was a "grey" market one.. no us warranty.. and I was not comfortable with that.. so, I returned it. Never used it in the field.. hope this helps..
Yes fully compatible. I own them both.
Yes
HDMI, Display Port, DVI-D, VGA
I did to a new Mac Mini. I just let the Mac choose the highest compatible resolution though.
I use my speakers from my computer. I bought a set with a sub woofer. Then plug into the front of the movie mate. And then you can turn up the sound on the speakers as well as the moviemate
I don't know, I am responding to your question because the speaker stopped working after 4 days of use and I thought maybe you would like to know that, I returned it a week after I received it
Because it's for a computer
According to the description of this case on Amazon, it appears to be water resistant. To me this seems to be similar to a water resistant coat or jacket that will keep you dry in a light rain but not a torrential downpour. I have an A7 16" laptop case which is constructed in a similar manner but which has a rubberized bottom. My Targus case is awesome. I feel confident you will be happy with yours, that it will protect your laptop or documents, but use a little caution in a torrential down pour. Hope this is helpfull.
This is a lap top case. There are better choices made specifically for a camera and lenses.
I forget. Threw it out because it did not work with my iPhone. I do not recommend this product.
it will work on any Panasonic or Olympus micro 43 camera.
Yes
Yes, print on the lense reads "Made in Japan"
This lens for video is really good for establishing shots during the day. If you want look at this wedding video I did. All the establishing shots were done with it. If you want to skip all the way to the start of the reception and you will see how wide this lens gets and how sharp it stays.I hope this helps. https://vimeo.com/66283278
No, to my knowledge the pancake lens can't fit image stabilization inside. Here is a review http://m.dpreview.com/previews/panasonic_14_2p5_100-300_4-5p6
Yes, and I use this lens with Lumix G5, completely satisfied.
Yes it does, but it is a 2.5mm size and will require an adapter to attach a normal mike cable.
Red/blue blinking = charging mode. Red blinking = playback mode. Blue blinking = playback via aux cable. To receive a replacement manual, please email support@satechi.com. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
Yes
it can plug into a wall outlet with an adapter
These cloths are great because you can use either sides. There's no difference in either side! If one side accumalates too much dust, at some point if it becomes difficult to tell which side is cleaner. You can then wash with warm water only and hang them dry.
I have a Q501LA and it works great. I don't know how different our laptop models are if at all.
It is USB only. Works great on PC/laptop/etc.
It has a built in plug that you flip. No cord. Hope that helps!
Yes, mine was destroyed and this unit worked exactly as original remote no difference
Check if your notebook has a kensington lock, is a little square thing on the side or the back of your notebook ( srry for the grammar, im still working on the language)
It must have the standard lock port. It looks like a small ellipse shaped hole.
No--the principle is induction of the coil, which requires a ferrous target that moves proximate to the coil. Depending on the level of sensitivity you could have a car drive by very slowly and it will not alarm. I have mine about 30 ft from the road and fast moving school buses set it off; a slow one does not. Interestingly but not surprisingly, a close lightning strike will also set it off.
Yes, it will fit. The grove has several thicknesses, forming a kind of inverted pyramid shape. The Mini with a case will definitely fit in the largest grove.
I do not believe they willl work with rhe 1070. The Benq uses the DLP link system of 3D. It isva goid system, except that the glasses can lose "sync" with the transmitter if you mive, which almist never happensvwithe RF system the Monster uses. Some projectorz have an optional pirt where you can attach an RF emitter (comes with Monster glasses kit), but I am not seeing that the 1070 has that option. Good luck!
Yes. I listen to music every morning on my ipad mini. But these headphones also come with adaptors for standard phono and the smaller mini stereo plug. Full year's heavy use & they're holding up very well.
Yes, it works just fine. I have a Samsung S5 and I have no problems at all.
yes,not easy but you can do it.
i see no possible way to hardwire the subwoofer without taking it apart and risking damage to the system
Regular (2 wire) speaker cable can be used to hook up speakers to the R-S500BL. The receiver speaker wire connectors are capable of accepting either banana plugs or bare wire. You can install banana plug ends on the receiver end of the speaker cable if you want to but it is not necessary.
what does that mean you put them in your ears
Yes
yes one of the legs comes off and can be used as a monopod
It does not have spiked feet, just rubber ones
China
Hope this helps :-) http://hometheater.about.com/od/televisionproductreviews/fr/Toshiba-46wx800u-Cinema-Series-3d-led-Lcd-Nettv-Review.htm

I looked quickly and from what I see this ad does not specify the connector type at the camera end. The A 1400 and the A 1300 Canon cameras use a "Mini B" USB (male) plug at the camera end and a standard "A" plug (male) at the other (PC) end. I would suggest you look here for info: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB - and here for a cable that is compatible: http://www.amazon.com/Canon-PowerShot-SD1300-Digital-Camera/dp/B003ZRRDZK/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1390028117&sr=1-2&keywords=Canon+A+1300+USB+cable
Yes
Yes
This depends on the 'jack' in your camera. It must match the 'plug' on the shutter release device. Neewer makes a plug that will match almost any camera.
I have heard of it, but I wonder how the bass response would be with only 5 1/4 woofers. Mine is paired with JBL Es80s and I am very pleased so far. Especially for the money. But at the current price you can't beat the 363s.
Yes, no issues. Once you connect to the wireless network, you'll be asked for the password.
I have picked up from that distance, without a lot of things blocking your signal. You can put this antenna outside when you use it, but if I do put it outside, I don't when it is raining, I always bring it back inside later on. Put it up high outside. There might be something you can pick up between your house and the Library that you didn't know about. Try different directions with the antenna itself. I love mine, using it right now! Good Luck!!
It should, but Mcdonalds doesnt Broadcast to the outside of Building all there repeaters are setup for interior coverage.
Yes, this does have the "record what you hear" feature. I would also suggest you look at the products at www.DAK.com. There products are the most reasonable and work great. There support is also unbeatable.
This device does support SmartMedia cards.
I would write Delkin support and ask them. I have no idea. It is compatible with OS X.
i dont know, it just records to an sd disk. i think you can burn it from there
Don't know, never tried this. My understanding is that the HDMI port to computer or TV is for video playback only.
I have never had a reason to try to record when charging. Short answer is "I don't know". I could be wrong, but I don't think it will. But then again I have had no reason to try it.
Yes.
It does do that on my win8 laptop- but I suspect this is a function more of the operating system than the sound card itself. And if it doesn't happen automatically, there are usually settings for controlling that in your operating system.
Yes, it comes with a fairly comfortable and adjustable shoulder strap. It is removeable.
It should, the bottom unzips and extends another 3 inches
I'm certain it won't fit with the grip. I usually have my 5D MK II with the 17-40 f4L mounted (with hood on forwards even) and it fits nicely. If I unzip the bottom expander, I can have a 70-200 f4L mounted (but the hood needs to be reversed). Either way, I don't see the grip fitting.
It's does. It's located in a little pocket on the outside of the case. I love this case.
It comes coated with thermal grease
I don't see why it shouldn't work however you won't get to use the "control" 4th pin of it. I never had a reason to use it unless you are a tweaker.
Not sure however they did not give us the results we were loking for it only lasted for 2 months and was out again went to Sears web site and gave them the model number and the part to replace the entire board was available for 100.00 We got that and it has been working for over 6 months now.. these capacotor are universal
This is free standing separate. Notice the "bluetooth" which means it is wireless. Not having a wire makes it more convenient when you see what a piece of garbage this is and toss it in the trash.
I have a Canon...but I was able to completely extend the lens. I was also pleasantly surprised at how well the pictures had come out.
i believe it does come with a cord to plug into the computer
Yes.
I believe they fit the 4. However, go to the product description and see if they mention those others. If not, then I would make the assumption they will not fit. You can also try narrowing your search by typing in the unit you need a cover for. Good Luck
yes it will work perfectly with the D7000
I don't know for sure, but it should if it is a true apple product
The window opening is 10.5" x 13.5".
No, but they do have headphone jacks. We used our own headphones with no problems.
Have to use plugging in headsets
No, it does not. Normally one would not expect that of a projector. Audio out would come from your source such as a Blu-ray player or computer. It does NOT have a built in speaker (for a good projected image a speaker would potentially vibrate the image) This is meant to be a higher quality projector than a business meeting projector and it is - it is great for home theater applications where one has a separate amplifier running the speakers.
You need an AV receiver for sound and as long as it has HDMI input, the Apple TV just plugs right in to any input and carries audio and video signals to speakers and the projector simultaneously. The projector has no sound of its own.
Depends on who you buy it from and where they are vis you. Mine took 4 or five days. They aren't a big package, far smaller than a TV set, particularly the crappy new 'furniture' sets that Americans think they need to fit the the decor of their living rooms. I've got one of those too, but I'm not crazy about the 'tiny', 50 inch picture. The only way to have a bigger than life future, is to watch everything, particularly movies, BIGGER THAN LIFE!
B&H Photo. They're not cheap, but it's usually about a $50 discount. Consider yourself lucky that you get 2000 hrs.
Yes
There is no Hi Definition. You won't be able to read the small writing that Xbox 360 typically has very well. I suggest a tv box. They are a little more, but there are Hi Definition ones available and they can still record, in fact that is what they are meant for. The easy cap is like a cheapo version of a tv box, and it's not that much cheaper than a regular 480p tv box. Check out Hauppauge.
Sorry - didn't work for me. Only compatible with Windows 7 or Windows Vista...
Yes! That's the model I have and it worked.
Not sure what you mean by fuse but there are two ribbon cables which are attached to the slide out connections on both sides of the remote.
1.375"
Metal but I haven't bothered to know if it is aluminum or steel.
It runs 4K to my setup with no problem. 4K cables are pretty much a joke as shown here. http://www.cnet.com/news/4k-hdmi-cables-are-nonsense/ You don't have to worry about depth as any standard build will give plenty of room behind it to connect as long as it is below a 22awg HDMI cable.
Not with that configuration, that piece is set up for a 7.1 system. It has 3 separate components plus the cover plate, the center one should be able to be upgraded. The center one has the sub, speaker and HDMI. There is still room for one to two other component. Hope this helps
The weight is around 4.4 lbs. Actually it's not that heavy to hand hold while taking pictures. I do it that way all the time when setting up a tripod isn't all that easy. I have smaller lens that feel heavier when using than the Opteka. Hope this helps.
Yes, i had a samsung 32" on mine, now there is a 42" on it... You will be fine
The Walkman uses AA batteries (2) underneath where the cassette goes.
Yes, both reverse and pause. Very sturdy player.
It should be compatible. Most Sony stereos use the same configuration. I would also suggest buying a wire harness for you model car as well . That way you can solder the two together before doing the install
Yes
This card has 16 BNC video inputs
to view remotely with phone, you need set up network first. This requires professional network experts. End users may not be able to set up the network connection. For iphone, you can search for third party App, like Mobile Eye. We do not provide software or App for access from the phone.
The distant location being watched (father in NJ) needs internet access and a wireless router. The initial setup needs a computer, but after that, only the router with internet access. In NYC, all you need is internet access to log in to DLink to see your NJ camera live.
An external flash would fit in the top compartment.
It will work if the fan requires 12V.
The connection to the 3+ has not changed so yes, this should work...
The mount is 3M taped to the helmet. So yes it can be attached and peeled off after use.
All Dell Monitors are matte finish.
Yes, it will work just fine. Ignore the first guy, who posted the specs of the motherboard and apparently didn't read them. It says it will work with RAM running at 1866, and that's exactly what this is. Just be prepared to give it a little extra voltage to get the RAM stable at 1866.
I bought a 2x8 1600 and could not push it any further than 1866 increasing v and cl, stable but dissapointed with patriot oc, had a 2x4 kingston blue 1600 that could reach 2133 1,65 cl11 or cl12 i dont remember, heatsink in this patriot series is a toy, get a 2x8, its better for OC

No, it doesn't have a SIM card slot. It's intended to be used with USB 3G dongles like you use with laptops. I don't think you can tether it by USB to a phone, either, but that doesn't seem very useful anyway. If you have a 3G/4G phone, you should be able to use it as a hotspot without any other hardware. You can also connect it to a cable/DSL modem via Ethernet cable, plug your desktop into the Sapido, and have Wi-Fi for your other devices just like a regular Wi-Fi router, but with only one wired port.
Of course it can do the job while working in Access Point (AP) mode. See the switch button on the back of the device.

Your system board will only accept up to 1600mhz. This memory is 1866mhz. It is not compatible.
It is 1866MHz but it'd work with your system, just set it to the correct speed and everything should be fine.
fgcd
The bolt (screw) circle is 11 5/8" so the hole diameter should be about 1/2" smaller than that or NO BIGGER THAN 11 1/8" otherwise the screws will have nothing to screw into. You can probably get away with using only 4 screws at 12-3-6 and 9 O'Clock. That's what I did.
No
I would make sure the media volume on your Android device is turned all the way up, since the volume coming out of your stereo is dependent on how loud the input is. I did not have a problem with low volume on mine. The problem I had with the AUX input is I would get a lot of fuzz and crackling when there was a lull in volume (like in between songs, or while listening to audiobooks, etc.)
It should i had this for 3 months and it stopped working but it worked good until then
Yes
It's not terrible difficult took me about 15 min you would need a precision tool kit, a suction cup, and a blow dryer or small heat gun for the glue edges
Yes
Return this before you even unpackaged it. To respond, no, it is a standard aaa battery.
Just call Azza, Technical Support & Services: (714) 990-5625 Tech Support Hours: Monday - Friday: 9:00 A.M. - 5:00 P.M. PST.
I don't know. The GTM 25 works with traffic. If you just need a charger, I would use google for your Garmin model and look for accessories.
Yes
Yes, it will stay on. It has an off/on button. It will not flash with your camera ... this is just a light!
ehhh ... i dont think so ... don't get me wrong it BIG TIME lights up a room but i don't its near the flash quality to anything like a Nikon speed-light
It works on the T3I and I believe they are the same startes lens size so it def should work
Sound very good and the cushions are soft. I use these for watching tv so I won't keep my wife awake
It will fit any hot shoe. I have not tried it on a70D but have used it on a 30D, 7D and a 5DMIII.
Cause is electronic General warranty, no specific kindle or tablet warranty, but is the same
Touchscreen plastic.
What the hell is flossless audio files? I still use a Walkman.
This is not a problem. The device has 1Gb of ram but 512 are "locked" for OS/kernel use. You could probably do a meminfo if you could connect with via the adb shell and see the raw memory info.
can I get 60Watt, 12V, MR-16 Halogen bulb replacments but you have to remove the existing bulb to ensure u get an exact match which can be bought at amazon ,radioshack , or any electrical supply store .
Not very well. The picture is very grainy and words/ PowerPoint presentations are difficult to read. If you can spend a little more try to get an hp model.
Hello there! The Share N300 router does not have Android apps for storage sharing options. It does, however, have the USB Control Software for USB-enabled Belkin routers that can be installed only on computers.
The folks at Ooma would be the ones to ask.
Hi Carlos, Yes it will. Blue Nook
It is work with my camera no problem yet.
I'm not sure what all it fits but it does have an optical output. I use it and it works great.
not really, this card is really basic in my opinion, just does what it's supposed to do, but it doesn't really pack a lot of features. It has effects where it makes your sound into settings like "large hall, recording studio, small room" but that's really about it. Don't expect too much out of something that's costing you about 30 dollars. It will not have much difference from a stock onboard audio.
Yes you can. USB 3.0, 2.0, and 1.1 all work using the same connector. You will not get 3.0 speeds, but whatever the lowest version being used. Using you as an example, a 3.0 drive with a 3.0 cable, but using a 2.0 port on your computer will drop that speed to 2.0
I'm not sure how to answer your question, you can contact Seagate at their toll free number, I have used Seagate external hard drives for years, I am on Windows 7, and it does back up images.
yes, but check at the seagate website. beware, it is a 5400 rpm drive, not 7200, does defeat the purpose of usb 3.0 somewhat.
I personal believe it is the power flow back from you external HD to your notebook. Disconnect the USB, restart your notebook. (I assume you are using notebook, and is a turn off and turn on no response issue. )

Max resolution for my Monitor is 1680 1050 (HP f2105) - The D++ connection on my computer has a max resolution support of 2540 x 1450 do works great for my uses - which was to find adapter that would allow me to utilize my existing monitor.
Yes it is.... Fully compatible!
yes it does
No. You need an EN-EL3E battery for a D90.
It might, but for any SLI or CrossfireX, It would be best to get at least 1000w
There is a 5 year warranty on it, not as good as the Rosewill Fortress Series's 7 year warranty, but this power supply is (in my opinion) a lot more reliable and stable, not to mention cheaper. If there's any other questions please fill free to ask.
Yes
No, it is not modular.
Hello Ernesto, Be shure to mail any warranty paperwork,and go online and register product.
Any speaker cable you find locally will work.
Yes, this is the exact reason for my purchase of the cord.
Yes I bought this for my son and it works with his.
If you call them they will happily tell you which modems you can purchase that are compatible with their system. Also, be careful if you buy a second hand modem online, they are often equipment that belongs to the cable company (Comcast, Cox, Time Warner) but were never returned (by deadbeat customer who left unpaid bills and pawned the equipment), they have a record of those serial numbers and they cannot be used for another account.
My understanding is yes, however your cable or service provider may not support it. But all modems like this are compatible, they perform the same functions. I would check with your service provider first.
Yes this is apple compatible. You just connect your recording device to your computer via a usb port. Once connected the recorder shows up like any other storage device and you can drag audio files to your desktop. I have a 2007 13.5" macbook laptop.
It just quit working one day. Would not recommend it. I only had it for a few months.
You have to have active glasses with that TV
when you find a legit 9 cell please tell me where you bought it i need one bad, i got this thinking i would get way more battery life then i actually get (2 hours max)
Glasses? Maybe sunglasses. The screen is much brighter then my old laptops display; games running look beautiful. The horizontal view-range of the display is quite wide, making great for get-togethers; awesome for anything from Split/Second to Super Smash Bros. Melee (on an Emulator). Actually, just to drive the point home, I tried playing Resident Evil 5 while wearing UV400 Protection sunglasses. You can still see almost perfectly on maximum brightness, but you'll feel blinded for a sec after taking them off.
These are listed as 6 ohm. That's a compromise between 4 and 8 ohms. These should be OK with either 4 or 8 as long as you aren't pumping maximum power thru them. Keep it under 100 watts and you probably won't notice any difference.
Should be. Typically the A61u prefers to the motherboard and/or processor thats installed. You should be good to go. Screen has nothing to do with eithere motherboard or processor. Only connection. Which is the same.
Mine is that size and it worked great. Before you order send a note to the seller and ask them the same question. Good luck, Sam
I think it would work. As long as you get a decent signal. I have one I no longer use if you'd like to try widget085@aol.com
NO. Cable does not fit the slot as advertised. Any suggestions?
Hello Mohamed. This radio will fit, and function in your 2009 Toyota Sienna. You will also need an installation kit, and a wire harness to complete the installation.
it might. I looked it up first before I bought it
No it doesn't.
The cable is a male USB connector to a micro USB male connector. Their are a couple different micro connectors, I would recommend you take the speaker unit to WM, RS, BB or other brick and mortar store. That way if it plugs in you're golden.
If it only leaked a small amount it should be fine.
Unfortunately this company didn't think about the remote dying, if you have a universal remote that will work or buy a new one. Here's an online manual if you don't have one. http://tv.manualsonline.com/manuals/mfg/magnavox/tb110mw9.html?idRes=17051995
The device doesn't come on. I just don't want to talk about it. I bought a defective product.
No it wouldn't. You'd have to purchase something there.
Yes. In fact the best one I have seen so far. It can look up programs from 6-8 hrs, were most I have seen can only look up from 2-4. As long as the network your watching provides info for the show your watching, it will also tell you info as well. I don't know why some people are saying "No" because their is a button on the remote for this.
We timed it and it lasted over 3 hours and 17 minutes! Constant play of the complete movie "Titanic".
Yes. The rollers are adjustable for 7" 10" and 12" records.
Works great on my Nikon D80.
Definitely.
I have a Nikon D7000 and it works great with that camera, I believe Nikon SB speedlights are compatible with all Nikon DSLR
It's a flash not a lens but yes.
Yes.
Assuming you are looking for a desktop hard drive, you should be able to use any Serial-ATA drive that will fit in a 3.5" bay compartment. Right now, the "sweet spot" for getting the most bang for the buck is a 2TB drive - http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Barracuda-3-5-Inch-Internal-ST2000DM001/dp/B005T3GRN2/ref=sr_1_7?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1403804113&sr=1-7
I don't know if it fits the 150. i have the 570 which was also not listed but my camera said that the battery replacement was a NP-BN1 which that one is and it works fine, no problems
No HDMI .This is a nice little TV but the sound is bad. This can be taken care of by connecting external speakers.
There are pressure sensitive button areas along the bottom part of the front bezel and there is a remote control.
NOT AT ALL and I'm a female! And that's the honest truth!
New RETAIL comes in retail packing, NEW BULK in Bulk(brown box) packing , REF in bulk packing
Yes
probably not as the board is set up for the Xeon CPUs that have QPI enabled.
Try another disk, if that doesn't change then possibly your missing or damaged driver for the drive. Other possibly the drive I'd bad.
Yes
Yes, I mounted several of these upside-down on the wall outside. The mounting bracket is very suited for this. Use the "Flip" switch in the Live Video settings to correct the image.
No, it comes with a separate switch.
It will work with any system that provides power to it.
This depends on your dash. If your dash has what is called a double din, yes. The double din just means two standard radios stacked one over the other called a double din. Then purchase a install kit from metra and a wire harness to connect with your stock wires. If you don't feel comfortable installing it yourself, take it to a local shop that installs car audio.
The product relates to electrical "surge protection" and has nothing to do with video. Hope this helps.
Hi, I believe the answer to your question is, yes. You will need extra equipment (GSC 10) but it is possible. See this link. http://support.garmin.com/support/searchSupport/case.faces?caseId=%7B663fc9b0-5d1f-11df-c3d2-000000000000%7D Hope this helps you out! Garmin 310XT might be more suitable though from my readings, if you use the bike more than running.
Dolly is metal, Tripod is plastic. I would not use this tripod with 20lbs unless you add sand bags on legs. That is for photography. Not at all if your planning to dolly camera while shooting video.
All lenses are official Canon lenses.
yes it will work
Yes it definitely works with Windows XP and Vista.
Not compatible with the Senheiser IE80
The card is compatible with a regular HDMI cable, not a mini HDMI though
It will be too big on the iPad air. You can get a loose fit, you could even bulk up the case with some felt on the back but I would not put anything other than the iPad 2 inside.
Yes, I used mine with the iPad 1.
I am not sure. ... Here are the links to the drivers & HW specs. If your system is there, then yes. 1) Specs: nvidia_com/object/product-quadro-600-us_html 2) Drivers: nvidia_com/Download/index_aspx?lang=en-us&ptid=3&psid=73&pid=512 PS. Note: all "." replaced by "_" to get around AMAZON's no url blocking code. If that does not work, then go to the NVIDIA site & do a search for a QUADRO 600.
Is the GC capable of outputting DP++ (multi-mode) signals? Yes Should I use the active or passive DisplayPort to DVI Adapter? I would use the active DisplayPort .
No it does not.
It plugs into the wall like a traditional clock. It only records to the capacity of the SD card. The one that comes with it would record approx. 1 day. I found it a bit inconvenient to remove the back each day to download the video. It requires an allen wrench to open the back panel. I wanted to use it daily but the routine was too time consuming. If you are using it on a one time basis or now and then it would work well.
GDDR is just the graphics version of DDR, hence the "G" in front of the DDR. Hope this helped.
Mine came with 110V.
I don't see why not.
No. It has standard screw down connectors
Yes
Not sure what a Ipod Classic is but I used my Ipod and Iphone 4 without any problems
my sony reader stop working, i can not operate with any bottom, what i can do. thanks
I have a computer with this processor in it for nearly 5 years and the computer is nearly always on. Just a quick tip most processors will last for a considerable time if properly cooled.
I'm not sure but do NOT by this product, it is awfull the dock clip snapped off after 2 weeks of use and the speaker blew out. Save your money
I am not sure but i doubt it. I can ask my husband which ones worked with our tv which i think is a samsung if you'd like.
Highly doubtful. I believe the technology for each manufacturer is different. Plus these only work with the older, 2010 Samsung's, so not even every Samsung.
Yes, it does I have windows 7.
Yes, I have used it in XP, Win 7, and Ubuntu with no issues. It also works well with Sony and Samsung TVs and BR disk players that have a media playback feature.
Yes, I use this with a Windows 7 machine.
I used it on the 60D. Worked great but for a short time. The button on the trigger went right through. Cheap material. I would not recommend you buy this product if you are looking for something that will last.
Yes, this is the backlit with laser point wireless mini keyboard.
Not sure. It works pretty good keys are too mushy for me
6 inches by 2 inches. Easy to hold in one hand. Easy to set up. Keys are easy to press. Really great keyboard for small spaces or home theaters.
Sorry RY, Your Olympus TG will not fit. I have a Nikon AW120 and it is a very snug fit. The AW120 measures 110.1 x 66.0 x 25.5
Assuming the Blu Ray player has a wired network connection, yes.
This flash is very reliable with my A55, but I have encountered this problem once or twice. Make sure the contacts are clean on both the camera and the flash. A Q-tip (cotton swab) works very well to polish them, but be very careful, especially on the contact pins on the flash. Also, make sure your batteries are strong. If the red light comes on within seven to ten seconds of turning the flash on then they should be strong enough.
No
It would be helpfull if you told us what triggers and what camera u are using. I bought Pixel King Wireless iTTL triggers for NIkon and they do not work with my Sigma EF-530-DG-Super... so you see it is not only about the Flash...
I am not sure. I am using this flash with a D-5100
For the money...it's a very good deal. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the Canon, yet it does the job and saves you money. Of course if you want to pay...you can have a few more bells and whistles..
No, it is only a TTL Flash. Very powerful
The believe the two larger tripods each have an individual case. I have a D5100 which the tripods work well for. I'm not sure how much bigger or more advance the D5200 is but I'm sure they are good for that camera as well.
The items I received were new. You should be good.
Yes, it works on Windows 7.
Absolutely. I think it would hold an 80" it is build so well.
15 X 15 inches, weight about 2 pounds, You can install on the wall or 1 1/4 inch pipe.
Yes, you can.
I haven't used the USB but I have used a 16GB SD card with this. I usually just connect my Sandisk Sansa Clip Zip+ MP3 player to this and use it this way.
It did I Hatton upgrade it just to work probably and I'm still having issues
YES, i have a Wii U and yeah, it works with the Wii U! :D
I can not answer your question. I gave this item as a gift. But they live out in the country surrounded by mountains and have no complaints.
Yes I believe so. I used one on mine and it fit great.
I don't know for sure but it sounds reasonable. There is a lot of information and videos on the net that can help you change these cables. Also the cables are cheap so there is not much to lose if it should turn out to be the wrong cable. The power button cable has 12 leads. If it is correct that your power cable is 6 pin, then it is the wrong cable.
The camera does have wireless capability, but I have not been able to use it.
Just get in the habit of cutting it off at night or when out of the area... you'll see and feel the difference. Six or eight cutoffs with the same switch. Too bad we don't see them on the retail shelf. th
The one I received was 40 inches
Yes
I did quite a bit of research and finally purchased a horizontal sleeve for the MacBook Air 11.6" from www.rickshawbags.com. I have the black with red lining. It is beautiful, functional, and very light. Also, they produced their bags in a very environmentally conscious manner. Highly recommended.
I believe that this older model (2010) is neither a i5 or a i7. The early 2014 has the i5. One thing to consider with this older model, is the limited 2GB of RAM. This can limit the number of Apps running at a given time.
No it does not.
I don't know. I bought it for a player I had and sold it. Check out the Samsung web site. Type your model of player in on the site and see what remotes will work. Or call Samsung customer service and ask them.
It is about 4"
i didn't have a measuring tape, but its about 3.5 inches 4 at the most. Its shorter than a regular writing pen.
if the Targus monopod has a standard 1/4''-20 camera mount on top this Ball Head will NOT attach directly to the Targus unless you also buy or make a 3/8"-16 adapter. (look up: 1/4" to 3/8" Camera Convert Screw Adapter for Tripod Monopod) this is a fairly large ball mount. the bottom portion of this ball mount is about 2" in diameter and has a good size top plate as well (note: the one i have is actually a bit different than the one shown in this picture. the top plate on mine is larger than this one)
No, Martin, I wouldn't chance it.
Yes this was for my iPod Touch not the phone... if you are considering purchasing this, I would get a darker color!! :)
You could but frist you need youtube doneloder then you have to convert the song to mp4 then you donelode it it works
No it does not ! This was very cheap material, you get what you pay for I guess !
no they didnt. Pllus it quit working
The binders are empty for you to fill as you wish.
I was able to clone a complete drive with os on it...............
If you insert a 2-1/2" or 3-1/2" "doner" IDE drive (drive containing data) in the FRONT bay, and a blank 2-1/2" or 3-1/2" SATA drive in the REAR bay, you can transfer the data from the IDE doner drive to the blank SATA drive by simply pressing the RED BUTTON to begin the transfer process. This may be done WITHOUT connection to a computer, with just the AC power supply connected.
I have a Pioneer Elite receiver and used these for rear surround sound and they work great. Thinking about buying a full 5 speaker set for my home theater room.
No, everything is driven off buttons (up down enter and menu). The interface is really simple so the buttons are ok, but a touch screen would have been nice (but it probably would have increased the price).
Yes mine arrived without headphones and remote control as well. I contacted amazon customer service. They gave me the option of returning the product for full refund / replacement or a partial refund because the unit is still functional without the accessories.
No it does not.
No, it cann't be used as an external monitor because this device doesn't have a video input.
This unit does not have a (mechanical) hard drive. It comes with 4GB of solid state memory used by its built-in software and the customer's own recordings, i.e. music, video, FM recordings, etc. There is also an SD card slot for more storage.
It is adjustable, mine is currently 48" (camera about naval height). It can be lowered or raised ~+-4" from there. It's been a great and comfortable strap.
Yes, it comes with a latch gate and it's very secure.
It accepts a USB charger, so it should work. I use it for mp3 players I have, of which one is a Apple Nano, a shuffle and an iTouch. hope that helps. I like this one, because it is built sturdy and it has a swivel feature, so you can plug it in upside down if you have another cord in the same outlet
It works for 4th generation. My son uses it for his.
Yes. Perfectly.
It works with the older iPods that have the wide connector.
hell no
Yes
The only thing that fits in a microSD card slot is a microSD card. You would need some type of futuristic shrinking ray to shrink an SD card to a size that would fit in a microSD slot.
The closest I could find on the benchmark site I use most often shows a Radeon HD 5750 benchmarks at 1394 and the HD 6850 almost 1K higher rated at 2237 and every thing else should be fine with your PC. There are *always* faster, more expensive cards; but I am pleased with my two purchases!
At least 500W
the wattage should be fine but you also need supplemental power plugged directly into this card from the psu.
I use them for multi stage hides. The chirp would be programmed either with a clue to the next stage or for the final cache locations coordinates.
no sirve vino mala. que irresponsabilidad vender algo malo
Should have a clamp on each leg to loosen and extend
Don't remember it being brand specific. It has an adapter that screws into the bottom of camera (if camera has a threaded hole).
I have this as the center and the M8's as left and right and they sound awesome!
No
Sorry, I do not know
I do not know, we just picked this because it was what was already in his laptop.
MANUFACTURER REPLY: In a word, yes. OS X 10.6 and later is supported. In case of issues, just email support@plugable.com and we'll be happy to help! Best wishes- Jeff Everett Plugable Technologies
it works perfect with air~ :-)
There are two ways to charge up your battery pack. One way (slower) is to use a USB cable from your computer to the battery pack (computer has to be on). The best way is to get s USB to Mini cable and an AC adapter that plugs into an outlet and has a USB opening. Listen if you go to Amazon.com lookup the Battery Pack you will see "other items purchased" that adapter I mentioned will be listed. Good luck
From what I've experienced, it barely recharged my Samsung Stratosphere and Galaxy Note 3. it would get both up to about 75 percent. Not sure about the IPhone 5. But there is a plug in on the charger for Apple products. The Galaxy S4 shouldn't be a problem. However like I said previously I only seem to get a 75% charge on either of those phones and they are Samsung products. Hope this helps.
Yes, the volume control works very well.
Yes, the HC stands for high capacity and should be compatibly with your device as long as your device can take an 8 GB microSD card.
This is massive! Definitely not made for speedlites! I use it on mono light strobes.
I definitely had better had better luck mounting to the lens first then to he camera. I think it works grat and am highly satisfied.
The stand does swivel against the table, but I can't imagine how it would damage the table itself. My 70" Sharp Elite weighs 105 pounds and the swiveling action does no damage to my table. Your 46" is likely an edge lit and weighs far less than mine.
The sticker on the bottom says 32" at 60lbs. I use it with a 46" at 90lbs, and it seems perfectly stable. Obviously, use at your own risk above the 32" 60lbs marked limit.
31.5 inches X 16 inches
Tried many times to download in microsoft windows.Would not completely download.said there was a error in program. But... works in audacity. But the, re is a small delay when using a guitar or microphone.
I don't see why not the kit isn't camera specific.the spray bottle comes empty so you can put whatever solution you want in it.and the brushes are very soft.I feel you wouldn't have any issues using it on you lens.
yes it does have fun
Yes, it will fit in... I am also using Dell Latitude 10 tablet.
It should work on with any adapter as long the size and shape fits .. most probably yes !! because I'm using it with my laptop charger and it is working well !
I have used it with EyeFi cards successfully and under fairly high volume. I use the adapter card in both my Canon 40D and Canon 5D Mii. It is a good idea period since the SD cards are easier and cheaper and more people have them in their cameras.
This bracket will work with any flash, if it's the bracket you're talking about. If it's the 28" beauty dish that is pictured on this page, then this particular dish will work w/ Bowens lights.
Yes. Mine came with a sock covering to help diffuse the light
Yes as long as the headphones are a legit product from monstercables. A lot of phonies out there. You can register your headphones with monster using the serial number. You shouldnt have to worry about buying some counterfeit headphones from amazon. They are a supporter of monstercable
It should work fine, as for Wild Tangent games, you should be fine too, not sure if it has 3D acceleration though.
Yes
Dimensions: 15" depth (front to back), 14 1/2" width (side to side), 5 1/4" height closed (shelf to top of lid), 16" height fully opened (estimated about 70 degrees angle- locking bracket holds opened lid in position at this height).
Hello Eric, let me tell you what we did...we fixed the camera to a limb to watch the hawk eggs hatch/mature/leave nest. We attached a "model airplane" remote signal to send the picture to a monitor some 50' away and added a recorder to the monitor....short answer yes. Is there a better way to do it...probably. Was it worth it... Amazing! Have fun...
Not sure if I understand the first question, if you mean can anyone notice it...no, not as long as it's it the box. It has a great picture day or night. Yes, the TV you connect it to has to be turned on to see what the camera's pointed to! You could connect it to some kind of recorder to watch it later. The TV wouldn't have to be on for this.
would know not what I do is trial and error to say, leave it running for a while and turn off and turn on from time to time to see if I no problems ...
is for a laptop and you don;t need any thing else
Re: Case for Nikon D7000 Thanks alot. After your post I ordered a case for my D7000. It arrived yesterday and it fits perfectly. Bill
No, I don't think so. Does not have room for any accessories. Snug fit and feels very secure for camera only. I have a bigger case for camera and accessories and use the smaller bag when travelling.
I use mine while it is charging. Never left it on all night, but have used it while plugged in.
Yes
It's possible just if you have the same jack plugs in, like a phones jack. I use in my celular or MP3.
The box says "D800/D700/D300series/D2000/D4/D3series/D2series/D1series/M90s/F100/F90/F90X/F6/F5". I'm assuming YES.
Yes It does work on canon T3i . I have the same remote control and T3i camera. It works properly without any problems as well as on canon 7D. All u need for T3i is an adaptor N3 that will fit to ur camera
I have the 7D, but it sounds like you may be setting your DRIVE mode to either 2 or 10 second self-timer... I know it has the remote icon next to it, but it doesn't need to be set on those to utilize a WIRED remote. (you only need to put it on that mode to activate the wireless remote functionality) You can set the DRIVE to single shot, continuous shot, high quality multiple shot, (and silent versions) 2, or 10 seconds from that option. Try the continuous shot, with the remote plugged in, and it'll work.
I have a Canon SX50HS and it works great. I highly recommend it. You can't go wrong with this!
Yes. It will work with T3i/600D.
I couldn't make this work with my Canon powershot SX50HS, so I ended up with a Vivitar remote trigger that works fine and has cables to fit any camera.
The cord, from connecter to unit, is 39.5 inches.
It should. I am using this remote with the FZ150 and both the FZ1000 and the FZ150 can both use the Panasonic DMW-RSL1 remote shutter so they should work with this as well.
Yes, it works fine.
Yes it will.
Yes, it should be compatible with all Sceptre tv's.
Solid is what is needed to terminate network cable onto jacks and patch panels. We have never used stranded network wire in over 20 years of installs. We do use stranded for speaker, alarm, cctv, access control where we are screwing wires down to terminals or using wire nuts. You will use solid for all structured cabling in commercial or home applications
I would search for an outdoor rated wire. I wouldnt consider this to be an outdoor cable unless you are running it in a conduit. For your POE question that is better answered by your power source then factor in the frequency of the cable. Here is a calculator to help. http://beyond-wifi.com/poe/poe-calc.html
Yes this will work fine but you need to make sure your switch has PoE ports or it won't matter what cable you use.
Absolutely. Just checked my FZ70 to make sure, proud user.
Panasonic's website lists the DMW-BMB9PP for the FZ60. You can verify that by visiting: shop.panasonic.com
Yes. The optical output of the Pure i-20 is a digital stream that can be an input to an external DAC or a DAC built in to an amplifier or receiver.
Yes, it should work on any PC. Before you purchase the product, make sure the computer that you are planning to install it on has a PCI Express 2.0 slot. Also, make sure that the computer has enough wattage to power on the graphics card. As in most regular computers that you purchase from the store, they usually have just enough wattage to power the system. Make sure that your computer has a 350 watt or greater power supply with a minimum of 18 amps on the +12 volt rail. That's another thing to be aware of.
4cs0.001.03 should be the number of the battery, I just know this cable fits the TomTom go live 2535, 2505 or 1505
I have only used the Garmin batt pack with my 800, so I can not comment on the nuvi. Best place for an answer would likely be Garmin Customer Support. Graham
Yes it will. The soundbar receives all universal ir remote signals. Just remember if you pair that remote with the soundbar you will get a signal on your tv when you adjust the soundbar volume.
There are 4 small screw in one side. These camera are great and no one has ever suspected they are not "real". Only problem I had was the screws do tend to strip very easy.
it has a padded strap to carry over the shoulder or across the shoulder/neck but nothing for both arms
Match your lens size to the lens size of the fish eye.
I would say the SQ is about 6/10. Higher than I expected for its price range.
Takes about a second to switch sources. picture goes out then comes back. No blur or fade really.
No, it does not take a whole day, a pretty short time actually. I have never timed it exactly but what Richard Pham said sounds right.
Firmware is the operating system that runs your camera. You can find your version by going to menu &gt; setup &gt; Version Disp. It should be Version 1.1. I have tested this battery on Version 1.1 and it works just fine.
No!
Don't know but not for S3
The LED on my charger is red when charging and turns green when the battery is fully charged.
I'm sure it will we plug it in the pickup with the adapter
I have a NEX 6 and these batteries work great, show % remaining onscreen. Easy to charge. Not much difference in the capacity that I can see, vs Sony.
I have one in my hands now, and at least it states on its label "Li-Ion battery" . When charging and using it behaves like one Lithium - Ion Battery, but I am not really an expert, so I did not measure it with a multi test like some others did.
The light turns green when full and blinks orange when charging
Mine were 1600mAh. They definitely are better then the ones my 5 uniden phone came with new!
You'll need this and a 30 pin to lightning adapter, only the apple branded products will work for that, all Chinese knock offs don't Work, and gm doesn't make this adapter with a lightning connector so you have to buy both
Harry: the sensor in the 645D is not 4.5x6 cm but rather approximately the size of two full frame sensor stacked on top of each other. Actually the 55mm lens is not "normal" in the sense that 50mm lens is normal on 35mm film camera, but rather about a 35-40mm equivalent in 35mm terms.
Yes
I don't think so. I know you can add an external speaker, which I did. It really helps hear the radio over the engine and wind noise.
I don't think so. There is not a port to attach to anything. It just has a knob to adjust the speed
as long as the contacts are kept dry
As long add the small part is on the screen part, I don't see why not. It had an adhesive backing.
They appear to be alright with a spot but I am only using them with bright LED spots. Sorry. I don't mind testing it out though.
you could fit something like 10 to 15 of them in, if you are talking about the drive bays.
I cannot open mine up right now--you might want to contact Rosewill.
Nobody misled anybody. No, it is not USB 3.0...now quit being a paranoid.
All metal/aluminum construction... We are using it and it has been very good.
I load my bag fairly full, and NEVER had the strap release. It has metal clasps, which is why I bought it because my other bag had plastic ones and it could not handle the weight. I put a laptop, and iPad as well as paperwork and extra stuff. I love my bag!
I think it holds up well, but don't lift it by the telescopic handle.
Chevy Malibu 09
Depending on the product it should be fine. Its 720p and lighting would be a factor as audio may be as well.
i dont now
I hace two but you can only use One not two simultaneously
The lens adapter required for the FZ200 is, I believe, called the LA7. Please double check before buying.
I had a Panasonic Lumix FZ150 until recently and I used the DMW-LA5 lens adapter on it. The end that attaches to the camera is 52mm (which is the filter size of the FZ150). The other end of the adapter is 55mm and it accepts 55mm filters. The adapter is needed if you want to use a Panasonic Lumix Close Up Lens DMW-LC55 (which is 55mm).
Yes. It is compatible with iPhone 4.
I cannot answer regarding a drawing tablet. I use the cable out-of-doors to run all my USB astrophotography equipment to my laptop. I have had no problems. This includes freezing cold, humid, and frost conditions.
MANUFACTURER ANSWER: Thanks for asking! This configuration should work fine. If you have any more questions, please contact us at support@plugable.com. Thanks!
I use this cover with a Nikon D7000 so I would think the Fuji would fit easily. However, I don't know whether the Fuji would fit with the zoom lens fully extended.
I did the same for my son and its fantastic as well as their customer service
Yes you can. It has an integrated video card with 2 VGA outs and a second video card by msi with HDMI, DVI, and VGA.
Microtel does not ship outside the United States
I honestly have no idea. I would get with the manufacturer and give them your computer's serial number and ask for one. Sorry.
The foam is pre segmented into 1/2 inch squares you just remove what you want to fit your component.
When there is decent lighting the image is great....this is not a night time or low light camera....there is a low light version but it has a narrower field of view..... I have 3mp hikvisions and dahuas, this is not as good, but still works well considering that it has built in mic and speaker....
GXV-3611_HD - This should do the trick. Media Depot
It's not wireless. But you can port forward over Ethernet.
The NWZ-E374 model is smaller than the e450-e460 series, I do not recommend it because it will be very big in player.
This battery is a replacement for several models including the pv-bp17. So yes you can use it.
This IS NOT compatible with Windows 8. After spending time with Tech Support, they had no clue when it would be compatible.
Any carrier that uses SIM cards will work, you just will not get 3G because it does not support there frequency. Look for something that has 1700Mhz UMTS support.
Yes sometimes, but just when it is first turned on. Not that much of a problem. Still love the adapter. Saves a lot on batteries.
I would say that it's definitely an asset along with a gaming mouse. It has loads of customization and with a game like Guild Wars, there are a lot of buttons and hot keys that need to be mapped- so it would be perfect for him.
That depends on what you are looking for. I bought this to carry a light small Asus laptop, and just a book. For me, it's small and practical, I can carry everything I want without a hassle. I even carry a light sweater in it! If you want something small and practical, this is for you. If you want to carry a lot of stuff, then this might be just too small.
no
It is around 52 x 36 x 16 centimeters. It is enough for laptop & one huge book (like my medicine book) ;) I realy like it, looks good.
It is a bare drive.
No
It can be pointed from any direction
Works with a 7d. Will last about 6-9 months and then leave you in trouble. They just die. No warning no decrease in battery meter. Just dead in the middle of a shoot.
I use this battery in my 70D and it does communicate with the camera just like the original battery. They last a lot longer than the originals do.
as long as the hard drive is SATA. No cables to buy
Don't know... never counted them. Suggest you contact Rosewill.
Yes it does :) I purchased not too long ago and did not have any problems using it with windows 7!
comes with cable for canon cameras and a adaptor for sony D cameras
I used this backdrop last year for a Christmas party/portrait shoot. I was really impressed not only with how the backdrop looked, but also the size was great for family/small group shots.
It can but its clumsy because it requires you to install a print client on the client PC(as opposed to just an O/S printer with a device driver). It can be used as a bridge. I put DD-WRT on mine and found it to 1000% more stable than the junk Belkin O/S. I never have to reboot this router with DD-WRT on it. Its slick. Good luck.
I have no idea what the power is in sri lanka but the power supply for the turntable is 110 volts, hope that helps.
In the United States 60.
6.25" inside width. 6" total height. 4" depth of front slot and 5" depth of back. Holds 4 remotes comfortably. I use it by the bed to hold 2 remotes plus my eyeglasses and a notepad. I have 1 by the tv for 3 remotes plus spare eyeglasses. I like mine - doesn't tip over.
Hi Andrew. I think you have to use one specifically for the xbox 360 at this Amazon address/url: http://www.amazon.com/Xbox-360-Wireless-Network-Adapter-Networks/dp/B000B6MLV4
Absolutely ! even an under water conversation very small works well.
you can go to hbo.com and install it from there or google it and the first site should have it.
Hi, apparently there are no ebook reader apps on this Sony Internet TV. -Ely
I've got an iPhone 5 in an Otterbox Commuter case, and it fits. I have to put my iPhone 5 in a slightly different way than I did when I had an iPhone 4 b/c of the position of the volume buttons. However, overall, I'm still happy with it and use it every time I go biking. FYI, the Otterbox Commuter is a slimmer case than some other Otterboxes, so I would use caution.
Reception in general on mine is lousy! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.
I got Monster Cable Clear Jacket - for about $30 a pair sold through Crutchfield on the Amazon site. Are they the best - best can run into a $1000. So no, they are not the best, but spending more than I did would be overkill IMHO Are they better than what came with the set? Yes. And they were in my view at the right price point for the Onkyo&gt;
I don't know that Laptop model. All your RAM should be of the same brand for best results. As to if this RAM is compatible, like I said, I don't know your Laptop model. Look over the specs: match the manufacturer, speed, and footprint for best results.
This radio is designed for US amateur bands. I am sure they have a European version, probably with a name like VX-3e. Buy from Amazon in Europe.
It has worked well for me. No problems even in Italy, using the extra prong-thing to adapt to their outlets.
Yes, it does. We have two, one is hooked up to our very old T.V. and works just fine with the red, yellow and green connections. The other uses the HDMI on a newer T.V. and that works just fine, too.
It should. It's a 30-pin connector.
yes and no it will hook up to it will it amplify the sound no the one I got does not amplify the volume one bit.
I've tried this on an iPad 2 and it works great. In my opinion, no different to the built in headphone socket, but useful if this is bust!
Yes. It should work with just about any Thinkpad outside of the X1 Carbon (which uses a smaller rectangular power connector due to its thinness). I've used these with X60, X201, X220 and X230 tablets. I've used them with Thinkpad Edge E545's, E540's, the X100e, even the Thinkpad Twist. This should work with the E420 without issue.
IDK
This card is PCI express so as long as you have a slot open it should work on almost all manufacturer's PCs. The box included a drivers disk and setup took all of about 5 minutes to complete.
Good case. It perfectly fits to my camera.
Works perfect with my Gateway MA3
The Inspiron 1545 is a laptop and the 545S is a desktop. So this keyboard would not work as a replacement.
Yes it is .Easy to install so far great.
I purchased this specific to my brand and model number of my laptop. I don't know if it would be compatible with anything else.
Sorry, I'm not familiar with the FE-370.
Just tested: works great on Ubuntu 11.10. Plugged in and was automatically detected and recognized. Estimated 144Mb/s connection.
I honestly don't know. You may wan't to contact the seller.
Hope this helps. Try contacting LAPTOP MATE directly as they confirmed for me which adapter was compatible with my system.
Once it is mounted it is not adjustable in height. Side to side and pull out. The height is fixed when secured in place on wall.
All ports stayed accessible on my tv. It's a samsung
It has the red and black wires to connect the speakers. ..
Is this compatible with 4th generation I Pod??
Yes, the charger works but not the lightning cord that came with it. The lightning cord works with the iPhone 5, 5c, and 5s.
Yes
I don't see why not, although it may be a bit of an overkill and I don't have a mini to try it with. The top cutout is 5", so it looks like it should just fit on its width.
Yes. That's what I purchased it for and that's what I use. I have an LG TV 40" and when you plug it into the hdmi it actually fills the entire screen on my TV! It works great & is worth the money. For a kindle fire like I have, be sure to get the micro hdmi/hdmi. A lot of others bought the mini hdmi & that isn't compatible. I hope this helps you!
Is there any chance that your hdmi connecting point is intermittently loose or not plugged in securely? It's just a cable. If the connection points are secure the problem is probably elsewhere like with whoever is providing service to you... Satelite/cable co signal instability?? Power surge? On the remote chance the cable itself is frayed or broken internally you could buy a second cable. If the problem still shows up it rules out the cable itself but not the signal, connecting points etc.
Yes the active area is 12x9, a 1-1 ratio on my dell laptop where I do all my work. I reccomend this so hard, love my monoprice ! :'D
This mounts directly to a three gang box. No other bracket is needed.
No this one did not, but I purchased a separate bag raincoat from REI which works great.
Depends on the overall dimensions of the camcorder. It fits my Nikon D40X with telephoto lens just fine with room to spare along the side of the lens. That's with four separate velcro partitions holding my other lenses and the charger with cord. If you take the velcro partitions out of the bag, it should fit most any camcorder, even an old Beta. ;)
I think you want the mini. I have one and it fits by iPhone 5 or my iPhone 3GS. http://www.amazon.com/Aquapac-Waterproof-Case-iPhone-Droid/dp/B001G5A4JA/
No
I use it everynight as an eyemask
You will want to get a standard Micro USB cable (USB A Male to Micro B Male). Something like this: http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-USB-Cable-Micro-Meters/dp/B003ES5ZSW/ However, this is probably unnecessary since the drive will come with a cable that will work. You can use a USB 3 cable on a USB 2 port.
You should. Plug in the HDTV, boot the MacBook, then close the lid and it should push the display to the external connected display, which is your HDTV.
After I made my purchase I got a message from the dealer saying they stand by their products. I would contact them right away. I'm sure they do right by you.
Hi, this is not an active cable. But you could find Active Mini DisplayPort to DVI Male to Female Adapter from below link, thanks. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EDSZYII
The second one worked for me but the first one was defective. I waited too long to return mine so I had to cover shipping but they probably replaced it with a new one at no charge.
This worked for me. My monitor has a DVI out on the back and my Macbook has a thunderbolt slot. It is exactly what I got it for.
Not sure as I don't know the connectors for ps3 but if it can accept an HDMI signal then the chances are pretty good.
The small end will plug into a macbook pro., but if your monitor does not support displayport, you may have to get a cable with a dvi connector at the other end
the connector is about 3\8" and the cord is at about 1\4". they are very flexible cables also.
I don't know what you mean by a drop camera, but it should work in most installations.
It's very big as far as housings go. Inside is a sliding track that you mount your camera to and uses up about 1/2 inch of space the lenth of the housing. There is an screw that also runs the lenth of the housing for the lid and takes up 1/4 inch. Interrior dimentions 4 3/4 inchs width, 9 3/4 inchs lenth, 3 3/4 inchs highth.
Yes

Don't buy it - mine quit after I had it for less than a week - not the actual samsung product.
Hi, Conrad! I have Samsung Galaxy 7". This adapter work with it. About 7.7" I do't know? But I think it will work. Sincerely
Cut off ends (thefurthest leaving plenty of excess wire) of tweeters baring the wires and do the same on the factory installation wires...connect. Cover w/black electrician tape if you don't solder.
It will allow you to connect them but only the Video Signal will be sent to the TV. The audio will have to be sent out from the computer separately (the headset output) to the TV or other audio system to play the sound.
Not sure, but I remember settings in Amazon (not using HBO go) need to be set at stereo, not surround. Try that.
I used it for volume because my tv was too old when i connected my appletv to that tv. Im not really sure if its for channels
I experienced the same thing; never got it to work, so I returned it.
No all cell phones are blocked by law.
I don't have a clue..SORRY
I have three moniters one in livingroom familyroom and bedroom. its easy to set up. If I can do it anyone can.Just follow directions in the box. I love mine and don't know what I would do without it.
Any purchase for $10 and up - FREE SHIPPING
I don't think so because it doesn't work with sansung.
Yes. It should work. The 30pin connector didn't change until Apple made the lightning connector in the iPhone 5.
Do not know
Yes, it has an on/off switch and it turns the power off to all outlets.
Hello Daisy. All Belkin Surge Protectors are UL (Underwriters Laboratories) tested.
No it is not a sat radio ready unit.
Is this compatible with 2005 Honda Civic?
Had to buy speaker box's for them to work.
I mount it on my door soorry
Yes.
Yes it is. The pole would go through one of the pant leg and then you would re-adjust the form into the pole. It's easy and works great. I use it for eBay pictures.
Then this one should be the perfect fit, this dress form fits an average size 2-4, please check the listing for the exact measurements.
Yes it is. Your motherboard supports the 1600 DDR3 speed and that's all you need. Your processor doesn't matter but your motherboard matters, in order to determine if RAM is compatible with your system.
I could not get the device to read from an SD card. It would continuously tell me the files were the incorrect format. I tried multiple formats to no avail.
I could not get it to work with my I phone. The USB port did not work. I sent it back. Great idea, great dissapointment .
Yes. If you are hooking the unit to the rear speakers, if you fade to the front you will lose signal.
KEF is a British company with distributors in the US and other countries. I don't know where the speakers are built, but I would guess the UK.
the dimensions of the side to side space between tiers is: 31"width x 17"depth x 7"height. Hope this helps!
Absolutely
I have Century Link DSL, but just the "standard", not the VDSL. Works fine, one of the few that really are just plug and play.
Yes. This camera has a great microphone.
Mine was silver
110V 60Hz
Yes! That's exactly what I bought it for and it works perfectly
Should work
Hi Margriet, SavingsZone offers free shipping.
David...the bracket just screws down to your mounting surface with 3 screws or bolts. Then squeeze the 2 cogged mounting buttons on the bracket together and slip the display head over the buttons. You can then adjust the tilt in the display head by sqeezing the buttons again at the same time and rotate the display head where you want it. Hope this helps.
I've posted a picture of the jack on the Amazon product sheet for you.
No u cannot.
The wattage rating of this amplifier at 4 OHMs is 250 watts. At 2 OHMs it is 400 watts. And at 1 OHM it is 500 watts. These are the RMS wattage ratings. This amplifier is also CEH compliant and rated at normal car voltage 13.6 volts
The Onboard communicator is a hard-wired Ethernet connection, it requires an internet connection. The GSM module provides for a cellular uplink to the monitoring company and does not require anything additional. Keep in mind that monitoring companies charge an additional fee per month to cover the cellular cost.
This item didn't come with a microphone. Its a great item but if you want to use it for audio/ media or the one with a mic. This item is only for music, it wouldn't pair my phone properly for this use.
They should, they work great with my iphone 5
Try checking out Samsung's SBH600. I have been using mine for the last 6 months. On the ear, a little weighty, but it did the trick. If you have large ears, it may not be comfortable. I like to listen to my music while I'm working, so I've been using them an average of 8 hours per session. Sound is awesome, syncing to my mac at work, Android phone and my old iPhone 3g (used it with the iPod on it) was practically seamless.
I have a probook and it works well with mine
Tony, slide the top cover off. It is under it. Put in your batteries, and re-insert the top cover into place so no inclement weather can get into it.
The batteries make the light glow = which makes it look very, very real. My batteries only lasted 3 months at a time, so I had to get out the stepladder and do some reaching to keep changing them. That was annoying, but it looks just like the real ones if someone is looking over your wall or from a small distance. Use the batteries, keep that red glow going, that is a good feature.
Yes you can connect to any power point in your home ( hope your house is a normal size house) and get internet at good speed. I have not tried extension cord (I guess that should work too)
The keyboard did not fit our Galaxy 3 - 7" tablet. Only way it would work is by running a cord between them. The tablets port and keyboard port are different.
yes it does.
yes
There are small pockets on the outside and inside of the cover which if used would limit the inside depth capacity if filled. Inside will hold a couple AA batteries, outside not much of anything not flat, kind of useless. Depth dimension would vary also as to how tightly the camera would fill the other dimensions. Maximum depth for camera storage without working at getting camera in and out looks like 1 1/2 inches. My PowerShot A1200 has plenty of spare room with batteries in the inside pocket.
Not sure either, the Canon G15 fits just snug enough to avoid a lot of sloshing about in the soft case. There is a nylon mesh pocket inside which could hold batteries I guess, but, I wouldn't do it because of having something hard pressing against the camera. Sort of defeats the idea of soft padded camera protection. There is also a small exterior pocket which is only big enough for a sd card or microfiber cloth.
Shouldn't be a problem with a Verizon tablet.
Yes. PCI express 2.0 cards have backwards compatibility with 1.0 as far as I know.
Hi this is audio pro It will works if you have comand us . command EU radio with full text must have CD changer. Also non text radio is audio 20 or audio 50 also you may need to programmed radio or take to professionals installers for fiber optics audio system
From loop to loop as arrived approx. 32 inches..it can be extended slightly longer
I have used these on old Nikon FE cameras which are quite heavy. It works well. It D90 is lighter than old Nikon FEs then it should work.
it should work on anything that has the slots for a strap. I folded the straps back on them selves to get it to stay exactly where I wanted it. no problems in the many months I've owned it.
The strap width on the cowboy studio lanyard is 3/8" or 9mm wide. I don't know how wide the eyelet is on the Monarch binoculars. You need to measure that and see if it is at least 3/8" wide (or 9mm to 10mm wide). I looked up the Monarch Binoculars and the eyelet looked like it would fit, but I cant be sure without measuring it. Hope this helps.
20211 is the black original product, and 60211 is the white marine product.
2 Amps, although that is barely adequate in my opinion. I have two Seagate NAS drives and both power supplies have failed. I would recommend a 2.5 or 3 amp 12-volt power supply (such as for a network switch) assuming you can find one with the correct coaxial power connector.
Input says 100-240V. 1.5A 50/60 Hz. Output says 12V. 2A Hope this helps. I just read it off the back of the charger.
3" long, 2" wide at widest point, 1.25" tall. After a couple of months of almost daily use mine is still on the first battery and working well.
Can't give you specific but it did not add to my bill
The kit has an adaptor ring that screws into the lens of the sx40. If you look into your lens you can see the threads. The adaptor ring is metal as well. Then the filters and lens mounts to the adaptor ring. Nice. Jeff
I'm not sure when i get home from work i will check for you.
It's been a while since I bought the kit. I'd like to suggest that you should contact the merchant. I think you will get the best answer from the merchant.
I couldn't get it to fit. Moreover, I'm actually sorry I bought them, so even if they did fit, I wouldn't bother.
I purchased these for a lady in a nursing home to use with her tv. I'm so sorry, but I don't know how they would do with music. They do great with the tv.
I use an E383 and the width is fine but the silicone pouch is about 1/4" longer than the player. It's not really a problem though.
it's really easy to switch over music. I made a file on the computer and took off most of the music and added more. you can keep all the music and add more. there is a spot for a mini card if you want to add lots of other music.
Don't waste your money. It broke after only used a couple times. Discover Kids would not help.
Unfortunately, the Nikon D3100 is not listed as one of the compatible cameras. Through research it looks like the D3100 requires a DC2 connection. We have another timer remote for Nikon with this connection and according to some reviews it will work with the D3100. We hope this helps! http://www.amazon.com/Pixel-TW-282-DC2-Wireless-Control/dp/B004DR3GSO/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top
Standard 110volt wall plug for U.S.
Yes, it plays MP3 CDs
I don't have any experience with the SONY DSC-RX10.Go to the METZ website. They have a updated list of all cameras that is compatible with the METZ 58 AF-2 Digital flash.
There are not specific power requirement for this cards. I have installed about 20 of these in different case with different power supplies and they all work just fine.
Power adapter comes with several PC power plugs for different size receptacles for different models.
My son soaid the classic couldn't go on it. I recall there were some adapters in the box for the dock so I don't know if he tried those. Using my iphone on it I can control the tracks either with the unit's own remote or if I'm using bluetooth, there is a free Soundfreaq app which lets you control tracks on the Soundfreaq through the I phone.
yes it does works comfortably with 240 volts been using it for almost 2 years.
The jambox comes with a cable and audio jack that you can plug into devices that you don't want to use on Bluetooth.
Yes, an auxiliary wire is included and I use it most of the time to maximize battery life.
Jambox requires blue tooth for wireless connection (1st generation ipods do not have that feature). It does have a 1/8" headphone jack and cable that can pug into 1st generation ipod's earphone jack
yes an it works good. we hooked ours to cell phones for a cheap conference system.
The daisy chain only works if the first link in the chain is the microphone with the usb cable. The other mics plug into that first one
Well, before answering, let me say that this blu-ray is one of the worst pieces of technology that I have ever purchased. However, it will probably connect and work with your desktop monitor but not with your laptop. A laptop's HDMI pushes signal out. It does not receive. A desktop's HDMI receives, it does not push out. I am not 100% sure but that is what I suspect.
Yes, it has one hdmi port. Although this is not part of your question, it also "promises" wireless connectivity which it never achieved. It was a very disappointing device and if I were you, I would not buy it. As a plain-vanilla blue ray dvd player, it is ok but not great.
Yes, you're on the right path. When purchasing RAM you need the same type that comes within your laptop or Desktop. Brand name is your choice. Memory: PC3-8500/10600 DDR3 SODIMM 204-Pin memory Maximum Memory: 8GB Slots: 2
I don't know I have an 08 Sebring. It's probably worth a shot. Same manufacturer same year.
Didnt fit my 13 ram truck. Threads wrong
Just stills.
Yes it will. Your model is included in the description of the item.
No, your phone already comes with a driver that automatically instills to your computer when you plug in your phone.
No, It is not fully automatic. You have to set it at what brightness you need. Other than that , it an excellent flask.
I use a 17inch MACBook Pro with it and it works fine, just a little hard to sight in smaller celestial bodies, but fantastic for the moon.
I have a 2010 335i and that sometimes happens with mine but for the most it dosen't charge
What year and maker for your vehicle? You might need lightning connector/converter for lightning vs the 30 pins connector
Yes it will fit if you have an adapter.
it fits 2.1mm by 5.5mm plugs and I'm using it to power 4 Swann security cameras with no problems
I would think so, the Chromo 7-inch tablet only has the micro usb port for charging. And i plug my key board there and it works fine.
No the i7 2600 is not unlocked. the i7 2600k is unlocked that is the only difference between the two processors.
That depends on what you are using the computer for and your budget. I used this with AMD Radeon 6700 series graphics mainly for HD video playback and that worked without any issue. I also had a requirement that the graphics card is single slot, which means I would not be able to use any of the high-end units. But then, I saved some money.
What do mean by volume? I use them to split signal from my preamp to two separate power amp. This way I can use one preamp with two power amp so I can by-amp my AR9 speakers. One amp drives the upper range speakers and the other amp drives only the woofers in them. This cable works perfect for me no problems so far, very well built cable for the price.
I have both a nex6 and a7r. These batteries work great for both cameras. They're rated at 1500mAh vs sony's own 1080mAh so in theory they should last longer. I've not done any tests to really confirm this, but at the very least, these batteries seem to work just as well as Sony's.
Made in China
as far as I know it will work with the FZ18 - be sure to get the cord plugged in correctly (camera vs unit in the hot shoe). it fits both ways but only works one way
Yes, I have a both a 5D Mk3 and a 7D, and this model works fine on both. It's a Canon-standard shutter release cord that comes with this remote, it should work just fine on any Canon DSLR, but I can specifically confirm it for both of these models.
A RCA to 1/8 inch cable provided your speakers are powered.
I doubt it. My M2 is mounted to a Dishnet satellite to reach 800-900Meter in a residential neighbourhood with multiple wifi noise. Without the Dishnet I couldn't lock onto the wifi at the other end. Best advise is for you to call Ubquiti. They'll help you out with a soliton to your situation. There's a antenna selection simulation on their site that be helpful.
There is no minimum height requirement, but I would say the higher the better. That said, the one I put in my living room is only about 2 feet from the floor and it works perfectly.
You should contact Ubiquiti directly. They're very helpful. Also, try their simulation to see if it will work for your environment.
Looking at the documentation, it does support PPPoE and the GUI looks decent. As for supporting a 255.255.0.0 subnet, it looks like it will but I have never tried it. http://dl.ubnt.com/guides/AirRouter/AirRouter_User_Guide.pdf
Send in for a new one...really! Or you could try to fix it by buying new boards; it is not the back light or power supply.
Press Source led to change to USB or radio or cd, press again to next source.
I don't see why it won't as long as you get the correct mounting kit. To my knowledge radios themselves are fairly universal. The mounting kits are the pieces that you need to fit into a specific model, or make, of a car.
They should have a metal hanger hole on rear.
No. Just the ear molds.
It is flexible rubber. They are a bit stiff when brand new, but soften up pretty fast and are very flexible.
Yes. That's the point of this kind of mold. Other sounds flow around it without issue.
Yes it will act as an access point. Just remember it's directional.
Yes it is. I have a D90 and it works without issue.
Since this lens is a little more basic than the other lenses, you have to lock the aperture ring in where the red dot is on the lens.. Once it's locked it you can control the aperture through the camera like normal.
yes but I don't think the AF works.
Says in put 120v 2.0 amp. Its the dc volts you need. Charges both my toshibas at 19 volts and my hp at at volts. You have to play with the voltage till you find what works. Look at laptop battery voltage to give you a starting point. Only complaint i have is the ends distort easy.
It supports both WPA2(TKIP and AES) and WDS (Transparent Bridge).
We mounted ours inside our window pointing at the opposite inside window. There are a few trees in between our units and it works great. Our distance is about 600 feet between units.
No this is a Rocket M2 a Rocket M5 will as the NanoBridge M5 is 5Ghz. Rocket M2 is only a 2.4Ghz radio. Also using a Rocket will require an External antenna such as a Rocket Dish or Sector Antenna. The 5Ghz Band is typically Line of Sight. 2.4Ghz Band is LoS and Near Los. You may want to visit forum.ubnt.com for more advances answers to questions.
As long as you have the correct size housing unit. (basically a plastic sleeve that that fits snug around the head unit, sold serpereately.) Your best bet is to find a car audio store and purchase the housing unit there. They usually only run about $20. I DO NOT recommend buying a one size fits all housing from WalMart, best buy, etc.
Feet
its a great speaker, i use at as a center speaker in my wall, and its nice. i bridged just for the hell of it and screams back at you. great purchase!
Hello, easy smart is a easy simple managed switch, unmanged is unmanaged, and is the cheaper one. If you do not have any special requirements, browsing only, you can use the unmanaged. If you need Voice over IP, surveillance cams, etc, you go for the easy smart.
They look like the same to me in functionality. I chose the one eligible to ship outside the US. More a practical choice than technical comparison.
Don't know if this is their latest but it works superbly with all the apps we are using for. Skype etc.
I do not know any reason it would not. I've built two machines with this case and am happy.
Yes not too bad even sitting 1.5-2 ft. away
Not every USB but yes.
Try disconnecting the cable from the line-in port when you're not using it. I noticed better battery life if you unplug the cord after usage.
Tap n' Tap has usability issues, although there is a rumor that Viewsonic is pushing out another update currently. You will not get access to the actual Android market without flashing a different ROM (basically, a layer on top of Android much the way Tap n' Tap is).
They just came out with HC Alpha 7.1 with a lot of fixes..I have the 6.0 running and love it. Market is opened up and this version of HC is overclockable to 1.4 Ghz. Will be going to 7.1 soon. Flashback is the way to go on the Gtab if you want Honeycomb. I am also using cpu tuner to overclock it to 1.4Ghz (Performance setting) and it outperforms the Moto Xoom in benchmarks at 1.4 and using only 512 MB of memory vs the Xoom's 1G! This is GREAT!!!
the Li-Ion I like the fact does not develop memory. I bought the desk charger that will charge the batteries not attached the radio. And 2 spare batteries. Normal useI recharge the battery about two or three times a week,and rotate batteries about every five or six charges.in heavy use as soon as I get reports signals a little crackaly and I need two up my power.I just pop in a fresh battery dropped the old one in the charger and rock on. KG5EJG 73 Mike
Yes, this model does have the switch that allows you to toggle between Hybrid Silent Fan Control and Normal modes. I also confirmed on the label that it is the SS-850KM3 version. Enjoy!
I'm not sure about a office server but it works really well for a high powered gaming machine. 1366 mobo, 24 gig memory, 930 i7 overclocked to 4.0, 2 amd radeon 6950 graphics cards, 250 ssd, 2 1.5T WD 7200 hard drives, 2 blue ray players, 8 case fans and 2 cpu fans. Still have power to spare. Best feature is the module power connectors. You only need to plug in the cords you need, no extras
4 feet
There is a phone in and out, so I would assume yes, but I am not sure. I don't us a phone/DSL line for internet service. The HP/Monster Digital PowerCenter 450 (HPM MDP 450 ES) has a separate Network IN/OUT, but I'd assume that's intended for ethernet cable.
Yes, it is a one year warranty (which came in handy since I needed the hard drive replaced twice and the keyboard replaced once on mine within the first 5 months of owning it).
I bought this specifically for the iPhone 4S, I do not think it will work with the iPhone 5. But I am sure they sell one for the iPhone 5. This works great. I use my iPhone and my ipod on it. Love to listen to my own music. Sounds great in my older van. Thanks
It should work for a balckberry, but not 100% sure! I would not recommend the product as it doesn't charge well.
Most samsung batteries won't fit
i can't find this, either. It's irritating.
It will stream from Pandora, but I do not know about iHeart Radio because I do not stream very often.
Honestly, I don't know. I sent it back.
Dear Thelma, I must confess, my new Creative Zen is still in the box. My old Creative Zen was great for audio books and that is what I used it for. Great audio, great bookmarking. After 5 years it no longer was recognized by my computer so I purchased the new one, but haven't set it up yet. I borrow my books from the library, online. Ours has a great selection of e-audio books, so you don't have to pay to listen. Hope this helps.
no, and it doesn't have fast forward, that's what I bought it for and found out it is junk for audio books, get a sansa, they work
I'm not sure since I don't have a car, but I believe you could provided your car radio has the appropriate auxiliary jack. And I believe it would probably need an auxiliary cord, not a USB.
No idea. I am still trying to figure out how to get some playlists on this thing.
Mine is Dualcom works great
Yes. This item screen is also has two mounting holes on each side on top
No. It is for a Dell Inspron N14z laptop.
The cable is a standard 3' cable
I just tried it on my phone, an LG Xpression, and it worked fine. It got a full charge in the usual amount of time. I can't say for sure for ALL of the "devices" out there, but it worked for me.
Mine did.
you can see a red glow, make sure your camera is compatible with the wave length...
Daniel, I would need some more info from your computer to determine for sure, but I think it is compatible. Example: there are many different Alienware X51 computer setups, i.e. Ax51R2-1438k or the AX51r-2683BK and so on. Best place to tell is your Motherboard manual specifications for compatible CPU's. they all may have the same socket but, each may have different compatibilities. Hope this helps.
You need to buy a socket LGA1155 motherboard.
I used a CF card from an old camera. Upon first connection to PC iTunes reformatted the card automatically and then it has worked ever since. Although, evern so often the ipod states that there's an error, needs to be restored, then reboots itself and works fine. little weird but overal works okay - with no special partitions or conditioning of the card other than what iTunes did - at least for my old iPOD classic.
I dont know when i was using it i used a ipad 3
The charging part only works for the 30 pin connector (4s and earlier) but the radio part does.
No
I'm not familiar with the iPod suffle. If put songs on it the same way you'd charge iPhones and iPods then yes. If it only has and a/c jake then yes it will work but it'll just hang there. You won't be able to close the arms small enough to hold it in the docking part. Hope this helps. Let's me know if you have anymore questions.
No it can't
No.
The keyboard is bluetooth. In you settings you can sync the keyboard to your ipad without any issues. I have not seen the board and ipad use a cord between them but I will assume if that is what yo want to do then get a 5 point connector for the iPad and a mico USB adapter for the board and try to connect them that way? Hope this helps.
Yes, it works on mine just fine
Hello, Yes we do ship to France. Amazon Will calculate the cost of shipping. Thanks, Nathan Betamacs
Technically, the previous poster is correct. If you try to download and install Mountain Lion from the App Store, it will not run, as this model is unsupported. With a bit of work, however, you can run Mountain Lion on these models. I had given a detailed answer to someone who received an error when trying to install Mountain Lion earlier; please read that for more details, or leave a comment, and I'll explain how to upgrade for you as well.
I'll have the item in my hands in a few days. If you know how I can tell, I'll look and let you know.
My 13" Macbook (non-retina) fits perfectly in this sleeve. The Macbook retina may fit...but depending on what "little bigger" amounts to compared to my Macbook, it could be a little snug.
This is great quality camera. It works for me. Only problem is mounting on top of my monitor. There is no clip. I just put on top of monitor and taped it. Sounds like lousy but it works. It works in skype but I am not heavy user of video conferencing.
One other reader posted 36.7 x 14.5 in centimeters
It should. However, are you aware that you have to turn the laptop on before plugging it into the henge dock? This creates a power surge that can damage your laptop. Also, if you turn your laptop off, you have to unplug it from the henge dock to turn it back on, thus creating another opportunity for power surge damage, when you plug it back into the henge dock.
Yes it works for Facebook but need very good lighting in the room whenever using it
the dayton audio sa230 is utilized for passive sub-woofers which are normally built inot the wall. it is utilized for base only. i have purchased and used this product for my passive sub-woofer and it works great. i don't think it is applicable for your use.
A friend just made the same upgrade and the answer for him was no. The connectors are different. Since the new unit comes with its transponder, no need to worry about it.
You will not be able to calibrate your speedometer without being in the water but you can set up just about everything else.
Hi! This box has 1 main trigger and 2 additional ones that You can use only with 2 speedlights! I hope it will help.
5 ft
that's what i have and it works fine
It comes with everything you need to hook it up .
It comes with the tulip lens hood and a Tamron logoed cap. Great lens ! Would suggest a UV filter primarily for front lens protection. If you edit your photos, no need to spend on a polarizer unless you are concerned about reflections. Easy to darken skies as needed.
Never had this problem. Cannot assist. Sorry.
It will work
No, I never happened to me something so sorry you can not help
Yes, but I am having problems with it freezing on start-up.: memory card saying it's full, but there are no images to display. There is a firmware update and it's only compatible with Windows.
I don't think the camera has edit cap on board. I edit in the software I have on my desktop. after download.
A refurbished camera is one previously owned and used that is restored to "like new". But it isn't new and I found that a new one from Amazon was very reasonably priced and well worth the difference.
No it does not. Most cameras don't usually come with a memory card.
Yes you can. In fact it's incredibly easy. Here's a video showing you how. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyUfs788cJk Just as an fyi, the max is 2gbs.
Yes you can
No this ceda does not have flash.
I believe the drive I installed in it was 1TB. Actually, as long as it's a 2.5 inch drive, the capacity, I believe, is irrelevant.
Sumit P. I've looked at the specs for the Kingston V300 120GB SSD on line and by the appearance of the connector and type of drive I believe it should work.
It's OK. But my recommendation will be upgrading the ram memory. If you add more RAM will be fine
No. You can view your video but you can hear it through the camera.
I used an SD card reader to load the pictures on to my iPad, and then yes, over to Facebook from there. Also the EASYSHARE program lets you pick where the pictures will be sent to. Look on Kodak's own website to read more about how EASYSHARE software works. A google search for EasyShare C123's user manual also will tell you everything about how this camera works.
It will work, although i find the fit of the prong a little loose so you have to make sure there is no drag on the cord or it will fall out. For the price is is a good deal.
Not sure but it is a cheap charger, doesn't have the metal ring to keep it from popping out so you have to keep it in one place.
No. It's specifically designed to fit the optical drive bays of the Macbooks listed in the description.
Yes
it's for Macbook Pros
why don't you get the one for your MA895LL: http://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Special-Designed-macbook-SuperDrive/dp/B0057V95M6/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1389541944&sr=8-2-fkmr0&keywords=ma895ll+2nd+hard+drive+caddy
Absolutely! As long as your wifi router works, every wifi device should work, and this will work perfectly for you!
Input is controlled by the plug sent. You have to make sure that you order from your home country or order the appropriate plug separately.
This is standard 35mm film. Any camera that takes 35mm film will take this. From what I have seen online about your camera, it should be compatible as the OM10 is a standard 25mm SLR. Be sure to set your camera to the film speed rating for proper exposure. The ISO rating for this film is 400.
Consumer level (nice for snapshots) but not as forgiving regarding exposure as Portra. Ultramax tends to be grainier. A lot of people seem to think it' s Gold 400 under another name. To me the results of Portra can't be beat especially by a supermarket brand.
Charge only at least with a motorola android. Met my needs by allowing me to use my old Blackberry charger at work. I now have either Mini/Micro adapter for charging. If you want data, best bet is to get a good dedicated micro usb cable. All usb cables are not created equal. Length can be an issue on some models. Hope this helps.
I believe so it worked on for me
It says..10.8v 5200 mAh ..& I have no idea what that means :) ...an update....mine only lasted about 6 months :(
Request Amazon to replace it.
I've read elsewhere that it requires a 3D source, the projector, and 3D glasses (the active-shutter type, IIRC). When the projector detects the glasses, the otherwise grayed-out menu choices become selectable. I would guess it also takes twice the bandwidth of 2D high-def, or 20Mbps if you're viewing source over the Internet, but home/work networks should have plenty of bandwidth. And if you're playing through your PC (via HDMI-out), it obviously needs a decoder, but I think it also must be HDCP compliant if accessing content over the Internet (or commercial content). That's less likely if you're using VGA-out.
Yes
No, this is an Intel brand motherboard, Asus makes sabertooth, and the one I bought was in perfect condition. I didn't use the sataIII ports because they seem to have unstable drivers. Other than that, the DX58OG is a good motherboard.
I use it for am HTC and have used it in a Samsung Galaxy s2 with no problems. You need to use tape to hold in the micro SIM though.
I dont know...sorry
Yes. I can use my micro sim in my HTC phone. It's a little thick making it hard to slide in and out. I didn't use the sticker that come with the unit that would have made it thicker still, and sanded the aadapter to make it thinner.
We ship Fed-ex.
The unit itself? Unfortunately no. The only way you can remotely turn volume down is if you can turn it down from the source. Hope this helps..:)
Yes but they'ed be somewhat quiet, it would definitely work though.
I love my center channel Polk. It is extremely clear especially for voice/dialog which is why I purchased it. No complaints here.
You have to use a video converter program......you can download for free, VLC....which will work. I use Wondershare Video Converter. Good luck.
Unfortunately, no, it doesn't.
Although I am using this item with 7942 instead of 7945, most likely it will work.
It did not work was disipointed
Hello Meghan, This adapter only works with Cisco phones (but not ALL Cisco phones) -- what you need is our PH25-RJ9A adapter. It works with your Avaya phone. Link here: http://www.amazon.com/Headset-Buddy-Adapter-2-5mm-01-PH25-RJ9A/dp/B004FVDUAW Thank you, Long Tail Products Support
I tried with a regular SIP Phone and it doesn't works.
Did not work well in my app - sound quality sucked
Three holders are included, with plastic chains and wall/ceiling mounting brackets.
No, the lens mount is different for the Nikon mirrorless cameras. This is designed to be used withe the Nikon SLR lenses
Yes. Works with all Nikkor F mounts.
Leica M lenses are all manual with no electronics as is this adapter. Manual aperture and focus. The only automatic features possible are aperture priority and auto ISO.
I personally couldn't see why not since your TV is a DLP...I have the 82" and they work perfect!
Dear Frank, I believe they support all DLP projectors and Mitsubishi DLP Tv's. If your Samsung is DLP, then perhaps "yes" - but I would try to contact vendor first. Go to their EBay store.. http://stores.ebay.com/3DTV-CORP
A long 3 second press is to shot off the glass and a simple blink of an eye press to turn the glass on, when you turn it on it will give a flash and it'll go a little dark in to the 3d mode, hope this helped you.
No
To be safe you would have to ask the manufacturer of the specific product, but that said, I can tell you that I am using a "safe" adapter between the hot shoe of my Lumix DMC FZ230 and a very old flash unit that is supposed to be too "hot" with no ill effect.
No
Works great for me.
Yes it will BUT, if you HP Stream MicroSD card slot is greater than 3/8" wide, then you need an adapter. The adapter hosts the microSD card and it slides right in. Then, you would slide the adapter into the HP MIcroSD card slot. This SanDisk does NOT come with the adapter.
Yes
There's an adaptor plug that's with the plug unit, but separate. I got enough of a hint to go take another look in the box, thanks Kevin.
Lightscribe software is free from the lightscribe website. This drive does not support lightscribe burning. Poor description.
If the mp3 player accepts Micro SD cards, it is. If the mp3 player accepts Micro SD cards but of a lower memory level, you will not get the full advantage of the 32 GB available in the card.
Yes; according to the SanDisk website, all of their MP3 players are able to have up to 32GB added with a microSDHC card. 32GB plus the 8GB already on the device would give you a total of 40GB to store music on.
Hello John, Unlike card write speeds that measure maximum performance, class ratings measure the minimum sustained speed required for recording an even rate of video onto the card. The class rating number corresponds to the transfer rate measured in megabytes per second. Class 2 cards are designed for a minimum sustained transfer rate of 2 megabytes per second, while Class 10 cards are designed for a minimum sustained transfer rate of 10MB.
I have not. Be sure to check the specs on the Cam. Some take specific cards. My cam uses any Micro SD Card and this one works great in it.
Yes, the Moto G holds a Mirco SD up to 32gb.
Um, I'm not sure. It says it costs 12.99 which is a pretty damn good deal if you ask me.
Yes it will.
Yes, but when i did, Ipod / Ipad would not play, no volume, my Samsung Note worked, but no sound from ipad
Hi. I'm Sorry I don't know for sure on both questions. If you want a guess, I would say probably no hdmi output.
The unit will hold 3 drives, either 3.5" or 2.5", with 3.5" drives at 4Tb then the max storage capacity would be 12Tb.
stand it up and turn the prop underneath so it stays standing up, much like it is displayed. whatever you do don't leave it fan side down that way it don't overheat
This is most likely down to the software, but in the camera's menu, under the playback options, should be an option for auto-rotate. Try turning that off and see what it does.
I'm not sure what TN or IPS mean but the monitor is awesome. I've had mine for a couple years now and it's great, picture and detail. Highly recommend it.
1 year and as far as I know you might have to buy it though the manufacturing company
No speakets
Standard US household current
I'm wondering the same
Negative. It's made for slim 2.5" SSD drives. The purpose of RAID is if you have a controller capable of raiding these drives. For all intent and purposes, it's a pass thru design.
If you're buying the US model it will be 110 if you're buying a European or Asian model it may be 230 or higher.
Yes, to the memory. I upgraded my Toshiba mini to two megabites(?) last year. I bought battery directly from Toshiba online. Sorry I can't answer your other questions.
It was upgraded to Windows 7 full versionl when I received it. Also has Microsoft Office small business. I upgraded the RAM to 2GB.
No. But this is one excellent monitor. I would have bought two of them if I knew how good it was, and at the time, I purchased it for $250. Wish I had now.
http://www.gladiatorjoe.com/HP-VESA-Adapter-mounting-kit-for-HP-LCD-Monitors-GJ0A0005.htm should do the trick!
I'm pretty sure it has just one hard drive. I don't think they could physically fit a second hard drive into a netbook as it is. I had an ASUS Eee PC 1000HA which had two partitions, each at about 80GB. Once I installed Linux, only one hard drive was detected with a capacity of about 149GB, so there was one hard drive in that netbook.
No, it doesn't have a slot for the batteries (a newer model may)
Neither my dad and I are sure. Sorry we couldn't be more help.
It will work as both, but at only 500' I would NOT recommend getting this unit. This is over kill and you will have some issues using as only an AP. I would get two Loco Nanostations and create a bridge - super easy to do, super reliable. I use the Loco's for anything under a mile.
As long as there is line of sight, you would just have to turn down the power until your receive index is around -65db on either side.
Not 100% sure but I believe the extra lens could fit in one of the side pockets. The main pocket holds the camera body with one lens attached. Hope this helps.
Hi. Yes it will.
I can't find the model # anywhere on my machine but I have the new Kindle Fire HDX with the 7 inch screen. I think you are asking about the larger one so can't fully respond but it works beautifully for me. My second one is performing just as well on my quite old Motorola 'droid.
No. The rails are sold separately.
No, it is from China. Only holds a charge for a couple of hours compared to the original HP battery which lasted 12 hours at a minimum.
To me it means that everything IS included including the lens hood cover. I hope this helps you.
No
Hello Amazon Customer, Yes, this cable will be able to charge that device quickly. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support
When I inserted it, I did have to apply more pressure to get it to lock. But after that, it holds well.
Here is what's written in the description for the Anker battery: 'Anker New Laptop Battery for HP Pavilion DV4 DV5 DV6 CQ50 CQ60 CQ70 G50 G60 G70 G71 G61 G60T Series - 18 Months Warranty [Li-ion 12-cell 8800mAh]' HP G71 is listed as one of the HP laptops it fits. Good luck!
I installed an intake fan since my power supply has a 120mm fan that is providing the exhaust functionality. That setup seems to keep everything pretty cool (&lt;40 C).
Standard ATX form factor.
I used this case a long with "Diablotek DA Series 500-Watt ATX Power Supply PSDA500" PSU and it was fine. Its a little tight because they basically butt up against each other.
Yes. Search for the Cisco document entitled "Link Aggregate Group (LAG) Configuration on 200/300 Series Managed Switches".
Yes, its easy and it was a Cisco Mini-GBiC. No issues
Hi It can *forward* DHCP info to pc's and phones. If you want it to originate DHCP, you need one of the 300 series switches. Bob
Martin, I purchased the Cisco SG200-26 a couple of months back. Personally, I did have to upgrade to the latest version of iOS Firmware. Firmware version 1.3.2.02 (Active Image). My SG200-20 shipped with 1.1.0.6 Boot version. This smart switch is only used for my home LAN and it is everything a Home/Small Business could possibly need. So download from Cisco the latest version for your switch and you will be happy.
I have not tried that but I would suspect not. If you wanted mono in both ears from either channel, probably the best bet is to use a stereo plug to phono and back so you could separate each channel to become your mono to both ears.
In the "mono" position the left and right ear sounds are somewhat averaged, and this average sound is sent to both ears.
Yes
It wouldnt let me play mine... Come to find out its nit even a real microsift produxt its a laptop or portable harddrive slapped in a plastic box... I just soent the extra money and bought one brand new from a strore... Wastes my money on this thing... Titanfall was awesome after i xould play it though
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8ttWH_DwUI The Acer 533 got the same internal as 522, there is no screws hiding under the rubber feet on this model
I don't have a 5d ii. I have a 5d III and it works just light the canon battery. The camera will read the battery charge level and battery serial number.
At miccastore.com I was just there and they have remotes for their products.
No, your car doesn't have to have bluetooth capabilities. The connection works like this: Phone to Tunelink via bluetooth Tunelink to car/stereo via FM transmitter or AUX in port
it does not drain my battery and it is left in maybe 50% of the time
save your money and look for another product besides New Potato - Their products works for only days at a time and then you are stuck with calling, shipping and waiting for replacements - Only to do again in a few weeks. After three replacements, I decided to trash my TuneLink and other reputable firms

the "Class" represents the minimum transfer rate you should see with these cards. Class 4 = 4MB/s Class 6 = 6MB/s Class 10 = 10MB/s There is an informative page on the kingston site at the following link: http://www.kingston.com/flash/sdhc.asp
I would have to agree with Samuel because most people can just use their iPhone or DROID phones to shoot great video for example. We have a DROID X that has a generous 4.5" screen and takes HD video & sound just fine for the everyday user. Videos can now be uploaded directly to YouTube without having to convert them either (had to do this a year ago for quality)! I think little pocket-cams will become obsolete by 2012 (along with the WORLD!!! LOL).
Yes

Windows 7
It is supposed to be 110 ~ 240. However, I strongly discourage you buy this adapter. I bought it from the states in hopes to run my xbox in the middle east. It fried my power adapter and I had to order one from Europe. It's not worth it, trust me.
Data compression and encryption for transmission are handled by the CPU on the transmission side of the device. Video requires a fairly large number of calculations and thus a beefy CPU. If you are using it more for displaying presentations or as a second monitor to typical desktop applications the CPU requirements are greatly reduced.
It should be line-of-sight. You could try to send the signal thru a wall, but I cannot speak to the quality or strength you'll get. I even had to buy a USB extension cord for the transmitter and it's even in the same room!
Warpia has a product that works for Macs and PCs... http://www.warpia.com/products/streamhd-mac-pc-swp130a The model here works only with Windows PCs, and from the sounds of it, it doesn't work well with Windows 8 (much better with Windows 7).
I wish I had an answer for you. Unfortunately, I have no experience with linux. You may have better luck contacting customer service/tech support with Warpia directly. Good Luck,... and again.. sorry I can't be of assistance.
yes ours does smell pretty bad but you can only smell it if you put it up to your nose otherwise you can't smell it. If the product smell bothers yout I think putting it outside to air out for a week would help.
a guess would be..about 6 inches wide..i actually used it to mount an ipad on the dash of my work truck..worked out awesome!
if your owners Manuel calls for it then I would buy it.
So far I have about 85 on my camera itself. I prefer to put them on a disc to make it easier to print.
Yes Mine came w a bag. Great setup good projector
No. It is just a key pad with a few buttons to adjust sound etc., It is a great cover key pad combination but it doesn't turn the tablet into a laptop.
Yes it does. Not very bright, but noticeable within about 40 feet or so.
Yes, same as other cameras, BNC connector for Video and DC Jack for Power.
4.5"
If you want to see recording you need a DVR, there is no storage on the camera. If you want to just watch live video you can hook it up to any TV source with a analog input, you'll need a BNC to Video connector.
The logo is green. Other models I don't know.
Hello, I'm on my second pair as I had an accident with the first and snapped off the connector - my fault. Both pair were bought in two different countries at different times to where I live now, so any warranty issues, had I pursued them, would probably have been negated and not worth the bother. Afraid I cant help, you could check out the website for their policies. Good luck.
I'm using the sound blaster z and it sounds great. I don't know of a cheaper card. Check newegg.com and read peoples reviews.
Certainly. I use them exclusively for my vinyl collection and have been very pleased by the depth of sound they offer. The highs and mid-ranges are clear, while the bass is strong but not overpowering. For the price point, they are 9/10.
Wires. They have the screw-type of connector consisting of a threaded post and a knurled thumb nut. You screw out the nut revealing a hole through the center of the post. You feed the stripped speaker wire through that hole and tighten the nut. Simple and sturdy.
You should have received a CD with the webcam that has software called "Live! Central". Install that if you haven't already. You can check out the what the video looks like with that software. In other words, what others will see/what you will look like to others. It also has some other features which allow you to manipulate the video in different ways. I'm a bit unclear on exactly what you're asking. So, if this doesn't answer your question let me know.
Yes it is. :)
You can but instead of the j arm, you would have to have a straight arm.
Yes you can. You would wire the two 6" to the front channels and the sub would be wired to the two rear channels but in a bridged fashion. The polk manual should show you how the wires should be run the be bridged properly with that particular amp. As far as sub goes I have a polk DXI 12 in one of the polk ported boxes they come with powered the same way and it sounds great. It won't shake the neighbor hood but provides very good low fill.
If you mean the settings of the devices plugged into the strip, my devices have NOT had to be reconfigured each time. I have my cable box & DVD recorder plugged into the "always on" plugs to always be ready to record. My Yamaha Amp, Apple TV box, & Sony DVD player have kept their settings, I tested the Sony DVD player by changing some settings, turning it completely off (red light off ) and the settings were saved when I turned everything back on. Hope this answers your question.
Yep, it's supposed to do. See the details pane: 2160 Joules of protection *7 surge-protected AC outlets
Yes it comes with an ac cord to plug into an electrical outlet. Also comes with an antenna.
Insignia is a brand exclusive to best buy, try one of their stores.
I am not sure I understand your question? The device provides the options for various encryption methods thus it is user defined.
I have mine connected via my charter cable box. I am able to use my phone with wifi and my laptop too.
It measures out to just a hair over 4'
The base has ann AUX INUT
It's for PC not a stand alone recorder. You have to get a DVD recorder if they still make one.
Yes it fits
Should be universal, I have one on my 2005, but it should come with multiple fittings
Yes, that's what I bought mine for.
I can't tell you that for sure. It fits my 11" MacBook Air perfectly though!
My Powershot does!
If the Elph you have is similar to other Elph cameras, the small ones, then yes,
Depends on the size of the text book but probably not. I have been able to carry a water bottle, iPad, digital camera and other smaller things. Sometimes I can squeeze a novel into the bag along with the iPad.
Yes you can. Simply hook it up via hdmi and set your tv to display 3d and off you go.
Yes We do
Five users shouldn't be a problem. They have decent tech support. My only beef if the SSL VPN doesn't work due to software issues. The IPSec vpn works just fine and the router has some decent security options. I use the VPN every day and its solid from that perspective.
viene con todos sus accesorios....
I really do not know. I have only used a 32Gb class 10 SDXC memory card.
Yes - you can buy it on Amazon.
It plugs into the back of the unit.
I keep mine in a waterproof case. Even with that I have noticed that the faceplate needs a wiggle to make it function properly. This is assume it due to the salt air. Given that the faceplate folds down to allow you to put your cell phone inside I don't think anyone would say this unit is waterproof.
Hi, this Sony Cybershot DSC-HX100V is a fixed lens camera type in which you cannot connect other lenses. You may also send us more details about your concern at socialsupport@am.sony.com, give us your contact details so that we can assist you further. Thanks. Ely.
Hi, this Sony 3-way Speaker has an approximate dimensions of 6-1/8 x 8-3/4 x 3 inches or 168 x 237 x 75 mm. It weight is 2 lbs 7 oz per speaker. You may check your 2004 mitsubishi magna if it supports this kind of dimensions. -Ely
just 2
Depends on your local noise situation. The biggest enemy of AM radio isn't the quality of the radios, so much as the level of electronic interference from electronics and power lines. That said, this radio has good selectivity. If you want more sensitivity (and less selectivity) you'd be better off with a radio with a larger ferrite antenna like the Degen 1103 - it also has better audio and is a larger radio. The Tecsun audio is tinny due to the small speaker.
The gain on this amplifier is average 10-12 dB over the frequency range. The CEA standard for digital indoor antenna amplifiers is 14 dB or less because higher gain causes issues with the tuners.
Dec. 16, 2014 Yes it has to be next to the TV.
I think it should. I used this battery for my 2009 Mac Book Pro 15" and it works great. This is my second battery for my Pro; for the price it works every bit as good as the more expensive battery I purchased the first time around. Hope this helps.
Sorry, but I don't know for sure.
I'm currently using it on my 5DMK3 without any issues. Like I stated in my review however, approximately 3-4% of the screen (the edges) will be excluded from the viewfinder. This hasn't hindered my shots though and would highly recommend it over spending another $100 on the 2.2X magnification version. If I want to be precise with my shot I'll use my external 7in monitor. This viewfinder is great for being in the field shooting.
with the phone in the otter case you'll need an adapter such as this http://www.amazon.com/Patuoxun-Exension-Extender-Adapter-iPhone/dp/B008R68DFS/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1389117893&sr=8-2&keywords=4s+iphone+adapter. another detail about the radio that i'm not crazy about is a second visible cord that is the radio's antenna. good luck.
Hi. The Software is not Mac compatible but if you are using this unit as access control you can perfectly program all the features via the keypad. Janio
It's a fair distance away around the chest area. I really enjoy mine, they work and sound extremely well with my iphone.
I doesn't fold up but can be taken down as easily as turning off a light switch. Well almost.
No it cannot. The screws are located on the top therefore had to 'hang' from it's location.
I only charge mine with the USB cable on my computer and while it does indicate a full charge in a couple of hours, I found if I leave it connected overnight I get a longer time period between charges. I have my notify set to 30% and 20%.
Can't really answer this as I don't know your camera specs. It has worked well with both my S9500 and AW100.
I never could get the steering wheel controls to work
Same here - as long as the jack is in all the way, its good. In my case, I found a quirk - I was playing Pandora radio from my ipad speakers and then pushed the jack of the kinivo in and couldnt hear a thing. Then i gracefully exited Pandora, and restarted the app and all was good. Just remember to keep the ipod or pad at full volume and use the kinivo to control the volume and you should be good.
I'm not sure what you are looking for, there is a plug that stores on the bottom of the unit and plugs into the device being played, there is also a cord provided that has both a usb plug along with the headphone plug that will charge the speaker when plugged in. There is also a single female plug where you can plug in another speaker, any additional speakers are plugged into the previous speaker. I hope this answers your question.
Probably not. Change are you would need VGA. Assuming so, this would work: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HIM3ZQ/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1 for the pocket projector.
No. They have a stiff arc.
Yes, they are very comfortable and I use them when I am out and about on my scooter (disabled). I use them on my iPod, at home on my computer. They have very soft cushion in both ears and and deliver the same sound as they did when I first bought them. I will use them for a few hours at a time and they are very durable. Hope this helps you, Jeff
No it's silver and black. Picture is a little deceiving.
Yes they will. They are 3.5mm. I use them on my phone and MP3 player as well as my computer. They are great sounding. They are not very durable though. I've had to electrical tape the head band on the ones I've owned. But they are great headphones for the money. Happy listening.
You might get them to work on a plane if you have an adapter. I have not tried to use them with any plane entertainment systems.
I just use this to listen to audio books in my kitchen. I like it a lot, it is the best CD played I own. An audio CD may skip on one of my other players but not this one. I have not used it on battery although I have them in it for back up purposes. I haven't tried a USB product on it. I could give it a shot and let you know if you'd like as well as the repeat, if there is one?
Wiring harness for you vehical and your dash installment kit
yes it has five
No...it does not.
It has a aux inport on it and only has a aux input female and has a two speaker hookup plus power and your bass setting and loudness etc.
google it, you might find it on Ebay....
No problems with my Pyle pro PQA3100.It's working good.
No software or disks were with my 2 cameras. It is totally plug and play. Just plug the USB cable in the port and the Mic cable in the port and allow the computer to find new hardware. Maybe to make sure it is working reboot. Then go to My Computer to see if it is in there, and if so, just click on it and it will show what it sees.
Short answer yes. You will need cable card from cable provider and you will need subscription to HBO. Some areas you will also need a tuning adaptor that your cable company provides. Once you have that set up you can watch it on your computer. You can also watch it on any device that is connected to your network that can run windows media center (like xbox) Keep in mind these devices do not do on demand so if you are looking for HBO on demand services it will not work.
I wouldn't look to see windows 8 out until october at the earliest, but most likely the end of the year. And as rancher says, you can always install windows 8 when it is released, which is what I plan to do. I haven't seen any tablet on the horizon that rivals this one, so if windows 8 is your only hold back, don't let that detour you.
I'm not an artist, but you might find this comparison between an ep121 and the 21 inch cintiq useful: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAZg9bEPm1E
Yes, I've had it happen a couple of times. I was able to get it back to normal by pressing the "ESC" key (i.e. holding down the hardware keyboard button). Hopefully some future driver updates, etc. will fix this.
Yes, it is compatible.
No it does not have a 220V head.
Ive had mine for almost 2 years and its still on the same battery. Never had a problem
The antenna has a black magnet mount with a chrome colored antenna. The length is 34 1/8 inches tall.
I have a 2007 rx350 with nav and it did work, I plugged it in the sat connection behind the stereo, I do not know if the Avalon has a similar setting, look it up in the Internet .
As far as I know, you just have to select Anaglyph Red/Cyan mode. At own risk. I've never tried it.
You can hook these up to a regular 120 volt switch or some other kind of smart automation device for remote controlling. Only other thing you would need is the required wire to hook everything together and related supplies.
It will support H.264 AVC encoding and will DLNA support. If your TV supports DLNA, you can stream live TV to it rather than having to go through Myth, WMC, Sage, etc. For people with TVs that support DLNA, this would be great.
Yes it don't have BT as an standard feature.
Yes
Yes. The camera software includes a "wind cut" setting which can be activated through the touchscreen menu. The owner's manual indicates some low frequency sound may also be removed.
Hello Tommy, Thanks for your interest! Regrettably, it is EZCORP'S policy to not ship outside of the Continuous US. This is because of the loss incurred when packages go through customs, high shipping fees, and damage done to the packages themselves. They found that this happened too frequently and they were losing too much money. This is why they decided to only ship locally. We apologize again for this inconvenience.
I just receive mine today. Pretty impressive so far. I've got a review in queue. First sample pics here: http://photo.net/photodb/folder?folder_id=1000968 I'll be traveling tomorrow, but will post more samples when I get time.
No.
Six foot
I'm not sure 100% but it has worked great with my Pro-Form XP440 R recumbent excercise bike for a while now.
Yup!
It is a good basic phone. Note that the get it now feature for apps is no longer supported by Verizon.
Yes. There are two telescoping tubes.
I would guess around 6 feet. It is too long from my computer to chair and I have to coil it up to keep the chair wheels from running over it. It is extremely comfortable and excellent sound, but the microphone is very soft/faint for others to here. That is the only negative.
They're headphones, so no.
do not recommend this product- poor quality- may not work.
No it don't but it's a great laptop
No. Just apple ipod hook up. Comes with av cable acessory for red yellow and white hook. And a car charger hook up. You would need to find if iphone 5 lighting cable is the same as a apple ipod cable from the apple store.
It's a 2 channel amp, so you can drive one speaker off each channel, and connect a stereo source to the inputs. It works quite well.
No, this amplifier has RCA inputs only. You may need an 3.5mm to RCA adapter.
Hello J.: It is a Model 200!...Take care, BDD
I'll looked at a picture of the factory radio for your car. It looks like the Pioneer might fit. What you have to check on is this: if the factory radio size is "Double DIN" then the Pioneer will fit. Double DIN is the size of the radio. It means it takes up 2 DIN sizes. Where as the typical standard (smaller) size for radios is a single DIN. Hope that helps!
I've got one hidden in my 55 bel air. I'm sure it could fit if you're truck is cut out for a double din head unit
Yes it should fin in it
Yes.
The only wires in my glove box are for the iPhone/iPod connection. You can wrap those anyway you want but for me it was letting them go in the glove box. However, I hardly use it since I play most my music off the memory card. The extra GPS wires I have wrapped behind the glove box. I hope this helps answer your question. Rich
no. it just tilts up and down depending on where you want it or if your inserting a dvd or SD card
The difference can be more easily seen on a large screen monitor or TV, but you have to be sure to use the proper inputs and settings for the device.
Yes. Avchd format.
Yes, you have full manual control over focus using the focus ring when auto focus is off.
Yes, to access, you have to leave the monitor door open (careful!) and access the sliding a/v door. I use two 64gb PNY SDXC cards for better performance capturing HD video. Hope this helps, James!
MXP
Yes, it has an optical viewfinder.
There is nothing in the manual about switching to PAL. The manuel only mentions support from areas using NTSC.
not if your dash only accommodates single DIN units. I'm not familiar with Torneos, perhaps they are Japanese continent only models.
This is a simpler point & shoot canon, the flash options are; on, off, auto & slow sync.
It runs on AA bateries
.throwing out two piece of junk I bought one a friend of mine bought one both at the same time she loves hers I thought mine was a piece of junk I no longer have it she still has hers and that was 3 years ago whatever that's worth to you but yours sounds like it's just broken and to be honest at cameras pretty much I actually probably worth nothing so I will just picture it
About 10 ounces.
Yes
http://www.manufacturer.com/product/m6779255-Canon+VIXIA+HF+M41+Camcorder+-+1080p+-+2.37+MP+-+10+x+optical+zoom.html
Yep. Basketball and Swimming too.
I don't believe so. As far as I can see, the USB port is the only power source.
Anyone going on a safari would do so well with a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-HX200V. The ability to get close to any subject with this camera is better than most all binos. It's stable, beautiful color, has many options, and its small and light weight enough to take anywhere. One thing that sold me was the grip...long enough grip for my long fingers.
Not sure. I'm currently using it for Garmin. However, if it fits, then it must work. Hope this helps. Thanks
With updated software intended for Windows 8, it works ok for Windows 8. However, it has a fatal flaw. If you rest your finger on the left button (without pressing it) and the press the right button, the mouse doesn't know which button you pressed. When I use any mouse, I always keep one finger resting of the left button and one on the right button. Microsoft expects me to pick up the finger on the left button. Not something I will do. I returned it. It's a design flaw.
I know that Bluetooth mice work on Surface. This mouse uses USB, which will work, provided you have an open USB port on your Surface and are then able to connect it.
Yes I am using it with Windows 8.1. Just make sure to download the software from Microsoft after installing so it works right.
A charger yes but no memory card. You have enough memory in the camera for about 4 pictures then you have to download so technically it has a memory function. But if you are interested get a memory card when purchasing. It is a very nice camera.
This will work with iMac read stats below. Standard: IEEE 802.11b/g/n -Interface: USB 2.0 Interface BPSK, QPSK, 16 QAM, 64 QAM modulation schemes -WEP, TKIP, AES, WPA and WPA2 hardware encryption schemes -System Requirement: -PC-compatible computer CPU speed of 200MHz or above -Memory: 64MB or above 128MB recommended -Window XP/ Vista/ 7, Mac OS, Linux
Not completely sure but it looks almost exactly like my phone so I am willing to bet it will. Hey if not you can always ship it back.
I'm using two 9" Sylvania's but as they are adjustable they should also work with RCA
No
I cannot test this setup exactly, but there is not reason it shouldn't work. It's a pretty simple device.
Yes and they are easy to install and make a world of difference.
Yes the speakers come with the mounting clips
When I was doing my research for this part I found a link where it stated that it does not matter if it is a C1 C2 or C3. As long as the model number is the same and the pin on the back is in the same location as the one you have. It should fit and work just fine.
I use this product for my laptop and I am happy
Perhaps if you have an adapter... the model I bought had the old 30 pin connector. iPhone 5 has the smaller Lightning connector.
I would think so. This unit just extends the existing electrical circuits, so you would still have your ground fault protection. However, if the ground fault function in the main outlet was activated, you would need to remove the surge protector to access the re-set switch.
Yep. You can.
1TB
It doesn't work WELL with much of anything. Avoid at all costs, and buy a WD MyBook Live Cloud Drive. I'm serious. This one--though it technically still works--is sitting unplugged in my closet. I had too much trouble with it. Frustrating as all get-out. But seriously, yeah, it probably works with 8.1. As well as it works with anything.
As far as I know they should. I use the Kokkia with my ipod classic and it works great when I pair it with a Harman Kardon Onyx blue tooth speaker. Good luck!!
i read elsewhere that it does not...
Don't think they have given a specific release date, but their website, thetoshibatablet (you fill in the rest of the url), is advertising "coming this spring." I assume they mean spring in the northern hemisphere. That ends June 21.
Yes it does. There is basic dieting software included on a disc.
Ya
I try to hook mine up to ex- hard drive via USB and it did not play/or read any of the files.
I would say about 1.5 to 2 inches... My wrists hurt when I type for a long period of time but the legs let the laptop sit perfect enough not to apply strain on my wrists anymore.
I can't imagine why it would not work. You are simply pairing the Bluetooth, nothing else, I have found most to be compatible with anything which has Bluetooth.
Don't get it is very week broke first time I tried to use it. Get a cable style
I am not too sure about the 120GB iPod Classic. I use the 160GB iPod Classic (pls. refer to this link: http://www.apple.com/sg/ipodclassic/). It fits perfectly with my iPod Classic 160GB. Hope this helps a little :)
Should be all you need if I'm understanding your application correctly and as you can see, the audio speaker cable is included. Most all Laptops and LCD/LED TV's have VGA connectors these days. However, if I had a HDMI connector on both the Laptop and the TV, I would order a HDMI cable instead.
The VGA does not carry audio so you need plug the audio cable into the port, I haven't seen any TVs that carry one but not the other take a closer look see if you can find it, sometimes it's placed where it's really hard to see but I should be very close to the VGA. I'd be courious to find out if you found it. Good luck
Both ends are the same on this cable
No, the cable doesn't supply a "power on" signal to the monitor to tell the monitor to turn on.
I have a 60 inch Vizio on mine and the sides are almost flush with the end, but it might work if you don't Mideast it hang over the eadge a little. It is heavy enough to hold it and has lots of room.
with legs on it stands at exactly two feet. then the tv bar sticks up higher if you attach it.
It fits my 5" Garmin with its cables.
I don't play games but I can tell you that it works perfect for my use!!
The pocket is definitely large enough for a tablet with a case to fit. My iPad has a fairly thick cover and it fits with tons of room to spare.
Great bag. I've had it over 2 years and no issues at all. I travel a lot and the handle is durable as everything else in this bag. As far as size, it is a standard one
Turn switch on back to Bluetooth, hold play button on top of speaker for a few seconds. The light will flash orange and a tone will sound, scan for Bluetooth devices on your phone and select connect to iDM12BX.
I would assume you can. I haven't tried it. I guess you would need a longer cable like the one it brings which has a 2.5mm male jack on both ends.
No bluetooth. It plugs into a headphone jack. I actually returned the product because the sound quality was terrible.
There is no volume on the iHome iH16B . You have to turn up the volume on your device then hook it up to the iH16B.
If it has a headphone jack it'll work
I don't think so. I just have an iPod touch and I always take my cover off before I put it on this dock. The speaker dock comes with 3 different plastic plates to adjust for different models of iPod/ iPhones but I think you'll have to take the Otterbox off.
No
It works with anything that has a headphone jack
Life time warranty
I believe it will. At this affordable price you could risk the purchase and return if it doesn't work. Sure beats the dealer's price. Try it.
I have a 2013 S4 and works well, I think it should work fine for 2013 A4, as far as I know the MMI is about the same.
It works with Audi Q5 2014 with very minor glitches. That being said, I do not know how different the Interface is from your car to my car.
I know it works with my Tiguan Wolkswagen 2012. Sorry I can't be more helpful to you
As amazing as that would be, I doubt it. You could try connecting this to a wireless USB hub and ad-hoc to hub but the refresh rate would probably be awful if it even worked in the first place.
You would have to drill mounting holes. You dash is a bit to small but you could make it work. It is however designed for the Wrangler TJ. Thank you!
Yes and very portable, though an uneven surface like a rock, may require a flashlight beam to even out lighting the peaks and valleys. Comes with a perfect case to keep clean. Also the image screen attached is adequate for out in the field, however true pleasure is when you plug into your fully capable computer system for the full screen look see. Take care.
David, the ones I purchased did look just like this photo. Be warned, they worked for about 3 months and then stopped working.
My son is 11 and I homeschool him using Switched-on-Schoolhouse. This microscope has worked well with the science kit we purchased. It is easy to use and magnifies just as well as any microscope I have ever used in school. I like that it has a light underneath the slide as well as a pen light above.
does not, not unless yours have BNC analogue connections. The IP cameras I've seen do not.
We currently do not sell the video cable.
They are. You cannot move both forward. They have a toe brake axis which is completely independent though .
Works with Mac OS X
Yes it will. this is by far the best pc case I've ever owned.
you need a MODEL NUMBER 90HPDV7-B44A
I bought this battery for my dv7t model NB444AV. It is a replacement for HP battery PN516355-01, Li-ion 14.4v 73Wh, series HSTNN-1B75. I would recommend spending the extra money and buying the HP OEM battery - it is more expensive but will last you. The Anker battery didn't even last me a year - I can only run my laptop on battery power for about 15 minutes before it dies.
They are supossed to work on DV7 computers, but I suggest you contact ANKER (The Manufacturer) directly. They have a great customer service.
Just reverse the leads?
I would say yes. I think it leans more toward faminine than masculine. I really like the color, but since I am a female. . . But the cover is great! If anything ever happens to it, I would replace it with another one.
It's a matted finish, this is a great product for the price. it's still going strong.
My GUESS would be to record/transfer to DVD or other device. I have never used mine. Owner's manual says "for future use"? meaning what I have NO idea-take off cover & see if connected to anything-or hook to something that records and see what happens while it's playing.
Yes
when pressed it begin to send periodically a SOS menssage with coordinates until deactivate by sending a SOS stop SMS to the gps
I HAVE THE 2TB FANTOM G & IT DOES HAVE A POWER SWITCH
They only offer 7200rpm
I've used a program called "HWinfo" on this specific external drive and it says it is a Hitachi at 7200RPM's. I recommend the Fantom brand just because of that honestly, Hitachi just doesn't make bad drives. PS. They are also known as HGST and are now owned by WD or Western Digital.
yes, 2 years parts and labor.
Yes it comes with A/V cables, you will either want too mute your tv volume or turn it down low to prevent an echo effect.
Yes it will. It works with any device that has Bluetooth capability.
Yes, the whole bottom piece is vented.
I believe it will work just fine, I have mine on my D7000 with extra battery grip and it works great.
I have an iPhone 4S but I never tried to use it with it, because the iPhone already have built in Bluetooth capable of transmitting and receiving. If you have a Bluetooth headset or hands free you'll just have to pair it with your iPhone, so there's no need for it unless the BT in your iPhone is not working. Anyway it should work with the iPhone 5 but only as a transmitter.
My suggestion would be to send it back, the one I purchased for my daughter did not last a month.
I don't use iTunes so I am unsure
Sorry but I don't know. I don't use the player for TV.
The accessories/Lens are for 52mm attachment, so I would guess that if FZ50 is not a 52mm, then you can attach step-up/step-down ring to use the lenses in this kits. The distance from the camera's own lens may varies and may affect the wide/tele- zoom ratio, though. Hope this helps.
I don't know, I don't have fz60 lumix
metal. feels really solid. and it passed my child test :D
Yes, it does.
I bought mine as a direct replacement for the model I had. You can go to Vizio's webpage and look up the proper remote for the model you have.
Good for both just recommend using a headset and not the built in speakers
Well, that would depend on how deep the tv you have is of course. But, it folds rather flush against the wall. I am beyond happy with this mount. I have a 55" tv mounted to it and when not using it, typically fold it back against the wall. And I am very happy with how close it is to the wall. Hope this was helpful?
hi, yes, it works with it. thansk
I have mine hooked up to my HR24-100. If the HR23-500 is also single-wire, it should work fine.
a little bigger than the 18'' round dish but will work with all directv receivers
I don't know about the rpms on this hard drive. What I can say is that I think it's pretty fast. So much so that I own 4 of them and have not been disappointed yet!!!!
Don't think it has enough power. Apparently needs 170W (8.5A x 20V), but my Lenovo adapter only rated for 120W.
Unfortunately, this one is a hard plastic material that doesn't grip the floor- it slips all over the place, so you'd have to tape it down or secure it somehow. You're better off getting a foam rubber type.
I have the same question. Anyone know if it works with the 6500 series? Thank you
Yes, all time
Yes. Note the part number KTT-S3B/4G To confirm visit Toshiba Direct: http://www.toshibadirect.com/td/b2c/afin.to?stt1=Laptop+PCs&stt2=Portege&stt3=All&x=11&y=9#25 216 4294967195~5~0~fprice
Sorry, it should be no. 800mm is too much zoom and the f/8.0 aperture is not fast enough. Also this is a MANUAL focus lens. For fast action/sports you would want an Auto Focus lens, probably 70-200mm and something wider than f/8.0.
I am not sure. I took the information off my original charger and when I typed in the model number, the charger I purchased came up as compatible.
They are garbage. Was broke when it arrived. Just threw it away. Pay a bit more and buy something better.
yes it comes with it best bag you will ever buy i love mine
Absolutely yes. Also it depends on how you arrange the panels, but there's room for quite a number of elements. You even get to remove all the panels and use it as a regular backpack.
Hello there. Well i dont own that lens but i do have a 75-300 mm and if it fits that one, i guess it can fit any other of the regular lenses. According to Amazon, the 75-300 lens is 6.9 inches long, and the 18-135 is 6 inches long, so it should fit. Great looking case by the way.
I have both a wireless mouse and wireless keyboard. The mouse receiver is plugged into a USB port rear of computer. The keyboard receiver is contained within the USB plug , which is plugged into another port in the front of he computer. Even though I have multiple USB ports front & back, the keyboard works best (sensitivity) plugged into the front.
It depends what you are looking for. I needed an all regions player and it seemed to provide that, but it did not last long and I replaced it with Sony which seems more solid.
No.
It's very good for a home radio studio. This equipment can do all that you are currently asking( You can Cue Tracks and will also be able to run it through a mixer). Best of of it all, you can Map it in your favourite DJ software to play all your tracks. Hope this helps
No. This is not a touch replacement.
yes, my daughter dropped hers, and I replaced the replacement monitor and everything works great.
Yes, BUT 1.) You have to set up an account with iLok via their web-sight 2.) you have to buy the license from Avid for pro tools (9 is now old) or transfer a valid license to the registered iLok USB dongle. To transfer a license to your iLok there is a fee.
You must sync the FM station on the wireless transmitter with the one on radio. Takes several trials with various stations to get best match.
Yes it will work. I have an iPhone 4 my self and it works for both. You can also plug it into the Aux plug in and it will still work either way. But yes, it works for both music and phone calls.
No
Yes, you could easily do that. You would tell monitor 1 and 2 to use "extended desktop" then tell 3 to duplicate 1 and tell 4 to duplicate 2. I just checked the settings on the one I'm using right now and it works just like you say. You would just need longer cables to reach the other location.
Yes, I have 4 monitors running off this card, all on HDMI. The card outputs four DVI's and I use a DVI-HDMI adapter on each. Great card, awesome setup. Note that I use it for business, not gaming, so I can't really make any claims to performance.
Google "Crysis 3 system requirements". A quick search shows that it requires a 5770 or higher with 1GB RAM. So, no. Or if it does, it will be at very low settings. This is a business graphics card, not for gaming.
DESKTOP. It will not fit in a laptop unless your laptop is very very big.
Hi K, Thanks for the question. This TV has a 300mm x 300mm vesa pattern and weighs 53 pounds. It will be a great fit on this Long Arm Articulating TV wall mount. Hope this helps. Contact AV-Express with more questions.
It extends very smoothly and easily to about 28". Pull somewhat harder and you get about 32" max extension. Getting it to retract when at full extension is a bit difficult as the arms are almost completely closed and they want to pivot instead of retract.
Yes
I use it with my 3200 and it works but understand that it will be a completly manual lens. auto features do not work
Yes, we have several of these Nikon FE cameras. The meters work in all of them. In addition, there is also a 90 day warranty in all our cameras. Thank you for shopping our store. We appreicate your business.
There are space to mount everything, this case is huge!!! Really really huge!
The dimension is 23x11.1x23.2; the measurements include the handle. The height and depth, not including the handle is 20x21.5 - I may be off by an inch or two.

Most laptops have an HDMI out connection. Just connect it to the device, reset the output on your laptop to HDMI, then select either HDMI 1 OR HDMI 2 using the menu on the Sony device. (Recognize that it does only have 2 HDMI inputs, so if you use your laptop for one of them, you will have only one more to connect to your satellite system or cable box.)
No it does not. It does a tremendous job of playing CDs/DVDs/BluRay disks and internet content.
My refurb was a revision 1 which was important to me since I needed to install DD-WRT. Make sure everything works properly right away, though, since I ended up with a weird one--it works with the included LAN cable in the WAN port, but not with any other cable I've tried since. Refurbs can be odd birds and hiding places for trouble.

Hi Klondyke do have analog video/audio out (3 colored plugs) in which it will work properly on you older TV. -Ely
Yes this product works. Helped me greatly
Could not install. Could not find helpful instructions.
i'm not sure but read this and you may find your answer http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Other-Notebook-PC-Questions/HP-Pavilion-dv7-1245dx-What-is-the-correct-cooling-fan-Pt/td-p/1513165
Never tried it but pretty sure it will work. It space at the top is small so you have to really press down to get the chord in so I am sure it won't fall out when it is upside down.
As far as I know they are the same. When I purchased mine they were the same price.
Yes.
Yes, the board has 4 way sli support. It has alot of room
I don't know I don't own an HP
If your stock speakers are 6.5" yes if not you will have to buy a trim ring to get them to fit securely
They couldn't be to thin. They have pretty good size magnets. I would wait until I got them before I bought or built a box for them.
Yea they would fit any 6x9 whether or not the holes align exactly is another story. You may have to drill new holes to bolt it down
No they are not.
If there is a downside to the mic, this would be it. It's a little tricky. You have to push up with your thumb in the groove enough to pull the door away with your other hand. Take your time, it will open. Unfortunately putting it back is just as tricky. Hope this helps. jeaupe
I HAD TO RETURN IT. IT DID NOT FIT INTO MY DESKTOP.
Yes, HDMI outputs both audio and video.
The ASRock E350M1 is a Mini-ITX form factor MoBo, while the Asrock P4V88 is an ATX factor MoBo. The four mounting holes in a Mini-ITX board should line up with four of the holes in ATX-spec MoBos, and the locations of the backplate and expansion slot are the same, so it should work...but you'll have limited expandability.
Sure, Minecraft has low graphic requirements.
I got the fiio e11. Just right for me and I love bass ... But not overpowering to the expense of the mids and highs.
the problem is the hook to keep the tablet in place keeps slipping so it would not work
Sorry I can't be sure. I used it in my FZ200.
Charges in a Panasonic DE-A79 Battery Charger which plugs into a standard wall outlet. You can also get a Panasonic portable charger that works in your car.
I have a Sigma 170-500 with the hood reversed that measures 10 1/4 x 4 1/4 which fits securely. Great case.
I believe it came with a USB cable. That's all I need on my desk top computer to upload pictures. I really do not now about a tablet.
Yes.
Made in Japan.
Yes it does, standard mounting.
Yes it will
Yes I have an Orion skyquest 8 and the fit perfectly with the 2" to 1 1/4" adapter that came with the scope.
I used a 32GB in this unit. Of course, the unit lasted just 30 days. Amazon did replace.
12x9 and 6 feet - I work off an executive desk, multiple monitors and my cpu on a separate console...this keyboard reaches without issue.
John, I'm not sure exactly what you're asking, but I'm actually typing on the thing this minute. In my own experience (running Windows 7) the thing is literally plug & play. I've had this one a while, but don't recall anything other than minor adjustments being necessary straight out of the box - no BIOS adjustments, etc. Hope this helps.
Provided that your gates have standard relay inputs then yes you may use this keypad. It does have 2 separate relay outputs, and you may assign different codes to each output.
If you ordered from us, it would be written on the box or bag that the fobs were shipped in. If ordering less than 100 units, we pull your credentials from a 100 unit box and make a note of the site code so that you can use your credentials.
The spool it comes on has a 16 inch diameter and is roughly 10 inches high. So figure a box of about 17x17x11 inches. I don't know how they are currently packaging these.
Sorry, can't say, as I don't have a Samsung S4 to try it with.
You can't Once you pair it calls, alarm txt msg notifications
Should has standard Bluetooth and a nice unit will sink up to 5 BT items.
It is capable of xm, but does not come with it. HD radio and satellite are additional.
The minimum requirement for Win 7 64 bit is 1GB. Although it's really slow running on 1. My work computer runs on 2GB, and I'm running win 7 64 bit.
Yes, it's a basic windows OS, so anything you can do with windows, you can do on this.
There were no instructions for reprogramming the keys, so I'm assuming they are not. If you are considering this for gaming applications, I would steer you towards a real gamer's keyboard. As a multimedia keyboard, it's pretty awesome. I hope this helps.
I think the one I got is a class 6, but since I use it in my tablet as extra storage for pictures and music speed is less important. I don't download movies or create videos where I believe higher class like 10, with max speed, may be needed. I use plenty of class 4 regulare sd cards for still photos with no problems.
Canon T4i SLR has a Touch screen LCD. This screen protector will not work.
Checked the screen size on the Canon t3i and it is 3". The 3" GGS screen protector should fit without any problems. I have a Canon with the same size screen and mine works great. You hardly know it's on there but gives great protection. I have one on several of my cameras and wouldn't hesitate to get another one if I purchase another camera.
That I don't know, but I found out it doesn't work with Cannon Rebel.
Yes it is made in japan
They indicate that they are fog proof

Don't believe so! I ordered it and then figured out it wasn't worth anything so returned it. Thought it was cheaply made and would not easily work with my camera system.
No. You cannot use these RAM for your MAC, these are just for PC, you need these others ones: http://www.amazon.com/Crucial-PC3-12800-204-Pin-Notebook-CT102464BF160B/dp/B006YG8X9Y
I am so sorry, but I would have no way of knowing. I have the 55" that I control with my Dish Network remote. Do you have cable or satellite tv? You must be on the proper input for that HMDI 1 or HDMI 2. That's the only possibility that I can think of other than a malfunctioning unit. Good luck....
Yes, If it is with the stock intel cooler..the thermal paste is already on the fan assembly
This is not a laptop processor. Those are usually designated with an "M" for mobile. That being said, the majority of modern laptops today use a processor that is directly soldered to the motherboard. Processors of this nature use a BGA socket. Mobile, replaceable, intel based processors use a Socket G2. But knowing which processors are compatible with your laptop takes a lot of research and often it is better and cheaper to just get a new laptop.
The lid for the drive is installed in a clean room when it is built. If you remove it, you can kill the drive due to contamination. I believe that they display a photo of it without the lid and showing the platters so that customers don't get the impression that it is a solid state drive.
about 4 or 5 years
I didn't see one. However I do not have an optical cable. I just remember cables
Have an SUV this subs shake it right to left n up n down ,,,,,had em for 6 yrs,,,,,wrkd flawless some. Punks brOke my car glass.

Yes, if your 90" Sharp is under 150lbs. According to the manufacturer's website, this model supports TVs up to 150 lbs.
This would be a great lens for that camera.
Yes. Mind you, it's manual focus.
I could never get the Prolific drivre to work under 64 bit WIN7. I don't know about WIN8. Try a converter that uses the FTDI Driver.
I don't know personally I have a Z33, but I won't recommend these batteries to ANYONE!!! They have no lasting power, they seem to be repacks of generic batteries, the original batteries from fuji gave me over 200 pictures on one battery charge these are lucky if I get 80 or maybe 90 if I am really lucky, DON't wast your money, I bought 2 and am so sorry I did. Hope it helps, I just wish I could find the real thing once again, i miss the real batteries from FUJI
In 2020.
Yes, I received 10 batteries with my order.
Its not wireless...here is a usb wire to plug into the computer to charge it and an auxiliary cord to plug into your device
No.
It displays a clock (which I've found to be very inaccurate), and it's how you program the intervalometer. That's the bit that allow you to do time lapse photography, or take a sequence of 3 photos, 15 seconds from now - i.e. automatic, timed shutter release. Programming instructions have been posted here somewhere, but I've not used it yet.
Yes
Seems to work fine in my hp laptop. Don't know about long term durability, only time will tell.
Yes, but there were 2 command buttons on top that were not exactly the same from the original, but it doesn't matter at all...
no, it does not work well and the key board is all wobbly and unstable while typing and in use. kindly send an appropriate one and replace it. thanks for the query.
Yes
I bought this case for my 2009 model of the 13 in MBP and it fits perfectly fine on it.
No, it didn't fit the 2013 model either.
2.5", laptop size.2.5" SATA(III) / SATA(II) HDD/SSD
I believe it will not 100% sure.
The Twelve South Magic Wand is just a piece of plastic that holds your apple keyboard (wireless) and magic trackpad together. It does not come with the actual keyboard and trackpad (those are bluetooth and sold separately).
Yes it will
Someone mentioned in a review that there were two slots opened. So with there being four slots in total, you can safely assume that it is two 2gb dimms.
Not a Nexus 10 but I do use it with my Nexus 7 & love it. All the android buttons work great. I think its size would make more sense with the Nexus 10 vs 7. It looks slightly out if place with the 7. I think with the 10 it would seem a perfect fit.
It looks like a matte finish to me.
No it doesn't, but you can find the correct part on other sites. Ebay for example.
Works on all my family's Apple devices. iPod, iPad, iPad 2, iPad mini, iPhone 5. Easy to connect via Bluetooth. Can't imagine it wouldn't work on a 5s.
Hello, email verbatim support and they said there is no print screen button on the keyboard
this works good with windows 8 but the software included is out of date and i am now unable to use the device without spending money on current software
Place antenna on outside of vehicle as high as possible. Test position of glass mount prior to final install as explained in the install directions. When listening while parked, make sure antenna has clear view of southern sky (no large trees buildings in way).
Should be ok. Last time I bought quantum batteries, they seem to last longer than regular batteries
I believe these both might be comparable. I had taken this as a gift and this was not as expensive as others. The friend to whom it was gifted is really impressed with the camera. however, the issue he has is the battery life. These cameras use AA alkaline cells the GE takes about 20-25 photographs with 2 cells. It would be better to buy the AA lithium ion batteries which will last longer. HTH. Thanks and Regards.
Yes, it'll fit.
The top of the stand itself is 48". With the TV bracket set for the lowest possible position the vertical center of the screen is 50"
I have this stand in my home office. To date, no problems with IR on my DVR due to shelf height. The stand is easy to assemble and very sturdy (supporting 50" Samsung TV), and really nice cable management. If concerned about IR line-of-sight interference, I suggest an IR repeater mounted to your TV.
we had same problem
Yes, I have. Will post it online soon. Zonesystem
No. The Canon hv30 does not accept interchangeable lenses.
I'd suggest asking manufacturer. They respond quickly.
Yes it will but you need to use The FT-1 Mount Adapter to attach it the Nikon J1 camera and then attach F-Mount NIKKOR lens to the adapter. The FT-1 will add an angle of view of 2.7 times that of the F-Mount NIKKOR lens' focal length. And so, you will effectively have a 189-567mm zoom lens.
Plays mp3, not sure about MWA...............
Hit the ok button on the remote
I have Linux Mint 15 and I use this to connect to my Motorola DRIOD RAZR MAXX for internet access, and for copying files. Depending upon the age of your distribution, you may need to remove your existing bt package and install the bluez package. Search your distribution's forum to find out what's needed.
No, it does not have a camera.
I didn't have any problems. Just plugged it in and started using it
Yes.
Answer: It holds any headphones. so yes. Clamps onto a desk's edge both vertically and horizontally. Comment: Beats are not worth the price you pay for them. Much better options out their.
Yes i love it.Thank you.
Hi Shree, the Sony Battery Sheet is compatible on that Sony VAIO model. -Vincent
i wouldn't recommand you taking apart the computer yourself since it might void the warranty, You should contact ASUS about this.
Works great with my Adobe Photoshop 10 i use it for video / photo editing and gaming but there are faster processors for the same price now if your motherboard can take them
Yup, its been fixed ever since the first shipment of the XA1s in mid-march. So no worries :&gt;
I'm not sure of the style HP laptop but the screen is a 15.6. The replacement screen fit perfectly and works well.
No. It doesn't. There is a soft "lip" between the zipper and the tablet face. AND the zipper is plastic without sharp edges.
Yes
Found this info for the Toshiba, so looks like the 2-pack should work. Memory Type: DDR2 PC2-5300, DDR2 PC2-6400, DDR2 (non-ECC) Maximum Memory: 4GB - 200-pin SODIMM Slots: 2
I cannot guarantee it will, but 3.5mm is used in various applications: iPhones, car stereo aux. ports, headphones, etc. so I believe a pair of beats would be compatible. Best of luck
Hello, Our longest cable length is 12ft but we do have extension cables to add onto the cable for your preferred length. I attached a link below to the extension cable. http://www.amazon.com/Mediabridge-3-5mm-Extension-Cable-Feet/dp/B00M8CPWC4 Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support
No, but I use my ps3 as a media server to stream from my PC. You can do the same with an Xbox360.
No to both of those questions.
With a big enough array of panels, yes, but not with just 2. The inverter will give you 110 ac.. but major appliances you will not have enough amps. Laptop works great, but desktops draw too much.. get 4-6 agm batteries in parallel. .. you can put them in series to give you more than 12 volts, but you will need another inverter. .. the one that comes with it is a cheap 12dc sine wave inverter . I user mine for lights and electric horse fences. Good luck
it works fine with mine, I have never used batteries.
The LGA 1150 shares a close similarity to my gigabyte motherboard. The complete package includes the necessary equipment to properly install it. So, yes, it will work.
Yes it came with a few to pick from in different sizes and shapes.
No, it does not have volume control--you have to adjust volume on the main device.
Hi, thanks for contacting us. Unfortunately we do not ship internationally. I am sorry and if there is anything else I can do for you or if you have any other questions please let me know. Sincerely, Chris Nickels Red Planet Trading
Of course, jeeze it's got 128MB RAM. My first computer had a total of 640k RAM total! (but no HD)
I wouldn't use it in a 220 volt outlet. It's only rated at 110 volts.
Nope. I use rechargeable AAs
Yes I have to Orange rx and works no problem.
If both boats have the same receiver for that transmitter yes you can, but you will have to bind the trans to each boat as you use it, but they should be on the same fequencys" you do not change that, just rebind. You use the little chip with the red flag that came with receiver. Hope that helps you.
No but its comes with a nice travel bag
Each ear cup swivels 180degrees but dont know what You meen exactly.
E9K and E17 are the newer pair. E9 only works with E7. I had the reverse problem. I bought the E9K and E7 so I needed to buy the E17. Once I did that everything worked great.
I modified the door so I could plug in and with a 32 gig card you could prob. cover a few days. With out plug in, I taped 4 hours at the highest video quality. Hope that helps.
With a 64 gig memory card both batteries will give you 8 straight hours of recording time All depends on your memory card as well Hope this helps !!!
Nota yet, the camera needs the Wifi backpack or hero 3
Yes. it works with Nikon d7100. However, I don't know whether it works with TC-20E III 2x Teleconverter. As you know it is a macro lens and it is not telephoto lens and diagram is important so teleconventer may disturp the macro photos.
mine does - the AF stands for AutoFocus. It will work with the 5200, see the Amazon product website for compatibility listing.
No, you cannot. F/2.8 is only available for objects that are far enough. For the closest objects (0.38m) it will be F/5.6.
RMS is a measure of continuous Power in Watts with little to no sound quality distortion, unlike Peak Out put Power which manufacturers usually proudly display with stickers on their units. RMS is usually around 70% of peak power.
Can't answer that question, the clock never worked for me, other then a regular clock.... I reviewed it as nooooo good.
it needs to be plugged into the wall. Only the time on the clock is battery operated
If it's a r shallow or punch shallow. No more than 6 inch depth. Don't think a regular prime will fit.
i have a kicker-comp/s 10" woofer, does the job well
I do not think so
Yea
You will get the value that you paid through which ever company you bought device from, you must have confirmed receipt of purchase price on file with square trade. So if they cant fix your device and you paid 250, you will get 250 back.
I do not know, but I will let you know I have not BEEN able to get Square Trade to cover the two new tablets I purchased
As long as you have a "line out " or "headphone" jack on your Sirius receiver, it will work. I put one of these in my accord, and it works great! No more bouncing from station to station. Helpful videos on youtube for installation as well.
No and none with my Mac book
I reviewed the contract and there doesn't seem to be a deductible. We purchased the 3-year plan WITH ADH (accidental handling).
Square trade uses your receipt to determan your coverage amount.
Not if it's a refurbished tab. If it's a new tab then yes, you'll be covered, just make sure you contact Square Trade all the time since they take a while to get back to you.
I bought mine separate, but you must have a receipt.
I would call them
You should look for a lapto plan, but I not sure, I think there's one of the same planes that cover but not sure if was this or not
Your best bet is to contact Customer Service at 1-877-927-7268 or email them at st-questions@squaretrade.com. I have found them to be very helpful and professional when it comes to answering questions.
The coverage starts approximately 2 days after purchase. I received mine on the 22nd of October, and the coverage started on the 24th of October!! Once you get their paperwork from Square Trade, your coverage has generally already started. You MUST contact Square Trade to register your tablet. They need the information off of the tablet.
believe it does but you can verify that by going to Amazon
You have to buy @ the beginning of the purchase. Also - you must keep your purchase receipt for the item for the entire length of the SQ warranty period even though you've registered your warrant! If you need to file a claim, they'll ask for a copy of that receipt. The paranoid side of me thinks they're betting most won't have that receipt and therefore SQ won't have to honor that claim.
5.25 inches. I wouldn't recommend this sub. I would move up to the P1 at least.
I would not. 1 ohm is too low for this sub, its a great sub, but not designed for 1 ohm load.
Yes
Hello, Yes! there is an internal 100hz Xover in the cab, Hope that helps, 8thstreet Music
I got for my daughter. She said it took awhile to fit. But once you get it. Then it's ok. She likes it.
Good question. It's an empty hole. It serves no purpose. It's just there.
No. Not unless you are a serious hacker. It has a custom power, HDMI and Micro USB connector that align with the Zoom.
It's been a long time since I bought it but I am pretty sure that it did. I bought it because the standard jack wore out and this charges through special contacts on the bottom.
I couldn't say for sure. Compare the xyboard dimensions with the Xoom. That should help.
there are many secondary market cases for the Motorola Xoom, most can be had for a song and a dance - especially since Motorola discontinued this wonderful tablet this past year.
Yes. The set does not have a wireless network adapter built-in. It does have a USB port, and Panasonic sells a USB wireless adapter that will add wireless capability, however the wireless adapter is rather pricey compared to a "standard" USB wireless adapter.
JVC Everio 3D browser & Player. That will allow you to edit the 3D videos you take by this machine and change into other format so you can burn a DVD or Blu-ray disc or play on youtube/iphone...etc, also you can use this software to watch 3D video on your 3D monitor/screen if you have one.
This system has composite/RCA audio inputs on the back (the red and white cables for left and right audio), so with a mini jack to RCA cable you could plug in any MP3 player/audio device with a standard mini jack output. There is no headphone output from this system. The only outputs are HDMI and the connections to the speakers.
Yeah just ordered it and would really like to know what the best settings are also.
I heard the same thing from a Best Buy salesman. After reading all of the negative comments, I'm not so sure.
Mine too, after about a year. Seems to be common for this TV. Mine could not be cost effectively repaired.
Says 60hz looks same as my 240hz
Nope.

yes
Yes, you can rewind and record over a section, but be careful not to record over subsequent sections of your previous recording that you want to keep. And yes, there are multiple folders and files. Each time you hit the stop button that recording terminates. When you then Hit record again, it creates a new file. So, to stay within your current recording file and not create another, use the pause button.
yes 2 AA batteries. you will love the camera. Regards Patricia
Yes, this is the second time it has happened to me. I will try with universal charger when I get home or have to buy another battery within 6 months. .
YES! It comes with a battery, but it did not last very long, I had to buy a new battery. It was very cheap.
It works with 6th Generation, but I'm not sure about the 7th.
I had a diffrent problem wth mine and it quit working to I dont know why its doing that but I just got me another one think its an 8 2 0 and so far no problems wth it...
I played with the menu selection and picked " scenery"Its ok, but if your willing to go further on really nice photos, I bought a lens adapter & wide lens kit. Extra $ 60.? or so I think for an adapter & separate lenses. Hope this helps you. Good luck..
I'm not sure that this will solve your problem; however, try taking out the batteries and putting them back in, and see if this releases your lock up. If not, customer service will walk you through what to try next. They are very helpful, and stayed on the phone with me through the whole process of fixing when I had my problem. If they can't fix it, you will probably have to send the camera in for repair or replacement. Good luck
Yes it is and is fantastic
I am not sure why they dothis. It could be that the opriginal list price dropped and they didnt update their list price.
Yes it will but my screen have stop coming up but I love my it the company want me to pay to send it back and I got it about 4 months ago on top of that I love it just miss my screen cant control all the features
Megan I think it will u just gonna have to buy the adapter n make it fit ur car..... But it should work just fine..... I had to custom my adapter cause when the screen comes out it would let it all the way out.
Yea i had 2 jl12w7's and it pushed them pretty hard
U.S ground only.
Yes
It might be that the interface for your trackpad is shot.
I don't have the model notation in front of me but I used it in the Macbook Pro 13" mid-2010 model quite a while ago and it still works perfectly.
you do send it back to pyramid a 1 year limited warranty is always something you get from a manufacturer
I feel it will give you a good bass line but as far as maxing out, no. It's a decent amp for what your paying for it but it's defiantly not top of the line. You'll get a solid hit. Those speakers are single voice coil so you should be ok.
This really depends on your cars alternator. Im assuming its for a car. So 800x4 =3200 peak. Power is VxI. V=voltage=12v. 3200/12=267amps. So at peak power your alternator needs to supply 267 amps. My car is a v6 with an alternator that supplys 120 amps at 2000rpm. Yours may be higher or lower. It takes around 65 to 75 amps to run an engine. So youre missing about 200amps at peak power. If youre stupid like me youll blowout and fry this amp in a day.
back of the camera to the right the trash can will take you to deleting.
Im not sure I just bought one on here a few weeks ago and it said it was made in Jan of 2013. The EasyShare software it automatically tries to download when you plug the cam for the first time has been discontinued so your going to have to go to Kodak's website and download the "Share Button App" for win or mac that software will work with this cam.
SDHC
AA -- Original answer. Revised answer - I should have said two AA batteries. Sorry for the poorly worded answer. Since purchasing the camera, I have invested in a battery charger and a set of rechargeable AA's, which will pay for themselves over time. The charger also works with AAA's which I use in other applications.
Hello Jill, all you do is go to the menu screen, you will se two tabs "capture and setup" choose the set up tab by pressing the "ok" button. Then simply go down to where it says format, press the "ok" button and you will see two options, memory card or internal memory, make your choice click "ok" and you are set! Have Fun!
What does kids mean?
No. I purchased the adapter and nothing happened. It's a great deal for the price. Hoping that some wizard figures out how to make it happened!
Mine works with no exterior antenna on my modem.
Replacement batteries do not appear to be available. You might communicate with the manufacturer directly, but since these units are quite inexpensive, you might be money ahead to just buy a new one. Sorry.
I am typing this reply on my iPad (1st Gen.) using my just-unboxed keyboard. So, the answer to your question is "Yes"! (You will need the CCK USB adapter and to move through the message you'll get initially that this is an unsupported device, which apparently comes when any USB keyboard is first connected.)
No it's not, I thought it was when I bought it. That is what I really wanted because I couldn't the keys at night on the keyboard before. I can see the keys on this one better than the other one I had. I don't have any problem with it so far. i love it.
Not sure on the exact distance limitation but I just walked about ten feet away and it still worked, then I went into another room and still worked with a wall in the way. So if you're thinking about using it with a media center from across the living room, you should be fine.
Yes, Tighten the knobs as tight as possible to get the best connection. Turn the red and black knobs so they fit snuggly do on the wires.
Sorry, but as Gary P says, "middle of the road units". Still, if youre in the middle of the road, why not travel cheaply and well. Im delighted with mine. Paul H.
I am not quite sure but I bought this sub to match my Pioneer home theatre speakers and I kid you not it thumps! Downside of it all is I dont used my home theatre sounds that much cause it would shake my whole apartment complex. I wasnt sure what amount of power the sub punch! I have to keep turning down the volume cause it would rattle the whole complex. You have to be to mix the sound right during set up. Once you got it right then watch out!
Hi Jessica, I'm really sorry, but I don't know what a WB210 is? I'm not very knowledgeable on all the latest technology these days! Ha-ha :-)
I don't think so...
I really do not know. The only reason I am responding to this is that you should send it back. I had two of those ... the first was replaced but after 6 months the second one went bad. Amazon did not help since it was after 3 months and Toshiba was absolutely no help. Hopefully you have better luck. I am surprised it does not say on the TV itself.
No it doesn't
Wifi only for the apps they no have internet explorer and set up in the preference men Ajust then preferences
If you have the screw in the bottom of the DSLR, then yes it can be used.
If you also have an amplifier or if they are powered speakers, yes.
Ours is although it takes an Ethernet cord plugged into it so it is not Wi-Fi. Thanks, Computer World
Yes. I'm using it on Arch Linux 64 bit and Windows 7 64 bit, and it works fine with both. It supports the latest Nvidia drivers still, which is nice.
Noup it doesn't
Yes. I use it for that all the time. You leave the legs short and spread them out wide and you can get down pretty low.
100% yes and this is how I use mine ! I keep my camera tight on the MF's head and loop my hand threw the hoop and adjust the length to a good height. This also has a formidable weight, strength and distance for warding off other annoyances !
Yes it will. I have the xt and use it with the new 18-55mm lens.
It's gonna be a super tight fit. I doubt it.
No, unless you want to just put it on top of a router or server. There are no mounts for it.
Yes they are. Very easy and they stay where you set them.
Hi: I bought this for a friend. He has not taken a lot of pictures yet as he is just getting through the change from film to digital. I have looked at most of the pictures he has taken and I have not seen any evidence of any undesirable effects from using this filter holder and the clear filter.
Go to www.crutchfield.com. Every possible question you have can be answered there.
Go to www.crutchfield.com that will answer any question you have.
The keyboard was perfect. Never know it was replaced and it works with no problems
It works on my x100. I don't have the "s" version, but I don't think that anything has been changed regarding the flash interface. I also have the EF-x20. It is more expensive, but a much nicer flash because of the manual controls for EV and manual flash. If the EF-x20 has a negative (besides the price) it would be the AAA batteries vs the AA batteries for the EF-20. I use rechargeable batteries for both of these flashes, but the AAA's don't last very long (carry an extra set).
yes perfectly
Sorry I don't know -we have an X S-1 and it works great with our's.
No. It doesnt
Apple site may have one......but I returned this because it sounded like junk. Got a Logitech and we are so happy!
The remote has a "SOUND" button that you press multiple times until you get to the selection (surround, bass or treble) you want and then you press the arrow buttons to adjust up or down. It also has a "PRESET EQ" button for "HEAVY", "SOFT", "CLEAR", "VOCAL" or "FLAT" choices.
Have this unit in a living/dining room area so haven't used the alarm feature but I will tell you the sound is amazing for this little unit - bought one for my son.
Absolutely not. This is a surround sound for a TV only, make sure you put it ear high, as the speakers are rather small and have directive sound. It has a good sound to it.
They're dishwasher safe but they probably won't help in that situation a whole lot
The same company makes the 6" size in black. The name is Nite Ize GT6-2PK-01 Gear Tie Reusable 6-Inch Rubber Twist Tie, 2-Pack, Black. If you look in the "Customers also bought..." section of the site advertising these 3" ones, you'll see a direct link to the 6" ones.
I don't believe so.
Yes they will work and they will probably sound great, but you won't be able change volume or answer calls with them. They are designed only for listening. I hope this helps you.
Straight jack. Short cable, good for device on hip, but a little short for my laptop docked at work. A DJ told me about them.
No it's not. I had to call First Alert directly, to obtain the respective single camera. I'd recommend calling them. Good luck!
The add for the one said it did video and it did not have video,also the phot that it took was not what you see through the binoculars.The photo was a normal photo of what you see with the naked eye. The construction was poor...I have no idea if it will work with windows 8 as I threw it in the trash when I realized the quality was so poor.
Sorry but no. Not enough current to run the heating coil that long.
Mine didnt work 1 week after I got it!
You are asking the wrong person, the wrong question. If you go to a search engine and type the battery numbers, you may find a cross reference. This is all I can say. You may have to go on HP website to find your answers.
No, still only Netflix, Vudu, CinemaNow and YouTube
Not that I know of, it's a very basic unit
It would not recognize either a dvd or bluray
I am unfamiliar with NTFS. What would an example of that be? I'd be happy to help with more information.
It has a slot for an sd card and flash drive
It fits my ELPH 330HS. According to the Canon web site, this case fits the ELPH series. It was a tight fit initially with my ELPH; however with use, the case has stretched a bit.
They're not designed to fit over glasses, and the gasket doesn't have gaps for the temple pieces, although that can be easily addressed. I would say no, they're not going to work well with most glasses.
Mine does. Still need to practice with it, but it should work for you.
Yes it will support a micro ATX board
Just to let you know thes speakers are good but if you want loud and clear these wouldn't do it go with Pioneer infinity ect
CHINA - it's of very high quality in every respect
four
It's straight.
Have you checked the outlet it's plugged into to see if it's hot? If you experienced a power surge when the outage occurred it may have fried the power supply. (We had this happen to several devices plugged into a surge suppressor when we had a lightning strike.) If you've only had this monitor for a short time (less than the 1 yr warranty coverage) you might contact Dell for guidance. Other than that, I can only suggest you have a tech look at it to determine cause and possible repair.
Yes, I have done it. You have to give them each their own email sign-on and that will identify which one is "active" at the time for updates.
I haven't owned the "GO 730" to compare to, but this one DEFINITELY has high volume. It startled me when it spoke and I needed to turn it down. I am not a fan of blasting my radio with hard rock and driving with the windows down though, so I guess it could be considered not loud enough in those conditions.
This is correct.... but I would say the other way around.... this radio comes with it's antenna. Yes, you need two of them to make a link
No - you will have to supply your own cable.
Yes
If your looking for an in wall sub try home theatre direct, they have great products. If not try the klipsch sub 12. I have both and they perform great with the quintet system and deliver great bass. I have two sets of quintets in my home. Hope this helps
Yes, these are the latest quintet set that Klipsch currently offers. I ordered mine from Amazon for the same reason. Lol and they are worth the money.
I bought two extra speakers on eBay. Someone bought a second set for two extra speakers and sold the center and two speakers separately
Sorry but don't know. I bough mine for a D80 and a D3100. You have a VERY nice lens!
Yes. You can plug the speakers in just about any device
Deviled quail eggs
Simply put Yes. To avoid confusion, I am running W7 Ultimate 64bit. I cannot speak for any other OS but I would assume the answer would be yes as well.
go to menu and look for reset or settings and it will be in there....else call VISO toll free
Yes.you can its already Internet ready and has a lot of apps to download like Netflix YouTube amazon etc.
Yes, which is exactly why I bought a bunch of them.
yes
Works well with my Sony Blu Ray player so I don't see why not. Stream is consistent with no buffering. 802.11n
I've used it this adapter on vista, windows 7, and windows 8.1. It has worked fine on all of them. I've never tryed it with windows m.e but I searched it on google and it said it is compatible
Yes does your camera have 2 points to attach a strap? Or you could feed 2 of these throught the one point on your camera and use a traditional neck strap. As these are very small. If you have trouble feediong these through the ring on your camera use a small wire to pull them through.
Yes it will.
Yes. I have one and we use a PC (windows) a Mac Air, iPhone, S3, and a children's tablet.
I can't imagine that it wouldn't be I use it with Windows.
I live in a 80ft. Mobile home and works great,it is great while I am outside also
Yes it will. I have used it with my iPad "4".
I have used it on my Nexus 7 tablet, which runs the same version of Android OS. Just tested it on my Galaxy S3; it works. Both the keyboard and touchpad are fully functional.
Yes they are normal size, except that it doesn't have the extra numerical keypad on the right side. It can best be compared to the keypad of an 15 inch laptop computer.
yes it can fit ok
The case does not stretch.
Yes, it has 1 component out, 1 HDMI out and 1 Digital Audio Out (optical).
My understanding is this player does not support Amazon Prime. I also verified this with live chat. Bummer.
So-So. It's fairly easy to remove, but it probably takes 2-3 seconds; no problem with walking. Putting it on takes maybe 10 seconds and is a bit harder to do while walking. It's easier to put on than some reviewers report - you don't need to turn it inside out. Neoprene slides very easily, even over zoom lenses, but snapping the snaps means you have to line them up and look at them to do it.
No :-( You can on their TVs but on on the damn Blu-ray player! Boooo!
yvonne avery, We're sorry to hear that you're having issues with your Blu-Ray player. Without more information, it's difficult to determine what might be happening. Please reach out to the Samsung customer service center for live troubleshooting and further assistance. We look forward to helping you out. --Mr. S
No, it is not, after will I find out the 3D is not working right. Do know if it is the unit or the glasses. I don't recomand this because the first delievery was defacted and I had to return and this one works but not the 3D
Not at all !!! Sound is clear and complete ...
No only U.S. and Canadian marine frequencies
Yes. Pretty much every object in your house or workplace (aside from a clean room) acts as a capacitor in some form and contains static. Using a pad with the wrist strap will guarantee no static damage to whatever electronic components you're working on.
Yes
Sorry I have not tried all share as of this date. I did purchase a usb for wifi and watch all of my videos etc on the tv which is fabulous!
No. It does not have that app as of yet. You will need an internet streaming device like roku, Apple TV, wii etc.
My guess would be yes, as long as the Chromebook has a USB port.
"it is clearly not really meant to be portable but you could use it this way. To be clear though you will not get any better connection than you get wherever you set up the extender... So if you have a good connection by the desk but want to browse from the bed I guess this could be helpful. "
Sorry Nilda, the one I bought for my grandson as a Christmas gift was not used until several months later when his family flew out to visit me, by then it was too late to return it and it didn't work, it just spun around. If I were you I would return it while you can, ours was just a piece of junk!
No. The iPod Touch 5th gen has a lightening connector and the radio has the old 30 pin connector.
No does not work to charge the phone.
Hi there, This item does not require a computer the built in projector can be used on any room or wall up to 70" diagonally. Regards
Up to 8 feet away and then you have a focus lever on the camera that you can adjust for clarity.
It is a decent camera, but I think I would upgrade to something a bit more powerful next time, not a lot of detail in the pictures when inside.
Sorry Nilda, the one I bought for my grandson as a Christmas gift was not used until several months later when his family flew out to visit me, by then it was too late to return it and it didn't work, it just spun around. If I were you I would return it while you can, ours was just a piece of junk!
UV filter coating imbues a slight color tinge, and reduces the amount of light. Clear is actually preferable. UV filtering is unnecessary with modern lenses.
The filter has a 67mm thread on the rear so you can screw it onto the front of you lens. The filter has a small lip on the front of the filter for your lens cap to clip on to.
I live in a long valley. The antenna only worked in one location for us and that was not in the area where we have TV. I live about 10 miles east of San Francisco so many stations should be available. We decided to stay with comcast for now. Wish I could return my Walltenna. Charles
Slow won't buy again!
My response said that the card worked flawlessly in my D200 with it being 24 GB'S larger than the manual recommends. The D800 uses SD, the D700 uses CF
I don't believe that it will as the dimensions are different than the 2006 macbook. The case fits -exactly- over my macbook so any difference in length/width and whatnot would cause it not to fit correctly.
Its a weird pink... But it is completely see through! It won't hide any scratches! Plus, I found out this case is actually made for DELL computers but it sort of fits this MacBook... I actually took it off already because it doesn't really fit and it doesn't look too good! I would recommend you go on www.ebay.com and search "MacBook A1181 case" and you will find the perfect case for this MacBook! Just don't buy this one
I don't know the answer to this question, all I know is that it didn't fit my computer properly. Sorry I couldn't provide an answer...
I have hooked a monitor up to my laptop to watch Netflix and have the above speakers connected to my laptop for the sound. In my office the sound is good and I listen to my iTunes as well. These certainly are not loud speakers nor meant for a large room.
Hi, this Sony Personal Audio Docking System uses 30-pin connecter and is compatible with iPod touch (1st-4th gen), iPod nano (2nd-6th gen), iPod video, iPhone 3G, 3GS, 4 and 4S. Using an adaptor (30 pin to 8 pin) is not guarantee to work on this device. -Ely
About 40 ft. give or take
I use Sanyo rechargeable batteries that are superior to all others so last longer. Deoends on your batteries.
I would just buy a new laptop ! It is easier.
I had the same concern but I just received mine and it does. It is a tiny whole on the right side of the machine which seems to work very well. This is an impressive machine but of course I am waiting for Windows to download 29 'important' updates.
Yes you can if any how your amp my burned or on protection mode
TV is not necessary for playing music CD's, DVD's or Blu-Ray sound disks. The sound will come from your speakers & not the TV, but you can also use the TV speakers if you like.
Two things: 1. Make sure that the TV option for sound is set to the internal speakers, otherwise it will direct the sound signal to the mini-plug sound output jack on the back of the set (this is used to send the signal to another amplifier to drive external speakers). 2. Make sure that any routing of the HDMI signal to and from other devices is arranged properly (i.e. devices-&gt;inputs of receiver and Input to TV is from the TV-out hdmi port)
You have to manually set what surround setting you want, it does not automatically detect it. I think that's what you were asking and I hope it helps.
The wrist strap, belt clip and necklace lanyard should all come with the pendant. If you need one we will be happy to mail you one www.ATS-TN.com (Assistive Technology Services)
I'm really don't know....I have a KW-ADV790 Arsenal CD/DVD player installed in my car.
I recommend a mono amplifier
The speaker is in the handset.
Yes, both cords.
If you can afford it why not get the MacBook Pro?!? The Xoom is great but I am not sure that you can compare a full-fledged laptop to a tablet. You should evaluate if you need a lot of storage, a bigger screen, full software suites etc. Then go with the MBP. If you want portability, like being a geek and mess around with the Android OS (and are willing to sacrifice some functionality until all bugs have been fixed in Honeycomb) then buy the Xoom. But in general they are not really comparable devices!
yes
Hello, I use theme for my Wacom Intuos 5 and all work perfectly, much better than the genuine ugly one !
Block near USB is 9.5mm large - 12.5mm deep and 8mm thick
It is called a defective TV. get if fixed or return it.
Yes its a big trick, it is really ten feet, they just says its 50 feet. You figured it out, good for you. LOL
As clearly stated, one is for Android devices and the other is for iPhone/iPod/iPad.
Yes, it has quick forward/back jump within tracks.
yes, it does
Hi, this Sony CD player requires a speaker system or you may connect it to an amplifier or receiver to here the sounds. This unit doesn't have a build in speakers. -Ely
I am not sure I understand your question. The only noise the machine make is when changing disks.
Yes, this will power that and more, actually this psu is way more than needed to power those components you have, for this kind of these little details you need to know, you can use a PSU calculator, google "thermaltake psu calculator" and you will find a very useful tool and will tell you an approximate wattage needed for the components you add to the calculations in the tool.
Works great with my SLI setup too. It is pci-e
I am really not sure. I bought it for my camera (Canon ELPH 300 HS) and didn't do any research if it would work with other Canon cameras. Sorry, I wasn't much help for you. Good luck.
If you take the time and read the owners manuel that came on the CD with the camera, you will find these instructions on page 30. I suggest you read the entire manuel.
If you received the remote with it. Yes
I would believe so. At least the harness adaptor. It's tge sane as any aftermarket radio as far as install kits go. If your car requires a kit to install any radio, it'll need a kit for this one. Kit is super cheap anyways.
Any place. Look here on amazon. I bought my dash kit on Amazon and wiring harness at best buy. The main companies for the dash kit are metra and scosche.
80watts
It works on MacBook pros, but if you have the latest model of a MacBook Air, then the upper row of keys doesn't line up.
No
Mine works fine. It plays DVD but not blue ray DVD
Good Afternoon, We have this model AVXMTGHR1D but it is a 7". Thank you.
Yes, the case fits my iPad 3 perfectly.
It should fit. However I'm not sure that it will fit but it should. You might want to see if its available at a store near you that way you'll know for sure if it will fit before you buy it.
Unfortunately no. It doesn't fit the 3147. I doubt if it will fir the 3148. You can get the laptop into the sleeve, but then you cannot close it at all.
It has been a nice case for my wife's Acer with zero complaints, but I do not know about the fit for the new MacBook.
Yes very well.
I have taken it on an international flight with multiple security checks and no problems.
I can't say for certain, but I measured the foam that came inside that fit slightly snug and it is 1/4 inch shy of 15. I measured it diagonally. The cover is stretchy, so it might work. I hope this helps.
your laptop is 15.08" and the inside of the case is.... Internal Dimensions: 14.7" x 2.2" x 11.2" ( L x W x H) So I would think it would be a tight fit or not at all.
I did a few tests on it and it does look like its water resistance. I put my laptop in it and ran water from a faucet. I have been in pretty heavy rain with it, never longer than about 15 seconds, and it never got wet. Hope this helps!
HI, I bought my two pairs from Amazon in the United States and I brought them to Costa Rica. They work perfectly here.
Yes
I know exactly what you're talking about and that happens to mine as well from time to time. You probably can't work the volume on the tv either while it's happening too, right? Usually, what I would do is unplug it for the night and the next day when I wanted to watch it, I would plug it back in and the lower right corner glitch would go away. I will say that is my biggest gripe with the tv, but it's just a glitch and unplugging it always worked for me in the past. Hope this helps!
My set up is currently only running 5.1 and has no problems. The layout of my living room makes it difficult to use all 7 speakers. If you choose this system and hook in the Audessy michrophone, it will realize only 5.1 are connected.
Use Stereo mode or Mono. - outputs identical sound through all speakers. See page 28-29 of user guide for more sound settings.
It has a 2 year warranty.
HDMI card is broken. Onkyo will fix it.
Your best bet would be to replace the fans. The front and top fan have a while led. The red shown in the picture is bus decoration/what it would look like when someone would build one and put in something with red LEDs. Also the LEDs get brighter the more you increase the fan speed. The top and bottom fans are 200mm I believe. So if you wanted to replace them it would be easy to find others.
Wouldn't know from experience, but it is per this: http://www.corsair.com/en-us/graphite-series-600t
YES and make sure the sub you buy accepts speaker wire input, and not just RCA
It should work. I'd check the wiring or try another hdmi port.
has a amp in side of it if that helps u
mAh = milli-ampere hour. It is a measure of battery capacity. Electronics use, or draw, energy that's measured in amperes(A). So a 1500mAh battery can power an electronic device with a draw of 1mA for 1500 hours, or a device that draws 1.5A for one hour.
Yes, a battery is included.
I really don't know unless it is for a new camera that is the same then yes, I don't see why you could not use the original battery and charger.
You are probably looking at the 60Hz on the AC power supply. All US AC electrical current operates at 60Hz. The 240Hz refers to tthe screen refresh rate,
O, If your warranty ended and you're in the U.S., register your television online for the additional 3 months of warranty on your product. Then, try calling the Samsung customer service center, mention that you registered for the additional 3 months, and see if that's able to help you. --Mr. S
J. Smith, That App is not available on the UN55D7000. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
That's a good question. However, I've never tried it, nor have I seen anything in the controls that leads me to think you can. Doesn't mean you can't. Wish I could have been more help.
No app for it yet....I stream amazon prime via my computer through hdmi to the Samsung.
You have to use the Samsung 3d active glasses with this tv
The one I bought is black.
First turn on the keyboard. Make sure you see the lights turn on. Then Go to settings on your iPad. Find and select Bluetooth. Turn on Bluetooth. let your iPad find the keyboard signal. Once found, select the keyboard option on the iPad then immediately press the Bluetooth button on the keyboard, located next to the on switch.
Be sure your bluetooth is turned on for both the Ipad and the keyboard. The keyboard switch is in the top right corner. If both are turned on and it still is not working then contact customer service to obtain a new device. The customer service people are very helpful and easy to work with. My first keyboard had some letters that did not work and they immediately sent me a new keyboard. I've had my second keyboard for about a year now and haven't had any problems.
It comes with the USB plug to upload the music from your computer which is also the charger.
sorry I don't know. my best advice to you is too contact VTech directly. sorry I couldn't be of more help
I am not sure of the model number compatibility. I will let you know that we ended up not finding a VTech headset that would work with our VTech phone. It was pretty frustrating. I hope you have better luck than we did.
Yes it will work.
yes it has bass to it. sounds good to if you have the right earphones to go with it
Yes. It is rated from AC 100-240V.
Yes, two sets.
I have the same question..
No, much to my dismay. The Playbook does not recognize the keyboard, and even if it did, with the awkward adapter, the case does not close. A big disappointment, but I guess you get what you pay for.
no, does not work with mine; it is going back
Micro
You can get one almost anywhere and plug in the code, most aftermarket remotes are better than the ones you get in the box with the TV. Menards, best buy, even some grocery stores.
About 3.5 x 2 x 1.5 inches
It was with mine, and measured approximately 18". It has worked great for me.
I've not had to do that, but they do sell adapters on amazon. just look up usb to micro usb adapter and several pop up!
Interestingly, this is a compact reader that does not read Compact Flash memory cards. Look elsewhere if you need a CF reader.
Yes you should be able to move USB Thumb drive data to SD Card with the device
it's Cost-effective, but I personally do not think is appropriate
The adapter has 5V, 1000ma output, center tap positive. The original adapter is 2" long and, because of the prong orientation, must occupy the end plug in a strip or it will overlap any adjacent plugs. The power cord itself is at least 2' long. Vic vchorney@verizon.net
I don't know. It looks like a 110v.
Don't know why it wouldn't as long as the MacBook has a USB port. The hub is externally powered.
I never intended to do that!
Yes. This needs to happen.
I purchased this model 9 months ago and now it will not play. It makes grinding sound and ejects this disc. LG told me that the parts are covered for one year and labor for only 3 months so they will repair it for the labor cost of $69!!! Completely dissatisfied.
Same with my 47lw5600 tv. No solution, no solution likely because LG discontinues support for all products after about 12 months (when they move to next year's model). I think I will get a Roku in the future since they sell their product to work as a streaming device.
Around the dial is a ring with the trippers (black) that you can press down.
Could be a bad unit or it was installed wrong, contact the company and report it, you may be Compensated for it!!
I really don't know. I don't use it that way, and I can't look at it. I am at a public computer. Good luck.
Yesterday, July 23, Frys in Houston has the LG47LW5600 again for $799.00, down from $999.00. But the 55-inch went from $1,199 up to $1,449.00. Probably being set up to go on sale this Sunday for $350.00 off at $1,099.00.
Yes, Netflix has a search function of their streaming library on the 42LV5500.
I complained, but the response was somewhat confusing. It could be that the hardware won't support it or that since Adobe is a plug in they won't upgrade it because it is a plug in.
The classic tube type tv uses a magnetic field to scan the image onto the screen. Flat panel tvs have individual circuit traces for the rows and columns of pixels and are not subject to interference the way that tubes are.
in my experience, i only had to input the wifi password once. every time after that, i can simply use the smart tv feature like netflix, amazon video without having to re-enter my wifi password. keep in mind that the tv does take some time to connect to your wireless so you won't be able to jump into the apps right after turning on the tv. that's the only minor quirk.
Make sure the wifi thumb drive thing is plugged into the port in back of TV. LG call center is very good about walking you through set up.
Sorry, no idea... Sorry.
both the same specs, i bought the 42LV5500, but couldve saved $20 since the magic motion remote is free by amazon when you buy the 42LV5400 both have the wifi adapter. but i still love my decision, well worth the price. so right now the wise choice is to buy the 42LV5400 and get the special remote for free. this is a $1k tv for $700 not bad not bad
They kick good buy !!!!
It does not come with wire. They work in a variety of boxes. The owners manual will provide you with a couple of different enclosure sizes for these subs. They are versatile, and sound good.
I am a HUGE Rockford Fosgate fan, but it is hard to beat this sub at its price. I purchased these for a friend. He loves them. They sound good.
Yes, it works on our T-10's and it's about the same size as Plantronics.
I believe so.
No idea, if I knew the cameras measurement that would be helpful.
Yes, it fits a 1015PE but it doesn't have the metal frame with it with no screw holes to securely mount onto the netbook but it's still usable and just use a bit of tape to tape the edges. It should be fine!
No, this transducer ONLY works with the Lowrance DSI series (which I believe is being phased out & replaced by HDI and eventually CHIRP).
Yes
Yes. As long as the radius of the lens is 1.25".
With my setup, there's roughly a .3 second delay between the actual feed and what comes out of the Colossus. I use the HDMI-in on the capture card coming from my Directv HD-DVR box.
It depends on the case. The card is the length of a full sized PCI(Card is PCIe) card. In most cases no. Test with a PCI NIC card too see the if you have the space.
Hauppauge Colossus Model 1414 has the following Input/output connections: HDMI Input, A/V (Component) Input, Optical Audio In, A/V (Component Out) pass through, Optical Audio (Out) pass through and IR Blaster. It does not have a coax connection. However, I believe the HDMI connection will bring in HD and Standard definition content.
Yes, in fact that's the only thing that makes the using the web browser worth while. No flash so internet videos won't play.
Hi, sorry for the late reply but I have been swamped with other obligations. The answer to your question is NO. You cannot "synchronize" this device. It is a stand alone device, and only works on its own by providing you internet access, via an internet browser. Whatever apps you currently have, can not be accessed via this device, but only from your TV. The term "upgrade", only means you can now "browse the internet", in addition to using that apps already on your TV. Hope this helps. Feel free to inquire for more info.
You need the one made for LG. If your model is 2012 or newer you can buy the 400 series. I have a 2011 model so I needed the 200 series which works great. I had to send the 400 series cam back.
I prefer to hook my critical video equipment, especially reference equipment, directly to my monitor. You can use the ARC HDMI to get TV sound out of the Receiver. there 'has' to be 'some' information lost in the translation, imo.
Yes
It is internal. (No power block... just a cable from the television back to your power outlet.)
Yes the WI FI module comes with the TV when purchased new. It also can be connected to the internet with LAN cable.
Unfortunately, there's no cover apparent for a battery compartment; probably requires an "authorized" technician to replace the battery.
I would suspect so, but given the headphones aren't sold separately, you're going to have two transmitter/charging bases even if you only use one for a signal. Your audio connects to the base via RCA stereo plugs or toslink. I have my computer connected to one, TV to the other.
Sorry, do not know&gt;
Yes. It's all zippered everywhere. Really nice design. I love it. It's actually the first camera bag in 40 years I've loved.
Hi, thanks for your question. According to the information on the Product Page, this battery is available for shipping to select countries outside the U.S. I'd suggest adding it to your cart, if you can continue with your order, then it can be shipped to your address. I hope this helps!
Not sure but it worked just fine for me.
It works on the S9300. I looked in the booklet that came with the camera on page 3 and it listed what parts go with the camera. I ordered from that information and it works fine.
Not sure. I have had a lot of trouble with this device!!!!! DO not waste your money
Miniscule. 500mAH at 3.7v
I cannot attest to charging the Ipad, I only use it as an Flashlight which I believe is a very useful and important tool for emergency's. I would buy another if i could afford it,. CR
We bought two headsets - each comes with its own optical connector wire. We then bought an optical splitter box (wasn't too costly) and one extra optical cord (tiny wire). We hooked the one optical cord to the TV "optical out" and the splitter box "in." We then hooked each headphone's optical cord connector into the two "outs" on the splitter box. Both headphones sound FABULOUS! Hope this helps. As far as I know, you cannot piggyback another set of headphones, as each "tower" (which is also the recharging unit for the headphones) connects to its own individual signal.
It clicks. I will say I like the feel of it more than other mice though.
By my measurement it is about 1.75 inches tall, 3 inches wide and about 5 inches long. I have used it daily for over a year without any problems.
Not really noticed too much - it clicks just as loud as most lower-price ranged mice I'd say
Yes i bought it for my 3DS XL works perfect!
I do not know what the HD would mean in this case. The writing speed is fast enough if you have a good Camera Engine.
Not a lot. One is a wifi only tablet while the other two models are verizan tablets that can get wifi and 3g or 4g service through verizan. So there is the wifi model, 3g model, and 4g model
I would think so, it uses a 3mm plug for speakers and mike
Sorry i can't I returned it
I can't answer that question. I always ride single up with my bluetooth paired with either the bike's audio or my Garmin. I have accidently paired to both of them at the same time, and it worked until I shut one down. The system is always easy to pair and has good audio.
No, these are ntsc north america disks. The pal disks are available from other dealers, but on amazon they have been sold out for some time.
No. The swap magic discs only work with ps2 games. You would want a Breaker Pro NTSC version. they sell for $20. ps2cover sells them. with that you can play ps1 imports on your ps2. You can play backup ps1 imports also using it. Hope this helped you out.
Yes, they fit fine over glasse
I don't believe so. I think they are proprietary to LG tv's. Unless Samsung direct says differently.
check monoprice.com.
Sorry, I can't say if it will fit a Sony. It fits my Panasonic Lumix just fine.
Yes, but the memory slot in this case, I don't recommend you use though because it's a tight fit and exposes the SD card contact to the case unprotected. - good luck
Yes, definitely this Sony LCS-HH/B will fit on your Sony DSCHX30V. -Ely
Hi auctionat, one major difference between the is the noise suppression ratio. The Sony MDRNC100D can suppress noise level of 17.5 dB whereas the MDR-NC13 can suppress only up to 9 dB. Hope this helps. -Ely
I would say, "Yes.". Obviously these are not Leica optics, but they are very bright and clear. For the price, they are excellent. Bear in mind what power you may need on a safari.
Binoculars come with very nice strap and heavy duty pouch
Yes it will work on any android phone. No it won't work with a Samsung Galaxy tablet. 5000 mAh is good for any cell phone, but not enough for a tablet. For those, you need double or more; however, I admit that I haven't tried to use it on a tablet, and it might work, but I am sure that you won't be able to recharge the tablet.
The idea of "wired" to a router is not the issue. It requires access to an ip address. It can do that through a physical connection or through a wifi connection. It only requires a hard line at the time of set up, after that it acts as its own video server in either a wired or wireless environment assuming you have a wireless router in your network.
It is USB 2.0, not 3.0
No. In fact, my dad broke it pretty easily after a few months.
This sound bar has a 3.5mm analogue input (aka headphone jack size) and two optical (TOS Link) inputs. If your TV has an optical out you would purchase a compatible cable to take the TVs output and input it in the sound bar.
Yes. I have 3 5004's running off one 5101. I believe you have to resync them all when you add one. If you don't have the Netgear Powerline Utility (Windows app - free) it is a nice little utility that lets you check the status and add a security key.
The only cables would be a standard ethernet cable. Don't recall if it came with any but it would be up to the user to connect one unit to the router and the other unit to whatever. They could be three feet apart or thirty. As far as 3D, it doesn't care what is transmitted or received but your internet speed, router, and powerline speed needs to be sufficiently quick.
I have the exact same question. My approach is that you need line level converter to convert the speaker level wires for the sub into RCA line outs. Then purchase a powered sub. Make sure the new sub has a crossover as I'm not sure where the crossover is set for the sub out of the Samsung unit.
You would have to have a wired network, since this phone does not have a WiFi antenna.
We do have them in stock
Yes, we can ship to Italy. Simply choose international shipping during checkout. Thank you.
If you call ACER, they have a way to reset the computer so you can bypass the password. The same thing happened to my daughter. Good Luck!
one input in. two out.
Yes it will.
Yes, it works. You have to follow the instructions for recharging to a t. I had a few short charges the first time, now it holds great for at least 2 to 3 hrs.
Not on these headphones
i dont know Anne im using them in my laptop but they dont have a microphone in them for making phone calls. they have the universal 3mm connector, but as far as sound they are the best ive ever had for simple earphones. hope this helps..
I'm not sure where regions 1 and 4 are. I live in Illinois (USA), and have not had any trouble.
Nope needs to be plugged in to 12 v but most planes have that
While I'm sure they will not match a pair of Bose full ear headphones, they produce more bass then the other wired earbuds that I've tried.
Either check your mSATA slot to see what's compatible with it (better) or check the list of compatible devices for IEEE 6230 802.11n and see if yours is listed? Mine is ASUS NS53SV and it works fine with it. The previous one didn't do Bluetooth and 5 GHz band which was the reason for replacement.
Yes
Yes you can. You just plug the roku into 1 of the 4 HDMi ports. And the Amazon Fire has USB ports available for the Amazon fire stick.
Have u tried force closing it through settings?
Yes it came with a neck strap , I bought the xtra warranty as my 13 yr old uses it as well but if it was for adult use only I think you be fine skippy the warranty we love the camera
No problem with speed!!!!!! I use the Air play with my iPad. I listen and surf at the same time. Super Super Fast. I also have an Apple router. You will absolutely love love love the Zeppelin Air. We also have the ZA hooked up to the TV. OMG, freaking fantastic!!!! Purchase one you will not be disappointed.
Once the initial setup has been complete, the Zeppelin will run on wifi exclusively. Not only that, but when I have parties I can unplug Zeppelin and bring it anywhere the wifi reaches, plug it in there and it connects right up. And on top of that, the sound quality is truly unmatched when compared to other dock systems.
Canon uses a bayonet mount for accessories. These are screw on accessories. To make them work I got an adapter from Lensmate. The adapter takes 58mm accessories. So I exchanged the 52mm accessories for 58mm accessories and now they work.
It should..it mounts with the same nut as the front passenger seat..mine is in a Kia and mounted in minutes
Yes the one I received is for the SGT 2 7.0. I own a 3 7.0 and was Dissappointed to find out it will not fit
Both screen have the same characteristics, so I think they are compatible each other.
It will not work in dv6 - 1245dx
Yes, it is compatible. Both are led-40 pins and the lcd is ccfl.
I hesitate to answer your question as I don't know your camera. I am using Sony 580 alpha.
yes thank you
yes you can did you register or your products if so go to your Garmin online and pull up your products then check for updates it will tell you if you need some then and now I own this one and the 465 version and have no problem
I believe its for 2 years. I've gotten replacements twice in my 8 years with Shure. It's covered if it's through no fault of your own.
Yes
Hi Joan, yes it fits great. My printer didn't come with the cable so I purchased one, actually 2 from this site. Good luck to you and Happy 4th.
Will not clip in. Must remove clamps so just positive and negative wires.
Dear Customer, thanks for your enquiry. Please kindly note that each of our product is specifically designed for the corresponding device. The case can only fit Dell Venue Pro.
It doesn't fit a particular camera, fits the lens instead, a 50mm, 35mm, etc....
I don't know, I bought this as a gift for my step-son. Sorry I can't help. :(
I don't think this connector will overcome an inherent limitation of your HDMI cables. If the cable itself is only reliable to 15', This will not overcome that problem. It doesn't contain any sort of signal amplifier.
Yes it does.
BTW--If you already have your TV on & then turn on your Headphones & don't want to turn your TV off/on again, you can simply go into your TV controls, deactivate your Bluetoothe & then re-activate it & it will instantly connect! Mahalo's & Aloha
They worked great for my 2 year old on the plane. When she got sick of wearing them on her ears the speaker part will lay flat so I could just put them around her neck and she could listen that way. You will need an adapter to plug into the airplane though.
R. Tran - No. The MDR513H and MDR515H can only record to DVD+R, DVD-R, DVD+RW or DVD-RW disks.
Not as I understand it. The power button isn't programmable because it would be very easy to mess up. Really, its the only downside to this otherwise very full featured, very reliable, very inexpensive remote. All too often the multi-device-on power buttons on cable company remotes time out and leave at least one device off anyway
Mine came in a Windows 7 sealed boxed, cd holder with key code inside.
Correct. You need 64 bit operating system to read over 4gb ram
This is a fully functioning developer version factory sealed by Microsoft. The product key is included. I had no problems installing or registering, but this is NOT the retail version so you will not have any technical support available.
The same way as if it was a regular hard drive. Can you be more specific? What kind of issue are you having with installation of windows 7?
The actually operating system is no different. Just the legality of its use.
Win7 uses up to 32g as far as I know. I've got mine set up w dual boot to win7 or xp although when I boot to xp I'm limited to 2g of useable ram.
Yes, it is. When you turn the dual the screen lights up.
Will Skype work on this tablet ?
probably in time for fathers day go figure.
Yes. I found it is not stable with a wide-format tablet stood on the narrow end when in the low angle position only.
I'd go to the apple store and ask. I ordered one here and every site said it was the right size... and it did not fit when I tried to install it.
I ran the cable its full length above a dropped ceiling and through to the second floor. If no rodent problem, it should work well. I get an excellant signal on the remote studio monitor.
I had the same problem and would use warranty if it applies for you, hope this was helpful.
The three that come with the scope are H20mm, H12.5mm, and an SR4mm at a diameter of 1.25in. The set includes a Barlow that employs a 3X magnification which can be used with the 20 and the 12.5. Combining the Barlow and the 4mm exceeds the physical limitations of the telescope. My next two purchases will be a 2x Barlow and a 7.5 or 10mm plossl.
yes
Yes.... you need either a cable or FiOS modem.... this is just a Router
glossy
Wont work i guess as it is up to sata2 backward compatible
It's less a question of will it work (almost certainly yes), but will it fit (what Scott said). Check the physical dimensions of the OCZ drive against the one you're replacing. That should be available in the manual(s) that came with the laptop. If you don't have them they're available for download on the HP web site. If you're still not sure, got the support page at the OCZ site and ask them.
I have not tried to burn M-Disc.
yes if you look up panasonics's UJ-240A, its a burner. I have this by brainydeal. great drive
I ended up using standard webcam drivers in Windows 8. The manufacturer's website was pretty bad and I never did find good software made for this.
You can see the indentation in the picture. Imagine the knob moving in an arch around the perimeter of the microscope
don't know exactly but my connection box is behind the back seat and it reached no problem - anyway I believe you easily extend that cable if needed, nothing special
Yes, it will work on those models. It will even function in wireless slave mode on cameras with Nikon's Advanced Wireless System, although it is permanently set to fire on Channel 1 on Groups A, B, & C whenever those are set on the camera or master flash. This is a simple flash to use with few controls, but it works well.
I have not tried that, but according to the manual he answer is no. It can be used as a slave for cameras including Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax, and Sony using the camera's own master flash where supported. It does not work with Samsung cameras. The manual recommends model 58 AF-2 as master flash.
It does work very well with GX1. Full TTL, etc.
This flash works with all Panasonic and Olympus cameras with a hot shoe. A great flash.
Yes, it does. I use this model flash with my LX100 and FZ1000. It doesn't have the power to fill a shot at the FZ1000's full zoom, but its compact size is a nice trade-off.
It is my understanding that these different letter designations are for different retailers so a unit purchased at Best Buy could not be returned to Wal-Mart for example. Different retailers also have their own in house warranty. As an example, Best Buy may offer a 90 day no questions asked return on a product whereas another retailer may require servicing from the manufacturer after sale.
You need an adapter for nex6. Nex 6 has standard hot shoe, nex 7 has old Minolta hot shoe.
Yes, the Metz MZ 44316S 44 AF-1 ADI works whith the Sony A99. But you need the adapter. Read the Customer Questions & Answers by Amazon.com for the flash, please.
I am not aware of a specific case, however if it was me I would just measure it and purchase a leather bag that has a soft inner lining and that should work fine.
Yes it swivels and tilts and it will work with the FZ200
According to the specks on your Motherboard M4N68T-M V2: Memory 2 x DIMM, Max. 8GB, DDR3 1800(O.C.)/1600(O.C.)/1333/1066 Hz ECC, Non-ECC, Un-buffered Memory. This RAM will work on your board as it's DDR3, hope this helps. Dual Channel Memory Architecture
Corsair is typically listed on Asus' verified vendors list. For this particular board (when I searched it I got an Asus board A85XM-A). According to the specs on their website, you can have up to two cards of DDR3 memory. This memory is DDR3 1600 Mhz, which is a speed that the board can process. The bottom line: yes http://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/A85XMA/#specifications
The mounting screw has 3/8" threads on one side, 1/4" on the other and the base accepts both. Just unscrew, flip and tighten to suit your needs. Mine is married to a head that required the 1/4" thread, but the monopod shipped with 3/8" showing. Easy to loosen, flip and mount...no issues.
We have not received any news of our customers removing the clamp from the head. We also would not recommend it as it will more than likely affect the functionality of the ballhead.
It comes with the arca type Suisse, dovetail plate.
No bag
Yes, it does have a low cross over included.
Yes
Sorry, i didn't understand your question
Yo siempre he utilizado 2 luces en la cmara y me funciona muy bien..
I have the 65" version and they work fantastic with the TV.
Yes, I used the replacement LCD on the exact same model laptop. Worked perfectly.
It's does a great job protecting my iPad, which already has a leather case. But I haven't tried it with the Bluetooth keyboard. It might not be big enough for both. But perfect for the iPad with a case
Yes, this microscope does stream instant video. So long as the height and location of the previous coin that was being viewed matches where the new coin will be , then yes this will do the trick. be sure that the coin that you are looking at is on a flat surface. If you are looking at this with your hands it may be difficult to maintain clarity.
I did a search at Amazon for the 44302-B and it appears to be a new model listed for $105.09!! As opposed to $40 for the other one. Not a lot of details,though. Look at the Celestron web site.
Yes it will fit. Trust me you will love it......The speakers fit inside the ear well inside the helmit. You will not even notice them
I have used the drive (3TB version) about 5 months on my iMac as the time machine with no problems. Set up was flat simple. My old (somewhat full) time machine drive is still attached to the iMac as an auxiliary drive.
No it doesn't.
No info on drive specs.
I am not familiar with Smartware and use my Studio Book with Time Machine software to back up my Mac.
I'm not sure, but they sound amazing at high volume
Yes
The battery life last about 3 to 5 hours depending on the movie your watching.
You will get 5 mounts that will come all together in a small box
I use them with a Bose home entertainment system. They work wonderfully. They were easy to install and configure. They also hold the speakers with no problems at all.
From the bottom of the hole it is about 1 7/16"
I don't think it can play android, also it requires the kca specific cable and apparently the ones sold on amazon are fake and don't work properly, it does play iphones and ipods though, I just bought an old ipod to use with it.
Except for digitally encrypted transmissions, it will get whatever you program into it, and is within the frequencies that it accepts. So what that means in layman's terms is, it will do all conventional and trunked systems that transmit an analog signal.
I don't hear it on this radio, but some do. Most radio volume knobs control the amplifier, hence zero sound when turned down, but better fidelity can be achieved by leaving the amplifier on max and controlling the input to the amplifier. Therefore, turned down. you still hear the amp. My son told me why that is.
Still works fine after updating iPad to OS 8.1.1.
I'm not 100% sure. I was a little hesitant too when I received it, but I did receive an original Apple iPad 2 leather Smart Cover exactly like the one sold in stores for double the price. So my concerns about the box were not important. It's the product inside that matters to me.
IIt works great. Great video and sound. I use it while riding 4-wheelers.Only complaint is it is slow transferring to computer via usb. It is better to use a card reader. Comes with multiple mount so you should find one that will mount on your goggles. You might want a weather proof case to protect from a direct paintball hit.
This is the newer model but don't get these mixed up with the similar model that is made for iphones. These are monitor headphones for djs, etc. They make a similar model for the average consumer that looks very similar as well.
As far as I researched, they are the same. There's no higher impedance, so all DT-1350 are 80 ohms.
yes, I have found it to work with both of my Satellites...
Yes, I have Vista and it has worked on my system.
You mean multi channel connection or multi stereo sound stage? Because, if it's multichannel connection, you should have the sobwoofer connected from the source and then it should be working. If your talking about multi stereo, then the speaker pattern must have a .1 in order to get the LFE directed to the subwoofer.
without knowing what is connected and how you watch your TV, most likely the cables connecting the TV to the amp. try to use a quality hdmi cable. I have Uverse DVR/Tuner connected to the amp and have not experienced any sudden fluctuation in sound. The sound changes only after I select different settings.
Maybe buy it and try it.
I don't know without knowing more. I'd your capacitor a two wire, four wire, five wire or what?
Idk but it fit in my Dell. It's a skinny tower
They should but you can look up the full specs on google
No. These are the small form.
No, it does not - this cord has the standard narrow 'handset' connectors at both ends. I have not seen a cord with a handset connector at one end and the wider 'standard' connector at the other. You may want to look for an adapter or connector of some kind, or you could buy one cord of each type, and splice the end from one onto the other. That wouldn't be very easy to do, though - the wires inside the black outer covering are color-coded, but they are very thin and delicate.
Go to any store where you can compare the battery size on both cameras if is the same size must to work
Yes.
It might be but it got this bag for similar reasons. I needed something to carry my laptop and papers in and I hate briefcases. It's a good sized bag so if you're sure that's all you'll ever carry, you might want to look for something smaller. I love mine though.
I ordered mine in black...but that seems to be a manufacturer mistake! They put two different msgrs together.
No, there is not. 110 only.
I'm about to buy this and need that question answered too. If I get it before someone knowledgeable replies, I'll advise what I learn. Considering how awful my buying experience was here at Amazon using a Metabank gift card, I'm hesitant. But, I need to use up the gift card funds, so, here goes a second try. Think I'll email the vendor first, just in case.
If he/she listens to music while drumming, then yes it will save your ears as well as the drummer will not have their music turned up to a deafening level in order to play along.
It has an end to attach to a light stand. The neck gives you flexibility.when pointing the light.
YES
i've owned it for two weeks. perfect picture, no 'crease' issue. amazing tv and internet apps. beautiful design. it is sony's top of the line edge-lit. the hx929 is full-array, so it supposedly has better contrast but is a heavier, thicker unit because it has more led's. i love the hx820 and the contrast is excellent.
It got to my house way earlier than expected like when it says it was going to ship lol.
Yes it will fit however the jl design enclosure is better
Wish I can help, but I owned this Dell tablet less than 24 hours. It stopped working, won't powered on, won't charge either. It is a piece of junk.
Hi I'm sorry I really don't know. Sorry wasn't able to help you
No, it fits the 10".
To answer your question, the pen is a replacement for the mouse only in a pen shape and does not have ink or graphite. The pen has a laser light and functions the same as the mouse, I personally like it for drawing as I'm use to pencils and paper or brushes and canvas.
Don't think so. It's a computer mouse...
Doesn't like a USB 3.0 port, though.
Yes, you can. In fact you can do it all with the included three-way cable, which has three male plugs: USB, mini USB and 3.5mm
here is what I found.....*Plays DVD-R**/DVD/DVD-R/DVD-RW***/DVD+R/DVD+RW Compatible, SVCD/VCD/CD/CD-R/CD-RW Compatible, DVD *Plays All-Region DVDs: Region 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0 *Plays PAL and NTSC Region DVDs on all TVs. *Built-in PAL to NTSC Converter *64 MB Video Converter *NTSC/PAL Compatible *USB Input *DivX playback *Compact and slim design *Progressive Scan *Picture Zoom Function *Parental Lock control *Dual Voltage (110/220V) for Worldwide Use
I think that there is a time frame that you have to purchase the AppleCare. If your Mac is still under factory warranty, I think you are good. I would check with Apple before purchasing.
Please check if you still have original Apple warranty left by going to Apple's website. https://selfsolve.apple.com/agreementWarrantyDynamic.do . If you do have some warranty left, you can add Applecare to your Macbook Pro.
No. This is the reason it is thin and light.
My question deals with the Wiki reader/dictionary: It's approx 4.5"x4.5" and I've looked everywhere for a soft or hard case or zip sleeve.. Even the manufacturer doesn't offer one. Does anyone have some suggestions? Much appreciated.
Yes it will split the connection for the mac computer and Samsung smart tv
This case is for LP's. It is pretty heavy duty and will protect your records while traveling. We haven't tried it yet, but the last time I was on a plane, I measured the under seat storage area, and this case should fit easily under window or middle seats. Now my hubby can confidently buy records at festivals and such.
The depth is correct. When you lift the front latch to open the case the entire top will come off, so I would be careful.
I'm sorry but I don't know. It was a gift to a friend.
nope
all semipro and pro cameras have 1/4 20 receivers on the bottom.. this will work for your camera.. I use it on Canon and Nikon all the time.
I use the monopod in two modes, the first of its fullest extent and the second in his extencion minimum, these two modes are useful for photography and video.
Yes I did and no it did not. Tighten it up and set to go.
Which screw?
It should be compatible as long as there are inputs on the back of your tv.....if not which I think is a 1 in a million chance...AMAZON IS TOP NOTCH FOR RETURNS. Now that I think of it my tv at the shore which the Jvc sound bar is connected to is a Panasonic Viera ...Im sure you wont have a problem.
Hi,dear friend,sorry for the later reply,Of course you can, but you need to add the postage fees,thanks!
No
Yes my friend
It is L shaped.
this power supply will work: http://www.amazon.com/VideoSecu-Regulated-Switching-100V-240V-Adapter/dp/B000VRL632/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1389677797&sr=8-2&keywords=video+surveillance+power+supply. Even if you find one that only provides 300 mA still will work. Make sure the plug is like the one described here. Good luck.
As long as your motherboard supports this RAM, Then you are fine.
Si es totalmente compatible
last I knew one of the beauties of a muslin was the rumpled look. Never fold; twist them like you would a broomstick skirt and stuff in a storage bag. if wrinkle free is what you are after, stick to paper.
Yes, we can ship this item to costa raica. Shipping prices will be added upon checkout.
I have the other version of this mouse. "All black" But the one I have didn't come with software so I wasn't given the option to change the DPI on it. The mouse for sure though is worth getting over those Name brand ones. Does all I need and I play a lot of 1st person games that require reaction from my mouse. I just turn it to the highest and lower the sensitivity in game if needed.
Sorry, I don't see a question?
they are awesome .. great sound
No mic on this model
Go for it! It is surely a great product for work out. The wires are also sturdy and the head grip is just great.
I couldn't tell you for sure regarding the generation, but I do remember seeing that it's compatible for ipads and ipods on the back of the packaging.
It is a standard 3.5 mm plug, and can be used with any standard headphone port, including on your macbook.
won't work on ipad.
It does! Works better on PC, as far as software cooperation is concerned.
BluRays and game discs are pretty much the same size, so yes, it can work for these. I went and tested mine on a BluRay and it worked perfectly fine.
Just lift the lid and the slider grabs the Disc in that position and it comes up with the lid.
I don't want to be responsible for answering that question which should be answered by the manufacturer. In case anything goes wrong, I don't want culpability.
This radar detector is very sensitive and you have to disable some bands to avoid false alarms! The manufacturer made sure to cover most of the police radar bands and depedepending on were you are located, you may disable the x band and k band which interfere with the garage door openers. If you're in North America the police usually uses Ka bands. Also you have to select the city setting to avoid other false alarms. Traffic radars are usualy in the x band and therefore can be ignored most of the time. I hope this helps!
the cobra, velcrow and a suction mount along with the power cord
Yes it can swivel to vertical/portrait position, the stand pulls out.
It will only pick up speed cameras that are "front facing" (i.e. the violation picture is of your front plate). Most U.S. speed cameras are "rear facing" since not all states require front plates. In these situations, you generally won't know there's a camera until after you've passed it (and have already been caught, if you were speeding). It will not pick up red light cameras, as others have noted.
Excelente
Yes it does. There is a connection port on the top of the unit. Since i do not have an ipod I have not used this feature.
I find the same problem. I did not expect the Golf Buddy to be precise in the first instance. To have better precision go for the range finders. The distances can also be affected by the changes made by the golf courses but not updated by Golf Buddy. You should let them know if that is the case and they update these courses very promptly. I am quite happy with the Golf Buddy's accuracy of up to 10 yards give or take.
Our Uverse box came with a silver remote but when I ordered replacements we got the black remotes and they work really, about the same as the silver. In fact, the silver didn't work directly with our Mickey Mouse TV but thus black one does - so improvement! Hope this helps.
It should be able to. 12v plugs right into the back. Make sure the connector is compatable.
I installed the 500 GB on a 2008 macbook. same size 2.5" Sata, 5400 rpm. It works great. Your model is a year newer than mine, it should work. Check the specifications of your comp Hd (u can google macbook 2009 specs) and make sure they match description of this HD. Hope this helps, changing hd is easy and if you're not sure how to do it, check youtube.
I have a black mid 2007 Mac book and it works perfectly with it. Have had it for over a year now
Yea they would be
yes, it works well.
I've been using eneloop rechargeable NiMH batteries in mine.
You will not get the full 100mbs it would depend on your switches or router connections but this wokes great for what we use it for
As far as I know,it should work for all tf card gadgets.
No.
No but you can buy an apple adaptor to work the 5 at Walmart
No. The devise sits directly on the object being scanned or is held ON the object being scanned like skin. There is no tripod.
Yes. The resolution is not great, but I have used it with both the Zoomy app and with the native Windows viewer by selecting the correct input. You can take photos with either application as well.

I don't know if this will help, but have you turned AGC or Automatic Gain Control off on your camera? There is also a switch in the battery compartment of the mic to change the output level from 0db, -10db, and -20db.
Here are the specs: http://www.rodemic.com/microphones/videomic
It worked perfectly for me. Previously I was going from VGA on the laptop to VGA on the monitor. With this cable I could use the HDMI on the laptop to the DVI on the monitor. Didn't have to change a thing. Plug and play.
DVI doesn't send sound like HDMI. Have to have external speakers hooked directly up to the source. Had the same exact issue, unfortunately had to get a cheap pair of external speakers.
merge
It def can but not to the max of 1100 maybe around 600
Not the volume, only the bass. However you have to have it set on "low pass" mode or it wont work.
It should be fine as long as your subwoofers are 4 ohm. The amp is 2 ohm stable and in fact supplies greater amperage at 2 ohms
Hello. This amplifier will output 300 watts max power at 2 ohms impedance per channel. To run two 300W RMS subwoofers that have been connected in parallel, you will need to purchase a larger, more powerful amplifier. I recommend purchasing an amplifier such as a BOSS PD3000.
The front panel is not detachable.
I would just hook up an amp and run new wires from amp to speakers will have more power pushing speakers which should make them sound nicer just look up the specs on your speakers and get an amp that will be just right for them
No you cant just a set of tweeters or a pair of 6 1/2 in speakers
From what I have seen installing the unit the answer is no. Once the unit looses power it has to be turned on off of the amp.
I measured the bottom of the amp and it is 3.25 by 3.25 inches
I used it on a set of 4 " three ways using the high inputs ( not the red and white cords) worked exceptionally well recommend it (plus it's cheap!)
Yes, it actually has two.
Press the reset red circle right when you open the case to your left Side ok
yes
2- 25 AMP FUSES
i believe it will, i was trying to go the other way and it would not work. so, i "think" it will work or so says my computer guru guy.
I bought this a long time ago. And it didn't work. They are on different formats. I would do some research to make sure but I'm almost positive that it doesn't work.
The image will be cropped. I started by using a 90mm macro lens which was cropping the image. Then I switched to a 50mm lens,(with a 52mm or 57mm thread - I don't remember at this time),now I am able to photograph the entire image plus a blackish area around the image, area that can be cropped in your computer.
It works on my HD TV and I would think it would work on yours.
99% of cars will require some sort of modification to make these work. This is not the speaker to run unless you are doing a full system and plan to run these of an amplifier.
It means you can under or over expose the picture by up to three stops.
The picture quality wasn't good without zoom, it only gets worse with it. I would guess about 5x but it was blurry, not crisp at all.
a waterproof one, because the camera is not truly waterproof. don't waste your money
yes, this works for these hesh2.0
Yes. Works with mine.
Don't know if you will get a mile out of this. Also depends on if anyone around you has WIFI and will disrupt the signal. Take a look at using WIFI point to point antennas on the access points for better range. Ive gotten 2-3 miles with access points and 2 point to point antennas in a country outdoors setting.
With the dvd player, there should be a cord with three plugs on one end - red, white, and yellow. Match those with the same colors on the left side of the TV as you're looking at it from the front. The other end goes into or should already be in the player. Plug in the power cord, turn the TV onto AV3 from the input button, and you should be set to play your movies.
The remote control has a Subtitle and a Repeat & a Repeat A-B button on it, I have not used the "repeat" nor the "repeat A-B buttons", so I don't know if it means "replay". I hope this info helps.
No
Yes it resumes where you stopped before. If you pause the DVD, and the player shuts down, it will start where you paused it. Great feature. Also love that it has a USB port.
Well it all depends on what OS you are running. With windows 7 it boots up slower just like any normal system running windows 7. Very similar to a laptop not like an iPad because this tablet isnt limited it full windows. Now while running windows 8 boot up from power off is approx 6 seconds and from stand-by about 1 sec. The important thing is.... do you want a tablet PC or a limited OS tablet? (Android or iOS)
which os do you hav in it? i am running wins 8 and it loves it thats what it really needed. i am a computer builder and repairer.
need more or cut and splice in copper stranded wire same size.and use heat shrink on splice.
I love the radio but I must admit the bands are not lined up just right play with the bands on either side of the weather band it should pick up. I do not use the weather band but I will and do a follow up on this.
Ball-bearings have a MUCH longer life than sleeve-bearings, which tend to lock up after awhile
It will work for Singapore and Hong Kong for sure, not sure for other Asian countries.
No and it is a piece of junk. First one they me was broken. The one I have now , one side of speakers will not work and the MP3 jack shorted out within the month. Poorest quality of workmanship I have ever seen/bought. DO NOT BUY!!
Product page says 7200
slow? not sure what you mean......I have not had issue 1 with it.
The spider pro holster belt is fully adjustable. I'm a hefty Man, weighing 275 lbs. In cold weather shooting you might find it more difficult to holster your camera if clothing gets in the way. Everything seems to work better when its warm and In the warmer months without all the extra clothing it all works very well. I carry my camera in the holster on the ATV all the time and it works well. It works far better than using a strap.
I shoot a 5D mark 3 with a better grip and 600 flash. No problems, best investment ever! As for the tripod mount too depends on the mount size but some work
Nope-I attach it directly to camera as any other lense. It works great- I take my camera on frequent trail hikes and I can't believe I ever lived without the Spider holster! Marshall Dillon might be able to out draw me but not by much!
yes
No
Works fine....great price also
Yes! I have a Sony Cyber-Shot Model DSC-W330, and this USB works perfectly!
I don't think so...
No. It does not have a voice recorder
Hello, if you talk about iPod touch : yes iPod nano, i dont know but IT should be ok.
It stays on as long as it is plugged in.
No, you can't. This recorder doesn't have usb connection, only stores in a built-in memory and you play from it.
no
If your X Box has this order for the mic and audio I/O Tip=left audio, 1st ring= right audio, 2nd ring=Ground, Shield = Mic it should work. I do not have a X Box. However I use mine for ham radio Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS). I had to search to find the correct cable for my Smart phone with a GPS.
no way.
Not sure that I can answer. I use mine to play 30 songs in shuffle mode. At the end of the songs the player will shut down. If there were more songs I believe it will continue until it comes to an end. It is not as user friendly as some others, but it does use AAA battery, the reason I got it.
I haven't had any problems, maybe you could still get it fixed through the one year warranty. Good luck
Yes.
I'll ask my daughter as she is the primary user
No, my cord is a standard USB that can be used in laptop, USB in my car and iPhone USB charger. I have charged with all three chargers
There are two different Sat antenna connectors. I am not 100% sure this will connect but I am almost that certain. If it will connect it will work.
I don't know
No
Halogen
Not an expert on this but I think the 700 series only supports 4GB SD cards.
I have a 1390 and it has worked with no problem. Look for the port you will put the card into to. If it is the correct size you should not have an issue.
Think you may be confused. The D-Link 325 is a NAS(Network Attached Storage) device and is connected to a home network. Your Smart TV can access it if the TV is DLNA compliant and capable of playing the movie file formats you plan to store. Pls read up on NAS devices and your TV before you buy.
Read only on Blu ray, R/W on everything else. You can spend $13 more on this Asus drive if you want to burn blu-ray's: http://www.amazon.com/BW-12B1ST-BLK-Blu-ray-Internal-Encryption/dp/B004ZMG55I/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1369520803&sr=8-2&keywords=asus+blu+ray+drive
It is ok. I like the 5000 for being ergonomic myself. The price is around $50 on the 5000 but the palm rest is rubber a lot more comforable than the plastic. It also has a back bottom on the mouse.
There is no difference. They both have the same keys, I use the Business one at work and I dont see any difference.
All I can say is that the MicroSD card worked just fine with my Nuvi1450.
As far as I can tell it will adjust to any combo
This adapter should fit. It has multiple configurations.
Yes, I ran into a similar problem and this worked well.
If the ULPC-M, which I am not familiar with, is at least a 200mm mount, about 7 1/2 inches, it will work.
I also bought one of these bulbs. It lasted one day. I sent it back using the label provided, and received a refund within a week.
No, this type of plug adapter (type L) is for Italy. In Ireland, they use type G, as in the UK. For complete details on which country uses what type of power plug, I will refer you to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets
Israel uses a type H plug adapter. http://www.amazon.com/Ceptics-Grounded-Universal-Adapter-Israel/dp/B00E0O0BS8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1388898393&sr=8-1&keywords=israel+plug+adapter This is a type E/F. If you can't follow the link, just type Israel Plug adapter in the Amazon search and it shows you several different ones.

Mine does not seem to disk over write once full. I recently had to erase all to free space as it appeared to have stopped recording. Since then Ive been careful to erase once in a while and haven't let it go to full again so I dont know if it was an isolated incident or if not over writing is the rule. For the rest, it works very well.
look around and find a good radio shop. be careful because doing this may void any warrenty that you might have.some manufacturers can do this also.
Although it is a server card and that's what I installed it into, it should as long as you have PCI Express slots open. You will have to look and see if Intel has drivers for Windows 8.1 Pro.
it comes with a cable I would say its about 6 ft???? Works great for me.
I would not see that as a concern. I am running 4 kicker KS series speakers with it. 2 6x9 that are rated for 150rms and 2 6.5 rated for 100 rms. Lows mids and highs all sound great.
Yes this amp is capable of running 2 stereo channels and bridging the the other 2 to run 1 sub or 2 subs wired in a parrallel series
Am not sure. you should have no problems as long as the measurements are the same. as for me, I have only tried it with the New iPad (aka iPad 3)
Not sure about that, but never got it to work with an iPhone 4S.
Yes, this camera will do that
It does...and to a T...of course it won't cover the lens...it's great...unless you are really close to the camera, you don't even see it!
There are no charges for correcting existing courses, but there may be a charge for a course that doesn't currently exist on the unit.
Size of a Sony nex camera , dslr' will be too heavy.
yes keyboard comes with it but could not get mine to work .
I can't recall. But I should advice you not to buy it. It malfunctioned after one year.
The best answer to this would be look at the model number ON the battery itself. If it is one of the following: * 464059-121 * 464059-141 * HSTNN-C50C * HSTNN-DB75 * HSTNN-IB75 * HSTNN-Q35C * KS525AA then the answer is yes. My DV7 laptop (might be 1245dx but i cannot remember right now) had an original battery of HSTNN-IB75 and this battery works great as a replacement for that model number.
First, check the back of your Blu Ray component output. It should but it wouldn't be 1080p only 480i picture quality. HDMI cables to your Blu-Ray and HD Television that's the best way to go. I hope I help answer your question. Happy Holiday and New Year.
No
Hi. This is a router only. Do you need a modem-router? Let us know and we will do our best to help.
I have a Mac Pro running 10.9.4, I didn't update to 10.9.5, yet. For my version it works fine.
Yes, Cynthia. :)
Unless your buildings are very close to your router, you will be better off running Ethernet cable to each building and then installing individual wifi routers in the buildings. Trying to get a router with a broad range will be very expensive and you will not be able to eliminate dead spots.
It all depends on the type of vehicle you have. If you have a car then yea it is but if you have an SUV then no unless you get two. The sub really is a well built sub & handles the bass great.
It's a Single homie
it comes with the 24x24 ezybox, the hot shoe mark II bracket, and the carry bag. not sure about the warranty. I have been extremely happy with it. the light it produces is far softer than I imagined it would be. hope this helps!
Really don t know, and i don t know if you can put one, it has the CW mode, but i don t know where to plug it 73" klaus CE2KVL
The Gigabyte price is from $125 to $175 more than from other Amateur Radio stores. And it's not eligible for Prime. Excellent Radio and suggested list is $850. I wish Amazon could query some ot the Brick and Mortar Ham stores and get the price comparable.
It's for the iPad 2. I believe that is the 2nd generation one.
yes. It fits preety good too...
I've got a D7000 and it works fine on it. I'm not sure of exactly what you want to know, but it folds up to get out of the way. This will allow you to use the camera vertically. If I understand you correctly, you can't flip it up to use it to look down like a periscope. I hope this helps and if you still have questions I'll try again.
im just some guy who bought a pogoplug (although I live in la, incidentally.) I think u need to contact the seller another way. pogoplug us cool by the way. I love mine.
2 inch. REALLY like mine!
I am not familiar with the Fogta product. However, I can tell you that I find the Black Widow Spider a simple but secure product. Even with a 16:300mm lens, my Camon Rebel remains secure & comfortable on my belt.
Crutchfield.com.
All I can say is this: if the HF G30 uses the same Canon battery as the HF G10, you're good to go. I do not have the G30, only the G10. I'll be adding more Wasabi batteries; currently have 4 for my G10.
Yes it is.
They connect on the back of the speaker. The speakers are 8 ohms each together they are 4ohms (parallel)
Best I can offer is this lil' trick: I have 3 units. I went to Dick's Sports and bought a $9 hand gun case. It's got padding in it, it's plastic, and it's the right size for a few of these. It fits three units plus batteries and 5/8" to coldshoe adapters for each (so I can place on stands). I'm sure there's cases like this on here on Amazon. I consider these a poor man's pelican but be clear that while protective they are no pelican case. I hope this helps.
For the price, this light is basically disposable.
return it
No necklace
If you read all the answers below, someone has used it for his Hisense Sero 7 Pro.
yes it will
It will work, but the special keys are marked for Android. You might see some odd behavior. The mouse is fine with Windows.
General cleaning, use a microfiber cloth/towel damp to just give a once over. Never had used anything stronger.
Yes
Yes it will work on a kindle fire hd.
Yes, you can cascade two SE1500 switches for additional ports.
Handset
As long as you have the right pin adapter, voltage shouldn't be an issue. Remember that these come with the flat pin american model. If you have an adapter then it will work in asian countries without any change needed for voltage. But i would just buy a model that has appropriate pin for your needs.
A router is more sophisticated than a network switch. A router can include a firewall and DHCP support.
SE2500 is a copper wired switch only. It has no built-in wireless capability. Wireless access points (AP's) can be added to provide WiFi wireless service. I do this.
On the "fastest" setting it's 2ms
Yes. I have a series E Sony laptop and it works just fine.
I don't know about compatibility. I bought this battery for someone who traveled abroad. Hence I could not return it. The battery does not hold charge. I will not recommend buying it.
I am not sure but I would wager that it could, I have this tv but have never used pip
Yes fit
120mm will fit perfectly now if you want to mount 140mm that comes with water cooling system then use zip tie it holds just as good as screws.
Not gonna happen it would be easier to buy another case probably cost the same also
No, the cameras have a single cable that has 2 wires (video and power) running from the camera back to the main unit.
No it can't. It just stores video on its hard drive.
I'm assuming your asking if there is there a battery replacement? No I haven't been able to find a suitable re-chargeable batter for these. but have had no problems with the battery that comes with the unit which does have a charger included.
The connection is to any bluetooth enabled device. So if it has bluetooth, it should work.
Yes it's got one large port on the side of it .. They hit HARD ....
Yes. I'm using it with a wireless Logitech right now
Yes the keygrabber will work with PS2 if you have the adapter to go from PS2 to USB.
If you lose the password, informate sorry there is no way to access. but this is very good article. regards
Are you kidding? No :)
NO!!!!!!!! please read this!!!! http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/Connecting-Two-PCs-Using-a-USB-USB-Cable/248
It appears that it's just a USB adapter, so it should.
I don't know. I use mine with a Seagate external HD. I bought the cable as a spare for the unusual USB connector on the HD end. If your Toshiba HD has that kind of USB connector, I imagine it should work. Please realize that this is not a typical USB cable. This is a special cable with an unusual connector at one end.
Yes it can.
We have testing this and it does work plug and play
Sorry, I do not know the answer to that.
Yes but would have to remove old ram sticks because only two slots
Yes. Both have the same display size.
I believe it will ruin a standard protector if it is applied to it. It is meant to be applied to device only. It works well regardless of whether you are in the sun or not. I have purchased PowerSupport for 4 iPads and 4 iPhones.
Yes, the shaft you mount your camera on lifts out and it is the monopod. Very convenient when you have the tripod extended you can lift out the monopod and move to a different location rather than pick the entire tripod up and move with it. So even though you can't see the monopod it is part of the tripod and separates with loosening the hand tightening nut and slide it out of the tripod. Hope this helps.
You can go to about 70 degrees up if memory service me correctly but you can only do landscape photography no portrait since it only goes 30 degrees either side
Yes that is the same camera I have. I used this tripod with a massive Nikon 12-24mm lens. The only drawback is the last section of legs are very small and tend to flex if extended. So I don't normally use them and make up that height with the center section. You also might want to look at the amazon basic tripod.
yes
the one I got had a Centronics connector, not DB25.
Sadly no. Each tablet has it's own keyboard that is only designed to work only for that particular model
Asus are supposed to be releasing a specific mini hdmi to vga adapter; it's been shown off as an accessory but there hasn't been any pricing or release information given as of yet. Until then, there are other cables/adapters that seem to work including one from HP (- it needs a mini hdmi to hdmi adapter in order to use it with the transformer); you may wish to check out this thread on XDA Developers that discusses it in further detail. http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1088243 Robert
On the top left edge of the tablet where the on and off switch is, on the left side of the switch is a very small light and when it is charging, it is orange, when it is charged completely, it is green.
Go to settings, then security, then check allow non market place instalations. Now you can download directly then go to downloads to open and run. BESURE TO GO BACK AND TURN THIS OFF WHEN DONE TO PREVENT EASY HACKING.
That I do not know I have a 2013 passat.
Yes to both.
No it doesn't, it's a very nice player with a excellent video playback. You'll love the great looking picture it plays.
you will need a transformer
no sim wi fi only
It did fit mine
I couldn't say with certainty if it will fit a Compaq. I had to shop around for weeks. If you have the old battery look at the numbers and the connection. It takes time but it will be accurate.
Not sure what you are asking. It comes with a stand. I don't think there is anyway to wall mount it because of the built in dvd player.
Yes but electronics good for about a year. My wife is on third one n now warranty is out. Spend the extra money and but an iPad.
There is only a front facing camera. This is NOT a good Tablet. Save your money i called for a refund the next day
Yes. I also use it with my iPhone. Very convenient and excellent sound quality. I have my music wherever I go.
No idea
I can say it works just fine with the iphone 4, don't own the 5 yet.
The USB port on this set is for attaching a camera or MP3 player to play through the TV. It will not work with video however.
I had these subs and they were really loud in the right box
the most common rule you hear is add the rms for each sub and add 10% on just because amps lose power output over time. With this in mind just do the math to figure it out. hope this helps, i have two and i have 1200 watt mono block amp and it is plenty.
Yes but you're going to lose stereo. It'll come through the speakers in mono
This speaker has recommended enclosure specifications. You would have to modify the cutout to make it fit but it might not sound as good...
Depends on what kind of box it's in. Idk the specs but mine are in a ported box about 1.5 cubic feet each. That's more than enough. If it's in a sealed box you really only need like 1-1.25 cubic feet.
Go to their website and look. It lists all applications for their product. It didn't work for me so odds are it won't for you.
No, you cannot charge an iPhone through the audio/headphone jack. If you are buying this for a docking station, get one that plugs into the bottom of the phone (where you charge it), and then it will play AND charge.
After you buy the kit, you need only buy one adaptor at a time as needed.
It is available now.
I'm not for certain my husband installed this hard drive into a laptop
Re: TechFlex F6N0.50BK10 Flexo F6 General Purpose 1/2-inch Braided Cable Sleeve - Yes. Tried it, and it fit snugly around a 1/2" diameter drill bit. It is springy and can also be fit around diameters slightly larger than 1/2" perhaps up to 9/16" in diameter.
Adapter clips meaning the interchangable plastic brackets (arms) that help support either the iPad or iPhone. You can only use one at a time so if you switch devices you must also switch these as well, and they are somewhat fragile. Not referring any actual connector adapter.
Yes. I've used it with a D200 in the past.
Yes, this should work on a d3000. It affixes and mounts to the lens body just like any other SLR lens.
The nikon d600 and 610 are virtually the same. This lens works with any nikon dslr.
No. But it's working with airplay
Not only for direct access to music from your itunes iphone or ipad for wi fi, to have fm radio, is required antenna that comes as an accessory with the JBL AIR.
It comes with an instructions cd that has a video explanation on how to set up the cameras, four foot wall plug, antenna and a wall mount. It doesn't how ever come with the larger 9 dbm antennas that the pictures and description show.
The tray accepts full-size sim cards, but you can get adapters for mini/micro sims that make them the correct size. http://amzn.com/B009ABEA7E
4 feet from connector to earbuds.
I find it works well with videos, however I have no first hand knowledge of its use with Pandora nor Spotify. The wifi antenna is very good though, and has no problem with streaming files, or apps. That is to say as long as your wifi signal is fairly strong.
The Playbook already has a built in Music player which is great. You can browse by genre, artist, album etc. It also has a build in music store. It can play multiple music types such as mp3 and wma. There are more but you'll have to check.
Yes it does but it does not have good apps
i don't have any trouble with them buzzing maybe it is some electronic equipment you have them around try moving them to different locations and see if they still buzz or do you have them plugged in to the right place, the speaker plug itself i mean
No, it's designed to be used with DLP-link active 3D glasses that sync with the light bursts on the projection screen. Passive glasses won't work with it.
you replace it when its no longer keeping your temps under control. when your cpu is getting hot and there is no specific reason like dust or fans not working to cause the heat, thats when you should replace it. Or if you remove the cpu heatsink/cooler, then i usually replace it as there will be air bubbles or places where the paste doesn't touch well enough and can rise your temps of the cpu
Yes.
yes it does. It has 4 objective lenses at 4X, 10X, 40X and 100X. The latter is oil immersion. It also comes with two sets of occular lenses (eyepiece). A set at 10X and a second at a 20X.
I have still not found any hard case that would be a good fit for this scope it would be nice to purchase it with some kind of strong case.
I have several of this model mounted outside my house under the eaves for a number of years. They have worked perfectly even in this latest cold snap. Down south here the lowest we have experienced recently was 22 degrees. The eaves protect them from most of the rain. The heat and humidity of summer hasn't had any effect.
Mine came in the original box and had all of its contents.
Hey, I have had mine for about a week and it's the best PC I have ever owned... I stream at 60fps and play high graphic intensive games in 4k resolution. Oh did I also mention it's so quiet I do t even here it and it's on my desk behind my monitors about 3 ft from my head:) def worth the buy !!!
It does not make reading outside any better.
The sound is excellent through the analog outputs. The headphone output is amazing and sounds the best. My Yamaha reciever sounds better when connected coaxial
Plug in a different mouse to insure the mouse is the problem. If scrolling only happens with the HP mouse it has become defective, replace it!
Can't say for sure as I have never used a Chromebook. Best advice I can give is to go to the HP site and go to the bottom and use the Contact Us link. You can ask them directly about that specific mouse and if it works with the Chromebook. HP is really good about responding!
The Pocket model XShot camera extender measures only 6.5" when collapsed - small enough to fit in your pocket or purse. Extends to a length of about 30". Great for selfies or hard to get to areas.
You can purchase them here. http://www.gemm.com/store/NEEDLEFINDER/item/PYLE-TURNTABLE-NEEDLE-793-D7-FOR-ALL-MODELS-AND-FOR-LP-33-1-3-AND-45-S-NEEDLE/1459680144 And here: http://www.turntableneedles.com/Needle-793-D7M_p_1529.html
An audiophile would never consider this or any Pyle, Crosby, etc. record player. Many things go into reproducing the true sound, and this does very little to provide a true sound.
the horn is actually a metal, the base is solid wood veneer
It never worked, It has not been used & the product never recorded a single minute. The USB I bought for this product separately also broke off because the insert slot didn't allow the USB in correctly. I regret spending my money on this product and it's relating items. A BIG WASTE of MONEY! *****TWO THUMBS DowN***
Of course. The antenna doesn't care which radio it's connected to. An antenna is designed and built to resonate to particular radio frequencies. This is a CB antenna.
10
I used it on a TS4, so I'm not sure if it does fit the TS5.
The case triples the max depth that you can take the camera. Without the case you can take the camera to about 40 feet underwater. If you add the external case you can take the camera to 120 feet.
I hope because that is what I paid for - it has worked great for me so far -
I have ipod 3g works
No
You can try it because it won't break anything if it doesn't work. You have to have a landline in order to do this.
There IS a volume control. The little black switch sticking out on the upper right acts as a volume control during playback.
The 26 has a slightly smaller sound bar, mine sits on a tv stand in front of the tv and the 25 blocked the very bottom of the tv, the 26 does not, it is only slightly smaller but it fits better. The remote is smaller but probably does all the same functions, I do not use the remote as the soundbar is programmed into my universal remote. Lastly I recall comparing the specs and the 26 has a slightly higher power output, so I guess to sum it up, smaller and more power
it depends on what size memory card you buy.
Yup. 5 rolls. Had mixed results with lab processing. Get a c-41 kit and DIY!
Dont buy this, its hard to put. I accidentaly broke mi vent because is hard to put. Buy other model that can attach to the wind shield
yYes. came with 60 ft cable and a wall power supply, but has RCA connection. I had to buy a BNC adapter.
..the d5100 is not weather-sealed as Pentax cameras are known for. I use my d5100 on the beach and hiking, and try to stow it in a large zip lock bag when not actually shooting, with several small selica (moisture absorbtion) packs inside for protection. Make sure you thoroughly clean your lenses and camera after each outdoor use.
I think the cord is about 36inches in length.
AF-S DX NIKKOR 35mm f/1.8G: Not a wide angle lens, but for the price ($200) you really cannot beat it for speed (f1.8), weight, and sharpness. I have much more expensive lenses but the 35mm lives on my camera body at least 50% of the time.
New Egg website says May 21st.
It would if you mount it on a boom. This is the worse on-camera microphone I've ever bought, and of course I returned it. You would do best to get a boom and mic for 18 feet, otherwise you will be picking up so much ambient noise that you will never be able to filter the noise out with any software.
I would
Yes
I only choose the the video option when I want to browse or search all video files on my hard drive. To create,move, rename or play the file folders containing my different subsets of videos, I choose the all media/file manager at the home screen.
21-1/8'' wide, 14-3/8'' high, 5-1/4" deep..
Honestly,I don't have a clue. I've never tried to fit anything to those dimenisions.
Yes this cover does fit the next book however it is not the best case for you to have your next book securely fit into. There is another case made for next book that you fit the notebook into instead of having the elastic straps that one better protects the next book I would recommend that instead of the one shown. It is just a more secure fit and is safer from damage. I hope this helps you
Yes as long as your computer has a USB input. If you have an older computer you can purchase a USB to PS2 converter and it should still work properly. Hope that helps.
Yes, it works fine with Windows 8.
I'm using it on my Dell desktop w/ windows 7....it works fine. K
It is indeed wireless as in no wire or cord at all.
yes it should include case and hood and cap even as a kit lens
Did anyone answer this? I was wondering the same thing.
This lens will fit all canon DSLRs
Apparently there is no written info on these products. Customer phone support is limited there was a vague schematic sent with camera. Most instructions and install can be found on youtube
Yes they sound good on a 1000 watt
I do not use windows 8, and do not know anyone else who does. (I use Windows XP and a separate MacBook) I do not see any reason why it would not work with Windows 8 as its photos are stored on a removable SD card that should plug into any computer. There is really no need to load the included software that I have found yet.
I only got black and white video without sound. The video that I did get was terrible too.
My android phone does all of those functions with this radio.
Yes it will work comes with everything you need
Yes
No
For starters, DayZ is both CPU and gpu intensive, so getting one without the other is basically going to keep you in your current position if you haven't upgraded recently. Secondly, I've been running the Witcher 2 on max settings perfectly fine with this card, so I'm sure it could handle DayZ just fine.
I would recommend you get a 750 Ti instead.
Yes, this amp is 500 watts max at 2 ohms
idont think so... you have to get one somewhere else
It is the American version of tr100 :)
I would say yes except the abstract pattern on it is a flower. So...it's probably not great for a guy. I really do love it though - I get compliments on it all the time!
It had an adapter for the 970 but I had to return my unit because of a faulty LED screen. The picture was completely unusable.
I know of nothing in the software that will enable you to do it directly. Let's say you record to a USB flash drive. You would then unplug the flash drive from AVER and plug it into a USB port on your computer. From there, you can do with your recorded file whatever you do with any other file, which includes uploading to YouTube; but there is no direct way I know of to do it. Recall that there is no computer involved in making the recordings and a computer would be required to upload anything.
Yes, it's adjustable and it will fit. I have a Google Nexus 10 and an iPad Mini and it fits both easily. It works great especially if you have kids.
Yes it will
Yes only with CDMA carriers
It's nice for the size. Good sound from such a small compact stero... Fits great under my tv on the shelf . For the price you can't beat it... Good luck!:-)
Surprisingly pretty good for background but I would not recommend turning it up loud and rocking out.
Honestly i dont know if you can use this in Europe. ....never looked into it that far...sorry
I was in Jackson New Jersey and. Was able to receive tv stations from philly and New York City
Nope cannot update maps.
Yes, with bluethoot
You have to buy an adapter (they are pretty cheap) and it does work fine!
Yes, you can record up to 8 channels at a time.
i added a radeon graphics card and upgraded the power supply to a 500w corsair and i love it..
be sure to press "Rec Mode" in step 7, and not "Rec". These 2 buttons are side by side and it's easy to get them confused. Hope this helps
does this item work wiyh the ipod touch nano 6th gb.
I think it does, but it's very cheap, and it doesn't hold wells, I would'nt buy it!!!
To my preference the Satechi has a nicer style and fits better on dashboard, 2009 Sentra it fits nicely on top of radio without blocking any buttons, except the eyglas holder but then I can always remove without any problem....hope this helps....
Yes it does. It has the earphone audio connector which you plug into the earphone jack on iphone. But note that it does not have any volume control. Volume can only be controlled by the iphone. It just acts as a louder speaker for your phone.
Yes as long as it has a headphone jack.
No It does not. I didn't notice that in the before... I do use mine every day, in fact we all use them a lot. Anything else just ask. :)
Yes it does
There's a lip by the plug area, just lift it up. It will pop off to put 3 AAA in.
Not sure it has a standard auxiliary adapter plug. Fits in anything aux.
yes - I did purchase this docking station "Genuine / Original Lenovo Ultrabase Series 3 with Internal Ultrabay DVD Burner - Combo Pack/bundle" - from Amazon and yes it is the correct base for the Lenovo x230. thankfully is comes with the dvd drive which can be very helpful.
I does NOT come with the AC adaptor. You can use the one that came with your laptop or buy another.
Yes. It would specify if it were for a left handed one. If it doesn't specify, its for a right hand. Good rule of thumb.
Yes, it will work. I have the exact same set-up, and use it frequently. Remember to switch off the wind attenuator on camera, and go to manual sound levels on camera, set at no higher than -12db, and set all acceptable levels via the H4n. Refer to the sound levels on camera when adjusting microphone and earphone input and output levels on the H4n for optimal performance.
If the plug is the same size (2.5mm or the 3.5mm) it should work any DSLR that accomodates an external microphone in stereo. There are also tip adapters, so more likely than not, although I do not know the specs on your SL1. If I had to guess , the answer would be likely yes. E mail Sescom and verify same.
If you can do some electrical stuff yourself at home, you can install it yourself. Otherwise go to tech. It does involve connecting the camera to the rear brake light power source and the display itself to some power source (Either use the aux power from the Cigarette Lighter Adapter (messy wires), or use the cabin light source from the ceiling of the car (I used this).
I bought this to use with my MacBook Pro charger and it works great
Thanks very much for your question. We currently do not ship internationally. The manufacturers that we represent only allow us to sell their products within the continental USA. I'm very sorry. It is a wonderful system.
It is compatible with any camera, digital or film, that has the Mounting Hole on the bottom of the camera. That is a standard mounting location for all cameras.
Yes
I did not install the unit. The Alarm tech who did advised me that there is a "tamper switch" built in.
No
I am using this with Windows 7. And, Windows automatically installed the drivers when I plugged the infra-red sensor into one of the USB ports. If Win 8 is not doing this, try plugging it into a different USB port. If Win 8 is asking for the drivers, then the device may not be compatible. I recommend contacting the manufacturer. Pam
It did for ours.
Looks like you would need a Roku or similar device to stream Netflix.
Christopher, The Amazon Fire Stick should work just fine on this model. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
I was not able to get it to work.
Screen is actually 18.5" diagonal and overall is 20.5" .Hope this helps.
Yes! Very unstable. And yes I did use all of the supplied screws. Haven't done anything to correct issue. I just relocated it to a different room and pray that no one runs into it.
Hi, Thanks for checking with us. Could you please advise your detail address, then we can further check the problem? Ittecc
Yes
I don't notice a difference as far as battery life is concerned. They work great! One thing that I did notice, the battery is hard to remove from the charging case but I have only charged the batteries a couple of times. There is a video that shows u how to remove them and l will look at that again someday.....Not a big deal.
Absolutely Not! It's just a generic, dedicated battery w/ contact points that work on any Canon camera that calls for an LP-E8 battery. I've given this Wasabi battery power pack the best rating of any accessories I've purchased for my camera so far... They're still in my battery grip and have been using without having to re-charge or swap-out for 2 weeks now. Buy in confidence... Have Fun!
Yes the screen socket is the same size
yes it is
Yes. This item screen is 100% work in your laptop.
As long as you have them in the upright position (on top of your head, not around your neck) they don't move. I relax in my chair and in bed with them all the time. Hope that helped/made sense!
Pairing code is 1234 for me. Please try again. It has been reported to be 1234 across the web as well.
the Bluetooth code is 1234, 12345, or 123456 I can't remember exactly.
It usually comes with Canada, USA and Mexico programed in.
Mine came with everything needed including cables and software. But, I used DriveImage (http://www.runtime.org/driveimage-xml.htm) to do the drive-to-drive cloning since I knew it was reliable. Everything worked perfectly. Love it - much faster, even on my old laptop!
3.5 adapter yes, 5 inch adapters don't generally come with these.
I use in Raid two SSD and I havent any problem.
Download the Firmware updater from the Crucial website ( Free Download ) and follow the directions they provide on the site for your particular application.
I would buy a large external drive. The is much faster than standard hard drives
Looks like 3 with 6GBs speeds
Beautifully! It's the same receiver we bought. Thoroughly enjoyed it with the XBox & BluRay, etc.
yes it will.
No
Yes, this camcorder is tri-pod compatible. You might have to go through the manufactuers website to get the right tri-pod for this particular camcorder.
not sure but for the size I don't see anyone using it as a hatcam. its to large for that.
its about the size of a canteloupe but with the bean bag type inside it has some give, but not much.
16gb will be fine
No.
No
Yes
These batteries are sub par. They don't last as long as the original so that is why you see the light turning off so early. They charge quickly due to how short they work.
Yes has micro SD slot but is shipped with no card. I am thrilled with mine (bought 5 ) use them on my model planes. The instructions are a challenge but can be worked out. Can't beat it for the price. dm
Your laptop has a hard drive of sorts so what you will do is transfer the program to that drive via the external CD/DVD device. Go for it.
Mine did.
the company was very easy to deal with and will exchange promptly with communication
Noo...not even with the replaced screen. Check your battery output.
yes. It will fit in B140XW02 V1
I plug my X220 in to this dock and I use a regular power supply that also fits the laptop directly.
Both. a Metal Plate screwed into the body of the lens. a Plastic ring protrudes out the center of that plate and engages the camera body. The plastic ring has metal connectors which come out its sides to engage the camera.
It does work with my D 5100 just fine
Tabitha that's a good question, I'm not really sure. I used it on my samsung tv, but I would pretty well guess that it probably should work on a Samsung Blu ray player, especially when you can do an upgrade to the Blu ray player. You might want to try and contact Samsung directly and ask them, just to be sure.I hope this helps you.I certainly wish you happy New Year
Lithium cell cr2025 3v it's one of the button cell ones, I'm sure any of the same size will work
You have to put your setting on "Timer" for 2 seconds and on the back of the remote there is a 2 second and a 10 second switch to set to what you want.
No. The IR receiver is on the front of the camera, at least on my T3i.
Hi. The item comes with two plug-in chargers: one for the headphones and a second one for the box that connects to the TV.
No
On a full charge Ive found that true to their word that a charge will last the full 11 hrs or more. I have not had a power failure yet.
yes
Hi. I bougth those 3d glasses and they work perfectly with my sony bravia. but it is not the same model of your tv. For sure these glasses works with any sony bravia model.. I hope this will helps you in some way.
According to the information I found, no. If you Google your phone model, it will give you suggestions on what battery it uses and websites to purchase them.
Good question, I use it for my MacBook Air 11" and it fits perfectly. Its snug enough yet loose enough for easy removal. Here are the dimensions of the 11" MBA, I would measure your MS Surface Pro to see if they are comparable in size. The string and button closure does break off pretty easily but there is a velcro patch beneath the top flap. Height: 0.11-0.68 inch (0.3-1.7 cm) Width: 11.8 inches (30 cm) Depth: 7.56 inches (19.2 cm) Weight: 2.38 pounds (1.08 kg)2
No. The flange distance (distance from lens to sensor) is too deep on any SLR. Its much smaller on mirrorless cameras, that's why c-mount and many others can be adapted it. http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flange_focal_distance
the adapter that comes with the lens will work on your camera
From the review,it's suppose to work for mac systems but mine is working well and am using windows 8.1
It will but not very well. Very cheap construction and must be very close to the USB receiver.
Mine did not have that, so I don't know.
Yes it works with all pc and laptops
Should work fine. Dead board or ram. Should post even without ram.
I have not. the magnets are not very strong. Door comes open quite easily. Also, Case is difficult to clean and there is no good way to lift / carry it. I am not completely unhappy with the case, but I did start looking for a replacement after about 12 months.
Hello - None of the R9 290X variations that I looked up quickly will fit with the HDD cage in place. GPU Length Accepted, with and without HDD cage: 270mm / 10.63 in with HDD cage 390mm / 15.35 in without HDD cage
This card is the same size as a standard compact flash card. I only put one micro sd card in to use in my canon slr. While I am not a pro.I didn't notice any lag while taking 5 shot bursts. Note that I did use the highest speed micro sd card I could find(above class 10).
Yes it is
Yes
Yes, it does.
There are two on the right side, and two on the back.
Sorry not quite sure
I am not sure if this will work with galaxy 2. However I have to tell you that I could not use it with my galaxy 3. To fit it in I had to remove the case which was a nuisance. Then if the sun was hot (I Live in Texas] the holder became unstuck. Finally after deciding not to use this I am unable to unstick the base from the dashboard.
I never tried but I would say no. The note is larger length wise and the s3 fits snugly, so I believe it would not fit
Yes it will. Mine is 13 and when I got it, it fit perfectly.
64 bit.
if you look at the specs carefully you will see that it has a 30 degree angle of transmission. You may want to look at a 60 degree angle.
Yes Alan this battery works fine. I purchased it for my daughter months ago and there is no problems with it and it holds a charge for hours.
I had similar experience. Try ordering a new AC adapter cord too. My battery now holds the full charge and its been 2 months and its still okay.
According to http://www.uk.onkyo.com/en/products/cs-n755-85625.html, no, it doesn't.
Yes they do
Glossy, one of the clearest I've had.
I have not tried it yet, however when I asked someone they said yes it should work.
I have never removed it but I doubt it. It's not like a sticker....
As long as you don't need to replace the "Enter" or slash keys. As easy as this keyboard is to install, it was just easier for me to replace the whole keyboard. My notebook you just remove 3 or 4 screws from under the battery and it snaps out.
I'm holding the original keyboard right next to the replacement, which I've already installed. The keyboards are identical. Matte keys, look painted, when I run my finger over the letter, I can detect a faint texture, just like on the original. Frame between the keys is glossy.
3.5 ft about
No, there is no additional battery.
Yes
Yes
It depends if you have other lenses with different focal distances but on a crop sensor it will be about 56mm. I know someone with a 70D who only uses this lens and it works great for him.
Yes. It fits in all cannon dslrs
No. The prostaff offers pretty good light-gathering for its price range, but it is not a night vision binocular.
Hi Amy, The D80 does not have this function but the Creative ZiiSound Dx series speakers do. They are linked below: Creative ZiiSound D3x Modular Wireless Speaker System Creative ZiiSound D5x Modular Wireless Speaker System with Bluetooth Transmitter
I have used a 105 watt studio light bulb and it has held up.
I doubt it since Samsung TVs from some years ago use bluetooth for TV/3D lenses comunication. Just confirm this data on your TV datasheet
some users have reported that if you can only see out of one eye that it does work as both lenses are the same. witch is what changes 3D back to 2d in passive systems. now I couldn't say if you will see any flicker or not but you shouldn't.
No. You receive only what is described. It works great however. Sorry.
Yes it has volume control on the player itself. As long as there is no other noise, it's loud enough. Any other background noise, it's not loud enough.
Yes. They are compatible
It does not come with bluetooth. However I purchased the Avantree Saturn Bluetooth Receiver and Transmitter 2-in-1 Adapter Black from Amazon, to add bluetooth to it.
No.... but it's advisable to have in the 3ds... that's why Nintendo give a 2 gig or 4 gig in each system for free.
I have this it never worked for me. I never used it. I be glad to sell this to you.
I doubt it, this is an entry level card and IIRC Flight Sim x takes a lot of power
I installed AMD latest for this card and works. I'm using it in Windows 8, was using it in Vista before. Works pretty good.
It has 1 HDMI, 1 DisplayPort, 1 DVI (that i'm using) and a DVI-VGA converter included.
Yes!
Yes, easy access to ports, I use it for my 7 Kindle hd and I love it. It isn't bulky but it protects the device nicely.
I'm sorry. I don't know. It was installed in my work laptop. The one thing I will say though, is that the battery is dead. I don't know if the product was bad, or the laptop drained it. It worked fine on arrival, but will no longer charge. So I will not buy another, nor will I recommend it. I hope this helps.
For general outdoor photography? Yes, it is a stable and solid tripod.
I have been really surprised at how sturdy this thing is. I find it very rugged and also had an issue with the ballhead that Dolica replaced since it has a 5 yr warranty. It's relatively light - it's no carbon fiber, but I don't find it any heavier than a standard tripod. Definitely worth it for the price.
I do not know. You can try with Apple EarPods if it works, it will work with this too.
That depends entirely on the recording app you are using on the iOS or Android device you have the mic plugged into. The iPhone's Voice Memo app's files are compressed using the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) codec or the Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC). Because the Voice Memo app only records audio data, the ".M4A" file extension is used. Almost all audio editing apps can work with these kinds of files; check yours to be sure.
The rotary is geared for a smooth pan motion despite the fact that it does not have a handle. You just need to use the camera itself; I find that by gently pulling the camera strap from side to side you can get a smooth pan. It would definitely be better if it did have a handle, especially for adjusting the ball head.
OMG yes. You need 4 GB ram for a pleasant windows experience, but these machines are crazy fast. I sell laptops, and the Precision m6300 is the only one i buy.
No.. I thought it had a Bluetooth adapter but it did not come with it... But the laptop is very very good.. I love it so much.. I been having it for 2 years and it's a good work hard laptop..
Yes it does
Yes it will
My laptop still didn't work after I put in the new battery. I don't think it was a problem with the battery but some dysfunction of the computer. The computer failed to keep a charge even with the AC attached.
is the warranty for this item global ?
I don't think so... Try this: http://www.metabones.com/products/details/MB_SPEF-m43-BM1
Remove the screw on the front of the projector holding the top cover in place. Remove the top cover. Pull bulb assembly out of the top of the unit. Reverse procedure to install new bulb.
No, sorry. Unfortunately, Dension does not have applications for Jaguar vehicles.
I RECORD BROAD CAST TV EVERY WEEK 3-5 PROGRAMS. Play back is the same quality as the original broadcast. The setup speed is a little slow and you have to be patient for the Electronic Program Guide to load. Timed recording is faster to set up.
This caddy + HDD is lighter than my old CD drive. Makes my computer lighter and quieter
It is very thin, but unfortunately, I do not know if it works with a keyboard.
The 2 I ordered have an open cut out.
No it does mot. That is why I do not like it.
Yes, they do. They are very comfortable, I've used them for 7 hours continuously, and they don't bother me at all.
It works with my Sony bookshelf system. My guess is it should work with your boom box.
Do not buy this cable. It is garbage. Unfortunately you have to pay for the apple cable or similar quality. I have tried the cheaper route and in the case of this one, it fell apart first time I used it. In the case of others, they don't always work.
It is not clear. It's somewhat frosted but you can still see the Apple logo and text on the back of the iPad
Yes, it stays on the iPad, but I have ordered another type. Mine did yellow and plastic was rough around one if the edges. Just didn't look nice. Good luck.
It takes old school 35mm film. My daughter mostly likes the sound it makes with no film in at the moment.
I got this for my son and I don't have it to verify the size. It was just big enough to fit his nook so I would say its a shade bigger. Hope this helps
Mine came as a 32 bit
I wouldn't even buy it. Had to return mine, worked for a couple of minutes then died. Bose sound dock portable. To their credit the company offered to send me a new one but I declined. Went ahead and bought a sonos system instead.
yes, I'm using it this way
I obtained my camera kit from Cameta Cameras and it did have a battery and charger in the kit. Very happy with Cameta Camera
Yes
The camera does come with a wrist strap.
Yes, it comes with a wrist strap that you can attach, but I purchased a floating one for use in the ocean and attached that.
Yes it does
I found the picture quality to be quite sharp and clear. Not sure about battery life I do know we had it out all day and evening on the boat and in and out of the water and no problem with it running down. But I always take the batteries out when the camera isn't in use after the day is done.
It does not have an optical viewfinder.
Never tried. 16gb is way more than enough for a full vacation of photos and videos
It should - check the bottom of the bag. There should be a tab, it opens up a Velcro pocket and the cover is in there
That I don't know since I got it before the new iPad came out. But it has a USB port so you should be able to use the cable that comes with the iPad.
Cable and off-air signals reside on the coax cable below 1Ghz. Moca exists on the same cable at the same time above 1Ghz, so they coexist happily on the same cable at the same time. BTW, be SURE to use a Moca entry filter (around $15) at the cable or antenna entry point to avoid outside noise (or your neighbor's Moca who doesn't have a filter) from entering your Moca network.
I notice my internet speeds lower if I use the cm but it's still pretty fast. Try rebooting both of them. Unplug plug back in etc
Yes, it does.
Yes
Only viper
We have Motorola zooms and they won't fit in it. , the 7 in. Model might.
Yes
yes
No it doesn't work with my controls on my steering wheel on my 07 benz
You have to go to this website https://www.gogonav.com/index.php and contact their representative to see if they have the map update for the DDN-868W available for purchase.
No, it comes with the ability to be connected to a backup camera.
Yes, definately! Its dual nature will allow you to shoot both great photographs and really good video! It is also light and compact. The goodies included in thi pack are also great additions and most useful tools!
no. it come without microphone.
they're 16 Ohm... - 8 Hz to 22 kHz
Short answer is YES. Set the SSID of the access point to the same as the SSID of your existing router. Then as you move about the house with whatever PC you're using you should automatically connect to the one with the best signal.
Well, yes...sort of. The tilt would depend how you position it on your lap, of course -- you could use a small pillow to increase the tilt or incline. But your best bet might be to place the Kindle in a Kindle stand, and then put it on top of the lapdesk.
In pairs (2)
Nop!
I got the L style connector shipped to me... and it did come with the 6' cable.
The FM transmitter is strong and easy to use. I have used other devices with an FM modulator (transmitter) and some stations tend to override the modulator. I have not had this problem with the Jabra Freeway. The sound quality is excellent through the FM. Phone voice & strength is also excellent when not used in conjunction with the modulator. As a musical speaker it is ok.
I'm not sure... never used this with any other headphones.
Yup, it works like the headphone jack on any device. It is designed for satellite speakers though. If you don't have at least a 4.1 surround sound setup it's a little overkill. But for the quality and price I'd still go for it.
You can record with a timer in any mode: AM (few do it), FM, and SW. live voice or music. There is 4 gig of memory: all or in pieces to use. you can preset start, stop, daily, once only. you can start recording something you are listening to in progress and only set a stop time. It will probably record for days straight.
Its on the top...
When I got mine, it came with all 3 females. I think the pic they used might of been a different part. But I paid for two and both of them came with females. No male rca. Hope this helps you. Great monitor tho! Works great. Take care. B
What are you trying to mount to the wall? Camera's come with wall mount brackets. DVR would just be a small shelf to sit on If you have internet you would need a network cable to attach to the back of your router. Power outlet nearby to plug the DVD and camera's to supply power to the unit and camera's.
Based on my research, I'd say no.
Maybe not an infant or toddler. But 10 year olds - for sure.
Yes
Yes, it comes with a cable.
Yes. There are 4 different "rings" that come with it. At least they came with the ones that I bought.
Yeah, it will. Just snap it off from the optical drive and you can attach it to the caddy then. You'll need some adhesive like Gorilla Glue though.
Hey Todd, Yes. I don't have that notebook, but after doing a quick search it looks like the Asus x500ca will fit a HDD Caddy. You'll need the 9.5mm caddy. There is actually a quick 3min video on Youtube that shows just how to install it. I don't know if links are allowed in Amazon answers but just search "Asus x550 SSD+HDD upgrade". Hope that helps, enjoy the SSD speeds.
After an expedient Google search, the Panasonic UJ8E2 is a 9.5mm drive so yes, it should fit. I failed to do this check prior to purchasing a 12mm Caddy and now I have two caddies.. one is unfortunately the stepchild that gets packed away for a fatter Laptop.
couldn't tell you; it's a standard size though so it should
absolutely! I am quite sure these will work with any device that uses 3.5 mm audio jack, which is pretty much everything. However, please note that these do NOT have a built in microphone, so the won't function as a headset. But, they will allow you to listen to music and play movies.
nope the keyboard is attached.
I have used two in the same room on two desktops and found no problem. Each one is calibrated to its own USB Pin. Just as two ceiling fans in the same room can have two different remotes, the same is true of the mice.
There are no games included. You supply the iPad with compatible games. The iCade is just a bluetooth controller in the form of a mini arcade cabinet
It is definitely compatible with Ipad 4 as that is the one I have. It took me a couple of minutes to get the connection established (I'm a novice), but once i did, it works great. There are a lot of cool games for this device, but there are also a lot of crappy ones too, so really examine the graphics before you buy any. I do not think it works with the Kindle.
I can't speak specific to a Macbook Pro, but I am using it with a Windows laptop that has a miniport-HDMI cable and it works fine. I do realize that isn't a Mac, but just in case a Mac user doesn't speak up, thought I'd let you know a miniport-HDMI does work in at least some cases. Best of luck!
I don't know what system that kindle uses to store data but if you can transfer the books to a computer and then change the books to text then the noodle can read it. You may have to change it to a word document before you can change it to text.
Yes, but the nex 6 has a standard hot shoe so you will need the hot shoe adapter from sony. The a99 comes with the adapter but I'm not sure if the 6 does. You also have the hvl-60 that's made for the new shoeo
Hi Davies Chisenga, Flash model HVL-F43AM is not compatible on your A6000 camera. Vincent
NO, it is not.
Yes, it does have a webcam.
It is a low profile card and the PS is more than sufficient. Not familiar with the case you mention so not sure of the fit
Yes it would be enough. It doesn't really use that much power, so you're on the safe side. Though sometimes it may be a little warmer, but it hasn't done anything to my optiplex 745 SFF. It's a really good card, money well spent!
Mine worked until my tablet froze. It's now dead in the water. Not caused by the keyboard. Still have that
Yes. only problem I have is battery stop charging after a year
Yes. Use the cable that plugs into the laptop's miniplug out (the headphone jack) and into the RCA inputs on the Ion.
I believe I'm correct in answering, yes, there are stations (or channels on this radio) that don't correspond to airway broadcasts. I went looking for Polish stations. There are too many to count and I don't know Polish so I gave up after scrolling through 100 or so.
Depending on the hookup, either use the RCA jacks or direct wire. Make sure the switch on the back on the radio is set to external speakers.
Yes!
Does not work for music legal reasons in Switzerland, unfortunately.
I looked up "BBC Listen Again" and found 4 separate sites. The Grace Digital gets registered with Reciva. Reciva is your gateway to stations around the world. After registering your Grace Digital Wi-Fi Radio you can go to the Reciva site and do a search for any station. I pulled up BBC London and BBC WM 95.6. You can also request stations on Reciva. If the station you want to listen to streams their program online, you can listen to it that way.
The radio works like the iPad but has better speakers and you can program buttons to select stations like a radio. It doesn't tie up your iPad.
No it does not charge the battery, but it does not use much power. I can play music all day and not drain the phone battery.
Yes. All wires (power, sound, etc) come out the back at the base & are "hidden".
i do not recommend that article, come with failure as the connector comes to wrong side of the tablet ira looking backward prevents use!
Yes.
If your nabi xd is 10.1 it will fit There is plenty of room for a tablet up to 1" 1/2. Depending where camera holes are located you may have to cut holes. Very satisfied
no, sorry.
The product overheats very quickly, and the video quality is not the same if you use a HDMI cable
Only suggestion I have is to used 'canned air' and blow out any dust that is in the keyboard. Perhaps the contacts are blocked. You can also contact iHome directly.
Yes. The iPad fits into a pouch like thing and closes like an old school sandwich bag. Not a zip lock, but with a flap that tucks it in.
Yes. The apple one. It's the one I have. Fits perfectly.
apple has great customer support, 3 days you are still under warranty and the wireless connection should be seamless. contact apple support
In the past we could say that have an Anti-Virus Program on your Mac was not necessary because Mac was not used by many people, but today it has become so well known operating system that now some people with bad intentions have it in their sights. By the way, it will be more secure if you install an Anti-Virus program in your Mac, for Mac Internet security I recommend: Little Snitch.
Yes running yosemite now.
The answer is YES to all your questions
I'm guessing 2011.
It's a monitor, not a computer!
because using the lightning cable to connect to monitor allows the ethernet to be plugged into the monitor, less things to plug into laptop. Also, the macbook pro retna does not have an ethernet port on it.
Not sure what you are asking about. From the Amazon "Product Information - Additional Information" it says "Shipping: Currently, item can be shipped only within the U.S." So , if you want Amazon to ship it to you it won't happen. If you want a U.S. citizen to ship it to you ... it may illegal , few people would knowingly risk a breaking a federal law.
No it does not. I did buy one separately, a nice one in fact, but I didn't like it. The screen is sharper without one and the glass has never been broken or scratched. It is 1 year and 10 months old, and still looks terrific!
I am not sure what all it does but does have TV, DVD, SD & USB! Hope this helps!
Yes it a nice case with good keyboard
It's a straight keyboard - no trackpad/mouse controls. It plugs into the USB port on the side.
ive played PC games off it and its beautiful!
Yes, it is compatible with macs
No u have to buy that seperate.
I don't know enough about camcorders to answer. Look at the different connecting pics at the grex site (e.g. S-video).
Yes Works perfect
Double check your manual. I would expect the D5100 would work with both those flashes via the pop up flash. Either way, the Yongnuo RF-603s are great for simple triggering and will work with both those speedlights. Keep in mind that they simply fire the flash - they do not offer remote power changes or TTL capability.
Bingo! Running said camera on that platform as we speak. Happy New Year!
Yes, it does.
Yes mine came with a 30 day warranty but of course it stopped working about 45 days after I got it.
Yes
Yes
Not so much.
William, I'll check on that tomorrow when I'm back at the office. If I forget, just post here again and I should be notified - otherwise shoot me an email. AEB35.75@gmail.com. Regardless, its a great unit - perfect for an additional monitor and very easy to toggle between the TV and external monitor functionalities. Only complaint is the sound is slightly subpar - I'll try to address your question tomorrow, like I said. Cheers!
Yes... There is controll for light level or to turn it off
I can't specifically answer but I use iphone4 with a video out connector that has RCA and the projector comes with RCA in connector. I am sure you can get a lighting connector with RCA out and it should work
Yes you can and it would use it's own internal battery. There is a side plug in as well to charge via outlet or car adapter also so you could do both.
Yes I have, works great! Knukonceptz is the best bang for your buck.
yes
32 and 3/4 inches wide and 25 inches tall.
Black Full-Motion Tilt/Swivel Wall Mount Bracket for HANNspree ST285MUB 28" inch LCD HDTV TV/Television - Articulating/Tilting/Swiveling. This will work or if you don't need swivel cheaper one's are out there. The hole mounts are pretty much universal on the larger tv's. And the 28" hanspree apple is considered a large tv.
yes
Yes you can, you just need to connect an aux cable or audio Y adapter to the dock or connect the aux cable directly to the speaker.
The quality of the case itself is good. The headphones are not good at all. It took exactly 4 days for them to break. They are very very fragile. Not good quality at all.
I guess you could say they are worth it, but don't expect them to last very long, mine didn't last a week, and I'm really careful with my earphones. So money wise probably not, but they did sound great for as long as I had them.
Haven't tried the receivers internet functions. I use my Blue-Ray to get Pandor (and other apps) and funnel that through the receiver with no problems.
If you look 3 spaces to the right, there's another output labeled SW with no white box around it. There's some on e-bay for great prices too.
It can be, although not easily at all... I must admit, that with a fair to good set of speakers (I am using 6 Definative SM55's, 1 Definative ProCenter 2000, with one sub-woofer, the sub is hardly used), and after running the Audyssey, I did not need to make any adjustments.
yes, i use it on my s3 and all function work fine.if you not sure it will functional with you device you may try to install jays headset controller on android market.
Stick to wireless. I tried to plug it to my Xbox controller with the same idea, but the audio jack wasn't compatible
I don't have an IPod. I only have an Archos MP3 player and it works fine with that.y only complaint about these headphones is that they're not comfortable to wear for long periods of time (1 hour maximum for me).
If you can... go for the SL 150 (Deeper Base).
My suggestion would be a 450 watt power supply. I had just upgraded to a 600 watt before I bought the card. When I researched this card originally, people said that the original 300 watt would work but I think it needs the extra wattage.
No
No
yes
Yes they will.
I ordered the t500 harddrive caddy from amazon several months ago and it is working perfectly.
Yes it's compatible with Windows 8. Just plug it in.
You will need to make sure your headset has A2DP. Usually this means, the headset can take calls and stream music via a bluetooth connection. Your headset will only handle calls. It will pair with your headset, however I don't know if it will function as you would like. You can purchase headphones with the A2DP profile and they will work with this player.
I bougt 2 three of these players over 3 years and none of them lasted longer than a year. I wrote to the company to have repairs done but they responded they could and would not. This 3 years ago and \I have not bought any more since.
If I were you I would send it back and buy a different model. The one I had was a piece of crap. I threw it out.

I never really got to use it. It did not work properly out of the box. It froze then jumped without being manipulated. Further, it was advertised as a "TO GO" product but it only plays purchased tracks. I have a Rhapsody subscription and the player was useless.
Yes, I use it exactly for that in my RV. I can connect to the campground WiFi and have my own private network inside the RV. I have used it to connect to public hotspots like Lowes, Panera, McDonalds, and similar while traveling. You need to add the USB access point to it and may need to upgrade the antenna on the access point depending on the distance from the hotspot. I use a Yagi for maximum range. I have been able to pick up good signals from over 300 yards away.
yes they are correct. I used these speakers on my patio and have been happy with their performance. I did add a 10" powered sub woofer because the bass just seemed to disappear outdoors.
Mine was
"With a weight of just over 1 LB (1.15LBS)" Definitely effortless to carry around
Yes, fits perfectly
I don't know of a single key to use - I use CTL P -
It is an accessory you can purchase separately.
I believe that the tv is always set to 1080p, although the media that you are watching may be at a lower resolution.
No chance. Your PC probably does not draw 900 watts by itself, even if you have that big of a power supply, but, this thing was garbage. Outlets shut down if you draw too much power and it appears you are going to exceed. Buy an APC instead. I bought the Pro 1500 and it is excellent.
Unfortunately this is the only shortcoming of the device. It does not have a replicable battery. If you are a skilled electronic technician I'm sure you could disassemble the unit but I wouldn't bother. The life of the battery should exceed 6 years under normal use. Without disassembling it I would just be guessing at a 12 V 20 AH rating for the battery pack.
Yes, though to play consumer blurays, you may need a player with the appropriate codecs.
Im not sure about that, you just need to check and see what file system you are using and what the Patriot support. I'm just running extFAT so it supports the full 256 GB on the one that I got.
It's physically possible, but I would have concerns about over-heating and reduced surge protection.
Yes, the circle is actually an on/off button and it is illuminated when the power is turned on.
This item cannot directly be controlled by your cellphone. All this custom designed power strip is able to do is enable you to plug in an assortment of AC adaptors (up to6), whereas an ordinary power strip will only accommodate 2 or 3 adaptors at the most. This quirky pivot power outlet can also be curved to go around obstructions.
Sorry, I do not know. Mine doesn't have that problem. Perhaps the cable or the connector is damaged?
I checked it when I received this email and I don't smell anything and it is in use 24-7 with all sockets being used. It has been in use for a couple of months. We have it in an office that is kept at 68 degrees and air circulation is excellent with overhead fans since we use a lot of electronics in this location.
It is very unlikely to work. It's not recognized by my android tablet when I connect it directly. I can't see how a on-the-go adapter would help
Yes. It works well on my MacBook
Yes, you can use this lens on your D90 but only in the M(manual) mode. This is also a classic manual focus lens so it will not auto focus on any camera, including the D90. Hope this helps. Thank you for shopping our store. We appreicate your business. Blue Penn Cameras
I haven't had the opportunity to try it out under water, but it does operate differently. I tried it out at home and the photos are blurry unless you have the lense set at maximum exposure (all the way out). It then takes clear photos. This means to me that you better be ready to use it when it is in that mode before it automatically turns off during your power saving mode.
Yes there is, and I would recommend getting a floating wrist strap in case you drop your camera.
Dear Ricky, Thank you for your inquire. Could you send your email to us? So we can send you the picture of the products via email to see if fit.Do you think it is OK? Any problem,just contact us.Regards.
Im nor entirely sure but I dare to answer: yes since msi z87-g45 support up to 3000mhz ram and this rams are 2133
yes, that MotherBoard uses DDR3; just like this ram.
I think they are one of the best and they have life time warranty I don't know if ballistix has that
I would just call their support number to be sure or ask someone on /r/buildapc
Yes
Yes they will work. I had to set the frequency to 2100MHz to begin with, these RAM chips are set factory at 1600 if I remember correctly. All your MB must be capable of is supporting DDR3.
For what e-reader? Nook, Kindle, etc.?
I mounted to the bottom of the TV and left room on the mount when above the fireplace so it fit OK
I don't see why you couldn't attach a 70" TV to it, and it's awfully sturdy and heavy-duty. BUT given the safety issues inherent, I'd ask the manufacturer before doing so. I know when I bought mine they were extremely responsive to my questions.
Email the company cust support. They sent me replacement when I lost one. They shipped same day. Good. Cust support
The cord should work. It is not a short one with an extension like many have that work just for iPods. I believe it is about 4' long. I will be HAPPY to send you my pair as I am not a fan of the design. If you like them, I can give them to you. My email address is criceball@aol.com
I'm using the shelf on a lg 47 in LED tv supporting my Klipsch RC3 that weights 29 lbs and doesn't have any issues. Go for it!
Yes, I have it on my Macbook Air, so it works find on the Mac.
It is being sold by [AIM USA] and they choose what they want to sell it at. I don't know what kind of company that is, but that price is a ripoff. When I bought my mouse a couple years ago, it was only like $30 or $40.
I just got this and the WDBBEP. It's a little snug, but yes, it fits.
Only for the drive. The hard drive itself comes with a fabric pouch for the cable.
I installed this product on my 2009 Imac and glad i did...works great.
Hello, Yes there is. You have to go to the menu and go to the HDMI settings. There is a pass through option. I am not sitting in front of my equipment right now so I am going by memory but you will see it. Let me know if you need anymore help.
You don't this is a 7.2 receiver
Amazon has asked me if I could help with your question. First, I don't have a Nyrius but I did look into it. My situation looks like it's different then yours. I have two satellite dishes and wanted to send to multiple receivers from each one. I now have RF-Links which do the job. I have three receivers that can select from either of the two senders. Similarly you should be able to set up several receivers with your one Nyrius sender. Hope that helps. DCL
Yes
I don't know about the Kindle fire, but it worked well on my Winbook tablet.
1 cover each. But I will warn you about the bulbs that are included. They make my skin look pink on video. This did not happen with (more expensive) light boxes from another source.
it does come with screws for the bottom of your camera
The straps are 1 inch wide and 1/8 thick material,however the shoulder pads are extra padded and very comfortable.
Yes, it is possible to change out the carabiner to something else. I would recommend doing that because the ones on there are very cheap and break.
Yes.
I have the air buds that has the bubble tips. The silicone earbuds tips snapped on. I don't have the Bose head set, just a pair with bubble tips, and what a great choice I made getting the Silicone Earbuds.
Yes, "mixed" has each pair (left and right) of Small, Medium, and Large.
yes
I did not purchase for that model. Sorry.
According to the specifications power supply requirements are 12to 24volts DC/AC
First of make sure your children have not left little smudgy fingerprints on the lens (it happened to me). If you do see dirt or smudges, make sure you use a soft lint free cloth to clean it. Once you have verified that is not the problem, focusing this camera is pretty easy, make sure you have the subject in the center of the shot, and gently press the shutter button until the focus indicator lights green. Then finish pressing the button down.
No, sorry I do not.
Yes it has a 10 second and 2 second mode and a timed burst mode for multiple exposures
It was a good design, BUT it was not worth the money or the time, because it stopped working! Overall good look bad hardware.
It does not. The base contains all of the input ports, and the screen is connected statically to the base. If you wanted to somehow support the entire monitor at a 90 degree angle, I'm sure you could display your desktop vertically... but the base/stand does not support rotating the screen to stand vertically.
The new module came with a battery pack. Also the original LED module had a battery pack.
It seems that after a certain time without activity the receiver shuts off. Like if I ride to work when I get ready to go home I have to press the button and cycle through the settings to get to brake mode again. So no it won't run down the battery.
Not to my knowledge. I will say that I have truly enjoyed mine and love it.
We are sorry but we do not know of any manufacturer that makes a tripod color for this Rokinon 500mm lens.
I've used this quite a few projects and have not had any problems with it. For the price it's perfect. I did end up buying a couple of flourescent lightbulb bags because I got tired of taking each lightbulb out individually from the box and styrofoam for each bulb. Lol but other than that I like this kit a lot!
Well I'm not into proyectors so I do not really about it sorry.
Cheaper and faster just to replace the whole set. It used to be that a TV shop would have spare parts to cover almost anything, but having a screen in stock is highly unlikely. That means waiting for the TV guy to order one from the manufacturer, waiting for delivery and then the laborious process of replacing the screen. Might also suggest buying restraints for the child.
Ok
Yes, of couse. It comes with the one button cable as well, but beware that the cable volume up and down will not work. Only the one button functions (play/pause, next and previous)
Mine came with 2 cords. One with the built-in mic and the other without. Both appear to be about 5 ft. long. It has a standard 1/8" jack but you can get a 1/8" to 1/4" adapter at radio shack, best buy, etc. to fit your stereo.
Yes. I have already had to send mine in as the cord died once.
I own two antennas; one for 2 years. It would either be the signal going to the antenna from the broadcasting center changed or a glitz with the tv and it needs reprogramed.
Yes, the iPad slips into the top part of the case and when you want to remove it you just lift it out and the case and iPad snap together. It uses a usb charger which comes with it and the charger plugs into your computer when you want to charge your keyboard. I have used the keyboard for days without having to charge it. I use my iPad a lot so the keyboard battery lasts a long time before needing to be charged.
I used it for my ipod touch. If it has the older generation connector (as opposed to iphone 5 small connector) it should work. but this unit has a USB connection, so I think if you have the right USB -&gt; ipod cord, you should be fine.
I just ordered it for my HP g7 1070us. It fits perfectly and really keeps a longer charge than the original battery.
This 3-way port is very poorly made. I would not purchase.
I got the remote control and a receiver that you plug into the USB port - it's on a flexible lead so that you can position it away from where you plug it in. Not sure how long it is as I have not extended it fully yet.
No WiFi. Must have hardwired Internet connection.
This card is for decoding video only.
I'm not sure. I used it to upgrade the video capabilities of a Gen 1 Apple TV. Sorry I couldn't help you.
Yes. That's how mine is plugged in.
It comes with an adapter that you plug in to the back of your Playstation 3. Audio 2/5 microphone 2/5. Audio cut out on me a lot and the people that I played with complained about static. If I could get a refund I would.
No
They are separate
i think it will work, i have used it on a power drill and no problems at all, check for the watts consumption of the nebulizer it should be less than 500 watts
Yes can stack, but they aren't specifically designed for it. You'll need to employ some of your own ingenuity to secure them. Best if you have solid floor rather than carpet if placed on floor since they have a small footprint and some carpet tends to flex a bit near the tack strip. You'll want to anchor these to the wall if you stack them particularly if you live in a seismically active area (or have cats!).
Yes. It comes with the warranty information and serial number and you register it with Nikon. :)
Black
I use it for the same purpose. You get the SD version of whatever package you're subscribed to.
yes it can
This monitor is made for back up camera in your car. No audio. I will work hooked up to 120 volts, but still no audio
Yes, but I don't know how long it will play. There are adapters that will allow you to use batteries, and then if you use it in a car, it is on a battery-- a really big one. The spec says it will run on something like 6 to 18 volts. Just be careful and match the polarity.
It might fit but it will not work. This is an enterprise SAS drive. The PS4 can only use SATA drives.
Push top down & turn to right, black peg on top will line up with symbol on bottom. Only necessary to protect speaker from dirt or for travel.
No. That is why the case is on sale. The iPad Air is new and there are few accessories that work with it. Give them some time to update their accessories to the Air.
Nope, you have to use your own monitor. I used an old PC monitor ...
It records on a loop just like the old VHS security systems used to do. Once the drive is full it starts recording over the oldest video on the drive. No need to delete or format the HDD.
No these are not.
It has drivers and a cable for Bluetooth but is not a Bluetooth card.
it take the laptop cool, but there is no fan, so is just the material used to make this who take cool, sorry for my bad english
I guess so, although I don't use 32-bit computer any more. It depends on the operating system.
No you cant do it on galaxy tab!
There is a middle click button that works normally in Windows 8. I'm sorry I can't confirm for Linux.
No, the OS is Window XP. The battery is may last only 20 min.
I use this in conjunction with a phone ap called Torque. I am able to se any and all "codes" that may be on any car that has an OBD2 port. I can reset the codes and see a great deal of real time engine information. It works great
Very good questions , sorry to say nothing, but very good product, I'm satisfied with my.
Yes. I just used it to play movies.
Yes; Amazon will always try to pack your goods together, specially if you're buying more than one of the same device.
Ram is DDR2 only capable of 8gb total 2gb sticks pc6400 motherboard is 64bit capable depending on processor windows 7 works
It connects via ethernet with a power injector in between to send it power. It can connect to your home router instead of directly to your PC as well. You access it via web page to configure it. The instructions give you the default IP address and password to access it.
My guess is that they will not work even at 1/4 mile without line of site. With LOS you can go 6 or 7 miles. The only way to know for sure would be to try. If there is not of other 2.4 around and you get a good bounce then maybe but I still say not likely.
You plug it into your computer and erase it off from your computer.
Not sure about the red filter One of the holders that come with the kit u can use it with a baseball cap U have to practice so u know where the camera is pointing
Hi Stephanie, I suggest you to use the Amazon On-Line tool to check if it fits. I am not sure, but should. For the brake wiring, just connect the Parking wire (from the unit) to negative (black wire).
Take it to a shop.
If your car is double din then it should fit... you might need to buy a wiring harness to connect it.... i place mines on a 08 nissan frontier sat in place perfectly i used the original mounting brackets
Yes it will fit your car, you will need a radio installation kit converter since this is a single din unit, you have a double din unit that has a bit of a round sides, so the install kit will make this upgrade look clean.
Yes it should work without any problems. I have the previous dual tuner and it works just fine. Wayne
3............
Should work fine as long as there are no obstrutions to its view of the satellites.....your zip code is listed in the instructio booklet.....
It should. It is universal but you have to sacrifice a key that stays inside the box. It amplifies the signal of your keys immobilizer chip and transmits it to the ignition by a wire loop.
Sorry, no. You can probably get chromecast in the play store. However, I can no longer recommend Acer products. My A500 died after just two years, and since it's past warranty, Acer won't even talk to me. ...or anyone else. Here's a list of other people with the same trouble http://community.acer.com/t5/Tablets/Iconia-A500-frozen-at-Acer-logo-boot-screen/td-p/7171 If you have trouble with the link, just go to the Acer FAQ page and look up Iconia A500 frozen at Acer logo boot screen. You will be amazed at how common the problem is.
Unfortunately, it is end-of-life at Android 3.2.1 ...even though Lenovo promised an upgrade shortly after the K1 came out. Never happened and from what I gather, not likely to happen.
You can if the webcams are not only powered by the USB hub. The power supply that powers the hub and devices does not provide adequate power for more than a few devices. USB sticks and such this would be ok, but with hardware, no not recommend. I would buy smaller hubs that are powered and chain them together and that should let you power 10 USB webcams and a better brand, let would have a better power supply. I got 2 D-LINK powered hubs and those work great with no issues. Here is the link: http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-Hi-Speed-7-Port-Powered-DUB-H7/dp/B00008VFAF/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1382384783&sr=8-1&keywords=d-link+7+port+usb+hub
In general you can charge USB devices on a powered hub with out a computer. I do it with my FitBit, cellphone and my son's 3DXL. As far as this hub is concerned, it under powered. Their 10 port has more power and USB 3.I bought the 12 found it not capable to power 6 devices at 2.5 watts and reviewed them with my experience. They responded to tell me in my needs I should use their 10 port and return the 12. I have done that and the 10 port is doing the job.
Did u ever find an answer to this?
I'm not sure what you mean by decoded, but I use these in my Panasonic Lumix FZ200 and I can't tell the difference between OEM and these. Battery gauge and all.
All i can say for sure is that DMC-G6 is in the list of cameras. As i've said before, my camera was not in the list. Are you interested in it?
Yes, the ear bud / headphone port is located on the back side under the rubber flap next to the other connection ports
I can't attest to performance, but build quality and durability is significantly less than the westcott. I returned the phottix the same day I got it, as I opened it up and pieces broke off and inside of it.
Hello, the spines are metal.
Version 3. The company is Italian, they say Rev for revolution.
No it is a receiver only, not a transceiver
yes i have a 780 fits perfectly
Yes comes in red blue and green
In order to reach this fan you have to take the front plate of the tower off. First you must take both side doors off of the tower. Then on either side in the front, you will feel 3 pegs. Pinch and push them all forward to release the front panel of the tower. You will then have access to the front HDD fan.
do not get . i just got one to program atmega328p and do not work.....useless.

Full Tower. Hella big
I'm using a h100i because it's less clutter but for an air cooler probably go with a Noctua NH-D14 or Phanteks TC14P
USB 3.0 cable which is compatible with a USB 2.0 connection on most computers. The older USB 2.0 models come with a USB 2.0 cable, which can be connected to USB 3.0 connections on most computers. These are Type A connectors. The end that connects to the device is the standard Type B (USB 2.0) and the newer Type B for USB 3.0 cables.
Both the order confirmation & shipping notice came from Bang & Olufsen, (USshop@bang-olufsen.com).
It is the new model.
I doubt that you will be able to connect directly to it like that. Now you can connect the drive to a laptop or desktop computer and then connect the camera to the laptop/desktop and burn the camera video directly to it. The burner has to have software telling it what to do and how to do it.
I'm using them in my loft for mixing but you will need to learn them in order to get the perfect mix. Took me about a month to get my mix right with these.
not fit for it
I don't belive this antenna will work with ISDB-T , this antenna covers VHF Band 174-230MHZ & UHF 470-862 MHZ , from what I could find ISDB-T is in the 2600 MHZ Band .
The Samsung Galaxy S4 has a mini USD connection. This is a converter from HDMI to micro HDMI, not for USB.
Your printer measurement on Width is 0.25" too wide and your other measurements are within range. You might give it a try since it is made of cloth and may fit. Your call. ...
Yes, I believe it will. I have a 160 gig black I-pod and replaced mine. If you never replace it before, Highly suggest you watch the you-tube on how to do it. Just getting the thing apart is the hardest part. You might want to check and make sure it is not your head phones /buds. I replaced mine and still had problems and found it it was just the buds. Good Luck
Yes, this lens would work with any camera that uses the A-mount.
From what I know it fits well. I am fairly sure it will fit the I pad air They do have a good return policy just in case. God bless
Yes. We just hooked it up and it worked.
It works ok my gt-p1000.
That is what I used it on.... zoom in on the pic and make sure the buttons and holes for camera are in the right spot......Also I ordered 5 of them at different times and 3 were broken and had to return them...but the company was very generous and the return cost me nothing except waiting time.
Hello, To dim the brightness on the backlight, you just press the snooze button until the desired brightness has been made. thanks.
Italy is included in the preloaded counties. I do not recommend to buy this unit, it stopped working 13 months after I purchased and I spent 10 hrs with Magellen chatting to get it fixed with no results. Claus Wutherich
Does not need internet to work. Would probably need internet to update maps.
HI - you can listen to music via a USB connection
Answer should be yes, you need to check the spec of the unit u order.
that's easy, none. The video memory is shared from general memory, AKA RAM. There is 4 gigs of memory on the desktop. This is a good general purpose desktop.
Hard plastic.
It will fit a standard CF (compact flash) slot. It has a side loaded push-push slot for the SD/SDHC card which works flawlessly for a standard sized card.
It was tough to reach to measure, but it appears to be 34 inches, and doesn't look like it can be cut down.
I'm not sure. According to the WD TV live owner's manual, the WD TV live unit looks at the format of what's on the external hard drive connected via USB.
Yup! That's the one I have!
Could be memory low try deleting pictures, videos and apps you no longer use. This will help free up memory that games use a lot of sometimes! Hope this helps! Larry S.
Go to Google play online.
How do you rate amps, watts, volts.... this sub thumps. Best bang for the buck. Had mine 3 yrs never turned it up over halfway because it overpowers my surround and wakes up the neighbors. It does high and low inputs.
Nope. Outs still works fine.
I have the 50' one which doesn't have an amplifier. The only one with an amp is the 100' one and I don't know where the amp. is on that one. (Sorry)
Well, i own a panasonic blu-ray (3D) Tech specs here http://shop.panasonic.com/shop/model/DMP-BDT220?t=specs, and a Smart Samsung Tv 3D, and i have never had problems. Im not sure if any of my devices delivers 1.4 hdmi, but the cable is working just fine.
The Atrend web site shows a different one for your truck. Copy and paste the below link to go to their site and you can see they show a 164-10CP for your truck. I would not think the one I used would fit your truck as they are custom made and there is literally no extra space under the seat after installing. Good luck. http://www.atrendusa.com/bbox/vehicle-specific-carpeted/gm?page=shop.browse&category_id=58
I'm going to say it would. It fits perfectly in my 03 Silverado. I'm not the seller, however. Just offering advice.
Yes. We have two of the tab 3s and they do fit.
Yes, it will charge pretty much any phone. The part that matters is what goes into the phone. It'll charge Windows, Android, BlackBerry and Apple. You might need an adapter for your phone but you have to find that out. The 4 port charger is very useful and beneficial.
This 2-Pack cables too support the newest standard. Towards the end of product description, you can find this mentioned. Also, these cables have the same features as the single pack. Thus, 2-Pack and single pack cables are identical.
It broke after a few weeks of usage.
Its 720p but i could never get the light amount to work right
These are passive glasses in which i purchased for a 3D TV that needed active glasses so I returned them. According to my findings the answer is no. You need AG-S250 for your TV.
Yes
Dimensions for this product are approximate due to it's curvature on the bottom as well as having a belt clip on the back. With this in mind the dimensions are 3 1/2 inches long by 2 1/2'' tall and 7/8 inches wide.
I have the ear plug for the one ear not the actual head set.
No problems and for the money it is very good :)
If you have a standard threaded 52MM lens, then this lens will work physically. The 52MM Professional Lens Kit for NIKON (D5200 D5100 D5000 D3200 D3000 D90 D80) - Includes: 2.2x Telephoto, 0.34x Fisheye and 0.43x Wide Angle (w/ Macro Portion) High Definition Lenses + Filter Kit (UV, Polarizer and Fluorescent) + MagicFiber Microfiber Lens Cleaning Cloth is made of the D90 and might work better. It all depends on the size of the lens you have.
That's a bit of a problem. You cannot use it while it is charging. But it does charge through the USB connection so your power bank will still be useful.
You can download the manual in english and change the menu to english. That is what I had to do.
Mine came with a wall charger that uses a USB interface. You can use the same cable to plug it into a PC. When you plug in the USB, it will automatically ask if you are charging the unit or plugging it into a PC.
yes, if like all other I pods ! I have 4 & 5
I believe it is. I don't notice much of a difference. I use both the aux cable and the direct ipod connect.
Not sure, but I can tell you I have not had any issues with it on my iPad.
Yes, but some services as Netflix took video out ability off the app.
The side that does not have the ear jack can be turned. Just twist the outside of the headphone where the S emblem is located.
The second video input can be used for any video feed you have (Another camera, DVD player, etc.). Most dual input monitors use #2 for the backup camera which will display automatically when shifted into reverse, then return to display input #1 when shifted out.
Yes
Yes, wonderful at all three. I do all of the above on it. It handles fast 3D graphics with no blur, beautiful colors, no bleed over, sharp crisp. No faded looking colors like you get with a back-lit LED.
Just a reminder Sunny.. I'm speaking about the VP2365-LED", not the 27"..You'd have to look up the specs on that model..Once more, I'm super happy with my 23" model..You can't go wrong with that one..You would pay 2-3x more for a monitor to top this for editing IMHO..Good Luck! Eddie (PAHTSPIX)
yes, works perfect with win 8.1 blue and pro
This is not a modem that connects to a telephone line. It is a cable modem only.
Yes, as long as you have space on the click free device.
Yes, AM3 processors are forwards-compatible with the new socket AM3+. the Video card will work as well
YES It can. Very well.
No it will not. cracked screens calls for replacement screens
yes
I clip it right to my backdrop bar right in the center
From the top of my head: Tablet Charging cord Battery Cleaning cloth for screen Discs for reinstall Instructions Stylus with tethered line and an extra "refill" for the stylus and batteries for the stylus (I think it uses batteries, if it does you get batteries) I think that's about it
Sorry - no idea
Yes, you need a QAM tuner. If you have acable box you need at least a NTSC tuner for channel 3 or 4. For basic cable right out of the wall, you will need a QAM tuner. Does this TV have a QAM tuner?
The connection from the player to the TV is with RCA audio/video cables. They were included with my unit.
Yes
Not sure, but I believe it was made to work with any IPad. I use it with a Kindle Fire HD - and according to the manufacturer, it shouldn't work with the Kindle. I do love it though.
I have a 515 unit in hand and on the back it indicates the accepted input voltage to be 100v to 240v AC, 50-60 Hz. So, to answer your question, it is not specifically a 240v unit, it's a "universal" type in that it accepts US standard voltages and European (240v 50hz, similar). If you have any concerns you should call TASMAN directly (go to their website www.tascan.com) or call them at 323-726-0303.
I use it all the time in Oregon which is as I recall in the United States
output is 5 Volts 1.5 amps 7.5 watts
It's wired keyboard.
The one I received is standard English QWERTY keyboard. It does not have the special characters like some of the photos.
Yes. Large left shift key is on this keyboard.
when we first got it out of the box we also had a hard time to connect it for the first time, there is a tiny reset button right next to the volume letters, after that we plugged the USB first then turned on the headset and it started working properly, we mainly use it on the PS3 and the PC.
Yup. If I am not mistaken. The product page have list of the systems requirement and OS compatible
I use Mac OSX 10.6.8 and 10.10 Mountain Lion with no problem; plug and play.
No B, The tube is way too wide and cannot possibly shrink down to fit.
No, this is not lined with adhesive. I had lots of edges wrapped underneath so it was not an issue but it is definitely good for 2:1 ratio on shrinking.
The cords are relatively noisy due to the braided surface
TOTALLY! you definitely won't regret buying them!
I would guess not but the seller is really the only one who can answer that question accurately. Good luck.
N2A has a good website. Join the forum. Your question can be answered correctly there. The actual micro SD card will work, but the software may be different.

no it is not normal. I get the hissing sound until i turn off the puck(i.e. I touch it). The hissing with power on appears to happen with most computers and speakers, until the speakers are turned off.
I have not used a scanning wand. The LSM-100 is swiped over the document and depending on the size puts the image together from several scans. Size and portability is very good.
try the micro usb cable for a Blackberry.
Product was as advertised. It fit my Canon SX50HS perfectly.
Its made for 2 devices and one monitor.
Yeah I use mine to wire connect my printer, receiver, and tv to my wifi network.
Good question. The ports are only usable in bridge mode.
It should - that is what it is designed to do. I have a media server and a TV attached to mine. I can stream Internet content over wireless to the TV, and stream music to other devices on my wifi. Make sure you update the firmware http://support.dlink.com.au/Default.asp as my connection was very unreliable till I did. Still has some reliability issues, and I would try something else next time (although the problem could be the Motorola device it bridges to).
Probably, but I wouldn't recommend them anyway, as they wear out VERY quickly
Hi, Yes, that is what I bought them for. They work great.
These are passive. There is very little material (very thin/simple).
Yes but they are junk 2 or 3 out of 5 returned. One now that just stop for no reason
That's mines main use ! I ride a crf450r
I have used Garmin GPS units of several types, in the car and hand held, in the USA. I haven't taken them out of the states, but they are very dependable and never given me any reason to doubt their accuracy. You can buy them with maps for any country. Just make sure you get it loaded with the map you need and you will have a great GPS.
according to the Garmin website, a map for the Andes is available. However it is only for the etrex 20 and 30. That being the case, it would probably suit your needs.
It doesn't allow anything since mouse is not working(i was already refunded for this).
Yes it has both.
Yes. They make a wireless 6 key push button the syncs with the controller.
It does have a built in siren. You would not add this to your system but you would replace your system with this system
Hello OrangeMonkie, I apologize received a defective unit. Both front and rear facing camera should perfectly align. Please login into your amazon account and contact us with your order number and brief description of the problem and we'll replace it immediately. Sincerely, rooCASE Customer Care Support
No ...thankfully. I'm not a fan of hand holders
I think about 10 -15 feet Have found in a different room from sensor
Mine upgraded over the air from Acer all on its own after I connected it to wireless. First it updated Honeycomb and a couple of days later it upgraded to ICS. Acer has a video on their site regarding how to make the tab look for an update but since mine did it on its own, I never had to watch the video.
I havent used it but there is an ARC option on the receiver, so yes
I refilled my TN-450 with a bottle. It should fill the 420 as well. I've used my cartridge twice, so far. I suggest:1) Use latex gloves 2) Carefully empty all the "old toner" from old cartridge before refilling. (shake gently into plastic lined garbage bag and knot it to avoid the dust from escaping). Good luck.
Screw on
It is a continuous light source and so will work with any camera. It has a hot shoe (which is really a cold shoe) mount or you can mount it on a tripod, light stand, duct tape it to a pole, or whatever. Many have switched to these for their DSLR for video. Use the diffuser if you are going to be using this aimed directly at people from a close distance.

This will not fit your lens. You need the Canon Tripod Mount Ring B (W). Unfortunately, It doesn't seem that the chinese manufacturers are making these, probably because they come with the lenses they attach too and thus not a huge market for them. I found one marketed as being compatible on Amazon but it's a hinged design and I wouldn't really trust it. I think your best bet is to buy a used one off of eBay or just bite the bullet and buy one from Canon.
No it will not, you E-mount tube set.
Don't know
The case doesn't have that auxiliary wrapper it is simply the keyboard (which has a slot for the ipad to prop it into the position shown).
I can't be certain, but I doubt it. The magnetic front cover isn't likely to interfere much, as long as the hinge is up.With a back cover on though, while the iPad might fit, it probably wouldn't fit well.
Yes it is (for both).
Thank you for the inquiry, Mar. The cable was specifically designed for Apple iPhones. The microphone will work with an Android, but the buttons (volume up/down and the play/pause buttons) may not work with most versions of Androids.
Yes
If all you're talking about is the height top bar to floor, just put t screen on, roll the top bar and clamp it, then click the top bar in place. If you mean width, take a bar segment out and clamp the excess backdrop. So answer is yes :P
Strictly 110v. You'll also need an adapter kit to plug into various foreign wall recepticles rated at that voltage overseas.
The drops could be a lot larger, maybe 1/3 larger so more than one person can fit on it.
Yes; pay attention when you take the stuff out of the bag, it has to go in the same way.
We will pack as good as we could sometimes Fedex driver not careful with the package.
Imagine your desktop keyboard without the numbers and F keys sections, and with a narrow trim around it.
Yes, I use it with my 1st gen nexus 7
I think this keyboard will work fine for you; it does for me. I use it with an Android based tablet and an iPad and in both cases have had no trouble whatsoever.
No, it doesn't.
Yes it Does, has Dobly Surround Sound
Dolby Digital Live with 7.1 "virtual speaker".
Yes. The case has a textured black finish. It has held up nicely since I have bought it so no obvious wear/quality issues.
The expiration date on mine are 2021
The device is to control a cable box through the TiVo. In other words you control the TiVo the same was as now, and the IR Emitter sends a signal to the cable box. The cable box could be hidden.
I think it's like 6 feet long. I have mine bundled up still since my cable box adapter is plugged in right next to my Tivo.
I have been disappointed with this antenna... It will transmit marginally ok, but doesn't receive well and is spotty at best (overall). Save the money and buy a better rig... seriously
This unit has major bugs. I am sure Amazon can ship it to Russia, but you should consider a similarly priced Yamaha, Denon or Onkyo that works correctly!! They are fairly equal in quality/craftsmanship.
You need a phono preamp, I purchased an ART DJ preamp, and connected to analog 1. Works well with Shure MM 5e cartridge.
They do protrude a little bit, but there is a plastic lamination over the entire surface that merges the buttons with flatness of the surface, so you can't even tell that the buttons are there.
Yes
Yes it is. However I think the ethernet speeds are only 10 and 100 NOT up to1000. According to Donna of Toshiba Direct the ethernet speeds up to 1000 is only available on their Quosmio line. Go to Toshiba Direct tech site which you can find on this page somewhere and ask them anything about this laptop or any other Toshiba PC's. They are open on Sundays !!!
This is the corerct power AC to charge the battery of your Cybershot DSC-HX camera.
They say does, so I have only got it to work with Windows Explorer , you must install the driver active-x it request. the camera has a speaker jack on it for an external speaker you must provide. hope his helps
The power adaptor comes with this device supports 100-240 volt AC input with 5v/2A DC output
To charge fully, the same as your phone, maybe 3 hours max... depends on how much you use too.
if it has a basic USB port for charging (similar to an Android phone charging port) it would work.
I know it fit my 10.1 tablet that was a new model. I'm not sure if it was a 7500 or not. Given the dimensions are the same, I'm thinking you could modify it if needed.
It didn't work for me.
I do not remember. This device is a plug and play item. You just plug it in to your computer and let it install. It does come with a USB cord that is about three feet long so you can place the device in a area that is better suited for wireless signal. If the item fails to load properly you can go to the linksys website and download the driver onto your computer.
It works with the bare iPad mini turned sideways.
It's very light - about the weight of a flash drive. Hope that helps.
It should i used on samsung and on sony and it worked great
Never got the exact measurement but it is hanging my 60 inch and there is probably 6 inches on both sides of the TV
I would assume that all Galaxy 10.1's would be configured the same and all fit cases designed for the tablet.
No
DSLR with mic, light and H4n and works just fine. In fact: more weight = smoother shots.
No I don't think it will support 5th generation.
Most likely no. It does not fit fi9804 or fi9805.
Unfortunately I can't answer your question definitively. These small ones were put in small places; we have some larger ones that do activate when our cat comes up to the front or back door....my husband thinks they probably have about the same range. I'd just try it; you can always take it down and put in another place if it causes a problem with the dog.
Yes, you do. You can use dropbox
This camera comes with a disc which excludes the software. However it is poor at best. If you are seriously interested in exploring the world of IP security, I highly recommend you look at Foscam instead. I entered this business with EasyN but found Foscam to be a better choice for many reasons. EasyN simply has not kept up with the technology. Further, there is virtually NO customer support with EasyN. Foscam offers excellent customer and technical support.
NO don't do it you'll fry your camera. They wont even work with my pocket wizards, because pocket wizard only handle up to 200 volts. Vivitar 283's are workhorse's but they need so many accessories to work. The have up to 400 volts. You'll need to get a safe sync to reduce the trigger voltage down to under 6 volts for canon and i think 12-24 for others. 6volts to be on the safe side.
The GF3 can be purchased as a body only OR with a standard kit lens. If you bought the body only, you'd then have to purchase a micro 4/3 lens (either from panasonic or olympus). If you bought the body + standard kit lens, it's ready to use as is.
yes
I honestly am unsure. I bought mine for a NV59C. They are pretty versitile though bc mine gets used for 2 other gateway models as well.
The last time I ordered this, I got a more generic one so the model numbers don't match. But if you have an Asus this looks like the correct one to me too. Just make sure the "plug" size looks the same and you should be good to go! Hope this helps. (P.S. I've ordered two of these on Amazon and both were great fits.)
It is for an Asus. Mine is a K52F
I would recommend a different charger. Mine makes a crackling noise every time I plug it in. It got to the point that I just bought a different one because I was afraid if frying my laptop.
I'm not sure, but the one I ordered charged my laptop once then quit working all together.
Thanks for your interest. I am sorry to tell that the item you are inquiry cannot work with the IQ506. While the item 111-11005-03 can work with it. You can check this item by the following link:
I have no idea...sorry. I put my model name & number into the search and this is the model that came up. It matched my broken one, it was Prime, so I ordered it and it came a day & half later and worked perfectly. I was back to work on it immediately.
YES it is the same battery...
I did have a problem with my order the first time and the battery delivered did not charge in the laptop, but when I ordered form a different vendor on Amazon (USTOP Battery for PA3634U-1BRS Toshiba Satellite M505-S4940 M305D-S4830 M305D-S4829 Sold by USTOP Condition: New) it worked great and charged correctly.
yes it fits perfect but it gives you only 2 hours use in full charge
Yes.
This model comes with an Intel Centrino 1000N 802.11a/b/g/n wireless adapter, and an external antenna. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by "wireless internet spot," so I should clarify that this device is not a wireless access point on its own and does not receive mobile broadband or anything like that. It just acts as a client on standard Wi-Fi networks, much like many laptops or mobile devices.
This is a barebones kit. It does not come with a hard drive or RAM so you will need to purchase that separately. It will only take a 2.5" HDD or SSD (Laptop size) and laptop size ram. So therefore it does not have any OS loaded on it. I have MythBuntu running on mine and it runs great. I have seen other reviews where they say that it runs Win7 just fine as well.
Hi, Barry, there is no battery! It's all run on light by solar power. It's a great calculator. I've had it for over a year now (I think) and it's fantastic! No issues with it at all. I love the big keys, it helps me to be able to do those simple calculations easily. Enjoy!
I purchased it to use with Windows 7. It worked at initial set up and not after. Perhaps it was set up for Windows 8.
No
Yes it does come with the bit.
You need to by whatever adaptor you need for your vehicle. I use mine on the handlebar on my two dirtbikes. Rugged mounts makes a couple of different adaptors and think about the length of the adaptor. I thought i would like the short arm, but ended up likening the longer arm so i don't have to look down as much and can keep my head up looking at road. I have used it a bunch and the unit works well.
I used these on my Montana....I found them to be troublesome with a touch screen because they impaired my ability to use the touch screen effectively due to thickness
I use that Suction mount for a Garmin Montana 650T. Works pretty good if there is a smooth enough surface. Falls off occasionally.
Indeed it does... it comes with a pig tail with coaxial audio and video plugs... for the 1/8 jack in the front. There also two ot 3Ht er audio/video inputs in the back. See PA's website for image of back of unit...
Absolutely, my IPad Air rests on it and because the items just rest on it practically any device from a smart phone to a tablet will fit without issue.
The base is 8 5/8" wide and 7 5/8" front to back. In the back it is about 1 1/8" thick and in the front it's about 1/2" thick. We have been happy with it.
I would imagine that it would support it. The back plate and the bottom arm rest would hold it in place. With the bottom rest the tablet sits in the arm grooves so it prevents it from tilting backwards.
yes, it has a micro usb port. though its not a OTG USB port. Its used for charging and for transferring to/from a computer only.
No. It would have to be a virus made specifically for the Webos to do any damage.
The iPad uses a 4:3 ratio, and currently commands about 85% of the tablet market. 4:3 is a more natural size for something like a tablet. It most closely resembles the look and feel of a book, magazine or piece of paper. A 16:9 display is difficult to hold in your hand, and makes for an uncomfortable device. It also makes rotation more alarming as you go from a very wide to very tall display. Many industry experts think the 16:9 ration is partially to blame for the almost universal poor sales numbers for the Android tablets.
That's why when I'm an early adopter for any tech, I would always buy from Costco. They give you a 90 day return policy. Otherwise, I would wait a couple months after release to see how the product actually does if I don't have that nice return policy. I got my Galaxy Tab 10.1 through Costco and I am thinking of returning it in October as I don't really have a need for the tablet.
Happens with many other items. It's a free market, after all. No sane person would buy at those prices, so who cares!
The Bose Case is 5" (Length) 3" (Width) and 1" (Thick) Hope this helps.
Micro SD slot allows you to add 32GB SD card, It's not internal storage.
If you use a micto sd to full sd adapter then yes. It does not have a separate micro slot.
I use it for X-plane 9.My pc specs are A770DE+, 8GB G.Skill PC5300,Sapphire Radeon 6950, and Creative X-fi Extreme audio. Since it could handle these items I would say yes. I did have to RMA it once about a year ago. Raidmax replaced it without an hassle. I also purchased their 850.
I think it will fit but you won't really have a place to put the radiator that makes sense.
These did not work for me.
... this has nothing to do with the remote 'learn mode'. From what I read, it will 'sleep' if no signal for several minutes, then wake up upon signal. Waiting for mine to arrive, so will know more shortly.
I dont know exactlybecause it is installed at my cabin.... but i can tell you this it will fit on most tv's it just a matter of positioning the plate in the right configuration. the directions are on the box cover......i found that out after i struggled with it for a half an hour or so to get it on correctly.
If it's anything like the Army rhino mount then yes it will fit. Sorry but I don't know what you guys use
I am not familiar with the Raptor helmet but they should have the standard mount if it is a newer helmet. The mount works good and is very secure.
That's the brand of my TV and I use them now. They r great. I have a Panasonic 3d blu-ray player
what i've understood is, the benq w1070 use dlp link which these glasses support. All u need then, in otherwords is the dlp link tv/projectors, these glasses, 3d bluray player, 3d blueray disc, and hdmi fast enough for 3d support. fyi, the lens on the glasses are dark grey/greenish tint(standard 3d glasses color) and not clear as per the picture in the advertisment. other than that, glasses works as intended. (just doesn't fit over prescription glasses too well.)
the life span of this one is a lot shorter, but since it's almost 10 times cheaper, makes a great deal. Brightness is the same.
In the internal wifi card port.
Hi, yes. and that would depend on the code it gives you...personally I still havent try it...so good luck!
Yep, it's working fine.
It worked fine for me. If there are bugs, I didn't see them.
No
I don't know actually.
None. Just use the lens without a filter.
Are you looking for a simple UV filter? I've always liked B+W.
No. This will not do the sightseeing for you. You have to do the sightseeing yourself. It will however allow you to record the sights you see.
no it dosent have a stand and when. you put the 3 triple a battires in it you get about 15 minutes. of life their are better camera unless your looking for a disposable camera which is what this is
Your car battery
No, you had to buy everything together, not the controller by himself.
havent tried to record with it yet
I'm using w/NP 900 X3A. Don't know if it works w/ 900 x3c
You must pull the boom are ALL the up and in then attempt to tilt the neck.
Hey Pacey...did u get answer to your question? I am also looking for something to convert my Audi mmi into using a Samsung/Android phone for music. Pls let me know. thanks
http://www.rammount.com/Portals/0/Skins/NationalProducts/pdf/buildsuctioncup.pdf I would start here.
It is a very sturdy mount, however, my phone did come out once on real rough terrain. What I did was get a heavy duty rubber band and looped around it and its not coming off now. Best phone holder I have used so far.
I think these have 100mb of throughput so if your cameras are less than this which I would imagine that they are it will be fine. As far as LOS, I'm sure they can go for miles. But it really depends on analyzing the spectrum and seeing what else will interfere.
No it hasn't
I do not understand your term "plug into one of my TP-Link power adapter". The PicoSation has it's own power adapter for Poe feeding. You can install your PicoStation in attic if you don't have a metal roof. Ideally, PicoStation should always be installed outside with line of sight with your laptop/pad ans if not line of sight, nearest PicoStation.. Normal installation is PS outside, Cat5e plugged into it and other side of Cat5e connected in interior Poe near router and 120Vac receptacle. Distance between PicoStation and Poe can be les than 100 feet.
This cover fits over the keyboard like a glove and it's barely noticeable when it's in place. I highly doubt it will interfere with anything.
yes it is
Yes, it's a single button on and off switch on the rear of the enclosure.
It needs an external AC supply. It comes with one.
Reading the description the carbide 400 will except a 240 MM cooling system and checking the specs on the H105 it apprears to be a 240 MM assembly so I would think you are good to go I am using the H100 cooler.
The new IPAD (3) is only 0.6mm thicker (0.024 in) than IPAD 2 so I hope it fits, atleast it seems like that on Griffin's homepage "...the perfect case for your iPad 2 & iPad 3..." (http://store.griffintechnology.com/survivor-ipad-3)
7200
It has an additional AC power and it comes with it's own power cord.
yes it is
Never tried that but I doubt it. I don't think signal is strong enough for that.
I just tried it from about 2 yards away- it worked fine; it has a good range
Yes, this will work for your fb454ut. I bought one to replace the OEM charging unit for mine and it does the job quite nicely.
I have the HP 10 inch, I am not sure what other specs might be needed in order to answer your question. It works just fine w/mine. However, I did notice that the charger would get hot initially if i attempted to charge and surf. I simply allowed it to charge fully before operating.
I can't say it is night vision. But it works very well in low light environment and the out come color tends to be green.
No. I wish you could. You can only live stream to looxcie service or, more useful, a post to your facebook page which people can click then see live video through looxcie service.
No, anytime it's connected, it only functions like a jump drive.
It is a 3.0. Also, I ordered (5) of them total and (2) were DOA just FYI.
We've had ours 3 years this month and it stays on, minimum, 16 hours a day. I've been impressed with ours, plus this tv was free with our credit card reward points.
Absolutely, it will work and this particular HDTV does have a headphone jack. (I think that many TV's don't but I am not sure.) Also all of these flat screens have lousy speakers since they have to make the TV so small, so using other speakers would be extremely helpful.

If you use a full size case to mount the MB in, then yes you should have the space to install a full size card
if you have a MacBook Pro 15 inch measure yours it's exactly the right size. it fits perfectly inside the rubber grommet
This cable transfers the pictures from your camera to your computer to be saved.
Yes it is!! Plugs in direct from your camera to the USB port in your computer.
Worked on E6500 Check on Dell Website.
Yes, you can. I use mine in Bloemfontein, South Africa. (230V) I am very happy wit the product and easy to use. ;-)
There are plenty of languages but I have only used or defaulted my setting in English. But when I was setting my camera I saw tones of languages
I believe so. The RAM doesn't have high profile heatsinks on it so I think you'd be ok. That being said, it might be worth checking the motherboard vendor's QVL list which will tell you what memory kits were tested and working with your motherboard. You can still use ones not listed on the list, but it may give you some perspective as to what to look for.
In general any standard desktop processor (Intel or AMD) works well with any standard graphics card (Nvidia or AMD/Radeon). So the answer is yes. However, the A8-3850 has inside a graphics processor with a reasonable quality, so you can use the A8-3850 alone, without an external graphics card, with good results (I'm writing this precisely in a machine with that processor and without graphics card, and if you don't play very fast and demanding games you can work OK with this setup).
It will only work with fm1 motherboards, fm2 motherboards only works with apu a10
Yes, its region free. Yes, it does have HDMI output port. It does remember the last memory.
Yes, it does play both PAL and NTSC DVDs.
It works with both NTSC(american)TVs and PAL(European)TVs.
It means those games with 3d compatable can be played in 3d mode, where u would need the 3d glasses to see it displayed in 3d, but it also has the regular mode which is called 2d. So u should have the option to select 3d or 2d/regular on those types of ps3 games.
Hello Thomas, Thank you for your interest in Big Grips! :) At this time, Big Grips are available for iPads only. Let me know if you have any additional questions. -Iva The Big Grips Team member
I know it works with PCs. I have used on several. Not sure it would work on a Mac, but I see no reason it would not. Do remember that as the source is display port, there will be no sound out put on the display.
Based on an examination of the one I own: absolutely not. It is however, a fine camera, and it helped me catch a workplace thief.
Great question, I haven't found one yet, all I have or was included with unit was an operating manual which had just basic instructions, I would like to know also, sorry I couldn't help you more.
No! These are garbage! I bought two and both would not work with my iPad 1 or 2, so probably won't work on the newest iPad 3 either.
Don't think so. Just photos and videos.
Yes it will I have them on my system and there are no problems
I'm 6'4" and 280lbs and at full length the strap sits my Canon 7D at my belt line. I'm typical northern European build (longer torso, relatively shorter legs).
I have not used with 70-200 f/2.8L IS, but I've used it with 24-70 f/2.8L and it's fine. I guess you'd attach the fastenr to wherever you would normally mount the camera on a tripod--and in the case of 70-200 f/2.8L IS, you would mount that camera on a tripod using the tripod ring on the lens--so I think you're doing it correctly =)
Not sure, I have only 78 GB loaded and it's 29 days of music. 10,517 songs.
Yes it does but is not intended for it. I've dropped mine a few times and the case just opened when touched the floor receiving all the impact
It will work right out the box. You won't need to buy anything extra.
HI Victor, To the best of my knowledge the processor should work. It is basically AM3 processor. Also it is rated at 95W which is also what the motherboard supports.
Yes, I want to give an advise, at the base of this mount put a double sided tape, a small piece is enough , as I have a bike so for its use I use the tape as it provides a grip on the phone , the tape is easily removable also.
I also have exactly the same question !! I got the 'II' for $ 40 cheaper !
It comes with a one year warranty, according to the email response I just received from SPEEDYTECHSHOP - Amazon Marketplace.
No hidden fees and if you are located in the USA, Canada or Australia no import duties too.
HTL
no. This is a mirrorless camera with interchangeable lenses.
mine wasn't...waiting on customer support to respond to me now...
Yes, the portable drive has a burner and a laser reader in it for creating or removing information on/from disks
You can buy an adapter plate from B-Grip, look up there site for information, the standard fitting that comes with the holder and belt as limited compatability.
This model in specific does support dual video card configurations but for better performnace this one should be used with ATI video cards since the chipset is from ATI. look for this model model but the one that has a nvidia chipset
HI. This will have two outlets which will connect to both your subs. 9.2 channel means that you can connect 9 speakers and 2 subwoofers. Center is for speaker not subwoofer. Thank you
I don't believe so; this is an adapter for a laptop computer.
No, it is not. You need other with different connector for I5
I use this item with Ipod 5th generation. I have an Ipod video 7th generation and doesnt work. Surely it wouldn't work.
I don't know. I returned it because I coul not get any tv reception at all.
We are not a manufacturer. We are replacing an old drive that went bad in one of our servers. I hope that answers your question.
It will work with anything that has a 3.5 mm input jack. I did not have good audio with my gopro hero 3 though.
The receiver has a 1/4-20 tripod mount, but the transmitter has a standard Nikon hot shoe mount. I mount a couple Strato on lighting stands with Nikon flashes when I shoot indoor sports with a low ceiling (such as a roller rink).
this wireless set is working with nikon cameras only
None
I have been using this cable for over a year in my iMac for a 2nd SSD. Connection speed is 6 Gb/s. Any SATA cable should support a 6 Gb/s transfer speed.
Use an app called Mactracker. It will tell you what type of RAM and how much you MacBook can actually use, in many cases it's a total of 8GB RAM even if Apple state 4GB. I installed 2x 4GB sticks into a MacBook and it was perfect. So chances are yours will as well. But use Mactracker and look at memory to see specs and maximum ammount of RAM that can be recognised.
Yes it runs on 1600 Mhz DDR3 Memory. http://support.apple.com/kb/SP649
I've ordered them, and yes they are Samsung.
I don't understand your question; however, the charger comes ready to use out the box. All you do is connect it to the charging port on the Air. You do not need to wire anything from your current charger to it. It's a great charger. I recommend just ordering the charger and see if it fits. If it's too small for your year Air, Amazon sells a magsafe to magsafe 2 converter http://www.amazon.com/MagSafe-to-2-Converter/dp/B008ALAHA4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1405574068&sr=8-1&keywords=magsafe+2+converter.
Work great
It slides in and out so there is no cap to get lost
Have you verified that it works on your computer before plugging it in the car? Verify the format of your other USB drives that work in your car: Are they formatted FAT, FAT32? What size are the USB drives that work in your car? Your car might not handle 32GB USB drives. 16GB might be the limit in your car or even smaller like 8GB.
There may be some confusion here, this device does not scan photos. It merely acts as a transfer device to move files from a memory card to computer. After the driver for this device is loaded on a computer and the device is plugged into usb port with a memory card in the transfer device, a window will open giving options for destinations for the photo files. You will choose one and thereafter the photo files will transfer to the chosen program.
Yes it has a SATA connection as that is the interface it is designed to use. For further details go to OEM website: http://www.asus.com/us/Optical_Drives/DRW24B3ST/
Yes and it does just fine. No problems.
If the directv reciever works with a wired LAN connection then yes. It works just like a wired LAN connection. Anything that needs a wired LAN connection will work via this wireless port device. Works the same as the WGA600N.
Yes I got it for my PS3 and WD Live box on other side of the house
No. It has USB 2.0 without MHL http://www.phonearena.com/phones/Amazon-Kindle-Fire-HDX-7_id8158
Hi Christopher, the product description says "MHL (USB Micro-B) to HDMI (Type-A female)" so if you're thinking Evo 3D (like me) you'll probably be all right. I think I'm going to wait for more options though. $25 seems pretty steep; this feels like it should be under $10 to me.
I am not that familiar of this type of components, all I know is that this is an external hard drive. Sorry, I am not of great help to you.
1) Try a different AC connector/cord. You probably do not have one but if you bring you Seagate into a Radio Shack, they probably will let you try a compatible connector/cord for the possible sale. 2) Go to Seagate support (www.seagate.com/support/)
I have the same computer and mine it perfectly
this machine is a piece of junk, I sent it back and bought this instead, this is a worthy investment. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004DSLIV0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Yes, they will work with anything with a normal head jack.
Unfortunately, they are not wireless. . .at least the pair I had were not wireless. And again, I really wasn't all that impressed with the sound quality. I really have heard better speakers - albeit mono, but with good quality sound.
Yes, the base is wide enough to support an iPad in horizontal position; you might have to support the iPad slightly if you're interfacing a lot on the iPad perimeter.
as the description says you are able to record onto a USB which you should then be able to plug the USB into your computer and transfer the music.
Excellent for ghost. My sister has a ghost and I heard it say "Boo" on the recorder.
The wi-drive generates a wifi hotspot you can hookup to your device through a wi-drive app and see its hard drive. There is a wi-drive app (Kindle Edition) that you can add to your device for this. Here is the URL for the manual http://media.kingston.com/support/downloads/WiDrive_KF_UserManual.pdf and it explains what's needed.
It's a 13 inch
I received a charger (it was not the original, but it works great)
I use this (vga) from the laptop to the rgb into the tv. The laptop has HDMI but the tv doesn't so this was my only solution. If both devices have rgb then I don't believe that there is any real advantage. Good luck, JK
Unfortunately no. The bag is great but that is one feature they missed
You need to cut the trim out in one spot or make a shim to raise the two together, thats what i did, I just cut the end off a 2x4 to length
Yes it does. I have OS X Mountain Lion on my MacBook Pro, and it works perfectly fine.
It is close enough to the wall/point the iR up so that the signal bounces off the white ceiling. We have 6 installed this way at my clinic; work perfectly.
Compatible with anything that has the 30 pin (old long) connector. iPod, iPhones, iPads etc
It would be in come places. You can't use over a 13" computer on this. My 15" hanges over and the top is slippery so can't sit in chair and hold in lap with ease. Not a good buy.
Yes but that is about it
I always kept mine in the car because my daughter used it all the time but after it being tossed around back and forth it tore and the beads spilled all over the car. It wouldn't surprise me if your cat/s end up tearing it. Very cheap material.
You plug it in. But mine stopped charging after only 6days... and others stopped charging too.. so I don't recommend buying this..
No lightScribe on this drive.
In theory yes, but it is a poor fit. I would recommend spending the few extra dollars to get the genuine Canon adapter. That is what I ended up doing after throwing this one away.
I dropped my camera twice and each time the ring broke. It is cheap plastic.
No, not for me. I have made sure to discharge my battery though. In unplugging and using battery only, after a full charge that procedure ensures proper battery capacity.
I bought it few months ago and it is working very good now. It fits well to the tab and very easy to use compare to others I feel.
No you cannot --only with alphine car stereo.......
No, you can't . It's only for alpine DVD
yes, it has a built in DVD player.
100% No question asked and working perfectly.
I don't know Windows XP, but with Windows 7, Penpower runs on the standard English version, except that I had to install a language pack (purchased from Microsoft) to recognize Chinese.
It's compatible with my MacBook Air running OS X 10.7.4. I just charged it for about 3 hours as directed and plugged-in the USB receiver and it works wirelessly. I was worried too. Hope this helps!
I do not know
I'd highly recommend against putting that much current through here. These are small relays you will likely let all the smoke out if you source that much current through them. I know it says that it's rated for that but when you burn your house down that will be a small consolation.
No this unit is 5 VDC only, if you want to drive it with 3.3 VDC signals then use a CD4050 IC Chip which can take 3.3VDC in and change the level output to 5 VDC for driving the relay board inputs. Just set VCC on the CD4050 to 5 VDC and it should work.
I don't know what you mean by "another sainsmart" since SainSmart has several different products, but: Arduino:yes, RaspberryPi:yes. If you want to control it with your smartphone you have to either write an app that talks (directly or indirectly) to your RasPi, or do it directly over a web ui.
Yes you just need appropriate 5v to drive the coils in the relay.
12 volts DC is 12 volts DC. I'd probably recommend some kind of circuit breaker in case something gets shorted to ground, since batteries mentioned have quite a bit of amperage behind it.
Yes these are opto-couplers.
Single relay schematic shown. All four identical. www.sainsmart.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/500x500/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/4/c/4channel-relay2.jpg
They are rated to handle up to 250VAC at 10A, so your 24VAC should not be an issue.
Relays should not be paralleled, as you can't guarantee simultaneous activation, so one relay would handle the full current. MOSFETS can be paralleled.
Yes, Don, it does come with a car charger.
It does a great job with my small Klipsch speakers, but the Klipsch are legendary for their efficiency. Not sure how it will do with anything else.
I don't know why it is sealed but I have played this amp for hours at a time and have had zero problems with any heating issues. I have played music through my CD player and my Surface tablet and everything sounds great!! I have it in a TV cabinet with two doors on it, I open one door for ventilation.
Yes, a 15" or so cable is included.
Hit the Favorite location you want to delete. When it comes up on the screen, touch the box with the title in it that appears in the middle of the screen. You'll see the Delete choice appear.
I wanted to photograph small jewelry & lace items but found that the lighting sources are not bright enough to go through the white surround and allow me to get the photos I want. I do like the background clothes in various colors to hang down and let me have a smooth background.
I don't think so. The small screw at the top fits the hole in a full sized camera and there is no converter for a cell phone with the kit. There may be a converter elsewhere.
I put mine in my 2010 charger and it started smoking when connecting the +1 amperage red wire... So I would be careful with this product! I did not install it.
No, but gwt serial/model number to make sure you get the right one. Rhis is my second remote. The remote i currently have, only is uaed to turn on/off and volume.
So sorry I can't answer that because not familiar with that model camera.
The descripcion of the item says: Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens + SSE Lens Accessory Kit For Canon 5D Mark III, 5D Mark II, 6D, 70D, SL1, 60D, 7D, T5i, T4i, T3i, T3, T2i, T1i, Xsi, XS Digital SLR Camera. Yes, this item fits at Canon EOS SRL T3. I used it at Canon EOS T2i
from what i can tell this is a standard memory module abet with XMP. it works on my desktop just fine so go for it.
Must be a typo - I googled it for info looked up part numbers etc. It is a Canon 75-300mm.
Yes, it will!
depends on how in focus and large you're talking, also how clear the day is, but I've taken photos up to a half mile away
Dude, unplug is from the adapter, plug into your computer's headphone jack, and rock out. I use it for Twitch live streaming every day in the chat. Whenever there's a teamp speak, I'm already set up because I have the mic in the headset. Win, win. Just, don't jam too hard, they have a habit of blowing out on one side (left/right) and you're stuck listening in just your right ear. I've only had to buy a new one in the past 2 /12 years so, don't sweat it too hard. Hope that helps brother!!
I'm not sure ..I would guess to say no. Seems these are for the X box 360
Hi Bonnie; As the ad says, it comes with an 18" x 20" dish, a tripod, 50' of coax, a compass, a signal finder and instructions on how to set it up. The only thing you have to supply is a Direct TV subscription and a receiver. If you are going to use it for an RV, Direct TV offers a plan where you only pay for the months you use it. Hope this helps you out. We are very pleased with it. Bill
Absolutely!!! No doubt about it.
No. I have a TB in mine. They are the same size no matter what size the GB/TB drive size is.
Pretty impressive, left my phone in my bedroom, still heard clearly in my living room despite the two walls between me and my s3. Also left the phone charging in the kitchen, gamed in the living room, got a phone call, turned the Bluetooth on, connected right away and proceeded without any issues.
Yes they have the flat tangle free cord.
No just remove the plastic fits snug as bug sounds good too
If you go to lightscribe web site and download software and template labeler and the labels, you will get a control panel. There you can change contrast up or down.
Radio Shack is the only place that comes to mind. Take the device with you since they have a way to measure the input port for the right plug. The other way would be to use a standard car to 110 inverter.
Yes
Yes
Hi Remus , This is jenny from zitrades, actually we can ship our products to Canada by merchant, we will do next step to open the channel for sell on CA, thanks for your question ^^ Have a nice day! Jenny
Yes as long as the pole's diameter is big enough. If not you could add tape to the pole, adding size to allow the mount to clamp down on it.
No, it is not able to hold a dslr. I use it for my small camcorder and it works, but it can't hold much more
The Arkon camera mount works well with my small camcorder. I would look at the Delkin Fat Gecko camera mount this is bigger and has better suction. The Delkin mount came with an extender that gives you a little longer reach.
Try this: take a child's small hollow rubber or solid foam play ball. Cut and "X" on two sides and pass the mounting arm through. After attaching the mount to the windshield slide the ball along the arm to the point of contact with the dash. This will keep the arm up. By varying the size of the ball, or the placement of the cuts, you should be able to achieve some adjustment in the height of the device.
I cannot measure this at present since I do not have it with me. However, I believe that it can hold a 10 inch tablet. I am using it with my Samsung Galaxy 7 inch tablet and have to use two of the shorter holders and two of the longer ones. The tablet is held firmly in place so that I can use it as a navigation device with Navfree, a free app.
Unfortunately not, there is not enough room between the top of the case and the motherboard.
Yes, be careful though of the regular source 210 designation, comes with a few less features like a fan and the like.
I got it to work with mine, but you have to remove the stock knob attached to the metal mounting bracket. It has a small c-clamp underneath holding the knob in, so you have to remove that to get the knob out. The battery mount doesn't screw in completely flush with the camera, but it works. I eventually bought the Carry Speed Swi-View for any 3-Inch LCD View Finder, so I could also take advantage of the swivel screen while using the extender/magnifier.
Hi, No, it will not fit Nikon cameras, the viewfinder size and shape are different. You might try ebay or google Nikon viewfinder.
I think not
Sorry, I bought it for the sony NEX5r. Not sure if it works with the Sony A3000
Yes I'm pretty sure it would as long as u have the double din meaning the height has to be the same as two normal radios for the screen to fit..
ofcourse yes.
Fits a 7" swivel/folding type dvd player perfectly. No charger. This is a case only. Charger should have came with player.
Yes
Yes, I just tested it by connecting the receiver base to a wall charger and connecting it to my computer with a 3.5m cord instead of via USB. There is a switch on the front of the base that says console&lt;-----&gt;PC Gaming, make sure its switched to Console before powering it on otherwise it won't use the correct input you want.
Hi Zachary, I assume so, I don't know for sure. Its a simple and stable product with a standard mini-jack.... Goodluck.
Yes we have ours hung fron the ceiling about 10 feet away,from the wall the screen is on.
Yes, this is what it is made for. Although, some headphones, such as Apple iPhone Headsets, do not work because of patented tech, which makes the mic unusable with PC. However I can say that the Samsung Stock Headset that comes with the Note 3 and S5, do work. Beats, Audiotechnica, and Shure, I'm not sure. CHECK PINOUTS OF HEADSET,PC, AND THIS PRODUCT FOR COMPATIBILITY.
Yes, you do. Once it is entered into iTunes, it stays. Sometimes iTunes will even add the album art, but not if the songs are not already in their library.
It does need to be plugged in to work.
Yes
Hello, gently twist the device counter-clockwise. If it doesn't move the retaining screw has been tightened. On the left-hand side there is a rubber cover. Lift up the bottom and you should find a phillips head screw underneath. Back out that screw a couple of turns and the device should twist off.
this is a figure 8 connector for 110 volt power. Your Dell device should be 110v. There are 2 types. Type 1 has rounded edges on both sides of the figure 8. Looks like a real "8". Type 2 has one side of the 8 that is squared off i.e. it has square corners. This is for devices that need polarized connectors. If you have a squared version, and need the rounded version, you can just take a matt knife and just round off the corners. I just did that to a cable, when I needed a round version.
as far as i know 110 only. i bought them both as gifts so don't have the actual item to look at. the frame connects to a cord that plugs it in (the cord is not attached to the frame) so there would be the potential to use a different cord for different voltage if necessary.
It might not be practical because the port for the Internet is on the bottom of the speaker. For it to work you would have to put the speaker on its side.
Yes, the PC software that comes with the camera does have schedule recording feature allowing it to record at a certain time(s) in certain days a week.
I do not know I have an iPad 2. If it is the same size it would be.
this is a raw stereo box with speakers and marine faceplate only. You must install your own stereo system. It will fit virtually any vehicle with a roof to mount it to and the surface area to place it. Bolts directly to the roof.
it depends the cables on the game cube
yes. but you have to have a ultrabase for x201. thanks.
Not enough information provided to answer question; need: model type, e.g., x230, T___, Yoga___ -- and whether it has an optical drive already (presumably not), or docking station, or whether it requires an external drive.
Sorry, but as of this time, we can only ship to the Continental US
Yes, it is adjustable. Be sure to read my review on this product. Unless they have resolved the problem, the wiring is backward as described in the instructions.
Yes. I've listened to all and love it for everything. To be honest, with a tweak from any eq, it sounds amazing.
It will work with any Nikon that the mount matches, however, it will be on a crop sensor, so you will extend the mm by approximately 1.5.
Yes we hooked a cable wire to ours and we get a lot of stations even without the cable box .
Kristina, Sorry It is too small for this holder. To bad great stand
Yes!
Hi Derek, I think you meant to say "fit" rather than fir. My iPad 3 is about 9.5x7.25 inches. I don't think it can go too much smaller. I'm not familiar with the Note 10. I checked the dimensions online. It looks like you are a taller and a little narrower. I must stress that this my best guess. I will cautiously say that I think the adjustments will accommodate your Note 10. You may want to double check with Halter.
It should cover it all cause it was bought as one.
They are similar, but the Thor has the fins on top.
Not built into the case, no. But plenty of expansion bays for you to install one.
I have no idea what a EV4 is.
We put based a 65 in slim Samsung TV and it holds pretty well. The bracket was made with heavy duty steel and it can hold a pretty good amount of weight. Though I was looking at the specs for my brackets and your VESA is NOT going to fit. It will fit 400x200 400x200 and 800x400 compliant. Sorry I could not be much more help.
Yes... we ship worldwide. This item is back ordered with Xantech until Feb. 15th. Chris
I would just check the dimensions LxWxH of the mg2220 and see if it's similar to my mx892. I would guess that it would fit, since it fits loosely on my 892. Good luck.
I'm sorry but I don't understand what you are asking.
Yes...you just have to buy the correct wiring harness that is compatible with your ford. And you may also have to buy a radio antenna coverter which is only about $7 from walmart
No
Yes with sum time. It is hard the first few time but after it is very good.
Mine still work fine.
No, only have medium.
The Silicon Power flash drive that I have is a 64 GB model, not a 32 GB model, but my SP flash drive has a blue indicator light. I don't know if the light is an LED light or not.
It might be personal preference but I have no issues with it. I am farsighted and I can read everything very well with my adjustable lenses. Clear and bright. Your font size could make a difference. But I am very pleased with this monitor so far.
No it does not only dvi & vga
Hi Fernando. The DXT Mouse Wired comes with in a white box with a solid carton for protection during transport. Any other questions please contact us at http://www.cityergonomics.com/contact-us/ Regards City Ergonomics
I am sorry - cannot really tell. The small print on the mouse does not specify. Is there are a way to tell by looking at it? OBTW - we have two of these in use in our office, and they are very much loved.
This battery is already mostly charged when you recieve it--so it only takes a little time to top it off at full charge.
yes it would, obviously at slower speeds than normal usb3
You're not buying a Tesla. this is the best external hard drive on the market.initial backup was about 20 to 30 minutes and every back up after that is around 15 to 20 minutes. Their phone number is 971/246-8200.
You can configure it to whichever operating system you USE. I remember I also had the option dividing it between Windows and Mac OS. I decided to make it 100% configured to OS.
Good Question for Amazon if they have both speeds posted. It is 5400RPM NOT A 7200 RPM
Yep
Yes..........but..........who cares.....it's a great drive.......& you can utilize it for a long time......with that much capacity!
No, they aren't.
No it does not come with a case. Its up to you if you buy it - BUT I returned two of these units they are not good, one over heated, the other died within hours loss of data - control card failed!
I don't know I had my monitor in the center of my house and cameras all around. Probably max of 50 feet in a direct line through walls and never had reception problems. But I never had to move them farther then that.
I have GREAT reception at 50 feet on one camera, FULL BAR signal and GREAT reception on the 2nd @ 15 feet. I am going to install a 3rd camera which will be about 40 feet away from the receiver. I would HIGHLY recommend this system to any buyer and I believe it is easier and better than the DVR versions which require wiring. Hope this helps!
Edit: yes you can it appears! The cables are able to physically be connected end to end, if the power output and video signal can carry that far I'm not 100% sure but I bet it would work. Wish I could help more!
8 channels means you can connect 8 cameras to your dvr, record and view 8 different angles at once. I have a 2 story home so I needed to view more angles. Bottom line it all depends on how much you want/ need to view (of course your budget too).
yes it will, it comes with an adapter too. No converter needed.
I have a Samsung galaxy s (first one). Pretty much, if it has a removable battery it should work. The shelf and pins are adjustable.
Only with the USB port on the side
just one
2-Rails, 28 AMP each. Be concerned about the orientation of the fan. If fan is pointing down, beware of fan hitting bracket.
I think it will fit its for slim computers.
Yes it will work... Its Compatible...
Check crutchfield for fitment
Is it a grand Cherokee? If just a normal Cherokee yes.... With modifcation so be ready to do some cutting but well worth it.
I have a Subaru but was able to use the stock brackets. Just had to drill my own holes.
I just received mine it is does NOT look the same as what's in the photo. It does work but the problem is the front of the filter is BIGGER than 52mm, my 52mm lens hood does not fit. Not sure what's the front filter size on the one I received, like I said it's not the one pictures so yours might be different.
I did not need a punch to install the wires. I used a very small screwdriver to tuck the wires down into the slots just fine
It's an original. The seller is Bose.
My camera is finepix 2950 and the filter adapter which fits this camera is marked 58mm which accepts 72mm filters. The box pictured looks like the one my order came in but there's not enough info in the pic to know if it's the same. By the way, I am well pleased with the camera and accessories.
It should, I am using this with a Raspberry Pi.
This is for people like you and me that DON'T have Bluetooth in their car. My Ford Focus may not be old, but for some unusual reason my car never had Bluetooth. To have my dealer install Ford's Bluetooth (Sync) was going to cost me over $500 to install. When I saw this Jabra on Amazon, I knew this was what I wanted. And I'm sold on it. So this is the cheaper alternative for hands free talking on your cell phone. This Bluetooth is built into the Jabra. Hope this is helpful.
Yes it is. You can say "call so and so" and it will pick up the number from your contacts.
Because it probably is. Mine did not work at first, but Foscam in Houston, TX sent me a new one that worked ok.
Yes, it comes with an external power adapter.
it should be.. I basically use it as a generic powered USB hub, and have connected it to both Mac, Windows, and Linux computers.
I think it will. It fit my otterbox very snug, & a bumper case should be thinner then an otterbox.
My understanding it must all be on the same network.
Hi. The manage console of Symantec let add license; you can add serial of products and add license you dont need replace product but the license that you add must be the same version of you product install
Yes, It has both red and white stereo out.
I did NOT have very good results with playing 7" on this set, lots of skips. Stick to 12" or try another turntable.
it fit ours and has worked out fine
Yes it halls quit a bit, but it never really gets smooth on the surface.
Yes it does. But it is really hard to put it on without tons of airbubbles.
I am sorry. I bought it a long time ago but still did not have a chance to install it. Super Busy. Like a bee on speed. Sorry. Don't know.
This device do not play video
It is a 4 channel.
I use two of them constantly and they have never failed. It's also one of the few at this price to go down to 1/32nd power, most only go 1/16th. Flash bulbs are replaceable for around $30. Just don't plug them both into the same outlet if you want decent and predictable recycle times.
Your check list is correct but I would suggest the following changes: 1. purchase pocketwizard triggers (pocketwizard x10) and not the cowboystudio tiggers. I have used the cowboystudio triggers and found them problematic. 2. purchase a higher quality 8ft or 9ft air cushion light stand as the unit is heavy and the wider base of the 8ft and 9ft stand will better stabilize the strobe. you'll need the extra height if you are using the strobe as your key light You will need to purchase the Fotodiox Pro 48" Octagn Softbox with the bowens speedring
It mounts on a light stand not a tripod for a camera if that is what you are asking. I'd recommend a more heavy duty light stand as well with spring buffer as its a bit more heavy. I think I spent $30 on the one I use for mine and its definitely worth it
No, I used it on top of my Onkyo receiver. It throws out a lot of air and works very well so far.
Hi Maryan , Yes its a nice easy to operate camera --my 11 yr. old Daughter likes the video part as well as the nice pics it takes. Don
Yes also get a LNB 5
Yes it is color
I take it you mean the AC power for the unit. If so, plug the cord from the power supply into the red connector and then plug the power supply into the wall outlet. The yellow connector is for video and the white connector is for audio providing the unit is wired properly to code as I am sure it is.
Perfectly. I have them in two 2950's right now.
I have no clue brother, but when i went to Vietnam which also uses 240v outlets, i was able to charge my iphones and laptops on it, something you might wanna google.
Yes
I DONT KNOW
do not know, I have the original bravissimo twin...
90 Degrees one. The one that I got shipped was the thin one too. Picture doesn't match the one being shipped out. (It's better than the one shown in the photo).
I use this with my NP900X4C I am not sure about the 3G
Yes. I purchased this fall of 2013.
yes works perfectly.
It is flexible.
If you are asking if the Polar will remain paired with iPhone if you also pair it with Jaybird, the answer is yes. You may need to go to settings&gt;Bluetooth and select connect when switching from Polar to Jaybird after initial pairing.
It looks great, but is not true patent leather. It is plastic and the inside where the ipad rests in faux-suede looking. I get a ton if complements on it, but the only issue is that the 3 stand options don't keep up the ipad very well when you're using it.
I do not know. it fits just not to my liking.
sure just wipe off with dry cloth.
Yes, it has a built-in GPS which can work without a wifi connection. Programs available in the Android Market include Co-Pilot and Sygic. Very easy to set up and use.
Yes they can be stacked. Just don't use close by channels. I was not impressed with overall quality of image and interferences with other analog channels, so maybe you should consider buying multichannel instead of chaining.
I don't see why not it is very easy to use
Could someone who owns this, read the AC Adaptor and read the power input voltage specifications. it will say something like 110v or, 110-240v 50/60. The only way to tell is to read this information.
It looks like a 550 to me. I have never had a 551 but from the picture the body looks exactly same.
Yes, with a Y adapter. The adapter has to have a 3.5mm plug for the receiver's jack, and 2 3.5mm female jacks to plug the earbuds or headphones with a 3.5mm jack. The receiver is not that powerful so by feeding 2 headphones you might encounter reduced volume.
I replaced my flooded unit with this one. All ports are loaded. It works good. One channel can consume more energy then another, bat the total is always the same and can't be exceeded.
Yes and no depending on the specifics of your question that I'm lacking. It can play a "burned" CD-R. If you are referring to playing music off a CD-R that is in data only format, it cannot. There is no USB port on this system. Hope this helps.
21x10x5
Not a wall charger, but it does come with a USB cord to charge it using a computer.
I did not download any software. I just put the usb connection into my computer, then the coby. I downloaded music I had put into my computer. No software needed.
Yes, these are the stick-on style. I have them positioned such that it is still possible to use the remote directly. I experimented first before "sticking" them to make sure that the remote could still be used. (Having a second person to operate the remote while testing is very handy.)
I have the GT-P5113, I don't know what the difference is. It fits mine perfectly.
yes
Yes, see auxiliary mini-plug input jack at left side of handle where handle meets base of device. Input is clearly marked "aux."
Yes
You may need a adapter kit. I suggest going to clutchfield.com. I had to get a kit for my 2005 honda civic.
Yes it would fit but you would need to get the mounting kit for your car...In all honesty I did not like this stereo..it malfunctioned after 3 months and I had problems using the usb port..I took mine out and reinstalled the factory stereo...if you want more power you'd definitely need an amp.
I'm sorry I can't help you. I put my CD player in W900 Kenworth Truck. I did not need a harness.
No. The wire is barely visible from my ceiling mount since I wrapped the wire around the bracket.
Yes, I used it for my sonons
I'm not sure. I have a FiOS STB, BD player and Apple TV on the bottom shelf and only a remote caddy and a framed photo on the top shelf. Unit seems very sturdy and I'm sure it would hold my big Sony amp.
No need for extra cable
Try changing the resolution or the refresh rate. Maybe the cable is defective?
No, it does not, you have to purchase it separately.
There isnt any rca' s in the back. It comes with a set of rca plugs that connect to the deck
If there is some kind of enclosure in the door. These are not free air subs.
It does NOT work for Galaxy Tab 2 7-inch! The cut out for the camera on the back is in a different place (upper corner instead of top middle)
One of the things you would need to concern yourself with is the large fan pulls air from the bottom of the cooler. That would need to be left clear of anything you would be wearing. I usually have one end on a chair arm or keep my knees apart for the opening.
The device becomes a single network location. Each drive connected appears as a separate folder
Yes.
No
yep, assuming you hook them properly the first time.
i would assume so. its just a sticker that you put on the front and back of the iPhone. as far as i know, the cameras are the same size, in reference to the iPhone 4 & 5. the pictures didnt come out very clear, i would suggest shopping around for a different one
It didn't work with Windows 7 and that was listed for what it would work with. I don't have Windows 8 so don't know. I would be surprised if it works at all.
Yes It Works Flawlessly Well you wont be unsatisfied
For some reason, Nikon calls their macro lenses "micro", so yes, this is a lens used for macro photography.
I have a Fujifilm finepix jz100. I think most digital cameras would fit inot this frame. Here's the problem I encountered. When I was snorkeling and wanted to go from pictures to video (one touch on the jz100) the back of the case was so still it would automatically select "timer". I could not go from pictures to video with this camera. I am going back to my old camera with a case that I know works well when changing from pictures to video. I do not recommend this camera case unluss you just want pictures
I purchased one for my Fujifilm JX580 and it works great so if the J10 is the same dimensions, you won't have any dramas. It comes with padding to make the camera fit snuggley in the case. Only issue is the need to remove the carry strap on the camera before enclosing it into the WP case.
Yes it does, you can use the touchpad to navigate also.
I've found a microfiber cloth to dust to be all that's really necessary. Since it's not glass, but rather a plastic-type substance, I'd avoid ammonia-based cleaners. I haven't found dirt to be a problem, though. Hope this helps.
Yes, however, unless you are in a city with slow moving traffic, the signals will fade out fast due to distance from the broadcast tower and obstacles between your vehicle & the tower. The faster you are traveling, the quicker that you will lose reception of a particular station. All this assumes that you do not kill yourself or others as you are gazing at the screen and not the road.
Probably not. This is a region 1 (North America) player. You can use a region-free player. Also, most computer DVD players are region-free, so you can try that.
the macro and the wide angle lens is the same, you just need to unscrew the wide angle from top of the macro to reveal the macro lens.
Not necessarily, but I have bought a 3.5inch screen that uses the same connections and I was using it for a raspberry pi set up so I couldn't use the suppliers power connector, so I bought a usb power cable that works great
Sorry I am not certain of the LG Tracfone as I don't have one.
It works great with the HD. That is the reason we bought it. It has the same power out as the Amazon $20 unit. Use the charging cable that came with the HD. Good solution. We use it with other devices as well since it is a faster charger.
No. You need to buy an adapter to do do that.
Get ahold of Samsung Tech Support.. They are INCREDIBLE! 877-213-1222
I am sorry we dont have the video, but you maybe able to find it on youtube.
I gave it as a gift.....but i dont think it has an alarm clock.
Yes
Yes.
You're looking for an access point. Out of the box this NIC (network interface card) was not meant to be an access point. That being said you could most likely turn your desktop into an access point broadcasting out of this NIC - do some searching / reading on turning your desktop into an access point. good luck
Sorry but no. You can get The Leaf to get local channels in your area. Roku2 XS is a streaming device where you can get Netflix, Hulu Plus , Amazon Prime (with subscription but have free trials to test it out). the higher level Roku's offers more. Apple TV is another streaming device as well.
Yes, the Roku will hook up to your TV through either HDMI or RCA (red, white, yellow). It depends a little on what connection your converter box uses, but on most TVs, you can hook the converter box to a second set of RCA jacks or the coaxial connection and then just switch between inputs to watch either Roku or the converter box.
If you have a memory chip in the camera, you can set it to record. Then you can review the captured video on the card.
I use Blue Iris and get a constant stream of video. It will work concurrently with a web browser either through a remote web connection or through a smart phone. I would note the connection is temperamental and will drop out from time to time, but overall it is consistent.
Look at the amp requirement (power draw) of the taillight. You may want to get a LED bulb to reduce the current draw as well as heat.
Nope it's 30-something ohm so any source can easily power them. I've plugged them into my android phone, my wife's iPad, and my work computer and all powered them easily. Volume levels were good and sound quality was great. I did get a budget dac amp for my work computer and I'd say there seemed to be the slightest performance increase, but it also could have been my ears getting used to the headphones. So no, an amp is not needed.
just checked mine, inside is 2.25" and outside is 4.5". Thickness is just shy of 1" (maybe 15/32). They are very large, my (big) ears fit comfortably inside ;) I wear them &gt;6h a day every day and even at high volume they seal very well.
Most likely not. But maybe. The sure fire way would be to use a Audio Receiver with HDMI. This would provide audio sync.
No they do not have DVD drives and they have 2 usb ports.
Yes, It comes with a battery and a A/C charging cord. I keep mine plug up on my glassed in porch, (Have not traveled with it) so I am unable to answer your question of how long the battery life is between charging.
Came with charger, but no battery. Had to purchase battery separately. READ THE SMALL PRINT
I don't know. I used this device in a development project for a client. I used it with Cygwin on a Windows 7 system and on a RS485 bus to which I had attached multiple devices. It worked flawlessly in this respect. No clue about RS422 or later Windows releases.
Sure does
Yes, it works fine on both 110 and 240V
There is no difference to me. These are all small batteries and I don't go out with out 3 fully charged at least! I own a total of 5 batteries. They are so inexpensive, it is not worth worrying about a possible few minutes of power.
Probably, but as you've seen from other reviews this battery isn't worth purchasing for any camera. Very cheap construction and the charger fails to work.
Sure. You'd just have to buy a cable with 3.5mm plug on one end and stereo RCA on the other. They're inexpensive.
It works great, but im not a fan. Go with a qinpu amp... Even the q2 will make you smile. I use the topping in the kitchen.
I have a brother all-in-one printer. It took me a minuet to get it set up but other then that it was plug and play.
You can operate one printer using two computers. However, you will need to use the provided manual switch to change the printing source computer.
Looking through the Motorola Accessories for the CP 110, I see all the head/handsets have the same style plug/connector. So I'm inclined to say yes that it will. But not having used a CP110 with this earset, I cannot confirm 100%.
No , on router box it is written clearly 3g modem is not included (while picture is given with router). USB port as 3G modems ? Answer is NO. Router signal strengh is great. I am using it as Wifi Extender to extend my neigbour internet connection through out my home but you need to be a network engineer to configure is as wifi extender :)
Yes, and they work great.
Hi Dan... I just had the opportunity to use my headphones and found that they do NOT block the sound as much as I would like. I also noticed there's been a price INCREASE of $9 since I purchased my set! Hope this helps....
I don't believe it will. The eyelet next to the antenna on the 60csx series will prevent the case from closing all of the way. The seam on the case runs tightly next to the antenna, the wriststrap on the case is down a ways from this. Other than that one issue I think it might have worked for both models.
Not at all. You can open the case in seconds. Just slide the cord-holder away from the case, and it opens.
Not that I've experienced.
Yes my friend ! you need the keyboard with the Thin flex cable ! this is the one ! Thanks a lot
Your not guaranteed a single platter drive unless Seagate confirms it for the particular version your ordering. Unfortunately, Seagate makes several types of 500GB hard drives. A single-drive platter (disk) is not common with most manufacturers. Hard drives usually have more than 1 platter mounted on the same spindle. Basically, multiple platters suppose to speed up access to data by creating quicker movement of the head. However, an increase in platters tends to increase power, heat generated and the Hard Drives susceptibility to operational failure.
I have reviewed the specs for your PC on the HP website. It looks to me like this disc will work; however, if you want to be 100% sure you should call them. If the disc you are replacing has the operating system on it (and I am pretty sure it does), you will need to clone the old drive to the new one. Some replacement discs come with the software and cable to do that.
Nope
yes, it works!
Yes. This computer can be upgraded to OSX 10.10, Yosemite.
I am not selling.
we are not including office
Mine is 6.6 lbs.
I edited a 10-minute video doing some pretty major visual effects using imovie, QuickTime and several other tools. It worked just like on my imac. The only issue is that with a shorter battery life, this type of editing cannot be done for long before you have to plug in the charger.
No, none, it works perfectly
If it has an ipoh cord it will.
Hi I think you can upgrade the ram to 8g
Yes you can, Daniel. Check out http://www.squidoo.com/apple-macbook-air-ds for more information.
No
I have this an I hook up to my laptop an correct but in fact it will give you the signal works right of the box all you need to do is buy a 3.5 audio wire an hdmi cable :)
Hi Lim, I can ship internationally, but need to get an estimate on shipping costs and regulations. What is the city and postal code?
no it is not...
The battery does not come with a charger. You have to charge it in the headphones.
Don't order this. It's garbage, the lights completely stopped working after. 2 photo shoots !
yes,it is but we do not sell the bulb separately. We can supply customer for that replacement if customer purchased this kit from us before and order id provided as long as we carry this merchandise for sale. Regards, kimoutlet
My toshiba fits with room to spare. It is 10.5" x 16.25" and 19" diagonally.
Yes. My laptop was 17 inches and there is still a bit of space in the case. I hope this helps
You first need to set up a home network. That is done using a wired Ethernet connection through your modem & router. Once that's set up, then the extender can be configured using the correct router settings. Natalie, this unit is used only to extend your existing network range.
My 11 in fits perfectly. 13 may be too snug.
I have had good luck using this with a 3 D player. for the safety of your laser lens, make sure this cleaner disk is cleaned regular.
Technically, yes, the topping amp can power those speakers. But, the sound quality is not going to be there due to sheer lack of power. You can increase the volume, and it will get louder, but the distortion level of the amp will be high. I am using it too power 2 Dayton 652's for my computer setup, and it works just fine. ymmv
The GPN-1 works with selected Nikon cameras only.
If the plug that comes with it fits in your cam and your cam supports GPS, then it will work. It works perfect and I love it.
I believe if it's the same product you can, but not a 100 percent sure.
There's thin, there's thick, it's three different colors you can use either, but be ready to iron because it'll be wrinkled, you do have to hang it, it comes with a clip
This may help: http://www.genovation.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=2185&sid=3f8330a41afb99c096fc65556e394c16 . I tested it on a notepad, it works. check : http://www.genovation.com/files/MacroMaster.pdf
Yes there is an adjustable timer it does take up one keystroke though.
The device does not control mouse movements. It can control assigned shortcuts in your desktop by following the manual. If you require mouse movements you may want to consider a software macro recorder such as "Macro Recorder 5.7.7.0". The Genovation device is incredible when used for working under Linux terminal, CLI devices (such as Cisco), or VMware CLI.
Yes you can record direct from cable tv. And you can change the record speeds. You can also create titles and menus. And if you have a blu ray player with a usb port connected to line 1 or line2 you can actually copy mp4s in real time to disc
Yes it does, RCA in and out S video in and out and HDMI output only. Hope this helps, contact me anytime...
I have a single level house and this thing did nothing.
Yes it will. Please send the seller an email confirming your Sony model# after you place your order. I've had my replacement VGP-AC19V37 for almost a year with no issues.
It worked just fine on my 32 bit machine
These are universal and the poles are adjustable so it should fit just find.
I have no idea. It fit in my 2007 Chevy Suburban. It has adjustable posts so there is a good chance it fits most cars.
Not at all.
Yes it is!
Speakers stand alone. Good product for the money.
Yes, I believe it does.
To be honest, I don't know. I am really having issues getting it to work on my HP computer. I will truly say instructions are not as easy as they should be to follow. I'd give it a 21/2 on a scale of 5.
Yes, it's the USB micro B, but the cable was included with the Versavu.
The keyboard charges with a standard mini-USB cable. You should be able to acquire one almost anywhere for $5.
I really don't know a lot about them yet. I set them up and from what I can tell it's and on and off switch only.
the muslin shipped in folded,not in roll. to get rid of wrinkle, it is better to hang it over the line,or backdrop support stand first,and water it very lightly,evenly,and let it dry over. Regards, kimoutlet
I noticed that it sags a bit , so I would say no.
No, It will not manage 25 standalone APs. They have to be converted to Lightweight Access Points (requires a software image change) and are then centrally managed. Cisco Prime might be able to manage 25 standalone APs via its template feature.
Surely. It'll work on any camera with a regular hotshoe. They don't transmit ttl info.
You can set each one if this triggers as you like to, if you want to have one as transmitter the rest if them have to be set as receivers and they will trigger the flash, hope this help I have 3 and I use one as a master the other 2 as slaves and I can have a set up of 3 lights using the one in camera if I need to and 2 off camera flashes with the other 2 set up as a receivers.
Something must be wrong with it, i didnt have a problem mine turned right on, send it back
Lowest position it can be in is about less than a foot of set at the shortest on the tripod with the light fixture completely facing the floor. I though for a moment you meant low as in emititon, to which I can say it only has two light levels, acceptable daylight surrogate, and off. Hope that answered your question!
Yes.
Mine didn't either. Once you take all the parts out, it's pretty self explanatory. You have to just play around with it to get comfortable using it!!! For the background stand you should have two tripod stands with 4 crossbars. The light stands come in 2 pieces, then you have to attach the lightbulbs and umbrellas if needed. You should have 3 backgrounds with 3 background protectors. I looked at the listing and made sure everything they said was included was there - and it was. Good luck!!!
I don't believe so. It barely fits with a back gel sleeve on it.
it doesn't matter if it's metal or plastic, as long as you install them correctly. Keep in mind when installing, don't push the sensors from the center but instead push them by outer edge into their place.
Yes it does and a USB cable to sync it for map updates with your computer. The traffic system is built into the car charger cable.
I have a nuvi 1390 and in the setup it does offer German for language and text, i haven't tested it and you may need to purchase and additional SD memory card to download the additional language but if it works , so what right?
I double checked the router and the manufacturer website specs for this router and it doesn't appear to support the 802.11b protocol, but check your device manufacturer's website you may be able to upgrade the device with a firmware download. the router is worth the hassle for the range and reliability alone. I'm running 2 hardwired and 6 wireless devices with no less than 4 devices online at a given time with no signal or speed degradation
Yes it is.
I purchased this keyboard to use with my Toshiba Thrive, it works perfect. I purchased other keyboards to use but this was the best by far. Good luck.
No it did not work for me..
This is exactly what I did... replaced the battery that came in the phone when I purchased the phone with this new battery. Works great, it hold a charge well.
I received two blocks.
I think it would be suitable.
The amount you get. I got the 3x and I got 3 mics.
This type of mic is designed to pick up your voice while being worn on your body. If you're trying to record a church service from the audience or from the back of the sanctuary, I think you will be disappointed with the results.
Yes. It works on all operating systems, or really any device that accepts headphone/microphone jack at all.
Sorry, it was almost 2 years ago, I don't remember. But it sounds like yours isn't working properly.
I was able to return the keyboard folio without a problem for full credit. I did have the original packaging and had only tried the product once. If you return it "as good as new" it shouldn't be a problem.
Yes it is. .. exactly what I run
Yes. You can use standard keyboard shortcuts, like copy, cut, paste, undo
Yes... it has the standard "up triangle w/line under it" just like on the laptop keyboard.
Yes - That is precisely the components I use, with no problems. Good luck.
I have a Samsung galaxy 4 works great
No, we have not had any skipping. This CD player works great for us.
You'd need an audio I-Pod adapter.
yes you can
Yes. Made in Japan!
This particular remote does not have a keyboard on back. This specific one has the 3D button, for the 3D-enabled TV's.
I haven't had a problem with mine I have 2 remotes used on the same tv are your 2 remotes the same model number? can you turn your tv on manually? do the remotes work independently one with batteries and one without? swapping them separately.
Yes
Yes very good remote it even works on my Netflix
No it is not the correct remote. The correct remote for your tv model is Sharp part number: RRMCG1003MPPZ
Because this remote is total garbage and should be recalled ! Do not leave the batteries in this remote for any length of time, the batteries will overheat and leak inside the remote. When I called Samsung about purchasing a new remote for my smart TV because the batteries had leaked inside my remote they failed to mention that this has been an on going problem with this remote! I read the reviews on Amazon Everyone has same problem with batteries leaking !
The bass is amazing. Really good. Much better then any earbuds I have had.
Yes
The camera has to be mouted with the bolt facing upward.
No it cannot be turned off.
Only if your screen can be used for a monitor
This monitor has 1) 5 volt power adapter pigtail 2) two std RCA video pigtails/ no audio RCA that I can tell but I use mine with a backup camera and only use 1 RCA. However when I plug the other RCA into the monitor it produces video also. I hope this helps, Sorry but I don't use the unit mentioned.
You simply remove the door with a small click and it stows away in a slot in the portion of the grip that slides up into the camera body. The battery door is then safe without fear of it getting lost and available in case you ever wish to remove the battery grip.
Dear Customer, Thanks for your inquiry, i'm so sorry that the crocodile colors for iPad air is unavailable now in our store. Thanks for your time. You have a blessed day ahead. Kind regards, Emily General Shop
I purchased mine 6 weeks ago and am now having the same issue. I am wondering if yours and mine are from a bad lot. I have emailed the seller directly (per Amazon's instructions for defective batteries) and am waiting to receive an answer. I will most likely email the address on the box it came in if I don't hear back from the seller very soon.
Definitely, yes. Have been using this version of Anker battery for several months now.
Only you can decide this. The 8X42 magnifies 8 times, and the 10X42 magnifies 10 times. So, if you want to use it for longer distances, the 10 power might be a better choice. However, there is a trade off. With all else being equal, the 10 power will not be as good in low light conditions, and the 10 power will be a little heavier, too. You need to decide if you want better capabilities in low light, or more power for viewing at longer distances.
There is a $50 rebate that would need to be submitted.
The best way for it to work is to hook up one plug link from router to wall via ethernet cable and other from wall to desired PC via ethernet cable and best range is 25ft to 30ft. I am running 75mbps and runs great.
I purchased a Kindle Paperwhite last year so I don't know if it fits the newer version. It fits mine fine. Maybe you can get on the Amazon Kindle store and compare the dimensions between last years and this years.
It fits great! I love mine. I would recommend this product.
go to magellan ,com there is a list of cams that will work with..
Works with the Acer C710 chromebook model just fine.
Yes
Yes, Mac OS X 10.5 or later.
Yes. It works great. I highly recommend this product.

Thank you for your interest in our package deal! In regards to your inquiry, the Canon EOS Rebel T3i and 18-55mm lens come packaged with the following accessories: LP-E8 Battery Pack Battery Charger Eyecup Wide Strap Interface Cable AV Cable EOS Digital Solution Disc Front & Rear Lens Caps
Yes
A. USM and B. Yes it is autofocus
There are 5 main lens caps included, 2 for each lens and one for the camera. Additional lens caps are provided on the wide and macro lens adapters and filters.
Yes
This switch doesn't auto-select (that is why I bought it). I use a universal remote and I don't want it switching if a device is turned on.
I got it for a Windows 8 installation - at the time of the purchase they did not have the driver I have t checked in a while though
sorry, it did not work with mine
There does not seem to be any "slack" at all. I'm looking at the back of one right next to a Bose Acoustimass subwoofer. They're vitually identical in the grip of the spring against the wire.
I usually just unplug the power supply connector for a few seconds.
It should work with all generations
If you're talking about the newest, current version of iPad (as of 10/13) then yes, this case will fit - I have one. But, Apple is supposed to be coming out with a new iPad this month that reportedly will be thinner and I'm not sure if it will fit in this case.
Yes it will. the case will stretch to fit it.
No
Yes. I have a couple different dongles which work. My son also plays music from his Galaxy phone through the speaker.
Yes, it does. When it comes to external subs, make sure you put it on the same folder as the mkv file.
Good luck that. This thing is junk and has a unrecognizable chip...
30 inches long
Yes. http://www.amd.com/en-us/products/graphics/desktop/5000/5770#
I have sharp lc80le940x and i used Freetalk for sharp and toshiba tv And it's work fine
Yes it worked fine, sad that the laptop broke.
Sorry, but i dont now.
You put your own stock in with bar codes so I don't see why not...
I use the standard wall charger and I have a car charger that you can set the output voltage to the required 13.5 volts minimum.
In theory, yes. The PS3 can play media files from an external HDD, just like from a thumb drive. If your TV can play media from a thumb drive, it should also be able to play media from one of these. According to various forums, you should put files in the appropriate folders on an external drive: "Photo", "Music", "Video". You also MUST format the drive as FAT32, not as exFAT or NTFS.
It's funny... I had the same concerns. But there is a new driver that fixed a big portion of that. But truthfully... The tablet draws fine. Most of the jitter I saw on the YouTube demos was due to pulling lines in their software incorrectly. I put out a Web comic each week, and have no problems. Feel free to check out the lines if you're curious. 1d4Rounds.com And contact us on there with any questions... Im happy to answer any questions I can.
Hi; I just measured it for you and it is four feet and four inches long. I have it plugged into the USB ports on the front of my tower and it allows for plenty of cord reach that way. Hope this helps!
It's USB connector. Hence, if laptop offers USB then you are good to go.
It is a power supply and does nothing to make it a tv, just sends power to it.
Many LED Flat screens have poor sound-hook audio out into an external amplifier or stereo system
If the question is work on PCs as well, yes. Hope that helps
2 1/16 by 2 7/8 outside - 1 3/4 by 2 1/8 inside .
don't know
don't know. I watched youtube and seen a guy convert it to a sony so I bought it and it worked.
was there an answer to this?
I think they make a case for the Ipad Air now?? Ck out their website and see.
Our pen pack came with on the last time I ordered.
The Swann 752 is an RS-485 camera, so Yes, technically it should work. Make sure to follow the RS-485 protocol and install a ballast resistor at every communication point. GL!
yes it works fine no lagging problems yet!
yes i do
I don't know but when mine showed up they had bare wire showing so I don't recommend buying this
Yes. it works perfectly with macbook air.
Yes
Andrew, it doesn't actually expand, it springs open and pinches on the phone- it should be fine. Watch a video on YouTube about it do you can understand how it works, it's a great product
With some modifications it can fit a small cam
Yep! you can create playlists along with a place where you can categorize your music, so if you are feeling happy, sad, anger, etc you can play the song that it sets for you. :)
If you have a car stereo that has the aux input (looks like a headphone jack) then yes. If your stereo has a usb port, then yes. Those are the only 2 ways I know will work with this unit.
Nope.
I believe it has 8.
I'm not sure. I always get added protection when I make a major purchase.
I honestly do not know... That is why I purchased this product
Canopy covers various brand name electronic equipment. I would say yes. You can call to check to make sure though: 1-866-551-5924. The customer service reps are very friendly and curteous and can answer your questions directly. AND you are not being outsourced to another country so you will not get frustrated by a lack of language skills.
This fits my Transformer Book T100 w/ keyboard. Plenty of extra room, I can even squeeze in some USB chargers, memory card readers and cables. I'd imagine a surface pro 3 will fit no problem.
The light only flashes when you press the button. To start or stop recording.
Hi, I checked-mine was a blue V2, the design looks a bit different than the V4, but I couldn't really say what the difference is. I can tell you I still use it at a follow focus on my Sony F3. It works great. Nice solid construction, adjustable start and stop points.
Yes, it comes with a focus ring.
It only displays an English keyboard (in a strange layout), but typing with a different layout than displayed works, as it just sends keycodes, not the characters - just don't look at it while typing!
Hold down shift and press 2
unfortunately you cannot :( but still is a great gadget , people will be impressed to see you using it
Looking at the specs of the d-90 it would appear that this is compatible.
I actually set my projector about 8 feet from the screen that I have to do power point presentations on. I don't think that you will have a problem focusing from a shorter distance.
Jacket reads "28AWG/IP+24AWG/2C"
I'm currently using it to charge my LG G3 with no issues. I would assume that since the Nexus 5 is made by LG as well that it shouldn't be an issue either.
Yes. It works with AT&T DSL. It is a modem and a router.
The mouse lets you program any keystrokes or a series of keystrokes and it has some default functions like copy, paste and so forth already on some profiles.
No idea, you'll have to check with the manufacturer.
Thanks for your question. We no longer have the system available in white. This is a fantastic sounding receiver. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Boston Acoustics dealer.
110
Yes it will.
Faisal: I don't precisely understand your question, but I can tell you that I have the same computer (11" macbook air) and my keyboard cover fits like a glove and looks exactly like the picture. I also didn't think it matched my keyboard from the image, but I trusted Amazon's amazing return policy and went for it. I was not disappointed (by the product). I'm pretty sure all macbook airs have the same mass produced keyboard, so you should be similarly delighted.
Yes.
yes of course...the charge last for an average of 200 pictures a charge...depends on your camera settings.
Yes.
I've never had any problems with the sound. Best hdmi cable I've bought
Yes, the two I tried, both had SD card slots.
The Thinkpad comes with a micro sd slot for expandability purposes. But like most tablets it does not have the ability to expand the memory as its soldered right on to the main board. You will damage it surely if you try to replace it. Your better of looking into the tablets with I5 processors which with enough knowledge you can expand the memory.
It has the older style prongs with not charge new iPads or iPhone unless you have adaptor purchased at apple store hope this helps
Negative, the charging jacks are for the old iPhone 4 type.
The answer is MAYBE. It depends on what sort of inputs your computer has on the sound card and/or motherboard.
It does not do the conversion. It is an adapter that allows you to connect you analog LP or tape player to a receiver or TV that requires a digital audio cable. It is most useful when you have used up all the analog (red/white) ports on the receiver.
Shipping to Australia would not be a problem..make sure the address is accurate..thnkd for inquiring
I believe it may be a proprietary connector. Smaller than the standard micro connectors on phones like Sprint uses. Should be able to use a USB extension cable. Several listed on Amazon reasonably priced. Or remove the memory card OR hook up with HDMI connector
It works with my 3rd generation iPad and iPhone 4. Can't see why it would not work with any Bluetooth device.
It was made in 2007 and the operating system is Mac OS X Version 10.6.8 (Snow Leopard).
yes
It has a AA place to put, 3. My suggestion is to buy good rechargeable batteries & charger. I have gone totally to rechargeable batteries. I will say that Ccrane speaks to good about the play time. I was disappointed.
Hi Chew, I haven't had mine in for too long, perhaps 8 months to a year, but it's still working. I suggest that when you do install a new lamp, you reduce the 'contrast' to save the lamp's life a bit. As for which one fits your TV, I don't know what model TV you have. You can find that info in the User's Manual. If you don't have a User's Manual, you can download one from the TV manufacturer's website.
I have a WD-73833 and it works perfectly. It's the same light for the 73734. Mine came from BULB WORLD through AMAZON. They even had free shipping! I read other people having problems with theirs from other places. Again, got mine in early 2013 and all is still good! VERY easy to replace too. It took me longer to pull the screen out from the wall than it was to replace the part. MAJOR difference in picture quality!
Yes
No it did not have any water cooling setup in the case. Its the same case as the higher end one that comes with water cooling, but this case is bare.
You connect the 20 - 24 pin motherboard connector to the tester along with sata power, pci-e, cpu 4-8 pin, & peripheral power connector. You plug the power cord from the Power Supply into a regular electrical outlet and turn the power supply on with the switch on the back of the power supply. Press the button on the tester 5 or 6 times to test the various connections. Really simple.
Mine has no audible alarm. It is visual as far as I can tell.
Yes.
It might if you hook it up out side to an antenna outside. That is what that antenna is built for mainly.
Yes, hello, This Drive Works With NTFS and FAT, But FAT, in all Drives, can't save files bigger then 5GB or So. Even So, Everyhting is mostly NTFS now, so just use that. Now, When I Backup, I Use TrueCrypt to secure my backups, because i dont "trust" Windows Backup. But There Should Be now Problem. I'm Pretty Sure That when I Got the drive, It was allready formatted to NTFS with 931GB of Space. Just Configure You Settings in windows backup, and direct it to the PHD (Portbale Hard Drive) There should be no problems at all.
No, not this one. As long as you use the USB cable the comes with it then you are fine
My husband has swam over 20 miles in the ocean with no issues. He stores on a mesh bag between uses. He also swims in chlorinated pools and lakes about 2 miles a week .
You can listen to anything you would normally be able to download to your iPod shuffle. If you already have another iPod shuffle then it will act exactly the same. Does that make sense?
I use it with my A7 fine with no problems. I use a 50mm summicron and get some of the sharpest digital photos I've ever seen. I would never spend $175 for an adapter these work just fine.
You can use Leica R (or Reflex) mount lenses on either Nikon (though I believe you need to change the mount rather than buy an adapter). Adapting a Leica M mount or screwmount lenses can be used in close focus/macro images, or there are a very small number of lenses that were designed for Leica's Lieca Visoflex system (these are fairly rare today) which can be adapted (but may require certain fairly rare accessories--Visoflex wasn't all that popular so the accessories weren't widely owned).
The SanDisk 5 in 1 only reads five different card types while the All in One reader reads pretty much every card type. Yes this is an upgrade to that model. Yes the 5 in 1 is still available for purchase for people who do not need as many card types to be read.
Yes, but you need a Windows 8 driver available from Sandisk for free.
No
Both lenses are a C-Mount and cost the exact same so if I had to guess it's just a listing error.
You may want to speak to a camera/optics retailer about specific fits.
I don't own an iPad. It has a standard USB plug. I am actually disappointed in the longevity of these speakers. They didn't last six months before we started experiencing popping sounds and changes in volume. We have replaced them with the cheaper Amazon basic speakers. The latter is not as powerful as the Pioneer set, but if they die inside of a year I won't feel so bad about it.
I have an IPhone and it works great with it. My understanding is that it also works with Androids. However, check in your Play Store first and see if it has a free LIVIO RADIO app.... Good luck...
No
No I don't. Product is a crap. Wasting money for nothing. Thanks
power supply must be purchased separately and plugs into red lead. Yellow is video and white is audio.
I tried using them several times- i don't like them.
I would think so. It runs fantastic on my Dell 755 with windows 7 Pro, 2 1 TB hard drives and 8 Gig of Ram. The extra 4 gig of ram really made changes to my plans quick.
Yes
Brittan, The set up is good however I would get brighter bulbs. The bulbs are 45 watt and I don't think will be strong enough for watt you are trying to do especially since you are using steady light rather than strobes. Hope this helps
it is a high pressure stream
Not sure. Mine was an ipad 2.
Fits perfect
I Dont HAve a ps4 but the web site said its compatible with the ps4.. here the link to the website http://us.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/sound-blaster-recon3d
It records over so you never run out of space. There is a setting in the preferences area for this. I have the 8 cameras running and I think I have more then 14 days of history.
I don't know is do not play game on my computer. Sorry.
will it a good computer it in good condition like a new one
At the N2A web site, I saw that this is only good for the Nook Color and one for the Nook Tablet is in development.
Technically no, because XBOX One doesn't have Windows Media Center Extender. However, I would assume the power, A/B/X/Y, etc. buttons would work.
Yes. The hood is removable. As a matter of fact we shoot hoodless and just crop the head because the person wearing the suit is also speaking.
We do not offer international shipment service at this time. Regards, kimoutlet

We purchased replacement bulbs at Walmart or home depot one of the 2 :)
The box it came in was about 14x14x40 inches. The bag it stores in is about 36x4x4 inches and the bag for the bulbs is about 9x10x3 inches. On a side note make sure you don't pitch the boxes the bulbs come in. You will use them in the storage bag to protect the bulbs.
Yes, it does.
The answer is no. The pogoplug only provides USB host ports that are designed to attach to slaved USB flash/external HDDs or mobile devices that have USB slave ports (and also support USB Mass Storage Class access to their internal storage). You, on the other hand, need a slave device (such as a USB stick or external USB HDD) to connect to the port on your TV (which serves as a USB host).
it will compress just like a normal door would. So in theory you could still use a credit card to get into a room locked by this. Power will keep it compressed but im not sure if it would damage it keeping power applied.
yes current pulls the latch back until the current is turned off.
They might charge you a small fee to rent a cablecard so you can access all the digital channels. With this device you can't use ondemand services. I use windows media center to record tv, this is not a standalone device as it requires a computer.
There are 2 tuners so as long as you are only recording 1 show you can use the other to view live TV.
You must have a cablecard provided by your cable company to be able to receive their channels. That is a small card that slides into the Hauupauge. This box does nothing without the cablecard. The cablecard decodes the cable signal But, that said, I receive all the channels I subscribe to from Comcast with the Comcast cablecard. I do not get HBO for some reason though through the cablecard. I do not know why Does Time Warner have cablecards to give to you? That is what you need to find out. I do not know about TW
Bluetooth, 5 band eq and bookmarks.
No we can not send to Spain
No, you don't have to, it works out of the box! http://www.olympus.co.jp/en/support/imsg/digicamera/compati/pen_optical.cfm
nope you can strobe these lights if you wanted to. And the lights themselves take maybe 20 seconds to reach peak output and depending what you use them for. For example I use them for my house plants and starting my vegetable seeds and I have to have sunglasses on while working with them on. Hope that helps
These bulbs are rated for 8000 hours. About 1 year of you leave them on 24/7. I wouldn't recommend them for daily use, though; the ballasts seem to be VERY fragile - we've had a number of them, (the ballasts) just burn out after less than 10 hours of use. Other than that, I love 'em.
This will work with virtually any standard desktop phone. Caution: You cannot gravitate too far away, from the base; however, without getting a lot of static. IF/when you are close to the base, it's fantastic.
Yes it has an auxiliary input. I've never used it, but the unit is a bargain for the money, and size wise it's great in small spaces.
This receiver won't have any trouble with the current setup. I did the same thing as you did in my dorm room.
Go to the Avid website to verify if you can. I upgraded from 5.6 educational version without a problem.
I have the TF001 and it fits that one..
It does. But it's used primarily for sampling the noise in order for it to select the best noise cancelling profile. It is also used in monitor mode so you can hear the the person talking to you or listening to ambient sounds. It can't be used to make/receive calls (ex. When connected to an iPhone or Android).
Yes, That's the same model I have. These are excellent cases and I highly recommend them. There is one downside however. The speakers are front mounted and the rim of the gumdrop case covers the speakers. Even with that said it does mute the sound some but not too badly. I never have an issue listening to music , movies, etc. I hope this helps.
There is a ear plug/speaker jack on the top of the case. We have had our case for almost a year and it is wonderful.
Yes, I have that combo and I think it works great. The wires on the buds are sturdy and comfortable and the sound is excellent.
Yes, this case will fit the 10.1 7500, 7510 perfectly!
Sorry it will not fit. It will fit the galaxy tab 2 10.1
Yes! I am a middle aged non techy person and I was able to get this figured out quickly! I love it so much. I even figured out how to download music to it and I use this almost every day. The clip feature is the best, especially when working out. I would definitely say it's easy to use.
They advertise compatibility to ACC, Apple Itunes format, so yes, it's compatible.
I'm running a 64 GB in mine. It's a SanDisk Mobile Ultra MicroSDXC Class 10 card, formatted to FAT 32, and partitioned by taking off 300 MB only. I'd be glad to give specifics if requested (quite easy). Oh, I installed Rockbox, too--essential--makes it a whole new level of player. (Installing needs a 32 bit computer or simulation program for the Sansa, also simple.
Yes it does. I download books from Overdrive media and players must meet that requirement to download the wmas. That is why I picked the SanDisk Sansa Clip mp3 player.
I use mine almost only for audio books - love it! love it! I wear it while cleaning, driving (one ear only), relaxing, knitting, traveling, quilting, cooking.... you name it! I've listened to hundreds of books, I often get library books on CD, rip them and move them to the SanDisk player.
Yes you can plug it into portable speakers with the same connections that come with earphones.
I'm Win7 and I've also used it with XP and Vista. Might have to check Sansa website for compatability but I don't think there will be any issues although I haven't been forced to buy a Win8 Computer yet.
USB charging only
Argh....I read your question wrong for my previous answer. Having a USB port is the key. If your tablet has it then I believe you can transfer music to the player. You charge the player using the UBC port, too.
Mean add IOS 8 where? Because that hardrive does not work with that operating system, it has its own software and the only thing near any IOS is the app that you get in the apple device such iPhone or iPad, the app just would make the updated to work smooth with both the apple device and the hardrive.
It is secured with Velcro also. I have had it for over a year and it has never come out or been a problem. Very well make case, and I would definitely recommend it.
Not really, it is for landscape use. You can stand it in portrait but it will stand straight up and can fall over a little bit to easy.
Greetings! I use it on my motorcycle so i put it closer to my engine so i could get a better idea how hot it is getting. Not sure what your using it on but the lead for the outside senor should be long enough to thread it through the firewall on a car to mount it outside. I attached mine with double sided tape and it has stayed put nicely. I'm very happy with mine. No problems for 4 years.
No,but you can get one for less than $10
It is not more than 10 pounds in weight
Yes. You could use this device to make phone calls. All you need are this board and sim card. But of course you could add some other boards to realize other functions.
Charger
Yeah it's worked in every system I've put it in (windows, MACs, and even Serbian tablets with USB capabilitys)
Reads @ 19.5 Mb/s. Have not performed write test. Mostly use it for RasPi OS. Works well enough for that. Hope this helps.
http://www.nix-digital.com/sites/default/files/attachments/X12B.pdf
Yes, Macintosh, Microsoft, Linux, etc. for the most part. It's a storage device not a program. For your assurance I only have Macintosh, definitely works.
The case is awesome. It definitely has more padding but yet it doesn't make it heavier. I can't say why but I bought it about 3 months ago and I'm very satisfied.
I've used my sleeve daily since early August and I have no issue with the rippers. They're sturdy and I don't anticipate them breaking anytime soon. I haven't experienced the rippers scratching my laptop; you can fold them back as you insert your laptop to further prevent them from scratching it... but I haven't had to do this and I see no scratches. I hope this helped!
Hello Dinesh, This product is not compatible with a Lenovo Yoga Pad.
USB cable is all I use.
Yes
Yes it does!
the answer is no. it should be worked with Mac while playing music on itunes.
you will have to download the driver from the internet [for the latest] or use the included cd rom... its not difficult. standard install. i had no problem...
Yes, that's the beauty of this piece! I have 3 monitors (1VGA 1DVI 1USB) hooked up to my Dell Latitude right now through my docking station.
I regret to say that I don't know for sure; however, most DVDs have Spanish soundtracks included. Sorry I can't be more helpful
No
It absolutely does!
I am not sure about that - but the cord for this item is extremely short. I was very disappointed in how short it was. You will need an extention cord for sure.
Our church has about the same distance from screen to remote. It works just fine at that distance. Overall, I am really surprised and satisfied with this product. It seems to be very well made.
I primarily use this to sign PDF documents in Adobe Acrobat. You need to download other programs to use the pad. It works well though I mainly use the same sig over and over instead of putting in a new signature.
Yes. It works on all cars made after 1995.
No
Based on my experience, yes you can replace it. Kodak will send you a replacement if you ship yours to them first, but only after they determine that yours cannot be repaired. The "new" camera they send you will not be, in fact, a new unused camera, but rather a refurbished, used and repaired camera.
Yes
I received this product brand new from Amazon, in it's plastic sealed packaging. For me, the product works as stated, as in it was WATERPROOF. So far I had no problems..... cheers!
As long as you want. I have one clip of a school play that is 45 minutes... you can record as long s you have battery power and card space, as far as I am aware.
absolute peice of crap the playsport is much better
hey, only rb450g :(
I just p[ugged and played once it loaded I have had no problems
To quote Alex Trebek, "Please state you answer in the form of a question." I ran a Google search on "M305." Apparently, it is a Logitech mouse model. If you have one, look at it. Does it have the yellow cogwheel logo on it? If so, it works with the unifying receiver. For more info, see: http://forums.logitech.com/t5/Mice-and-Pointing-Devices/M305-UNIFYING-RECEIVER-COMPATIBILITY/td-p/577610
I just measured my Sony MDR-7506 and their dimensions (approx 80mm x 100mm) are awfully close to your measurements. I had to stretch them a bit to slip them in place, so I strongly suspect the earpieces would work with your headset. The other dimension is the depth of the slot the edge of the headphone cover fits in to, but I have to believe it is fairly standard. So all in all, I think it is a risk worth trying.
They fit on the ears like the stock pads but are more comfortible than the stock pads.
Yes, I do this. I have one on the router, then one in my office and one in the bedroom.
Yes, the Power rating is 100-240 V AC, 50/60Hz three models are available: Plug type: &#9702; EU type: Two pins, 220 V - 230 V &#9702; US type: Two pins,120 V &#9702; UK type: Three pins, 240 V
The Actiontec c1000a is the newest version.
No it only fits iPad2
It is amazingly clear, so I don't see why you couldn't.
The hoodman HEYEC18G Hoodeye will fit a Canon 70D if LCD remains closed per the Hoodman compatibility chart. Please check http://hoodmanusa.com/cgi/commerce.cgi?display=action&emptyoverride=yes&template=PDGCommTemplates/Header_Footer_XHTML/compatibility_chart.html at hoodmanusa.com. Hope this helps
This is compatible with Canon EOS system including 6D
The camera does not have a removable battery.
Hi Edgar, the Plantronics part number is 83545-01.
Written on the side of the box is: 20" x 28". It contains 5 200W bulbs.
No, it cannot.
Yes. I can stream anything on my Dish Hopper and set shows to record directly on the Vulkano to side load onto my iPd, iPhone and computer. It's a great addition.
The tv works with Comcast cable but will not turn on and off with the Comcast remote. Need to use the tv remote to turn it on and off.
I found that the directions for installing the base were incorrect. When I turned the base 180 degrees it fi better.
Yes it is according to Amazon and Google
Never had to use the warranty. Still satisfied with this camera. No big flaws so far.
Sure. I have two.You can even use a 64 GB.
Yes. the A57 uses the minolta-style flash shoe, which the Vello fits.
One computer VGA/PC input. Great TV
It looks like it does actually the keyboard I purchased is supposed to be for the Envy14. Only thing is my dm4 is missing a connector in the computer so my keyboard is not lighting up. I don't mind because my computer is whole again.
I bought them separately They came one per box :)
Unfortunately It won't. The i pad 2 I put in mine is 7.31 inches wide, and the air is 6.6 inches and so the side brackets won't hold it in.
No,The bottom of the iPad in landscape is about 44" Max.
I would think so.
It fits my 17.3" gaming laptop so you should be fine
yes here is the standard R6G screw in on the back.
I first connected with an rf cable, then switched to a $3 3-ft long HDMI cable. MIGHT have seen a minor improvement in picture on hi-def channels, but not enough to worry about. NO cable connectors are included
Yes, it does have RCA inputs. The one drawback on this TV is that the speaker is Pretty weak. I bought a very inexpensive pair of Logitech S120 speakers that I just plugged into the earphone jack on the TV. Now I've got all the volume I need
Yes. Yes
No, this TV works with TV cable
I love the RCA portable in question, however I have problems getting a signal or the TV stations. I watch DVD's and play my CD's. The DVD's are very clear and I love the color and the CD's have a great sound. I don't blame the RCA portable for me not being able to get a signal because I live in the woods but I try to use the TV when I travel and will keep you posted.
i couldn't get it to work with an antenna or my regular direct TV cable, I sent it back
The camera itself isn't but there is a water case for the camera. It muffles the sound a bit but keeps the camera dry. I used it walking in the rain and it was fine.
No
It really depends on how loud your music is. They do isolate sound very well, I admit. For someone to catch my attention they have to yell my name or physically touch me when I have the headphones in my ear at medium loudness. My advice is to just be careful and rely on sight while using them.
Well I rarely use the microphone. But when I have uaed it no one had any complaints about voice clarity or asked me to repeat
No it won't save a specific video it will continue to record untill all the memory its used and then it will format itself deleting everything on it.It saves everything or delete's everything. I always carry two memory cards so in case somenthing happens I change the chip until I can save it to my pc... This device its priceless.
All chargers since way back, work with all iPods. and this is basically identical to those chargers. Works with some older Nano's I have.
It's perfect. Presents no noise. And people around me do not hear the sound.
Yes it does also has internal memory.
I had that issue at first. Try adjusting the display settings first, you may have to adjust the actual picture size if it's just too big.
Hi, yes indeed, as well as being a raid 0, 1, 5 unit this product is also a very competent JBOD (just a bunch of discs) that interfaces with your via a decent USB 3.0 port. It very (too) easily switches between those storage configurations; just don't make the mistake of switching before you've backed up your data!!
I have not used it that way but I would think it would work with Windows Home Server 2003. If the operating system can see USB connected devices/drives. May be some latency issues if the drives are not accessed regularly.
should work fine as will most canon lenses - the beauty of a top-notch photography equipment system
yes
Yes
yes
Yes
Yes. Just an f y I. If the lens is for a canon camera it will fit all canon cameras.
The size of the Stabile PRO does not adjust to accommodate different size tablets. The bottom holders across are 6", the tops are 5.5", and the span from top to bottom is 7".
ipad air sets at 11 inches and 13 inches to the top of screen ( landscape and portrait )
No. A DisplayPort is not a USB port.
It is not a usb to hdmi so if thats what you are looking for this will not work
Depends on which connections you have on your laptop. It looks like that projector only supports VGA, so you will need a VGA cable (Male-Male). If you do not have a VGA connection on your laptop, then you will need an adaptor to convert the signal from either HDMI or displayport to VGA.
Bought this for this reason, does NOT fit. Disappointed but can always use another USB cord
Personally, I use 4 1/2" clamps, and they work perfectly. It may be possible to get away with 3" clamps, but I seriously doubt it. The diameter of the support bar is large enough that I have to squeeze the handles on the clips almost all the way to get them on the bar. While I still have a small bit of room, I don't think the 3" clips would be large enough.
Yes, but it can easily tilt if back drop is too heavy. I'm currently using a huge Muslim backdrop in addition to randomly overlapping other background and it still stands sturdy. But I am looking to use sandbags, etc. as weights just incase.
No, it only outputs one source at a time.
Yes, it can. That is the purpsoe of a "Matrix" Switcher.
If your tab3 has a hdmi port & your tv has a hdmi port
These are HDMI plugs. You need the same female fitting on whatever you are connecting. You have to identify what type plugs you have on tablet. etc.
Lorenzo, usualy the Cable TV is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables and usually, the projectors have many types of plug into the back of the unit. Including RF coax cable or fiber optics female. Can you tell me the brand and model of your projector ?
Nope. You need macTv. To my understanding it is your Mac not allowing the data to flow through properly. I may be wrong, but I have tried to play my mac on all if my TVs by setting up as an external monitor and it has never worked. Work around would be to create a 3rd party video, store it in the cloud and have your tv access that cloud service and watch from there. More hassle than its worth.
No.
Yes I doesn't work.
what kind of cases is there for the trio sheath 10.1
I received an iPod Classic for Xmas. As far as I know there is only one model of the classic. This case fits my iPod Classic
yes, the screen will go off with a quick press of the power button and if the button is held longer, the entire system will power down. had it for over 18 months and it is still going strong!
It should with the proper hook up wire. Should you have any further problems, the vendor is great, they stand behind their products and will assist you 100%. Mine works great!
I'm sorry I do not have box and I have sold this TV so I can not answer question
Yep. Works great t4i
It does!!
It may not work with any OS. Mine and others pulled apart. Shoddy manufacturing from a Hong Kong no name
This is a female connector
Probably not, but there are other keyboards for your model if you just search for the model on here! I looked and a few are listed
Not sure of watts...but they are too dim
Yes; in fact, we ordered four then added three additional to use throughout the house. All work well together.
Uses in house wiring that gets the type of wireless connection, connecting to two separate houses I doubt if it would work. This product is great but doubt can be used in two separate house, check a wireless unit that should work. Or go to the Intercom Central site look up handbook it may be in there, I still think you need a wireless intercom, but some folks may hear it also that why this is the way to go. Hope this helped.. My email address is '.... brazil712@comcast.net
These are a piece of junk, stopped working after a month of use (very light use). I wouldn't find something else.
If these dimensions are of the laptop while closed, the medium will be fine for you. I have two laptops. The larger one is a Compaq with dimensions of 15 x 10, and it just barely fits. I would describe 15 x 10 as the absolute maximum dimensions for a laptop that would fit into the size medium of this product
Sadly, no. It has zipper for pockets at front, but it's covered by the flap anyway

Lifetime but I've had no issues.
I purchased the small and my 15" Retina MacBook Pro fit snugly along with my iPad Air
There is a lever that allows you to make the strap as long or short as you need. You can roll up the slack with an elastic. It works great. When I use mine for biking I keep the strap short so the bag sits higher, when I walk with it I loosen it.
No
it can fit a six-pack of beer with some room left, so yes.
Lifetime but I've had no issues.
The main strap is designed to go across the body diagonally. There is then a smaller detachable strap to connect the main strap, diagonally in the other direction, back down to the bag.
No
13" fits in the small, medium fits a typical 15" (such as macbook retina). I would think with a medium it would move about quite a bit. (My 13" has a speck case on it, and it fits just fine).
I have the same size computer. A medium fits it with plenty of room.
So Strong
The grab strap and everything else on the bag is excellent quality. My kid uses as book bag for school, i.e. good for everyday use.
13" fits in the small, medium fits a typical 15" (such as macbook retina). I would think with a medium it would move about quite a bit. (My 13" has a speck case on it, and it fits just fine).

I think so. I've traveled to Asia with it a few times and you can fit a laptop charger bottle of water and a change of clothes in there.
Call Timbuk2. They sent me a couple of locked clips to replace the buckles at no charge. They were easy to install. I would assume you can order an extra shoulder strap from them as well.
Check out the manufacturers website http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/command-tsa-friendly-ipad-laptop-messenger-bag They have all the dimensions as well as photos with people carrying the different sizes.
Yes, there is a slot on the back of the bag that you can insert the handle of a rolling suitcase into.

I'm sorry, I do not.
Right now mine are at my height (5'9") but I'm sure they go way higher. I love these lights however u gotta be careful cuz they're fragile
you could use LED bulbs 110V
Yes. 10 wide by 12 long
Hello Ivan. The X2000 will work with Comcast Xfinity Internet service if set as a router alone. It will not work if it is set to function as a modem-router.
Yes you can! It's a really good router/modem.
No.
Yes. This tablet comes with three free software applications: Corel Painter Essentials, Adobe Photoshop Elements, and Autodesk Sketchbook Express (I believe that would be the one you can draw with, I just use the tablet for painting). All you have to do is download the software from the Wacom site after you've registered the product.
When I bought mine it came with version 9.
Bamboo Create. It was my first tablet. I got it 5 years ago and it's still fully functional through all the years of wear and tear. It's not a huge one, but it's a nice size for beginners or hobbyists. The pen pressure levels aren't too bad either. It comes with two free art programs for Windows and Mac.
I have the IPad2, I am not sure. Contact seller and ask before u buy it
Yes. It fits all iPads except the air.
Yes, it definitely does come with a power cord.
used the charger on T400, T410, T530. Worked fine in these units.
I haven't used it in Spain, but I would think that it probably would work in Spain.
The kit I purchased came with an extra battery and charger. However, if your not using the flash you can take several thousand pictures on a charge.
Sounds like time a "Factory reset" with paper clip *off charger* If no Change Contact Phillips sorry friend Just a question. ..how long have you had it?
It is very good Igot it for my grandson he love it .
Yes it is compatible with the DL360 Gen5 server.
More detailed configuration information would be nice. However, if Apple's specs http://support.apple.com/kb/sp30) are applicable to your model, yes these should work. You should really check your system documentation first though.
With d320 it does, so I don't see why it should not
Yes, it will. I use it on my D5100 with great success. I bought for a up coming trip and it is a great all-in-one lens. Here is a video I found on You tube with a D7000 using a Tamron 18-200 lens shooting a video. Hope this helps....http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X25cmCkf1Vg
it makes a big difference from just more volume it pushes the bass and everything else its good if ask you ask me.I use it with my skullcandy crushers and it works way better than just the headphones alone.I recommend if u like loud music
Yes you can read, but you will need two pillows under your head I love my IPEVO, although you will have to Velcro it together, so it will not open a little.
It works with anything. It is just a pillow with a sewed in rubber ledge to catch the tablet. If you are sitting in a chair and want something to support the tablet it is great. I have another product I like has an adjustable angle Support I like better for laying back in my lounger. But for setting up in a chair I prefer this product.
It will, but it is a little large. The "Wedge" works better for the kindle in my opinion.
Yes it will. I use it mainly for my mini-IPad but my husband and his son tried their IPad Air on it and said it was just fine to use. I fine this pillow to be lightweight and easy to move around and very comfortable when using it on my knees in my recliner chair. I use a stylist pen to type with and this pillow keeps the pad in place just fine. There is a thin resting place for the pad that could be thicker but works fine as is. Hope this helps.
It should. I'm never without my pillow. I just love it. It's not perfect by any means, but works very well for reading and watching a movie! Worth the $
I'm pretty sure these only work with pc, or to listen to music. I don't think they work with the Xbox one
Nope. For some reason I thought the same thing when I bought them, but I wasn't disappointed because they sound so good.
It's charged by a USB cable and it charges quickly as well.
Mine is plugged into a satellite radio and connects to my Bose speaker, if that helps...
PCI-E 6pin, 2x PCI-E 6+2 Pin8
It would be more than enough. That's twice of what you actually need. I have the same hardware and i use a Corsair CX550M. Runs like a charm.
No, there are no backlit keys here. There isn't even a caps lock or num lock light.
I have a Logitech M310 mouse that I am using with this keyboard. However, the mouse will not pair with the HP keyboard dongle, so I am using 2 USB ports, one for the keyboard and one for the mouse. This configuration works perfectly. Since I have 4 USB ports on my laptop, using 2 for the mouse and keyboard is not an issue especially since I like the keyboard so much.
Nope but they sound amazing
Yep, they come with many different sizes and they feel very comfort in ears with a nice sound isolation too. Best Regards!
No
as long as the tv's support 75x75mm or 100x100mm VESA I don't see why they wouldn't be able to
I had the same problem and they don't connect together.
The 50 in SB50 is for 50 amps. A jump will generally require more than that to get the car started. There are other SB series connectors that would be better suited. Check the amperage you will be using and then pick the appropriate connector. The other question would be where would you put the matching connector on the vehicle? They only work in pairs and I don't know if you want an extra terminal hanging off your vehicles battery.
It comes with one piece it is both male and female. You need 2 to actually use it
According to my basic owners manual (a full-size one is available as PDF) it's one year on parts AND labor. If you buy it with certain credit cards, you can automatically extend it (or double it); check your particular card services.
Yes. there is a std outlet for remote control or other accessory on the side...but only one accessory that requires such at one time...I have a Rainbow Imaging remote with time delay - it goes in the shoe and its cord plugs in the outlet, so nothing else in the shoe or outlet at same time....Maybe someone else knows otherwise.
fits fine. been going strong since I purchased them
Bout 4 feet, great speakers especially for the price, well worth more
Sort of. Yes, the cable box will be gone but you will need a cable card from your ISP.
No it does not work at all I returned it when I received it
less than 12 inches
No, this headset IS the cordless phone. That is to say, the base station of this headset connects to your desk phone and the headset is cordless. But it requires a corded handset on your desk phone to make the connection.
Yes the mouthpiece swivels to switch

Hi There. Yes, this headset will definitely work with that Cisco phone system. Please let me know if you have any questions.
yes it does.
Either at Garmin's website or if you go there and get the code of the upgrade you want you can shop elsewhere knowing the code of the item like on amazon or even ebay. That is the best answer I have.
Unknown. But Pro 13 is designed for Win8
I am not for sure but this battery is horrible. It lasted a month at the most.
Standard, the only drawback of this product.
14AWG should be handling up to 15A, I don't think this will be a good solution for that kind of amperage. I would suggest buying a single outlet extension wire for such purposes. I am not an expert, so please check some more
It has a mini-usb port, with an adapter to plug in full size usb cable
The reason It won't connect is because you need to enter your routers WEP key when attempting to connect to your network, if you have at&t 2-wire than you can find the code on the router some where it should look about like this and be this length "5956659197" if you don't have at&t and it is some other type of router I would contact whoever set it up for further instruction on how to obtain your wifi password.
Just Google, instructions for Hummingbird 561408460.....
No. We wired ours to the battery. He has a nice trolling motor and we considered it, so I googled, I'm sorry, I looked it up on bing and found it, I think at amazon for 29$
256
12-13"
I have noted no degradation in picture or audio quality in several weeks of use from my earlier setup in the one room and in the other it enabled me to upgrade that sets input to the HD Maximum my satellite DVR is capable of. My equipment in both rooms are high end too. I recommend this splitter highly, it does exactly what I bought it for.
Not to my knowledge, it works just fine. I am very happy with it. Mine is also used to split two 1080P TV's plus dvr plus xbox and we station. works great.
Yes, the info states up to 8 bulbs - 3.Listen to wireless music from up to 8 bulbs throughout any environment in minutes
About 30cm each.
It's certainly strong enough. It's only about 10 - 12 inches high. Small. If U want more than that go to the next step up, but U can't go wrong with the Joby.
So sorry, Da Ke, but I don't know!
Yes you can either play music from your phone or play from the radio
Yes they are, via your wireless router WiFi using "AirPlay". But they don't connect directly to your phone via Bluetooth or Dock. The Dock is only good for charging, and it doesn't have the iPhone 5 lightning adaptor. Save your money, I bought these speakers and they failed after a few months. The warranty replacement also failed after a few months, and unable to replace those... They look and sound great when they work, but the reliability is no good.
I dont know. I just plugged it in then it started working. You may want to check your computer settings under the control panel options to enable it.
No
Sure. I'm using them with 18ga. Be careful not to over tighten the screws when you mount it; I split the plastic.
Keyboard should work on your laptop
No
Yes it did
Sorry but all of this model are fulfilled by Amazon. We do not have this model on hand.
It depends on your phone. You also need to make sure your phone case allows the headphone jack to be inserted all the way in. I have used the mic with the Iphone 4s and 5. However, it doesn't work with the iphone 4s Lifeproof case installed. Contact Yurbuds directly via their website. I've had good interaction with their customer service department.
I use it with my Motorola MotoActv both independently and blue-tooth linked to my Motorola Droid RAZR M. All the controls and mic work fine. However, when I plug the Yurbuds into my phone directly, only the mic works. I tried it with my Kindle Fire and the controls don't work either. I read some people had trouble with conflicting applications so I rebooted in my phone in Safe Mode, but it still didn't work. Soooo... I don't know.
They are very close to what you see is what you get. They come up about 10-15% smaller than what you are seeing through the viewfinder. (depending on the amount of zoom you are using when shooting). I've had mine for over a year now and still enjoying it.
I read somewhere that, it supports a resolution of 2560x1600. so it should support dual monitors if the total resolutions falls under this. I'm using nVidia GPU, so I never tried the onboard hdmi or DVI.
No, is for desktot MB soket fm1
i received a pair for my jetski but they did not last very long about 4 trip on salt water and they stopped working
please email us - we will take care
This unit will not do that.
The one I have fits a Kindle Fire which is 4.5" x 7.25", made prior to June 30, 2012. If the case the same type as mine, 5.5" is most likely too wide. But even if it fit, I would say don't buy it. The straps that hold the kindle in place pulled out in less than a year with very gentle usage. I had to replace it.
not sure measure the nook and figure it out i only own kindles sorry.
I don't know the answer to that. I have the original fire. I can tell you mine is 7 3/8 x 4 3/4. Hope it helps.
It was when I bought it...The lens got locked in the off position, and when I turned on the power the lens would not extend. Great pix's up to then and great pix on the replacement that Canon sent to replace it.
Don't buy it. I could not use it and do not know how to get my monet back.
Dear valued customer, Thank you for contacting us about our product. Because our price is the bottom price, so we can only offer 10% for the shipping fee. Sorry, we can not print a logo on the side for this holiday season. Sorry for any inconvenience. Thank you for kind understanding. Regards,
No AA battery accommodation.
Chances are it pushes less air than you're default fan, at least it did for me . I was debating between a new card or new fan, i should have chosen a new card because I've had to buy one anyways
Yes, but I had to add some foam rubber (side and bottom) to align the lens and the camera portal. If the lens is not centered, it will vignette.
no
It's not an Audi part, it's aftermarket. But it worked great in my Jetta MK4. It fit the dash great using the correct trim piece. It comes with 3 or 4 trims for different vehicles.
That goes back a LOOOOONG time ago. As I recall I had a problem with my application using this device. Not saying it was bad but didn't fit my needs. Sorry.
The most Ive been able to record at a time is 2:00 min then it stops and you have to start over .
It has a standard mount thread on the bottom so in that sense yes. But I do not know of any mount made just for helmet mounting. You could use something like this -&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Swann-SWVID-FREE01-GL-Freestyle-Vented-Helmet/dp/B008UG14DS/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1360096506&sr=8-6&keywords=camera+helmet+mount
Yes, it fits and works great. I have used it numerous times with no problems so far.
Yes and very well providing you want a telephoto. The camera is usually sold with an 18-55mm lens which works great for within 20' and a hypothetical for within 20' of the lens in question is you will get a great headshot for someone 12 to 15' away. I recently used it on some waterskiers and the imagery was jaw dropping... Hope this helped!.. :-)
Hi, I'm sorry. I am no expert on these lenses.. I bought it, on amazon, after discovering it was compatible with the Sony NEX5R that I bought... I have no other knowledge about them. Good luck...
Manual
I bought the camera body alone. You can purchase a sony zoom lens separately.
I have both cameras, the A77 is definitely worth the price. It's bigger but it has better build quality. You'll get two control dials (this is extremely useful), really convenient LCD screen (you can tilt it to more direction than the A65), more accurate AF system, built-in AF fine-tune, IR light, and you'll also get a top LCD panel (somehow it makes you feel like a pro). By the way, they use same APS-C sized sensor, not a full frame one.
The A77 and the A3000 both record the same 1080 24p video. You might also consider the A58, the A77 is weather resistant. the extra pixel count is in the still photographs, not the video . Biggest difference in A77 and A3000 is in build quality, things it can do, the focus system, and size. Stop by a camera store, if you can, and get a feel for the camera. If you only need video buy a dedicated video camera.
If they are Sony, Minolta (auto-focus) and Tamron branded, then yes. If you have any Sigma lenses with HSM on them, then probably, but they might need to go back to Sigma to make them compatible. Non-HSM lenses are not affected.
I would say it's quieter than most other SLR cameras, but it is still somewhat loud. There is no mirror slap like other DSLR cameras. This one sounds like a high pitched "zip" about as loud as the auto focus.
Yes it comes with a battery and wall charger
Good low light I would bye this camera again
No on both accounts. However, there is a solution for Time Elapsed Photography for this camera, which if I understand your question correctly, it is what you want to do. Therefore, look up the Tempus TimeElapse Remote. It's an IR blinker that you place infront of the camera and set the camera to remote and it will take a picture every time it blinks.
Yes they are fine.
The 30 pins refers to the connector where you normally attach the ipod to charge it. It will work on all the iPods with the 30 pin that is about an inch wide. I absolutely am amazed at the sound quality of this Pyle unit. You will not be disappointed.
Radio Shack should be able to fix you up...the manual should give power specs so they can get you the right amperage and so on
Gregory, I think it does. It says it works with Ipads in general.
I bought the tower for a christmas present and it came with a broken ac adapter. I've called the company to this date (1/26/13) and have gotton absolutly no care in sending me a new adapter.They promised me twice and still No adapter.They harldy ever answer their phones and their mailboxes are always full.I,m now stuck to buy a $86.00 adapter from radio shack or I will have to send this enormous piece of junk back to amazon.What a Hassle! I'd be very weary of what you buy from Pyleaudio.
They might actually like it, because it'll just sound like they have a speaker of their own...
If the car has an auxiliary port, then I think it should work.
Mine came with 2 drives with RAID 1. Suggest you to review the spec at http://www.wdc.com/wdproducts/library/SpecSheet/ENG/4178-705315.pdf
Yes both jacks are the same size. Still a bad buy!
it would probably not work as it most likely transmits on only one channel. However, if the set with the headphones was muted, then the other set could be heard by the one without the headphones. muting the tv does not mute the headphone.
Yes is does include the camera strap and yes the lens include the casps then again YES lenses does come with a warranrty card. It's all brand new (dont expect the bag to last too much tho)
I have no idea, check with Amazon.
I attach the strap with the clamp at a balance point along the shaft of the trimmer.
Not that I'm aware of....I suspect the price differential would't make it worth the mnufacturer to do so, but the secondary or ebay marketplace might be a good place to check
It needs a full field of view of the road. it will detect below the dash but the range is almost nothing.
The x50 comes with one. I think all newer bel and Escort detectors will work with it.
Yes I have played MP4 files
It's manual. You have to turn the ring on the lens.
I have a NX100, and it doesn't include flash. However, I've used three different types of flash units on it, Bower, TTL and Autos, and everything works really well. In low light situations, you can go down to as low as 1/5 shutter speed with ambient light, and it still looks great. The flash unit itself is very affordable.
It does indeed take video. It takes video in 1280x720 HQ, 1280x720 HD, 640x480 and 320x240. The camera is a 16MP camera.
Yes it is! I have an sb600 and a D90 and it works really well!
Yes, it work with all flash that will fit in the shoe, you have to set the switches to work with one or two flashes. Try setting one first once you have that one working the second should be easy.
As far as I know, it works with any camera and flash that have hot shoe connections.
Yes it will. I am currently using this with my T2i and loving it
Yes it does
I have only used it with Paper by 53 on my iPad. I like it a lot, but have no experience with using it other programs. The tips wear out if you use a lot of pressure, so have extras on hand. EH, Cleveland, OH
Yes, it does. I had gotten 2AAA and 2AA rechargeable batteries
Long as you have a desktop pc with an available slot. Be warned though that this isnt ideal for pc gaming of thats what you plan to do. I barley got 20 fps on DayZ Standalone.
I have seen references to ATI Eyefinity software that is supposed to support three monitors from this card, but I have not installed that software, nor have I tried three monitors on the card I have ( two works well, and that's what I need personally ). Also, if you're forced to use a low profile card, you will only be able to see the hdmi and dvi ports with the lo profile adapter on the card.
Yes at http://365complexes.com in computers
Here are the key information from the adapter: AC/DC Adapter | Model: NSS18-090-2000U Input: 100-240V - 50-600Hz 450mA | Output: 9V-2000nA
I have not experienced this ..you should check your HDMI Connections on both ends.. try another cable....or if you are using Optical or Coax for sound....make sure your settings are correct on the PLAYER AND the Receiver.....usually it is something really simple that you are overlooking......worse case scenario you might have a bad board and you would have to call Onkyo...but maybe it's your DVD player....
As long as the device has the 30-pin dock connector it will. It also has a place for an auxiliary cable so you can connect your phone or other devices.
You will need an adapter
No timer but wonderful sound and it is awfully cute!
No
Yes it does. Make sure that you reconfigure your MagicJack headset option in the menu tab.
Using this lens with a nex is ludicrous. It would be like mounting a water heater onto a cereal box. This lens isn't cheaper, the nex lens is overpriced! Small cameras are marvels of engineering but they are an acquired and expensive taste.
Inside diameter 2 3/4" wide by 2 1/2 " deep. Both of my Phonak hearing aids, one packet of batteries and a packet of wax protectors fit in the case. Nice leather pouch.
Yes. You could use the standard plug for the phone or you could even plug the USB cable ino the adapter.
It is not that large, it will fit under the seat of an airplane and it is very confortable, at least for me.
This is a Chromebook and you can do anything on it that you can do on any other PC. BUT, don't buy it!!!! It's a piece of junk. I bought 5 and 4 were dead within a month (one upon receipt). If you want a Chromebook for about $250, buy the Samsung. The $250 PC's, such as Asus, are also crappy.
most anything you can load to a smart phone you can load to this. worked great for the short time i had it, just didn't have a words program which is what i needed.
See the manual, thank you
Yes
The rubber is not sticky, it's anti slip rubber
if you have the thick fabric chord like on the rat 7 it will not be easy but with a lot of work you can get it in there. If its a regular rubber chord it should work just fine.
It depends on your printer. With some printers, the generic driver that Windows installs will be fine. In many cases, however, you will need to install the manufacturer's print drivers, which usually provide more options, and are generally better. In almost all cases, these are found on the manufacturer's website.
No there are better choices
Totally!
I am not sure...I do not own the S4 or any other controller. I would imagine there is an S4 specific case you can purchase. Width wise it would fit, but if its any longer than a large laptop, it will probably not fit.
That depends on the temp. of the smoke. If its cooler, say 50deg. and there are warmer objects in or beyond the smoke, eg. 80 deg. +, then yes it can. In my experience with it, the ability to positively identify a heat source (man, animal, other) tops out at 75 to 90 yds. This imager is relatively cheap compared to others. You get what you pay for.
No, it weighs a couple of ounces at most and it's very poorly made, totally inaccurate. Don't waste your money!
Yes, it will fit any camera equipped with a standard flash hot-shoe, and that means virtually all dSLR cameras.
Useless gadget, dont buy it.
With what?

I installed them in a 2008 MacBook Pro model A1278 and the memory runs fine in that model.
No , it is not working that way You have to check your proper BUSS and buy proper one from Dell website , as far as I know these rams are optimised for MAC book pro regards
it does comes in a single box and would fit in large luggage.
Yes the Bluetooth will still work but the hidden tray is too small for the iPhone 6!
I believe it should also work with MAC, but the laptop I'm using runs Windows. Do check other reviews for this product, I remember seeing one review saying that it runs on MAC.
Yes I am using it on a 2011 15" MBP with a speck case. I do have to open the lid to insert the lock due to the case, but this is not an issue at all. I can't speak for the newer Retina MacBook Pros, you will have to look around to see if it will fit with that chassis. Pretty much every laptop chassis has a lock hole designed for these locks, but I do know that some laptops may cause some issues due to the shape of the laptop body etc. Hope this helps!
if the blackberry has an auxiliary (aka headphone connect )...then all u have to do is purchase the auxiliary ( red and white rca jack with the connection port on the blackberry ) which is basically the headphones port...
Yes!
You could reformat to fat 32, but the size limits of fat 32 are far below the full capacity of this hard drive, so you either have to have multiple partitions or use NTFS to have the full capacity. Fat 32 is much slower in some circumstances also. There are some details on the size limits on this page. Hope that was helpful. Troy http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc938432.aspx
Yes
Yes, this does come with the USB cable.
If it has USB it should but check with Toshiba to be 100% sure
If it used to, but doesn't, its probably broken and does it matter if on or off? If it never has, it is probably set up wrong. For apple, download free E version of "The Missing Manual" for your OS version (10.7 on) and worm your way to how to set up buttons, you can get all 5 to work
Yes, it comes with the 3.0 to mini USB cable
I have used it with Windows XP, Vista, 7, and 8.
approximately 5 feet; i just checked my modem cord and it is around 5 feet long
I personally contacted Marantz about this. They said that earlier runs of this unit were manufactured in Japan. When the earthquake happened in 2011, the unit was then assembled in China. However all the parts used in the manufacturing of the PM6004 were manufactured in Japan.
It should...it uses a standard USB port.
Yes it will
Hold down the main button (wheel) to access the menu.
Yes windows xp y windows 7
Don't know if it will fit the Sony Vaio 14, but it does have the power supply plug with the 2 circles next to each other.
I'm not Familuar with the model #. Main thing is voltage, amps, & if the plugs are the same. Hope this helps.
I'm not sure if it will fit your machine. I bought it to use with my old sony vaio laptop and it works just fine. If it doesn't work with yours amazon is very good about returns.
Yes. 100% compatible. I`ve one.
No
No unfortunately, you could however easily remove the button, or rig it to where it could not be pressed down with a drop of superglue.
I have reviewed the unit, the box, and instructional manual, and do not see the numbers you reference.. The label on the back of the keyboard does not specify any model number or any other identifying information. The box, however, does have a label on it, with the number X000DRBPUP, which may have been put on there by Amazon for inventory purposes. I hope this helps..
I'm not sure, sorry. Mine is the 2013 macair
not properly, it wouldn't snap on like the other one i had. looks like a manufacturing error. The fit it Ok but one push from the top part of the cover and its off.
My blue ones stays on after a snap, but I didn't like the keyboard cover, I don't use it
It's very hard to take it off, I had one before, it was like this one, I just took it off to change it for this new one. if you wanna change it for a new one, you can pull it hard. You may wanna do it just if you don't wanna it anymore or you wanna change it, because it might break on the corners. Good luck!!
I do not know I have Mac Air and it fits my Mac I love the rubberized cover
It will work anywhere, in-fact, the commonly available Open Boxes are Chinese clones of the original Russian design and the bulk of Open Box business is with the EU. Generally, they arrive from China with the European satellite list (not the North American). Being in the Bahamas, you should be able to receive at least some of the European satellites and probably some of the North Americans. Most likely, you will have to program or edit che satellite list. Regards.
I don't know, I have the 10.1 inch and purchased the keyboard separately.
To be honest I do not know
The At105 is a Thrive, so yes it is. However, the placements of the hold down tabs could be better. I had to modify mine so I could use the earphone jack without having to remove it from the case. Overall, not a bad case for the price.
Yes, parts and labor warranty is one year.
Yes
Did you google electric plugs for Tanzania ? That will tell you the correct plug or plugs.
NO! But..........If the Disc in question happens to be a SACD 'HyBrid' Disc, then it will play the 'CD' layer. On the Hoffman site a few guys said that their Marantz decks wouldn't read the CD layer of a HyBrid disc-my experience is the opposite. With both my 6004 and 5004 and 5001 decks, I haven't had ONE TIME where they would not properly read the HyBrid discs.
No.It is a single disc player.
For Botswana, yes: http://www.adaptelec.com/index.php?main_page=document_general_info&products_id=310 For Zambia, no: http://www.adaptelec.com/index.php?main_page=document_general_info&products_id=326
Will work in South Africa, that's where I used it,works great, no problem, don't know about Botswana
Yessir. I keep my old 12" in my bag but my wife's 17" fits as well.
Hi There, it won't. It comes with a 2.1A USB port for quick charging tablets iPad or Kindle, etc.. and Micro-USB, Mini-USB, old Apple connector.
No 3d
Yes that will fit the 18-105 Nikon lens
Hi Enrique, I wish I had a clear cur answer. I use some new lenses and some 'E" series lenses made by Nikon. The adapters are different on each. The E series lenses were made in the early 1980's and are a GREAT value however their mounts are different than the 18-55. Sorry I cannot be of more help. Maybe go the B&H photo and see if they have a close-up of your lens and compare that with the 18-55? Best, Haji Mahmood
My symptoms were not exact as well, the only thing that was working on my TV was the back light. I figured why not for 10 bucks. Have you looked at them, some of my caps were bloated and leaking so i figured that was the problem, still going to this day.
According to the apple website only up 1066MHz memory is supported (this is 1333MHz). My guess is that this memory would be able to scale down to be compatible. But no reason you wouldn't want to just get the 1066 version of this stick. http://www.amazon.com/Corsair-Certified-Laptop-Memory-CMSA4GX3M1A1066C7/dp/B00505EZYM/ref=pd_sim_e_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=173RV7STY9HW9QY0SP51
Don't have to replace stems. Are compatible with existing stems.
It can be set up to work on trailers and towed vehicles. I have it set up on a motorhome only
Japan from all I can find. I thought I saw it on the camera at some point. It is on the box and the extra lense I bought.
Make sure the MHz matches. If so it should be good to go. Otherwise call a local computer repair shop and ask
check your model. it starts with a##### then check compatibility with your mac and the ram. i think it should fit though mine is an early 2011 or late 2010 13inc mac
Our customer has been content using fingers only. As an elderly person who has a hard time holding a writing instrument for any length of time, the stylus would indeed challenge her as well. Sorry I couldn't answer your question about the use of the stylus.
The tolerances are very small on these; they are tight. Are you sure you are applying enough force? Additionally, are you sure you don't have M42 screw mount lenses? This adapter will not work with those lenses.
Yes
yes it will, I have a 4TB drive in mine now. People like Fred need to stop making comments on things they have not tested.
there is only 1 power switch for entire unit. No individual power switches for each drive
it can handle as many TB as you'd like but it's better to use the data than the USB. also very careful when you take out the drives. it's very fragile. hope this helps. cheers
Dear Haseeb, I see no reason it shouldn't work. I've paired this device with literally every machine I have at home. Works with Lenovo laptops as well as with Samsung Galaxy Tab. Even my HTC phone recognizes it. As the Sleekbook is a pretty recent machine, there should be no worries. If you're not convinced, though, find HP forums and ask a representative about this detail. :)
No. The coaxial port is for audio. It is not a video port. There is no way to plug your cable box into your laptop and use the screen to watch TV. You can get some sort of online streaming service through your cable provider to do that.
I don't understand the question.
From the pictures, it looks like a mini-USB, but I'm not 100% sure. It looks like the one labeled "mini" on this page: http://phandroid.com/2009/06/30/microusb-becomes-european-standard-in-2010/. It has the wiggly sides, and the top where the metal comes together also looks like the "mini" picture. I have no idea why they don't give the connector information in the product specs. Since I knew what my Tom Tom model was, I just picked a connector that was supposed to be compatible with it.
Yes it can and it is great sound. It also has blue tooth so you can use it with a computer.
No.... only the 4GB of memory
This plays in the order you copy and paste the mp3 into it. I don't believe it shuffles.
I am not sure if you can or not. I bought this for my son almost a year ago and he has loved it. It was being used non stop until recent when my youngest got angry threw and smashed it :(
It doesn't work for the stock flashes ie; the ones on the camera. You could get it to work, I'm sure, but it's DEFINITELY a hassle and not worth it. It works best with a flash that you buy and attach to your camera via the hot shoe. It has elastic, so it works with most sizes. Hope I helped!
I bought the one you asked about as well as the other one. This one was supposed to give added support for the wrist. I didn't find that to be the case, and in fact, it seemed to get in the way and feel uncomfortable. Plus, the screw at the bottom of the camera keeps getting loose. I love the other one that just wraps around the hand. It feels very secure and the screw stays tight.
Seems to work with any camera with a tripod mount and a neck strap ring.
Do you mean SLR? yes, I've used it on my T3I and my Rebel XT This strap uses the standard camera strap eyelet for the top and screws into the tripod mount (has tripod mount on the bottom, doesn't interfere). So as long as your camera accepts a strap and has a tripod mount, you should be in business. Still one of my favorite accessories.
I think so, there is a connection the back for a camera.
It may be defective. I plugged it into my Windows XP and it installed and worked. I also use it on my PS3 and it is perfect. Perfect microphone and sound quality is quite good. Try contacting Pyle about your issue. Sorry I could not help very much
No
Hello Kathryn, This cable never did work for me. I plugged it in and my laptop could not see the drive. Returning the cable was not an easy process so I just kept the cable. If your WD drive is less than a year old I'm sure if you called WD they would send you a free replacement if yours stopped working.
In my experience it does hold a charge. I have not had any issues. I have had it sit in a camera bag for 2 months and it was still fully charged.
It can either be charged by a USB port or by an Apple wall charger.
Hi TOMMIE, this Sony protective screen is not compatible with your A77 II. You may try checking on this model instead: PCK-LM14. Hope this helps. -Ely
Hi Judith, Sony PCKLM1EA Screen Protector is not compatible on the A77 Camera. -Vincent
Hi, approximate dimensions for this Sony LCD screen protector are 44.5 x 77 x 0.7mm (w/h/d). It will not fit into your Sony A7. Works only for Sony NEX and A3000. You may try to check on this: PCK-LM16. It works for Sony A7. -Ely
Look into the metabones speed poster for Nikon mount instead. An FX lens is for full frame so there is a crop factor. The metabones coverts your lens to FX and also increases you F stop by one.
It it a LA-EA2???? No it won't work on the new Sony A7r. Its full frame camera needs LA-EA4.ok
Sorry, I do not remember. I returned the unit as this was for outdoor purpose. However, you can easily connect it to a POE Router/switch if you have one at home and will not need its POE adapter. This seemed to be a good device, not for my use. IT will give you long range from point to point, not inside your house.
I have 4 lenses. They all fit. The depth is about 6-7in deep.
Yep. I have the Nex5r. Works great!
It appears to. See link and look under the "Compatible" tab. http://store.sony.com/electronic-viewfinder-zid27-FDAEV1S/cat-27-catid-All-Cameras-Alpha-NEX-Accessories
The viewfinder does not work unless it is snuggly and properly mounted, i.e. screwed into the connector on the camera. However I suggest user exercise care with camera when one is mounted.
Salty, I just looked up the one on ebay.it looks Like its just headphones ..... no box or paperwork ! Hope this helps, got it 4 u
No reason it shouldn't. Works with my android phone, windows phone, wifes ipad and my laptop. I dont have the Clip but as long as it has standard headphone jack (initial googling suggests it does) it should work
No, that would be the JVC HAFR6B.
Yes
Yes. The same nib works for the classic pen, grip pen and airbrush pen sold with the Intuos 4 and 5
While I don't have the Intuos Pro, I do believe they will work for it. I checked out the Wacom site for the Intuos Pro and it seems to accept standard replacement nibs.
Yes but on that flash at high power give them breathing time they will melt after a little while
Sorry, I only use the video function for my business. I've never used the slideshow function.
Yes. I have a MacBook Pro and no issues. It receives N wireless which is faster
The version I received was the WNDR4500 as of this week.
There are 4 ports plus the uplink port. You shouldn't have any problem - however, if you going to use the 4500 as a bridge, you're probably not going to get the 5G speed.
Go thru the start up program and select English
No. XZ1 is a fixed lens camera.
Hello, The Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 40-150mm f/4.0-5.6 R Lens is made in China under the Olympus Imaging Group. Its a great buy for the its price. It takes great pictures and I have no complains.
Yes, I have and it works fine.
yes you can attach the filter first to the lens then attach the flash to it
As far as I know it will. It comes with a number of adaptor rings for different size lenses so it should work. Measure your lens and read the sizes it fits in the ad.
Should work as a Master and trigger.
It's not described as used. Of course it does.
bought this battery here and sold again, had no complains
Satelite 845 on Toshiba site currently lists at $799 (on sale there for $699) I checked it out there and appears to be virtually identical to the description of this one on Amazon, with only the suffix of the model number altered. So based on that this really is a deal though the suggested "list" price of this one appears to be $100 higher than the like item normally sells for at the Toshiba sight. In other words you can get this one for approx. $100 less with this deal here today.
Yes it is compatible ..... you do need 2 usb ports available but an expansion hub can be purchased for under $10 if needed ..... I've used mine on 2 laptops running win 8 (32 and 64 versions) and both had no problems
Yes it is compatible with MAC OS; at least it says so in the product description. I am using it with a Samsung Laptop and it works very well&gt; note when I received it the instructions say that the unit doers not operate as well if plug into hub. What the product description does not tell you is that it requires two usb plugs to operate; I plug mine into a hub and it works fine. Bueno Suerte
Yes on both. You will just have to import it.
Thank you for your question. The inkling and sketchmanager software is not compatible with Paintshop.
It's about 24inches long.
Not really. I found it way to easy to fall over. And yes I have a galaxy note 10.1. I returned the keyboard and bought a Belkin case keyboard instead.
As long as your Tablet is no wider than 10.25" it will fit.
its about 3'x5' x5/8 not bad for a 1TB
Yes, it is a great little hard drive. I've had one for over a year and it works fantastic. It's small and easy to use. I have used it as a media drive too, and had 950+ gigs on it and I've had no problems. You won't be disappointed.
Yes that would work
4 ohms
yes........
It is one year. It is though Canon but you have to register though Canon. The cards are with the camera.
yes, both of the lenses have stabilizer..
The first thing is to determine if your Roku is a G radio or an N. This router may be set to WAP2 encryprion and AES networking. In the various forums people discuss getting N and older G devices to talk on the same networks. Some people have expressed changing the AES setting to another option, or being sure that WMM is enabled. Log onto the router and do a site survey to see what the router sees. Also see if your computer can see the signal. Are all devices in your network on the same channel number?
According to the Olympus support site, "This camera accepts SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards. It supports Eye-Fi cards for wireless image transfer. Olympus maintains lists of cards that have been tested and are known to be compatible with its digital cameras. To view lists of cards that are compatible with this camera, please click here." Here's the shortened link http://bit.ly/15dRgJR
battery, usb/wall charger, lens cap and lens cap lanyard, neck strap, brief instruction manual, software.
The screen is 14" diagonally or 12.25" wide and 7" tall. The case is 15.5" diagonally or 13.25" wide, 8.5" tall, and 0.25" thick. Looks just like the screen of a laptop. VERY COOL! Works great.
its a usb connection
No problem with the tab key, but it did take me a little while to figure out that I had to make some adjustments to the "Logitech Control Center" software for all my function keys to, well, FUNCTION. I ended up returning this keyboard because it does not have a caps lock light. I can't work that way, ended up constantly erasing stuff I had not meant to type in caps.
They sound great with no distortion. Has good mids (7/10), decent trebles (8/10) and heavy bass (10/10) although it might appear a bit too bassy for some but that's how I like my workout music. Overall I would rate sound quality 8/10.
That is what I used it for but you have to make sure your connector is on the correct size. Make sure the one you are replacing looks exactly like the one you are buying. Some of them have the connector in the middle and will not work if yours is on the right.
It's probably the same LCD, but on the off chance that there's some slight difference in the position of the connectors (for example) you might be better off with an LCD that's specifically listed for the G7-2291NR, e.g. Amazon # B00IYY1NVO among others.
I bought them for my wife and she loves them, no complaints about weight of headphones
One wire, siren plugs into main box.
According to the specs, no.
I purchased a TG 830 and that battery/charger set worked fine with the camera.
Some companies like Corsair use the designation 1.35v DDRL memory and others like Crucial do not use the designation L for 1.35v DDR3 memory. The memory is "low voltage" in both cases, but one company uses the designation "L" and the other does. The actual voltage of the memory is what is important and *all* 1.35v memory is low voltage. This 1.35v DDR3 memory is the new standard for Intel Haswell chips.
My Mac Air is A1466, and it didn't fit.
It works good. I'm not super picky but the screen keeps up nicely with pixel refresh.
It has faster write AND read speed.
outdoors with engine running.. I doubt it.. I'd also guess the vibration and the like might break it
Took mine about two hours the first time
No
Ipad2 yes! The13in will be too snug.
Yes... Once removed from mfr plastic packaging, smell dissipates after a couple days.
Effectively this question has already been answered in prior Q&A. It's good to read ALL the comments. Bottom line, as long as you are not drawing power via the cable.. only using for signal, you should be fine.
Dear William, Thank you for your question regarding our BlueRigger USB active extension cable! The active USB extension cable should work with your PS3 controller. Note that this cable will not charge devices plugged into it. Please contact us at service@bluerigger.com if you have any additional questions. Thanks, BlueRigger LLC service@bluerigger.com
There is nothing cleaner than fiber optic if your receiver is so equipped.
Mine didn't come with any additional information
Not sure if it's shielded, but I have installed the cable thru our t-bar ceiling in the office. Lots of lights there and other electrical cabling - and shows no form of degradation in the signal/display
It should carry 3d but I'm not certain. It does have audio return maximum diameter would be for the connector ends 3/4 - 1" we passed it through a wall with no problems.
No. It's standard HDMI
I don't kknow but I don't think it will stick any better on this camera than on mine!
If you have a 2"X2 3/4" or 3" diagonal view screen it will fit--- a ring glues to the camera then the shade attaches to that so if the ring or bezel fits the outside of the view screen the shade will fit
You should not need a booster unless you're over 100 ft, but if you see some signal loss than one signal booster should work for you, or you can always buy the 100ft hdmi with a signal booster already built in.
It is not rated to handle 4K, but it should have the bandwith. Great quality. You may want to try it and if it doesn't work Amazon usually has free returns.
Dear Customer, Thank you for your question regarding our BlueRigger 35ft HDMI cable! The cable should work just fine with your Samsung Galaxy S3, provided that you have Samsung's adapter connected to your phone. We would advise you to contact Samsung for the correct adapter needed in your connection. Please contact us at service@bluerigger.com if you have any additional questions. Thanks, BlueRigger LLC service@bluerigger.com
No
None that I can see
No, only DVI and VGA. But there are HDMI to DVI cables that fix that little hic-up.
It will work with any system as long as the connections plug in correctly to the phone and head set
Not at all. It is the wrost piece of crap you will ever purchase. I will have a VERY loud buzzing nosie that will overshadow your conversation with the other person on the line.
you would have to know if the female plug in hole is 2.5mm the male end on adapter is 3.5mm. I use it on a Samsung note 2 with a headset. hope this helps a little.
Yes it will.
I don't remember, but I've had it about 3 months and use it every day. No problems. It is good for basic computer needs. Email, facebook, youtube, surfing the web. Also very portable and good battery life.
I have not downloaded thoes games, but I have downloaded 100's of other games. I don't see any problem as long as you can find a site that has them.
Hi, The netbooks comes pre installed with WIFI. If you have WIFI at home, simply enter your WIFI password and connect easily to the web. Regards.
I just leave the charger plugged in and leave it on all the time. It's gaffa taped to the back of the mixer. Seems fine.
Yes, this device can be powered with any USB outlet. I use it with TV and use one of the USB slot on the TV to charge and transmit simultaneously without interference
the fan should come included in the box
Comes with the cords but no carrying case. I've used it in a fairly large room (200 people) and it worked GREAT! It's a great device at a decent price.
Hello! I have no idea. It was not a factor I worried about. I have 5 of these and have never had to have anything done to them. Except replacing the bulbs. I use them very often. 2 of them travel a lot and the others are hanging from the ceiling and used every week! Wish I could have had a better answer for you!
It will fit. The bag holds more than my carry on if you really pack it full. I put it under my seat on plane flights and it is normally pretty stuffed. I think the bag won't disapoint you.
It might be....I'm 6' and it covers from the top of my shoulders down to my hips.
Yes it does.... and the mount config is 100mm best regards
to the outside bezel it is 21.5". The screen real estate is ~20". I own 3 of them and use for Eyefinity. Total width is ~64.5". I run them in 6048x1080 resolution (Bezel Compensated). If you wanted Portrait Eyefinity the base on 1 monitor would be 12.75"; for all 3 - 38.25" (But this view better with 5 monitors)
Any Cat5 e cable can be used instead of the included 50ft cables. . I have made cables myself for this product in the past with no problem.
Yes
Maybe. The device has a standard RJ45 connector. But it will require some work to make it accessible through the internet (firewall, setup of client s/w).
No, it's not normal... Make sure that everything is plugged in correctly(power cord, aux cable, etc.). And make sure that you earphones and your music device are capable and functioning. If nothing works, contact Nuforce and tell them that you got a defective product and they will help you out.
The camileo x400 have got 3,5mm for external mic and mini usb for data synchronization to pc
I don't know, but it works fine in my 100' signal application. I'm not drawing power over Ethernet.
Yes, simply hold down the button on the controller for about 1-2 seconds and let go, but with mine I've notice that it doesn't stay locked for long especially with long exposer time lapse photos, for example: 30 second exposer over a period of an hour, it only took about 3-4 photos every time, I eventually had to babysit the shutter release and my camera to make sure it was actually taking the photos... It could be just mine that's defective... Still works great though!
Impact triggers should work just fine. If I remember correctly, the light came with a sync cord as well. Just connect the PC end to your receiver and the 1/4" end into the light, turn everything on and you're ready to go.
Yes! Works well with my 5DMII.
i dont undertand your question
No, I already returned the item to Amazon for refund. It did not have any HDMI output only a PC output. Took it locally to Best Buy and Tiger Mart and Fry's and they could not find any adaptor to connect to IPAD 4
My understanding is that it is not: however, they do provide the water resistant case. I have not tried it when actually raining and did notice that the camera got hot when it was on. I'd recommend calling them directly if you can get through.
The light should stay on. ..could be from a dead battery, make sure to take the battery out between using otherwise it will die really quickly.
no, the case needs to be removed to fit into the dock so both cannot be used simultaneously.
Hi William: If you need stable 12V power, you may consider our BP160 battery, which has 12V and 5V USB port. However, BP160 5V USB port maximum output is only 1A. Best regards. BiXNet
No case
They have v8 sound engines
Yes, the standard Canon warranty.
It doesn't accept batteries.
google the part # and installation instructions and you should be able to find a pdf for it. I believe 9ft radius on the coverage, but check out the installation info.
Hello Kirk. No its not by Sony. Are made in mexico and look preety simple. The original ones are very expensive, more than $200 on the sony website. I think for this price its ok this one.. only wish you luck i had to by twice. The first one didnt work. The second one still ok.. Regards
It is suppose to fit a kdf-e42a10 . Good luck, mine fit but didn't work.
Anything with a 1/4" hole.
Yes. I am looking at mine in a fender start as I type. :). It just points down at a slight angle. This isn't the smallest or the best in class but the price is right and used at home for light practice, it does the job for the price. Keep your expecatations low and you will be very happy. Good luck!
Should be located on the front of the camera, right below the D200. It's a round kind of plug.
Not directly. You need an external interval timer to do that. You could use this to trigger a multiple exposure, but not as an interval timer. You could hack it together with something like an Arduino to make it into an interval timer. Then you would set the camera up for multiple exposure and use your make shift interval timer to do this.
It was Mobee's own software with a license key. I do not have the exact name anymore because I have removed the software. I'm going for the Belkin YourType Bluetooth Wireless Keypad.
Are you sure you have pop-ups disabled?
Very easy. Back comes off with 3 screws and a snap cover. Metal cage pops off over ram. Be gentle.
I did the upgrade, which was very simple. In all honesty the process was simplified by MS and worked great. My only other comment is that the 'learning curve' for Win 8 itself was not as easy as all of the other upgrades. This new OS is so radically different, that you will in fact be forced to work at learning it.
There is about a 1 second gap between loops.
i do not know I have a canon ti3. there is plenty of extra room in the front for a larger lens
Yes,I tried it and it was no problem.
It doesn't have coaxial output. In my review, you know, I didn't like it and returned the player. I have a Sony now and like that player, but it doesn't have a coax output.
i don't remember the part number but the screen i bought fit perfectly and works fine with my Dell Inspiron 1545 as of now.
Select settings. Picture. Select Expert 1. Adjust your picture accordingly.
It does have bluetooth and plays audio books and is not internet capable. : )
It seems to hold my 13" macbook pro, so I'm guessing yes.
i'm sure it will. You may need an adapter faceplate that they sell for the dash. It may need a wire adapter also that will fit your mercury wiring plug and plug in the back of the sony. You can go to a best buy or car audio place and talk to the installer and check with him. I put mine in a 1999 dodge truck and it needed those adapters. Hope that helps
no the one i have is blue and that is the only color
Wish I could help you out but I don't have an iPod. I've only used the Link with my iPhone 4 &5.
Don't know. I always have it open.
You need to have a radio supporting bluetooth or an apps on your ipod or ipad for radio... I have the tuneinradio on my ipod which streams radio to the soundlink. However soundlink does not support native radio.
Maybe it does, i wouldn't know, i use a separate microphone then the one built into these headphones, and i also do not own dragon voice software
Yes, it comes with two mics. One large "gaming" boom mic and one smaller "mobile" mic. Sound quality on both is great for the price as well on computers and mobile hand sets.
Go into your computer settings to the output setting and make sure it is set to your headphones. Also, check the mic settings and check external mic (your headphones mic).
There is a mini USB only, no phono plug...
I never thought about using it this way. The plug is removeable so it looks like it might be possible. I have not tried it to confirm though.
You don't need to logon, unless you want to pay for movies to watch. If your new connect the box to your internet first. Then see if you can watch a youtube video or crackle is free too. To watch a paid movie view the movies and when you try to watch it will prompt you to create an account on a computer and credit card before you can
No audible click.
If you wait till after Sept (schools start), the price will drop as summer vacation is ended.
Yes
Apparently the Pacific Region Database does include Russia. I don't know how detailed it is, but Garmin Support (1 (866) 739-5687) should be able to tell you what is included.
I do not know. TSA and/or the airline will provide an answer.
No it doesn't come with rechargeable batteries. No need. But it comes with a USB cable for charging
Yes any Bluetooth device.... You'll like it and if your using the aux it's even louder
It have a Line-in port for use with other music players. You can connect your pc's audio card with the Gear4.
Hey Ahmed, Sorry for the confusion. The image is wrong for the black model on Amazon.com. It is not a docking speaker--it is Bluetooth only, so yes indeed it will work with the iPhone 5. If you look at the other colors, you'll see what the product looks like -- just imagine it in black. BTW-- I'm reporting the image issue to Amazon.
All phones will blutooth, not sure if you could dock it
I have run into the same exact issue. Has this been resolved?
No. It has a single VGA input only.
This device works to boost the radio station if it a little weak or if it drops somewhat it isn't a strong device. It will not help in hilly or vallys I only notice a little better reception when it is on. Hope this helps
Yes it does have a 1/4 - 20 female connection very handy, i hope this helps you.
It'll work with any camera that has a standard thread tripod socket. Note there is a male post at the top AND a female socket on the bottom. One of the handiest gadgets I've ever bought! If it only came in blue......
I wouldn't use it for a DSLR. For DSLR's, go for the SmoothShot Stabilizer. For a small camcorder then it'll be perfect in stabilizing shots.
If your camera is threaded for a tripod it will work. It's a little heavy but it's handy to have
If your camera has a tripod mount then yes
the trend's dimensions are 4.78 x 2.48 x 0.44 in. The holder is 4.5in x 3.0in x 1.5in. it may be a little tight but should fit since the trend's corners are not as long as the middle. I do not use it much because the plastic gives off too much glare and window is only 4.0in X 2.5in. not very visible even for my iPhone which has a small footprint than the trend.
Hello John, Thank you for your inquiry. The USA Gear Weatherproof Handlebar Mount GPS Case is currently the only Handlebar mount in this style we carry. Keep an eye on our storefront for new items! Sincerely, Accessory Genie Customer Service
It splits without deteriorating the signal. So there may be an amp in it but its not going to supplant the need for an amp
Yes
The Samsung Galaxy Tab HDTV adapter, part number EPL-3PHPEG, arrived today and is working fine with my 3 month old VIZIO TV and Galaxy Tab 7 Plus. You have to drag the (standard sized) HDMI cable and the power cable around with the tablet, but I expected that. There are a few lines cut off at the top and bottom of the screen. Other than that, so far the video looks pretty good. I don't have a netflix account. Is there somewhere I can get a free sample of high def streaming video to test that aspect?
No sure I have the a53e and it does work
I have had mine for 2 years now. And no problems what so ever. I had a local Sterio shop install and mine works perfectly.
Yes it does ! They show on the screen and its s mirror inage . Worked well for the price , a dab of silicon also makes it actually water proof
It didn't work at all for me, and there's no instructions on how to operate the extention wire.
I wear glasses and it is very comfortable.
These we're great as far as the noise cancellation. I really liked that you could turn it off and still listen to music (you can't with the bose). However, I returned them Klipsch because they were so tight on my head and gave me a headache. THey were also VERY heavy compared to the Bose.
Here is the response I received from Sennheiser: The product inside the box is the same so the only difference is that the "West" version is what we sell normally here in the US, and it has English as the main language on all materials and on the box. The "East" version has Chinese as the main language on all written materials and is meant for the Eastern markets, but the East versions are being sold at a discount now over here because they have overstock of them at the moment.
Nope
Very, very comfortable and not tight at all. Super light, but the build quality is very basic feeling. The don't feel like they would break easily because the plastic is flexible, but they feel a bit cheap. Biggest for me was that I'm not a fan of the sound signature and they are pretty inefficient
6 months so far. I use them about 2hrs a day for listening to music and video games. i don't see these breaking.
No
Yes, these could probably be used on a treadmill. I'm not sure how well the earcups will hold up to being sweated on, though.
not for left handed use try mionix avior
I wouldn't know, I used them in my camera. They do not have any raised power tabs so they may not work for you.
It came bundled with a camera bag, lens cleaning kit, 4 GB disk. The camera was new and worked as well as advertised.
this camera was made in Japan
If your asking if the camera is a genuine Canon then yes. I purchased my Canon Powershot I think from the same source - Beach Camera through Amazon - and it's been the best camera I've ever had.
I would say no because your battery is sealed in the chassis. The battery that you are looking at fits the Vaio S 15" and it is very specific to fitting the bottom of that laptop. I would suggest carrying your power cable with you in a laptop case.
Yes you can. I do it all of the time. Note that both batteries will top out at 80% and not 100% when using this method.
Yes
I seriously doubt! This sheet battery is made for s15 series only !
".mpg," ".mpeg," ".m2ts," ".mts" ".mkv," ".mp4," ".m4v," ".m2ts," ".mts" ".wmv," ".asf" ".avi"
Yes.
It comes with some strips, but I personally don't use them. I ended up coming up with my own idea to easily take it off and put it back on easily.
Yes, there is an HDMI port that enables you to watch any program on large screen TV. The 15.5 " screen isn't bad, but a 55" TV screen is awesome.
Lens length closed is 2.5" without lens cap Lens fully extended is 3.75" without lens cap It is 2.25" in diameter Lens glass is 1" in diameter Hope this was helpful.
If your laptop can be charged with 9 or 12 volts, and it draws no more than 4.5 amps while charging, then yes. However, I'm pretty certain that most laptops require around 18 volts for charging, maybe a chromebook could be charged with this guy, but I would need to check. If you want to post a link to your laptop I could tell you with certainty whether or not you can charge yours with it.
Hi Khris, Astro3 is compatible with your Samsung Galaxy 10.1 PT 7500, and the connector for Samsung Tablet is the same as for Apple. If you do not charge your samsung tablet, please check the outport. USB output port S is especially designed to accommodate the circuit design of the Samsung Galaxy Tab.
No
Yes. It comes with the standard 32 pin Apple connection, and the iPod is usable while on the deck. If the Apple device uses the newer lightning plug, then you can purchase an Apple adapter for about $20 here on Amazon that works well.
yes
Havent compared side by side. But the gallery g42 only has 3 speakers in it, the Atlantic has 7. No contest if you are looking for best surround sound in a sound bar, go with the Atlantic. Sounds great in my room with open rear wall.
I've got it hooked up in a 7.1 configuration using existing rears as back surround. If you use the right terminals on the speaker, it will combine drivers for you to set it up the way you need to- using existing surrounds.
The first answer is a bit off, because they did not consider the step down from the power supply at 12V to the USB slots at 5V. The power supply is 5A at 12V, or 60 watts. The 9 USB slots provide .9A each at 5V, for a total of 36.5 watts. Add the 2.1A at 5V for the charging slot, and you have a total of 36.5 + 10.5 = 47 watts. This is within the capability of the power supply. So, you should be able to deliver the full rated power to all of the slots simultaneously.
No, no mounting holes or anything. Flat surface on the back
I would fully expect it to. The Anker is a hub which simply allows more USB 3.0 input ports. I have used it for external hard drives, external hard drive docks, mice, trackballs, keyboards, USB cameras (for skype, etc.), usb flash drives, connecting my Droid cellphone and iPad Mini, all without any problems.
I'm sorry I misunderstood. I am using my siren with a transmitter an door sensor. I have mounted my siren 35ft from transmitter. I 'm not using the remote.
Hi K. Lange. It's approximately 1 1/2 inches deep and 3-4 inches wide.
I am not sure if you could get a replacement. You might try at HP help page: http://support.hp.com/gb-en/search?q=USB%20adapter%20for%20HP%20Wireless%20Elite%20Desktop%20v2%2C&filter=&product=5125146 Good luck.
This is not a phone... it is an air card
Probably not. They treat the data modems as if they were smartphones. Two year plan and all that plus charging extra if you are sharing with other devices.
They have an outer diffuser as well as an inner one, both attached by velcro.
That's what I have and It works fine.
No.
I'm not sure. I have my connected wirelesly to my HP Pavilion desktop computer. I used the included CD to do this.
yes is this.
NO! This camera has a seperate power cable which can be used to power the wireless lan capability. All camera operations require the separate power cable.
yes, thats what i use
It works with any receiver hooked up to it don't know bout high def
You need to ask Winegard for a definitive answer. If the Chinese satellites use the same polarization and frequency band as the CONUS satellites, it probably will.
Yep. The confusingly named Sony alpha a6000 works with the e mount lenses that were made for the nex line.
Best to ask Wolf Camera. As for warranty, I have several Sony lenses and several Sony cameras. Never had to use a warranty. Not that it can't happen.
I would say yes. It works like an easel. It has feet that objects sit on. I've used mine with tablets, smart phones, etc., and it works with everything I've tried.
no
I found this same problem! I have spent many hours on the phone with Cox and Belkin about this issue. Seriously, on the phone with Belkin support for three hours today. I'm not getting anywhere at all.
It should work with the Verizon FiOS receivers.
not sure but i think about two weeks we set up ours to record over when full
I am no tecky but what it means to us is we get over a weeks worth of video storage for the equipment
As long as you can connect an ethernet/lan cable from your router/modem to the device, yes.
This adapter is compatible for your laptop.
Yes
Dimensions are 18" wide x 16" from floor to top of bag. from floor to top of handles, it's 25". The bag expands to 8" inside when open. Weighs about 5 lbs. I get so many compliments on it because it is so unique and well made.
No, the wheels are not detachable. Even though I like the design and colors I wish I had paid attention to the dimensions, because this bag is very large and I doubt I will ever use it.
sorry not sure
I have a manfrotto (501) quick release on mine. It's screwed onto the 1/4-20 but then I have a QR plate onto my ball head. So I can pop it on and off when necessary. But if ur ball head has a 1/4-20 on it you can go directly to the slider carriage on the slider if you wanted. So, yes you can.....
Yes
I don't know if there are different versions. Mine fits perfectly for the Samsung Tablet 10.1. I bought one that didn't fit only to find out there are different Samsung products (the Tablet and the note). They aren't the same size, so it might be that. About the battery replacement being accessible. I don't see any way at all to replace battery.
If you already have a wireless network in your house, then you can use his adapter instead of running an ethernet cable from your router to a piece of equipment. You can attach this adapter to a TV, Blu-ray player or any other piece of electronics that has both an ethernet port and a USB port. When it is attached it will allow that piece of equipment to join your wireless network.
There are devices designed to do what you describe. They create a wireless video connection between your computer and the TV so whatever is displayed on your computer is displayed on the TV HOWEVER, this device does NOT do this. What you need is something like: Netgear PUSH2TV HD PTV2000 1080P Adapter for Wireless Display But be careful, there are compatibility issues to be carefully considered.
the connector is the same, should work together
I wouldn't buy it. I took a chance and wouldn't you know it only lasted a week or so. Not sure why these are failing so quickly but obviously Belkin doesn't care and thinks it's good for their brand to keep selling them.
The outer dimensions of the bag are 8" x 11". I don't think the bag could contain a file folder without having to bend the documents. I don't know the dimensions of your device, so I can't say if it would fit.
It would - but depends on book thickness. This bag doesn't have any 'give' to it .. It's fairly rigid and does not expand.
I run them with the D1 all the way up. I set the speaker volume quite loud when the computer is turned all the way up and then use the computer volume control to adjust the overall sound. This is not to say that other systems may not work as well or better. One could argue that the best setting is computer and D1 all the way up and use the speaker controls to adjust volume, but I find this inconvenient given the location of the computer and speakers in my office.
Yes, you need to buy an optical to RCA converter as I did... http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BVT4M30/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I use this charger for my Canon Power Shot SX40 HS which has a NB-10L 6.8 Wh (Li-on) battery.
This charger has a flip-out plug on the back, rather than a wire. Just put the battery in the box and plug it in to charge it.
I don't know...I'm still using XP. Sorry
If there are HDMI connections on the 3D tv's outputs I can't see why not. It doesn't really impact the video. It's a sound system.
It supports 110-240V.
Yes, it has a tripod mount. And there are cheap remotes for it. Once you get the remote go to drive mode and select remote. No setup needed outside of that!
It works with Canon eos 7d,I don't know with 5d
Yeah, I did. Keep in mind, though, that you'll probably not get 36 exposures out of this. This camera is very barebones, so there's no way to accurately keep track of what exposure you're even on.
Yes it will work with your camera, and your lens.
Yes, it does.
Yes, I use the Paul Buff trigger and receivers for my two or three canon 580exii and 430exll....
All Hasselblad lenses compatible to 500 / 2000 / 200 / 900 series bodies (C, C T*, and CF lenses) will fit on this adapter, leaf shutter lens or non-leaf shutter lens. The H-series lens will not fit this adapter
Yes it will control your aperture. But the reverse mount ring will connect your lens to the adapter and camera too if you wish
It doesn't have a quick release plate like a tripod head. It just has a screw that you use to screw directly into the tripod mount of your camera. On the other side it has a 1/4x20 mount that you could use to mount your own quick release plate.
I use it on a Manfrotto so it fit all standard tripods (I dont remember if it is 1/4 or 3/8"). I use it with a quick release plate.
My setup is the same. However, I am using a D5100, a DX body and an FX lens. I believe this is causing the problem. Are you using an FX body?
when you mount the lens on the camera backwards, you loose the original filter thread size as it is now attached to the camera side. the ring that takes the rear of the lens has an opening of 52mm so you need any filter, cap or hood ti be 52mm because you're attaching it to the adapter and not to the original filter thread on the lens.
No. U need to get an antenna for this model.
Fees depend on exactly WHAT you buy. If you buy a 7710LM, you'll get Lifetime Maps included in the price. If you buy a model 7710 WITHOUT the LM designation, you'll have to pay for map updates. The same should apply for the replacement 7720 model. You'd be a fool to buy a model without the LM designation. NOTE: I've found the 7710 to be EXTREMELY disappointing and can NOT recommend it. I'd be leery of the 7720 model myself.
Absolutely. They deliver plenty of clean power in the full range. I have no need to use an equalizer to balance the sound.
I dont think it would. Im pretty sure it dimension are just for the macbooks.
Thanks for your question. Sunbrite has their own mounts for these TVs. This is a fantastic sounding TV. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Sunbrite dealer.
It comes with a battery for the camera, not the flash, it takes 4 - AA batteries. Would suggest buying an extra battery for the camera. Orvill
Yes it does.
Frankly I Don't Know i am an owner but not a technician. 1 thing i do know is Because it is a Single Chip camera it cant capture the colors of the Fireworks like a 3 chip camera can. Happy 4th of July wenever ir comes
Yes, it comes with a strap
No. You have to upload to your computer first, then upload to FB.
No. It has 2x4gbmax ddr3 ports. ddr2 won't even fit, ive tried out of curiosity.
quad core all the e's and q's and pentium d 925 and up. I put a q6600 and over clocked it to 3.3 ghz and ran fine
If you asking can the gigabyte replace the HP motherboard, no a micro motherboard is bigger than a mini-itx.
The other person was wrong. You CAN'T use this for an iphone 5 without a lightning to 30 pin adapter. As I mentioned previously, the 30 pin connector that this product uses was superseded by the lightning connector. The select needs to update their description to reflect this.
I have had this cable for about a month and use it with the older iPod Classic. When I hit the forward arrow on my steering wheel (or on audio controls), the current song stops and a new one begins. Hope that helps.
it has several I/O connections on it. USB, 1/8" headset, 1/8" A/V out. If your headset uses any of these, it will work.
I find that the D800E does ever so slightly sharper images because of the elimination of the anti-aliasing filter. I've heard that this can lead to problems with moire, but I haven't found it to be a problem. If the extra bucks aren't a problem, I'd go with the 800e. (I own and use both.)
No, the cables are not easy to break. However, that is the only thing that we replaced about 3 months after purchasing. The price for the cable was minimal if you compare other models that have to be completely replaced if the cable goes bad because their cables are NOT replaceable. It is worth noting that my H.S. aged son is a HEAVY user of this product.
Sorry but I dont know.-
The camera offers 1x to 5x zoom at 16 Megapixel resolution, and allows you to manually "overzoom" up to 10x at reduced resolutions.
Sorry only red, company no longer manufactures this item. Vintage
I had trouble and had to return it. No.
I don't think it will fit any other camera. This is a 2 pc. set. The inner case is a wrap that screws on the bottom. It's specifically made for the curves and shape of the nikon1, where it's cut out to fit the lens and the screen. The outer layer snaps on the bottom of the inner case to cover the rest of the camera when not in use. That's useless if you can't use the inner case/wrap cause you wouldn't have anything to snap it onto.
Yes it should Yes the strap is pink and is the same material
Yes
I only know that it works great on my nikon 1 j. I'm not familiar with a J3. Sorry!
It is used as the "Home" button found on iOS devices. When connected to a MacBook Pro it does not have a default setting but if you use the Fn+"Home" key combination it will become the escape key you are looking for. Hope that helps.
Not here with me , but about 36" long
Yes, I have. There is no problem doing this as these drives are generic. However, the company I bought it from sent me one which appeared new (with new packaging) but tested as having thousands of hours of use on it. The test said it was working just fine but it wasn't a new device. I did not pursue the matter further as I did not intend to put this computer into daily use and it was not worth the hassle.
Unless you select "release shutter without lens" it will not work, as there is no electrical connection to the camera. Peaking will work
Although I have only owned the converter 2 months I have not experienced any problems with my Pentax lens. Yes it works.
Hi Matthew. I would recommend the Fractal Design Arc Midi R2. That is the case I had it in. There was enough room to clear the side panel without it touching when closed and it looked good through the smoked window.
It kind of looks like an sd card reader from the picture.
yes
you can but it is very low audio. i recommend anything other than this headset such as astro, etc.
No
Most likely not since it requires proper drivers to function. Its not 100% plug and play.
Sorry, I didn't see your question until now because it hit my spam folder. The backlit keyboard I have is is n5902, and the ones I have without the back-lighting are n5901. I really wanted to like the backlit one, but the touchpad just doesn't work nearly as well as the rollerball on the older model. Hope that still helps. Thanks! ~D
Good morning, I would call Anker, (800) 988-7973, or e-mail them, support@anker.com, and have them advise you. Kind regards, Michael.
It was a perfect match as far as fit. And I have had no issues with battery life or anything.
No. You can operate it with one finger except maybe for manually setting the time, but if you connect it to Wi Fi it can get the time automatically.
Suggest you, as quickly as possible, return the lens. I waited too long and was unable to do the return. The lens adds little, if anything, to your photos. It's a big hunk of glass that does next to nothing.
I looked around for you, but I don't think that they are really available. Might have to contact Samsung and have them fix it.
Not enough info about Windows 8, atm. But at first glance, I want this because I want to be able to access normal Windows 7 programs. For Windows 8, it appears that the tablet form (ARM) needs a special version of the app and these won't be necessarily the same as their x86/x64 counterparts. So, yeah...I think I'll save up for the Samsung. It has pretty much everything I need.
Yes
Yes it does.
If they're video files you have to convert them to amv files.Regular mp3 files can be placed on the player normally
No. The capture is done by software running on the PC in real time.
It should as long as it has a 12 volt system. It's a moderate challange if you don't have much electrical experience. Instructions are not too clear but once it's hooked up works well. Just be sure that if you try to hook it up on a late model vehicle,you check the fuse block for the accessory that will turn it off when your car is off. I hooked mine up wrong and it drained the battery after about a week. It took me a new battery and about 2 months to figure it out.
Yes. Can pick one up at Radio Shack, etc. I needed one for Mercedes Sprinter van. I think I bought about a 15 to 20 foot extention for what I needed. If you need more lenth, get a longer RCA cable or use an RCA coupler/s and a second or third cable to get to the lenth needed. Can use a single yellow RCA video cable if you can find one, or a pair red and white (or whatever color) audio RCA cable. Exactly same can use for video.
No---there is a wire that goes from your dash where the screen is to the camera mounted in the back of the vehicle. I mounted my camera in the back of my pickup to help me hook up my goose neck horse trailer.
That product is discontinued, but I believe it originally had a one year warranty. I seem to recollect that the company reserved the right to replace or repair.
Hello Amira I have the Epson 3010 projector and these glasses do not work with them. The Sony PS3 glasses do work on the projector tho so you may want to look there, the Epson glasses are too overpriced and I have been able to enjoy the projector with the Sony glasses without any sync problems.
CalDigit and OWC have certified Mac PCIe cards. I used a CalDigit USB 3.0 card in my 2010 Mac Pro that I sold when I bought a new '14 Mac Pro.
Can't say that I can help...the only time I've had color changes was when I changed them myself. I've had no problems with mine personally.
Depending on which model you have. I got this to use with my TF-701 and it did not fit, but I didn't know that until far beyond the return date. Please double check your model and compatibility, or get a replacement cable.
I don't believe so- it mainly locks for long exposures, fires the shutter, etc- I'd check with the manufacturer.
This cover RUINED my tablet. The latch pulled the tablet apart so that I can't access the headphone plug or the micro sd card. So whether it stands up is irrelevant..I strongly recommend you do not buy this case. I am still waiting a reply from the manufacturer regarding the damage to my galaxy tablet...so far not a word!
I don't know the answer to your question, Spencer. I am using the Brookstone Bluetooth Keyboard with an Apple iPad 2 (MC773LL/A) Tablet.
Yes
Yes per http://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/990FX%20Extreme3/?cat=CPU it is a compatible.
Yes this i have a gtx 780 on this motherboard works like it should no sli only crossfire
I recommend checking the HP web site to be sure. I don't know.
My radio does have an auxiliary button. It activates when I plug in the cable. 2007 car radio.
Fit was ok but defective. Tip and barrel wired common, making it MONO NOT STERO AS ADVERTISED.
I dont think you can loose by trying I took a shot in the dark and my tv works great and my tv had audio but no picture...Cant buy a new tv for the price of this repair!!
Nikon vs. Canon is a preference thing mostly. I was raised on Nikon (and Leica) so have lenses, and it just feels right. You may have a different background, or opinion, so get to a camera store and play with some. Also, Canon is better at video. I do stills mostly so do not care as much and prefer the way Nikon shoots stills, but that is important.
Hi Vahnesa, lexus makes two keys that look very similar but the only difference if the length of the key from the plastic housing. Measure the lent on the original key and see if it's the same as the length oft this particular aftermarket key.
No just plug it in and your Xbox will format it for you
The arm itself is about 8 inches...with the mounting plate it extents to 10
It may work depending on the size of the closet. It extends the TV about a foot from the wall.if the space isn't tight, it should work nicely.
I believe this kit is for that model... it's best to open the TV and compare the boards just to make sure...
Yes, it can connect with two mobile devices simultaneously. See also: http://www.motorola.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-Motorola_CA-EN-Site/default/Product-Show?pid=m-Motorola-Elite-Flip&cgid=accessories-headsets
Are your asking can you locally access the drive or remotely access it? If its on your home network it does not use the Internet. But if you want remote access from outside your house you need the Internet. The only problem I'm having is remote access. I'm on the second drive, first one replaced by Buffalo, and we cannot keep remote web access working!!!
Yes. My drive came with the usb 3.0 cable
No it will not be a problem. I believe the N indicates an extra bracket that fastens the hard drive to the laptop. It can easily be removed from the old hard drive and fasted to the new one.
Yes
To install, open the small door (mine is on the side in the back of the screen) and remove the old lamp by gently pulling it out...it is plugged in. Take the new lamp and install the same way you took the old one out...it will plug itself in. The Sony manual shows this...if you don't have one, you can download owner's manual online. Hope this helps.
There isn't one as far as I know. I think you have two choices - 1) use ETTL, or 2) guess the power in manual and review the histogram. I must say that I'm disappointed that they haven't published a fix for the manual / pre-flash problem, and I'm currently considering going back to PW because of this. However, if you want ETTL, they are great.
https://forums.motorola.com/posts/2d15d88e46 You can check out that forum...there are a lot of different answers out there and I don't know what's actually true. This watch is still great, and I would buy it again if I needed one. Mine still works great!
Yes, mine included 2 of them
My camera is a Roam 1600 and it fits just fine. According to Contour, this mount fits ALL Countour cameras
I have no idea. Tried these on tv movie and did not work well over year ago and they did not work. Threw away.
Four
Yes, if the card in question has the standard male Hirose U.FL connector surface-mounted on the card. I believe these adapters have the corresponding female connector at the end of the 3 "pigtail" cables.
yes! i have two pairs and i'm a 28 year old woman i still have room to expand them if i need to
They are long enough, my son is 5 years old and he loves them... I would have to measure them, but they the average length any earphones are.
Yes. I have five Sony SANS500 in five different rooms and I can play to all five at the same time. Please note, that all the speakers must be on the same wifi network.
Yes and works well.
As per the item title, it will fit the following Kindles, depending on the variation you buy: &gt; Kindle Fire 2013 HD 7" / HDX 7" / HDX 8.9" / 2012 HD 7" / 2012 Fire 7"
I would say it's the vegan synthetic leather. I have a leather cover also and it's not as soft as it but for the price it's a great deal. It doesn't look or feel cheap either! :)
no of course not
It came with mike holder, battery, cables, charger, CD with SW, ...
No it will not, fastest frame speed is 60fps.
No.
Didn't care for it, camera hole doesn't line up and the strap broke after two days.
I use it primarily for over the air digital TV, but I am sure it would work for FM too....hope this helps....Frank.
Yes
As long as it has a aux. input it should. Be careful though, the part that plugs into your iPod is pretty fragile.
It should work with an adapter, but not out of the box
Yes when on you see no finger prints but when you turn off you will see them. Do not hesitate to get. It is a great product. I had a bad experience with a cheaper version and got this one and love it.
I would have to say yes. only because I've never had problems with glare but have always had the protector on my screen. I've never tried it with out it. i would bet it again.
Hello Jimmy, This is for iPod, iPhone and iPad only.
From what I read the amp is pretty good as well and could handle phones up to the HD650, which are 300 ohms I believe,. The DT 880s come in 32, 250 and 600 ohms models. So depending upon your model, the 600 Ohms would work, but would push the perfomance a bit. Some people with 600ohms headphones would still buy the Fostex for portability, and then might have a desktop amp at home. The opinion i gave is a uer's experience in the Head-Fi forum.
no
same item
I don't think so, no. The Mac Pro 1,1 takes 667 MHz memory, this is 800 MHz, and I don't believe there is backwards compatibility. You can check (and buy RAM) here - http://eshop.macsales.com/shop/memory/Mac-Pro-Memory
Hi Gwendolyn, We are designing a "universal" SwingHolder that work with all tablet computers and e-book readers, including the Kindle Fire. The "universal" SwingHolder should be on sale in late February or early March 2013. Regards, Marty Springer, President, Stand For Stuff, (800) 456-8629, http://www.standforstuff.com
Yes, the base has pre-drilled mounting holes. 4 screws are also provided, no need to purchase separate mounting brackets.
It will work, but it will also drag down the connection speed of attached devices since they will only be able to operate at 'G' speeds. You'll want to find one of the newer modules that support 802.11n if you don't want to affect other devices on the same wifi network (media streamers, Apple TVs, netflix, etc).
they are 3 1/2 x 4 inches. My ears fit nicely inside the cushion. Very comfortable.
YES.
No, the TT does not have any voltage converter switch so you may need to buy a step down voltage convertor, there are many brands you may consider. hope you enjoy this or any other TT and your vinyl collection. good luck
If the cable is attached to the TV's HDMI port, and the RCA connectors are attached to the converter box's connectors, then it may work, if the convertor box converts the signal from analog to digital. On the other hand, if the cable is attached to your computer's HDMI port, and the cables' RCA connectors are attached to the convertor box (which converts the signal from digital to analog), and the convertor box is attached to your TV by way of another cable & input source, then it may work. What are you trying to accomplish?
It should yes.
I think it could work Since both need mirco USB 2.0
If it has a micro usb port it should. Same port thats on many smartphones.
It seems to have enough for me. Only thing I do is, I put a legal pad in the back of the case. The pad just adds a little more shock support, and you never know when the pad might be needed. As for the front side there seems to have more than enough. Do hope this helps.
Hi, My son's laptop is 15.6" and he says it's snug in this case so I would not recommend it for a17" laptop. Hope this helps!
Absolutely- that is what I have and it is a perfect fit. This is a great case with enough room for my kindle, power cord and other accessories. I have been very happy with this case and recommend it.
No. The case is a very snug fit, no room for anything extra.
On the audiorider u300 there is a small place to plug it in on the bottom left side (left if you are sitting on the bike).
They were originally released from Dell with Windows Vista preinstalled, my refurbished m4400 came with Windows 7 installed.
As long as the back up battery is good, it's automatic. It even changes for DST by itself.
The base station would not work upon arrival. I returned the complete system
External brick, switching power supply, 100-240V, 50-60 hz.
Yeah I think so.
No. This comes with a DisplayPort connector and not an HDMI connector.
this cable connects to a special port called DisplayPort usually found on HP computers.I don't know if your all-in-one has just kind of port
No just tv
mine never worked so I returned.
Yes

Uh I hate to start an argument, but I'm typing this response on this monitor right now, and I assure you it does tilt. It's not that cheap. I don't have a protractor on me, but mine tilts about 5 degrees forward and about 10 back from vertical. 4 to 5 inches of travel in total for the top of the screen. No swivel though.
Not really sure. Under the display's menu selections there is a "gaming" mode. When I pull up the display info in settings, this is what I see, but I'm only connected via VGA not DVI: 1920x1080, 68KHZ 60Hz, VS239H. Hope that helps.
Yes
Mine did come with cables.
It is for the 4th generation Kindle (no keyboard). If you are not sure which gen you have, look in your Kindle settings. Also your Kindle manager on amazon.com can tell you what gen you have.
I find the speed to be acceptable in conjunction with good broadband width.
I have 2 of these units and both were easy to assemble, maybe the plastic fingers that fit together may have a bur or possibly the plastic did not mold correctly, good luck !
Most likely, it has multiple holes for different tv's.
This unit uses square rods, with built on hooks, bolted to the TV. The rods which bolt on to the back of the TV in a vertical position are 17 inches long with a multitude of holes and slots for mounting to the TV. The hooks "hang" on the formed mounting plate which is 43 inches wide. Screws on the mounting rods lock the TV to the mounting plate.
I don't know about board books. These are great for most kids' toys. That is actually what I bought them for. They are smaller in diameter than a dime, if that helps any!
that cpu is actually socket AM2+, it is still compatible with this motherboard, no issues
Either will work. The top has mounting holes for both 120mm and 200mm. Honestly, though, I'd recommend the 200mm fan. The bigger the fan, the more air it moves, AND the quieter it is.
Yes.
Yes it works well. I use it all the time.
Hey David - these AP's will intelligently switch to the strongest AP seamlessly. I installed 3 at my office and they hand-off devices to each other perfectly.
Yes, the POE injector is the power supply. It plugs into the wall with a standard 3 prong North American plug. It also has two Ethernet ports. One is connected to the router/switch/hub and the other is connected to the Access Point. This is important to remember because you need extra cables.
A Ubiquity ToughSwitch, yes. But not a standard 802.3af PoE switch . UniFi APs are not 802.3af compatible. There is a Passive PoE to 802.3af Adapter available from Ubiquity.
The older models of this tablet do not, but the new models do, which you have questioned about. http://www.samsung.com/us/business/computing/tablet-pcs/XE700T1C-HA1US
You can use with batteries or use a power cord included with it
No, no options on the amp/unit. You can only number your tracks on the USB to control the order. I cant comment on an mp3 player as ive only used the USB.
It wont turn on because you wasted your money on it. That tablet gave my son so much problems. I would get a refund and buy something else.
It might if you get the adapter from the old iphone/ipad connector to the new one, but I have no confirmation on that.
My 15" is a 2009. I think it should fit. :)
No. That case is for a non-retina macbook
30 days, did someone drop it or miss manage it because i have a year and no problem so far.
They come with a soft fabric carrying pouch, but they do not include any sort of hard case.
Yes, that's what I have and it fit perfectly. :)
Yes. I have a 15 inch. It fits and I can open and shut it all the way! I love it! Keeps my computer protected!
Absolutely, YES
Check the filter size of your lens , buy an adapter from your filter size to 58mm example 67 to 58mm filter adapter and you're set :]
Yes they do. A nice draw string bag. Very nice earbuds.
Where I could buy for less than 3,000.00? Luis
Yes it is !!!
Yes!! It will work with the SONY XAV 701HD . I Have that head unit and this bypass works as it should. Highly recommend it :)
Yup. It's port VLAN, so all devices connecting through the same port are in the same VLAN and would see each other. However devices on a different port on the load balancer will not be seen.
Should be hot swappable in the NAS
I did not keep the unit so I cannot answer the question. Sorry
I think the speaker was create to play in small enclosure area and sofar it is working for me. It base add a great sound and clarity when playing. In terms of volume it delivery the necessary to play in small areas.
Yes!
it perfectly fit my nexus 7 32g
The top just fits on top of the center brace/post does not securely attach. It's good for setting a laptop on but may tip and come off the center brace/post if you rest your arm on one side.
It's not so much an issue with the CPU, I think what you meant to ask is will it work with your motherboard.
The colors are lighter toward the center. It is a beautiful back drop that we are happy to have purchased for in-house photos in our church.
Yes, the LED Pico has a headphones out jack. http://www.aaxatech.com/products/led_pico_pocket_projector.html
Yes
No. My daughter is skinny 14 and is too big for her
No, But the Pro Fit Deluxe version does
It does not. I tried using it for that purpose but apparently any inputs that come from the output line (such as a mic or volume control on the headphones) does not get fed back to the input.
I saw your question and removed the speakers that were connected to the output jack and plugged in a headset... worked perfectly.
My laptop was N5030, not N5010 The 9-cells replacement battery(claimed to be compatible with N5030 as well) turned out to be too big for my N5010. After I had inserted the battery into the laptop, my laptop could not be flipped open. I had to ship the batter back to the seller at my own expense and order a 6-cell replacement from another vendor.
After 2 to 4 weeks your dell rejects the battery and it is it late to return. . I bought 2 and am stuck
yes. the 3d blu-ray discs use the same type of discs as regular. they are regularly shipped on bd-50s (aka dual layer) which this drive can burn.
There are no threads on the outside to hold a lens cap. I don't leave mine on the camera when transporting it, so that's not an issue for me.
Im not aure about it since only the "5250" Its listed on the description, if i were you, i would try with this one, which is fully compatible: http://www.amazon.com/Battpit-Notebook-Battery-Replacement-5250-BZ853/dp/B007EN9FYS/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1427315218&sr=1-2&keywords=Battery+acer+5250-BZ853
I have used a 16GB card with my 16.0 MP camera, Now looking for a service center to remove spots on lens - as the spots show up in printed pictures. I really wonder just how any spots got on the lens as it closes and opens as it should when powered on or off. ANY suggestions for a Service Center?
I'm so sorry but I can't answer the question truthfully simply because I don't know -- love it as a camera though. Fits perfectly in a pocket. Easy to use but whether as a webcam -- don't know -- sorry.
The camera can be set up for repair at the below link. www.panasonic.com/repair
Mine was doing the same. I found that the curtain was rubbing on the part of the camera in front of it. I could see that face was slightly pushed in, rubbing on the lens protectors when they tried to move. I was able to use my fingernail and pull the face out and now the protectors move freely.
I have not noticed any particular vibration problem. I have it in my bedroom with a flat screen sitting on top of it.
You can connect it to the RCA (red/white) on the back of your TV (cable is supplied).
Nope. You need the service to get program data daily along with updates to the service.
This unit can be used as one of the many units to set up a similar setup to the Verizon Fios multi-room VCR. You can record a show on one Tivo and watch it on another. They just have to be connected via intranet (all be on the same network).
Yes, perfectly. It is what I am using.
There are directions included to monitor via mobile devices. yes, you will need an internet connection and yes, it is in real time.
No it's in settings, am out of town right now, will get back to you in about 2 days
Jeremie this should work fine for you.
Yes...I bought one for a replacement and it works great. Thanks.
Yes it does work perfectly and you might install an app called nexus media player or the index files to view whats in the card
30 Pin. And it works great!
So far I've played Navy Field, Star Craft 2, Perfect World International, War Thunder on it and it does not have the best graphic card, a decent card. Upgrade if you're that crazy, Im not a full time gamer.
Hi. If your system supports an internal 3.5 inch hard drive slot and supports SATA 2 or SATA 3 connection, then yes this can be used in your system.
That is possible. Mine works fine without freezing.
I do on some occasions. I push or twist the "plug" on the headphones and then the sound comes in louder.
no, the FT1 mount adapter allows NIKKOR F mount lenses to be used with Nikon 1 cameras equipped with a Nikon 1 mount. Not applicable with a d7100 as F mount is standard.
My 18-200 lens from my old D 90 works well, with auto focus working quite well. The auto mode doesn't work but the "P" and other modes are fine
doesn't look like it. I can't find it in the original box. It's a very good lens though, since it's the only thing to survive being run over by a car, though the hood was crushed. I've used this brand for other cameras, and trust it.
Not sure what you are asking. These are excellent earphones. They fit in the ear and block out noise. I use this with my MacBook Pro and watch videos or TV from EyeTV or use them with my iPad. They are great.
I'm not sure -- sorry I'm of no help!
Yes it will as long as your vehicle has the remote starting feature
I have never used it. According to a review I read, it doesn't support ttl pass-thru for canon, only for nikon and sony.
You have to use an iphone or ipod. you cannot get the android to work as an external device. i have called pioneer and they say they have no planes to expand native beyond VTuner. Other than this major shortcoming(which if you read there writeup its somewhat confusing on if they have the native capability) its a decent device. dont think i would have purchased it though had i known this.
Manufacturer's warranty period is one year.
No. you need to buy a Lightning to 30-pin Adapter.
It appears this card will work in your Tablet. The specifications indicate that it will accept a MicroSD card, so there's no reason this won't work.
Any Micro SD card will do, you don't need to limit yourself to the Samsung brand. The Galaxy S3 will hold up to a 64gb card. You'll just want to think about how much music and video you need to store. Keep in mind these memory cards are rated by their speed class. Currently, the highest class is 10. It really does make a difference when transferring data to and from the card.
Yes!!! in the three models 7, 8 and 10.1, because they have microsd slot. The number ten is the highest speed of reading, writing
Nope I have 55'' HD
I believe so
I mounted a Vizio 55". Good unit. Don't know about Sony. It should work.
It would be 140 Watts the picoPSU is capable of 160 watts max and using a lower wattage adapter decreases the wattage.
Yes, but the LED still needs 12v
I used a multimeter and ohm'ed in between the pins, while pushing the button to determine the pinout - if you need me to check it out for you, please let me know
That's not something I have tried. I use this with MisterHouse software running on a Linux PC. I had to get Girder software to learn the codes from the remotes. There is a web site: http://www.usbuirt.com/. It lists many applications this does work with. Veralite is not shown. Several of the packages are open source software so if you are a software developer, you could figure out how to control the devise and that might help with Veralite. You can also email support and the developer will respond.
I personally don't own a mac but doing a search on the forums i found this: http://www.usbuirt.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=749&highlight=mac Hopefully it helps.
Mine came with a pen/stylus holder along the side.
I don't believe there was one. I did not keep the protector as it wasn't protection enough for me. Kip
So far we just have the "360 Degree Rotating Case for Apple iPad 5 Air", this one does not have a detachable design. Here is the link for your reference: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FIZXM8E/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me=&seller=
Mine didn't charge at all. I don't know if it would or not
Well, the battery does work above zero & it was cheap. Not a factory standard but it could be that my laptop lived with zero Power so long that it's the computer glitch not the replacement. Who knows!
I needed one for my dv7-2043d and this one fit just fine and works great
Nothing is covered. I had the same problem. It is a worthless piece of electronics.
Well I've been using my laptop a lot more now that I have a battery that works, and I haven't had any issues at all...And I've had my Dell for years... Could be just an ill-timed hardware malfunction, maybe...
It fits but it's not going to be flash on the back the battery it little bit more biger, hope the answer help you with the desition
Not sure, but battery has been in daily use with NO problems. It is larger than the original as in "extended."
I'm not sure is my best answer. I forgot how I figured out that it would work with my HP. I think there's a chart on the vendor's web site. Sorry I can't offer any more help than that. I do like the battery if that helps. Thanks
Hello, This battery is compatible with HP Pavillion DV7 6135 dx? Regards
Hello Edgar, Thank you for your inquiry and for your interest in shopping with us. We're glad to assist you. Please know that we offer free shipping within the US. Regards, Glaiza
Yes. 100-240VAC, 50/60 Hz, 0.8A
Due to its unique spring design, this docking station holds both your 2.5" and 3.5" HDD or SSD firmly in place. In short, yes it does.
Yes, I have Anker's USB3.0 attached to Dell XPS 8500/8700 systems that use the usb3xhc driver, and have had no problems at all.
yes you can use it because i am use it with AMD Radeon HD 6700 so it will work with 7770 with no problem
yes it does and the stock fan has thermal grease on it ready to be installed
AMPED says it works with most routers; it worked with mine a Motorola SURFboard SBG6580. Best bet is to call or email AMPED about your router. Before I purchased the SR10000 from AMPED I emailed them a question and got a response same day.
I have this unit wrks great up to 75 ft. From the input source..so 8 repeated it with a second unit to cover the other 75 ft. They have a step up from this one. I'm thinking about upgrading
The R10000 draws 1 Watt of power.
I have no issues with Blue Ray discs. The Bar is audio and not affected by visual media anyway.
Keyholes in back of unit, template included, use a #10 panhead screw. Also has two brackets for sitting on shelf (which is what I did, right on top of my cable box). HDMI yes. 180 watts (way more than enough for my 20'x30' den). Good clear bass, not overpowering...
Yes, it's all compatible,matter of fact you'll be able to overclock your system will with the included cooling unit or move up to the Corsair H100 cooling system for even more efficiency
Hi Mac. My friend, I dont know.
First of all make sure it is turned on. Very small slide switch on side of keyboard. Once it is turned on press the button on frame which is a blue light on mine indicating it is communicating to your tab by blinking. You then have to go to the your Tab - Settings and find the Lanuage Input icon for it to look for the keyboard to have your Tab recognize another keyboard. Also, as below, make sure your bluetooth is on
I've never tried both at the same time, but as fast as it is sequentially won't take long. My husband shoots with a D3 Nikon and it only takes a couple of minutes at most to upload 900 pictures. I really like using it as the speed is triple the others I have used.
Yup works great with all my canons including t3i. The real issue is your lens, since I had some longer lenses I also bought some longer rails (also from amazon:)). Get some 12 inch rails too since these are 8 or 10 when I bought them. Also be gentle with the tightening knobs, they will strip out cause they are cheap plastic but worth the price....just carry your leatherman at all times.
Yes it will work fine, but it probably won't last very long. I had to replace mine after a couple of weeks, it stopped working.
It certainly should fit snugly. They are made to clutch the phone to within millimeters. I would report it to ollo clip as a defect. See if they'll cover it.
Depending on how you place it on the i-phone, it provides you with a fish-eye lens, a macro lens or a wide-angle lens. I use it mostly for the macro, which lets me take great, detailed pictures of things like insects and flowers or details of art. You literally have to have the camera within an inch of the subject, so you either need incredibly steady hands, or get a stand for it. Also it's a very shallow depth of field, but that's the deal with macro lenses - especially when they're this inexpensive.
I am not sure. I have an iPod touch with a rounded back that resembles the iPhone 3 and 3GS and it works on that iPod touch, but I'm not sure what version of iPod touch it is. I also have an iPhone 4 and 4s which both have the flat, glass back and the Olloclip works on both of those. I think if your iPod touch 4 has a rounded OR flat back it should work. To protect yourself in case I am wrong make sure the seller will accept returns.
I don't know I can't use it because it doesn't fit my phone properly because I have a case on the phone
I have a iPhone 5 with an Incipio case. The Olloclip fit seems just right...not too tight or too lose. The other adaptor is for iPod touchs and iPhones with the curved edges. I don't think you will ever be able to use it with an iPhone 5s.
Not sure what you mean by shielded but the cable has a rubber cover. Hope this helps.
Yes. I7,ssd HD win7 Thanks
It's a dual core i7. It's the top-of-the-line dual core for its generation.
It has an optical drive, but I am not sure about hdmi.
No you cannot. That pen is only programmed to work on the scribe or jetstream tablets. You can purchase any TOUCHSCREEN stylus though.
Sounds damaged. Needs repair. Or duct tape.
Yes, I believe it can but not all win-7 functionality is available with the touch-screen keyboard...better call Sansung tech support.
YES,it has a second plastic ground prong to help hold it in place with a double outlet and you can just clip or break it off and it will work fine in a single outlet.
going to necro this question but i would go around 750 and older to be safe
The band rests on top of the ears and there is enough pressure to keep the pads pressed against the ears, with probably more pressure for bigger heads. I use these daily for work for video conferencing and love them.
Yes, it is for a MAC also.
It works with USB 2 and USB 3
These will work on Olympus Tough TG-2 with the CLA-T01 Conversion Lens Adapter. The Lens Adapter provides the 40.5mm threads needed to mount these filters.
Open is 8.5" x 6.375", Closed is 3.25" x 6.375". Keep in mind that it is a soft case and you could "scrunch" it up when closing to make it a little narrower if needed.
I have a pair of these and I love them. The jack is at a 45 degree angle (never saw that before). I use them with my computer, my LG smartphone and my Acer tablet. All work the same. For the best sound, follow the suggestion for burning in the drivers.
I use them with my laptop daily. Works well on minimizing outside noise also, so you can concentrate on what you are doing.
I love the sound of these buds when they stay sealed. Unfortunately, I cannot for the life of me keep them in my ears unless I am sitting still, despite the different sized tips that come with them. I think its because these buds are so light, and the cord is weighty, that any sort of minor agitation tends to yank them out of my ears. I've tried the clip, over the ears, etc. Nothing works. So its back to my Klipsch S4s for now.
No
I have Windows 8.1 right now and it works for unlocking my laptop when it is asleep and when it is starting up at the welcome screen.
Yes
Once the reader is properly setup (I am not sure how exactly the proper setup is done), reading part works like a charm. Tricky part is the installation. You MUST follow the steps (DO NOT ATTACH the device to your machine before the driver and finger print management application) or you could get your reader NOT recognized by the OS. I used the driver download link from http://www.zvetcobiometrics.com/Products/P2000/overview.php.
I'm sure it will.
I can't tell for sure the right speed,but is way better quality and faster than the other ones,like sony,lg and the other cheap ones.
Yes, it has a BNC Composite input as well as BNC component inputs for Y, Pb, and Pr. I would recommend buying female RCA to male BNC adapters to connect to the back of the monitor on the respective connections. Very important that you get the male/female right. Again, it's female RCA to male BNC.
It sounds like you may have had the same issue I had. I took it to a camera shop and all this guy did was push a few buttons on the HDMI and waited then the image popped up. So the key is fiddle with it and wait I guess.
It has frame guides but I don't know what they are. No information on them so I don't use them. Sorry I can't be more helpful.
No it does not. It comes with a ball swivel mount and a power cable. It also includes a couple of battery pack adapters but no batteries, and it does not take standard "AA" or "AAA" batteries. Also, I know you didn't ask, but the screen resolution at best appears to be 480i and the included shades are a MUST just to see the screen. All and all it is worth what you pay for it.
Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately, we are unable to ship outside of of the United States. Please let us know if you have any other questions!
I've never had that problem.
I don't have an Alienware MX but the sleeve measures 19 3/8 inch by 13 5/8 inch and its 22 inches from corner to corner and the material does stretch it's much bigger than my Asus G75 so I put my brick with the laptop to compensate.
It is powered by USB from your computer
i wonder if it would even work like that. honestly i haven't tried so hard to tell.
120hz standard, but 240hz enhanced. Excellent picture, I leave it at 120hz for most viewing; I have not found a need to switch to 240hz. Granted, I did check it out at 240 but find 120 is better for regular shows/movies. Haven't watched football yet... we'll see ;-)
Being a pretty basic tripod, it's weight abilities are limited. I have a Sony Nex3 camera and when using it with a 55-210 lens I had to tighten down the swiveling head clamps really tight to get it to hold it. Even then it was subject to some drooping I had to account for.
Yea it is a laptop atand
It's good on a hard surface. Not strong enough for your lap.
It is worth its price. It's not super sturdy at all. It works well for light weight camera and i would not recommend it if you will use it with a professional camera. However, since it is not super sturdy, it's pretty lightweight and easy to be carried around. It all depends on what kind of camera you are using it with.
Alpha is the family of digital cameras, the flagship of Sony cameras. Nex-7 is the specific model of the camera. So the exact name of this camera is the Sony Alpha Nex-7. Hope that clarifies.
Thank you for contacting Parts Express. Please supply your Amazon order number and I will be able to look into this for you. Kind regards, Joetta Smith, Customer Service Team
I wouldn't recommend it. The arm is pretty strong, but since you are using it on a treadmill the vibration plus the weight of the tablet might bring the arm down. If you find a flat surface next to your treadmill you might have better luck.
This rig holds anything. I use my t2i. If you are looking for a quick rig that fits underneath your car seat, this is for you.
You need what Crosley calls the NP-5 needle. You can find it here: http://www.amazon.com/Crosley-NP5-Replacement-Needle/dp/B00BMFY8GY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1377881711&sr=8-1&keywords=crosley+np5.

The dimensions of this power supply are the same for the S3910T and has the same connectors. The mounting screw locations also appear to be the same.
2700 is replacement for discontinued 2607, adds cell phone feature
Mine is a 13 so I don't know. Sorry!
No it will not.
Yes it works with Nikon D5
Yes indeed. Works for Sony HDR-CX220 HDR-CX230 HDR-CX260V HDR-CX290 HDR-CX380 HDR-CX430V HDR-CX580V HDR-CX760V HDR-PJ230 HDR-PJ260V HDR-PJ380 HDR-PJ430V HDR-PJ580V HDR-PJ650V HDR-PJ710V HDR-PJ760V HDR-PV790V HDR-TD30V. I am very happy with these batteries!! Last long and dependable!! Hope this will help answer your question. Take care!!
if it is for HDR-CX220, compatible V series battery, also compatible with HDR-CX550, the two V series cameras use batteries, Opteka these batteries work great and are long lasting.
They are just 3D monitors meaning they are currently compatible with passive 3d glasses. They are not branded with nVidia 3D vision. You will need the infrared emitter and glasses to make it work with your monitors.
Michelle, I have found the Dells are interchangeable, for awhile I was using my husband power pack for mine 17.3 Inspiron (his is a 15.6) hope this helps. Ellen
Yes. As long as there's no cd-rom partition involved, all partitions will be copied when "whole media" option is selected for bit-for-bit copying.
Makes it wireless
yes, there is no reason why it should not work. The real question is does windows 7 support this type of modem. Most systems are backwards compatible so this should work even with window 8. If you have program that will do this like the program that magic jack uses then there is no reason that this would not let you do this.
What is on now.
yes- it is an exact replica and can be charged with the Canon NBL 10 charger - I have had mine for more than a year and it still works fine.
I do not know.
according to http://us.toshiba.com/computers/laptops/satellite/L770/L775D-S7340/, no usb 3.0 ports...but it has three 2.0 ports...two on the left and one on the right.
I've used it extensively during aerobatics. Suction cup mount to the canopy, to the windscreen, no issues at all. Works great and is super stable.
While in practice you can, the manual clearly calls out *not* doing exactly that to preserve life of the battery.
Yes. And very easy to setup. You have a simple "chrono" mode, the second mode is Intervals where you can set the interval sets and workouts.
No, there are only three external 5.25 bays. You would need to convert one of them.
It should work long as the model number is right. You just don't plug in the lights.
Yeah you shouldn't have any issues with that. This case is a beauty. You'll love it.
It should without a problem. I have a smaller model and there is a ton of room.
Sorta, and rather neutral--perhaps a little on the reddish side. It's not a bluish purple--maybe a very deep/dark cranberry. I am totally happy with it--color and quality of product. It's more than I expected.
Yes, our 10 yr old grandson uses it and his ipad is in wonderful shape
Will this graphics card adequately support a 2560 X 1440 graphics display?
No not if the keypad is 11 inches.
I use that little case for my Nikon Coolpix s8400 which closes up nice and flat. I bought a Sony NEX-5 and had to get a larger case. Your camera appears to be about the same size as my NEX-5 which would mean it is probably too thick to fit that case. You might need to buy a case that is a little thicker to accommodate the thicker camera.
Hi Jeremiah. The Dual Band Wireless N Travel Router should work with the XBox 360.
We have no problem connecting our Samsung Galaxy pad to the device. Can't understand why you have a problem. Sorry.
Akitio MyCloud seems to support NTFS, FAT32, and MAC OS Extended file systems for external USB drives. I personally tried NTFS and FAT32. For internal drive, it uses XFS file system. I used built-in web-based interface to format my internal drive.
Numeral are large ours is in master bedroom can see across room 10 to 12 ft easily
No it is not compatible as this remote work through blu-tooth technology and ***mr1 is radio based.
If you mean USB cable, they are standard. Any USB cable will fit into the converter - whether it comes with your phone, camera, ipod, or anything else requiring a USB cable to charge.
This is the actual product, and I love it. I had one before but black. Someone picked up a bag and I thought it was mine. So blue it was, cause everyone seemed to have black. Going through the airport is awesome.
Don't know for sure. Don't have an iPhone 5 and my charger is in Saigon. My guess is it should work fine but the outer box may be a problem. Sorry I'm no help.
It will work fine as long as it can be mouted in a high position.
Good morning Casio, Yes you can use a voltage reducer to step down the voltage from 48V to 12V.
They worked for my 2011 Town and Country.
If your system uses infrared these headphones will work. At night Take a digital camera and look from the rear if you see purple lights with your camera they will work. A digital camera is more sensitive than the human eye. It will pick up the infrared light. Hope this helps you
2008
Hi Saul E., I got these headphones for our 2013 Chrysler Town & Country. They work just fine and are the same headphones that came with the car. I needed two more because I have four grandchildren, and they all want to watch DVDs when they ride with us. I expect the headphones will work in your 2007 Chrysler ASPEN.
Yes it is, but it's a very sturdy plastic.
No, it connects to a wiring harness to your car speakers or you can buy the portable docking station with speakers
You will have to replace all 3. The SXEV1 dock is nothing like the Sportster. FWIW the Sportster is a better radio IMHO
No, your antenna choice has to do with where on your vehicle it is to be installed.
blue
That is correct. You disconnect the antenna from your head unit, plug it into the iSimple device, and plug the iSimple device into the the head unit's antenna port. This places it "inline" with the antenna. This minimizes the interference from local FM stations.
Phone.
Yes it does.
Yes it does.
In my opinion, it has worked the same as comcast's modem; I'm happy that I bought this and got rid of the $7 month charge from comcast because that's a ridiculous monthly charge. :-)
No, The only M-disc that is currently available is the single layer DVD. Bluray M-disc are supposed to be out by now but still haven
UltraLife Gold uses same dye technology as normal DVDs and does not use M-disc burning technology. M-disc is permanent while other DVDs are not.
It has the same capcity as a standard single-layer DVD.
You can use an AMPED repeater/booster
You'll need the footpod -- the only other way to track distance is through GPS, and this watch does not have GPS.
You need to have a Garmin foot pod and then calibrate it. Then you can calculate distance. Some watches come with foot pods, some don't, so it really depends on who you buy the watch from and what's included in the package. The foot pod from the FR60 will sync with the FR70, so that's also an option if you have one of those.
No, none of this series has any lights on them.
Nope. No key hole.
Yes, i used it with windows 8. Rgds
No bluetooth.
No there not.
Yes, if your computer has a 802.11b/g/n compliant network adapter.
you have a remote that will let you record but you cant schedule anything to record it wont work like that
Its powered by car's 12 V output. USB output is for charging mobile or other devices which can be charged from USB port
Ypu should be able to i dont know why it wouldnt work
I can't answer anything about Mac's but I can tell you this was the absolute worst product I have ever purchased. Do yourself a favor and get something else like the Startech brand.
No it is just the receiver, I purchased also a polk audio speaker set with sub and it works great!
Yes. 3.5mm auxiliary plug.
I have the 4s and it worked no problem with the default iOS (6?).
Yes, I can use my Iphone 3G with this and the sound is incredible~ Better than Bose!!! I give this 5 STARS Enjoy~
Just on/off - but it does get dimmer as the battery starts dying! I bought mine a few years ago, and the battery is now completely dead. Still a decent case though.
Yes
It's around 30 feet or so. My shower is 25 feet from my bedside table and it works great, even with the door closed.
Rewrite ur question, it's not that understandable but I hope this answers ur question. The speaker can only connect to 1 device at 1 time where as a tablet, iPhone, galaxy can connect to a multiple of devices because it has memory processors to handler it.
Yes
I am a amateur and learned to use it! The manual is easy to read and understand. This camera is very user friendly.
It uses the standard SD card
Major gamer here and I personally would not game on this tv. Now my daughter plays my old GameCube on it but I would never hook my x1 to it.
I believe so. I have mine hooked to Satellite TV.
Yes
Yes it will! Any camera that fits on a standard tripod screw will do (and I know for a fact that the HFR42 has this capability)
As long as your computer has HDMI out, you can plug that into this unit's input. Then, connect the outs to your monitor, and TV
Yes it should work. This adapter is compatible with older bluetooth technology. You would need to install software on the laptop to communicate with your bluetooth enabled PDA. There is a step-by-step tutorial at this address: http://kb.hpwebos.com/wps/portal/kb/na/tungsten/e2/unlocked/solutions/article/13950_en.html.
Yes it is. but it is not powerful enough to charge it as fast as it uses power if the battery is not previously charged and you are just charging with the sun. You will need to charge the battery in the solar panel with the sun or usb port for a few hours before charging your ipad air
Sorry, can't help. I only have a first generation iPad, which it did not charge.
Yes I do. Thats the olny use I give to it and its excellent!!
Im Not Shore I Only Use It With My Phone In The Car Come From The Radio
I will try it tomorrow. Great idea!
Sure. You can charge both of them at the same time. Or the pair of two other devices.
absolutely...i believe this can literally be used in most if not all countries....i know it works in america, france, uk, and lebanon and many other countries...there is also a product description that tells u where it works...hope this helps
No it doesn't an all . Thank you
This is a U.S. FCC regulated Citizens Band radio. The frequencies are channelized, 1 through 40, and that is standard across all modern CB radios in the United States. Power output is 4 watts which is the maximum legal output for CB radio. If you still need to know the specific frequency of each channel, there is a table here: http://www.radioreference.com/apps/db/?aid=7731
No it doesn't. The unit has a built in speaker, and you can plug in an external speaker from the external jack in the back. External speaker Sold separately.
as with anything, depends on how you use it. have had mine for 5 months now and not a problem.
I'm not sure. I used it in an Inspiron 530s. Check the part number for your power supply against the ones listed in the description.
As far as I know, it's a keyboard that can be used with any computer. I"m using a bastardized windows 7
No
You have to buy $25 worth of stuff to get these shipped with no extra cost. If you want to just buy them, chose a different option. You will be charged a shipping fee.
Do you have one of the buds in too far? They work well at plugging up your ear from outside sounds if you push them in a little farther
I wear glasses and sunglasses with them on and they work for me.
Yes to both
Nope. Not that great on airplanes because of that.
Yes, this headset was made to fit both ears. All you must do is remove the plastic Ear Hook and reattach it in the opposite/reverse direction. Hope this helps.
I have an Android phone and the BlueParrot work extremely well and it stays connected until you disconnect. I would think it should work fffine.
my pen is black and between medium to fine. I do not like fine and I do like this pen. Such a good combination! I think you will love this combination, it is so easy to carry with you everywhere!ENJOY!!!!! MEDAESTH@ME.COM
Yes. U can also purchase extra refills when u buy it at the same time online. Very happy.
If you buy it in Japan, as I understand, there's no warranty.
No battery compartment. It uses standard AC power plug.
Do you mean use a fuse on it or repair it? I wired mine for 2 ohms. You have to make sure that your amp can carry the load, many people do not pay attention to ohms or RMS power.
Have you confirmed console and cable work on a regular TV? SNES is output at 240p there may be a setting to better capture this, but with the lag I can't imagine it being very playable.
Hi Denise I would start with a skylight 1a or a polarizing filter to protect the lens the lens will have a sign and a number underneath the sign is a circle with a diagonal line through it going from top right to bottom left followed by a number 46 52 67 etc this two figure number is the filter size for that lens
Please be noticed that this kind of Lens filters is intended to protect your valuable camera lens against scratches and similar physical damage. Considering this, I don't think this filter may work as a Water-Resistant protection. Therefore, if you plan to use your digital camera pretty close to liquids/humid weather conditions (rain, waterfalls, fountains, etc.) the best protection you may get is using a camera rain cover.
Don't know what you mean by dark screen. Those I bought were exact the same as original screen. You choose white or black depending on front of your device. Not sure if they are interchangeable, the white model came a bit later and may have a slight difference.
No...it is not... It is made from a very cheap material... I dont recomend it at all:(
Yes, some people do complain about that. The short of it is that Panasonic GX1 lacks in body stabilization that all Olympus MFT bodies have. You can eliminate that in part by keeping the shutter speed faster than 1/250th of a second, or buying lenses that have Image Stabilization (Lumix 45mm-200mm for example). I hope that answers your question.
I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "digital zoom"?. With the 14 - 42mm X lens with electronic zoom I can use "manual focus". I have not tried other auto lenses which have the manual zoom ring in addition to the electronic zoom.
It fits perfect BUT hides rear camera.
I am not sure, The one I bought, has no battery life, and will not connect to my Samsung Galaxy 2 Note 10.1. I would not recommend, this unit.
Not sure. There must be a computer involved but beyond that I've no idea.
The powerzoom is a smaller pancake lens. The kit is a larger lens.
Although I do not know if the power supply comes with an international warranty , their website www.seasonic.com may have this information since their instructions booklet prompts to visit this site for this information.
Oh yeah. This will be way more than enough power for that build. That build could probably work with only 500 watts, but I always recommend buying more than you need with a power supply so you have room to grow.
Dear Kenneth, Thank you for your question regarding our Cables. We actually do carry the cable, but we are out of stock and awaiting shipment. If you can contact us at service@bluerigger.com we can let you know when the cable is back in stock. We look forward to hearing from you. Thanks, BlueRigger LLC service@bluerigger.com
I have the Galaxt S4, I just checked to make sure. It doesn't work. It does connect the Kindle Fire though.
As long as the roku has a hdmi input, I think I should work.
Works fine with my 7 inch winbook
Dear Chauncy, Thank you for your question regarding our High Speed Braided HDMI cable with Ethernet.The cable is fully compatible with PS3. Please contact us at service@bluerigger.com if you have any additional questions. Thanks, BlueRigger LLC service@bluerigger.com

Please contact us at service@bluerigger.com if you have any additional questions. Thanks, BlueRigger LLC service@bluerigger.com
Try turning the volume on the speakers down, and the volume on your computer up.
For the price I was not concerned with an extended warranty. I was not offered one when I purchased it.
Yes it connects thru a USB. It is a great speaker I don.t need a sub woffer where it is located.
You betcha. ....With your adapter plugged in you play music plus keep your battery charged
I believe it is. There is actually a plug inside a plug on the end. It appears that it fits multiple devices.
A case protects the back part of your iPad (with the Apple logo on it) and a cover protects the screen.
The product number on the battery we got is LR69-GN-130408. its a Type:Li-ion. It fits fine just raise the computer so it does lie flat anymore but instead elevates the top. The screen opens all the way just like before. If I could find my order I would include that but at the moment I haven't found it. Hope this helps you.
Ya
Yes. It will stick out the rear about 1 inch though because it is a 9 cell instead of a 6 cell, But it will give you more battery life
I do not know but my feeling is that it doesn't. I have a Dell Inspiron 5010 which uses it.
I think your asking if this works for N5010. It should. I have the N7010. It has a 17 inch scree
Are you sure this particular batter is compatible with you model of Dell? I had no problems with mine. You may also try reinstalling the battery. When I tried to install the first time I didn't get the battery seated properly. Beyond that I am at a loss.
Truly sorry, we do not have white ones. But it is worthy having a try.
yes
I don't know because the one I got won't accept DVDs. Although the reading lights are visible when I try to insert the DVD the unit does not grab the DVD and pull it in to the unit no matter how far I try to push it in manually. Also the cable jack is loose and therefore the reception is garbled. I have requested return authorization and when I get a reply to that I'll add additional information.
no-just computer, mouse, keyboard & speakers. great bang for the buck.
It's a USB A-Male to Mini-B: http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics--Male-Mini-B-Cable-Meters/dp/B001TH7GUK/
Probably. The connection is with a standard 1/8" audio cable so as long as you can access that connection port you should be able to. The unit is designed so that various sized phones and tablets can sit on the stand. There is also a rubber seating cushion that can be removed if the item is too thick to sit in the seat.
I am going to say no, it will not work on a two post rack. The rails mount on front and back. Your best option is a cantilever shelf. They are designed for two post mounting.
Come with! extern mic, sound card and controller panel! The controller come with adaptor for 5 1/4"" slot like CD but you can remove if you have a slot 3,5"" like disket drive
If you're talking about the myfi, no it won't, sadly
Yes, it has an internal antenna and a power dock . I have not signed up for Sirius service yet so I don't know it the antenna with it is going to be strong enough yet or if I will have to purchase one for out side the home. I hope that helps a little.
Yes....its running windows 7, tablet
The 14 to 16g blue ones
It charge an ipad 3, I do not own an iphone 6 but it should charge it
The direct connect won't work , the prongs are the old kind. But it will play via AirPlay as long as ya have wifi
Answer here...AirPlay you mean? Download the JBL app.
It seems like your source setting is incorrect. Recommend looking at manual and/or YouTube video.
The JBL is awesome. The Klipsch is very good. Neither is a loser. I thought the JBL sound was richer and recharges the ipad/phone while is plays. The Klipsch is portable but a battery hog. If you NEED wireless then the Klipsch but if you are looking for great sound go with JBL
I did not find one in the literature. But I have purchased Jawbone products and although I haven't had a warranty issue I do say they have good customer service. Sorry I wasn't able to help more.
yes, the shoulder strap is shown in the picture.
Wallgreens WEB. Symphonix Ear Tubes, L on 03/26/2014 via FEDEX - $24.95
I don't know, it's been over a year since I've ordered this item. You'd have to see if there is a model number as part of the description. Sorry.
Not necessarily but it definitely is the preferred method.
Just got it up and running....so far so good....no complains....
No the T1i uses an lpe5 battery this kit is for an lpe8.
Yes.. This is for T4i
I tried it and the flash kept popping up, so I'm thinking not really.
Yes, you can. I've tried it. It's may be best used for non human subjects. The light is hard on the eyes.
Yes.
I would say yes. NVidia lists length at 10.5 inches and width as 2 slots.
Most sound cards use pcie slots and This board has 4 of those so you can have two graphics cards a sound card and still have one slot left over
Three years is the standard ASUS warranty for this class of mobo, perhaps within the first 30 days of purchase ASUS may (or may not) offer an extended warranty for an additional fee. The ASUS warranty applies only to the original customer that must register online at ASUS. It is not transferable, and no other party may benefit from warranty. If the board is defective ASUS will exchange the defective board for a refurbished unit.
Yes. A little tough to get on at first, but a good fit overall.
I am not sure. But make sure that it is compatible with both the camera and your lens. Some of these teleconverters do not fit the EOS kit lense. Bower should tell you. I have purchased some good equipment from the Bower brand with great success on my Rebels (T3i and T4i
I use it with only my Canon lens. I do not know if it will. Sorry.
Yes. The headphones will fit any standard headphone jack. The standard headphone jack is on just about everything ex. Computers. Tablets. Phones. Televisions.
yes they can be used with laptops
All this is designed to do is provide power.
I don't know. I bought it for a Motorola Xoom tablet.
11 3/4" wide. 8 1/4" w/ trackpad extended 5 3/4" w/ trackpad retracted. Keyboard slopes 1/2" in the front-1" rear.
I don't know what a panny plasma a board is so it's hard to say. It worked fine from my US NTSC signal TV playing a PAL signal in Egypt. Thanks
While it may work for some time I don't recommend using this video card with less the 400W power supply. Best, Martin
We are unable to answer compatibility question for certain PC model. If your PC has PCI express x 16 slot and it is PCIE 2.0 standard or higher compliant with minimum 400 watt power supply then it should work. The system you have seems like a slim tower, since this card comes with a pair of low profile bracket, it can be shortened to fit almost all slim tower system. Thanks Copystars Support
I wouldn't know the bare bone of if it is better, I do know it's one of the top 5-ish cards for low-profile computers, so it's almost a guarenteed it'll be a major improvement, especially for an older card, as long as you have the preferred RAM of the card.
Yes but throughput on USB 3.0 is still limited to about 40mbps due to the chipset used. I found the Transcend parts support bandwidth that matches the throughput of MSXD.
I have a Canon 7D and it (monitor) doesn't work with this battery. Plate A: Compatible w/ SONY NP-F970, F550, F550, F770, F750. Plate B: Compatible w/ Panasonic DU06/DU21/VBD140; SANYO DZhs301sw; Hitachi DZ-HS303SW/BZ-BP14S/DZ3200/BP07W. Fit following DV Models: Panasonic NV-GS/PV-GS/DZ-MV/GS/H28/H258/H288GK series.
If your camera has HDMI or component it should my camera is a Panasonic Ag HMC 80 and works flawlessIy
Yes, but not very well. Make sure there are no obstructions in the way. These would include power supplies , Mirrors or electronic products that may cause interference. I use mine from the computer in my Den to the living-room TV. It is only one room away and sometimes must be rebooted. I still think it is worth the effort.
The transmitter will plug into the HDMI port with a power wire connected to any close USB port on the computer... the receiver will plug into the HDMI on the back of the TV or Monitor and is powered with a standard wall outlet adapter that is included.
I ordered the tan in ear rubber ear molds in medium. They come in pairs, these work well. I have tried the foam ones which are OK. The torpedo brand are supposed to be good but I have not personally tried it.
The difference is only in the color of the glasses. To be able to use the glasses with the RF TVs, you have to buy BX104LX1 glasses bundled with the RF dongle. RF dongle may be available also separately.
No, it's not an SSD drive. When I bought mine I checked the price on 1Tb SSD drives on another site and they were $1,300. I think this a better backup drive when you consider the difference in price.
Try resetting ur password.
yes it would
it is a wall plug in. pretty good sound. its just like the ones from the 70's and 80's!
Plug it in and turn it on. If that doesn't work, contact the company.
no
It comes with it.
No need for adapter just plug the cable from your internet provide
It should work with your AT&T DSL. My service is through Comcast and I have a modem that interfaces with Comcast. There is a network output on the back side of the modem with a RJ45 connector (looks like a phone plug but bigger) and I run a cat5 cable from the modem to the Trendnet router. As long as you have the RJ45 output plug on your modem, you should be good to go.
I don't know... But if it was proper then the wording wouldn't be intentionally vague so we all buy them only to find they're NOT the same as what comes on the Pens.
It's really hard to take the top off. I usually push the top right corner by applying upward force. Then the right top and bottom notches come off, then you do the same for the left side.
I did what is mentioned here.. got it on the shoulder.. but how do I avoid it slinging.. it's still loose hanging loop?
I didn't need anything to connect it to my camera. I'm not expert though. I'm not sure about different models of cameras and what might be different. It came with a "coupling" to connect to my camera. I took it to Yellowstone and it worked ok for the price. I wasn't sure what to expect for it being so cheap.
Denon AVR-#### 4 numbers in the model number or Onkyo. Your center channel speaker should set max power output you are looking for in an amp. 50 watts from either brand drive them great
Yes you can lug it into your laptop. Just make sure you have the software for the video playback on your laptop.
Yes, I'm using it on windows 8.1 Pro.
YES
I am not a computer expert, but it is a standard computer jack and should work with another computer. Am still very satisfied with this no nonsense mouse that works well and holds up to daily use without any issues. Hope this helps.
mine is round also. it plugs into a color coded green round
I have had no problems with mine whatsoever, and get plenty of local stations. I get fine reception and the sound quality is good. I don't get all the people giving it such negative reviews. If you are looking for a top-of-the-line system with superior quality, this isn't the one for you. But if you want a small radio with decent sound, this is the one.
Everything has to be in the root. It does not read folders.
Yes they can be detached.
No
No. This is completely separate. Double check all wiring connections between your TV and DVD player and make sure you select the same TV input as you've connected your DVD player to.
I would not purchase this product if I were you. I was not able to do anything with it. Research another product.
This monitor is built for Nvidia's 3D Vision 2. AMD has a list of supported 3D devices on the Radeon page, and I don't believe this is one of the supported devices. It's possible you could get it to work to some extent, but I believe AMD's system operates differently than Nvidia's anyway so it may not be worth the trouble. If you're planning on staying with Radeon, I'd get one of their recommended displays.
In order for this to work the best way is to have a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) that has NVIDIA 3D Vision ready. This isn't a COMPUTER there is no CPU, Motherboard, harddrive, memory.... Not sure what an H-drive is this isn't a Computer no network card.... the ports are: 1x VGA Port, 1x DVI-D Port, 1x HDMI Port, 1x 3.5mm Mini-jack
I'm not sure if VW has different CD changers, but I bought it for the 2004 beetle. Therefore I'd expect that it should work for you.
Works great for me on COX! Much faster than my previous one, and all I had to do was call customer service and set it up.
Yes it worked with Time Warner. You need to call them and they will reset from the one removed.
It clearly states the height & width for this was a huge issue for me as well ;) so I copied & pasted details below: Product Features and Technical Details Product Features Supports up to 42 inch flat panel up to 80 lbs on the stand or on the mount Lower shelf supports 80 lbs On board media storage Interchangeable color side and back panel Easy assembly Technical Details Brand Name: Atlantic Model: 88335750 Style Name: Modern/Contemporary Material Type: Steel, Medium Density Fiberboard *****Width: 43 inches *****Height: 45 inches Weight: 45.00 pounds
As long as you have enough room behind the mirror. I've used this product on toyotas, dodge, Chevy and have never had any issues. Awesome product
Yes it will work great
John, I bought that mount but it would not work on my 4Runner as there was not place to clamp it. I returned the product but the shipping to and from still cost me. Steve
Fits everything that has a windshield mounted mirror. It's universal...
If the marantz has a subwoofer out jack then it will work
The actual dimensions, as measured by yours truly, are 14 3/4" high, 14 1/4" wide, and 15 3/4" deep.
I believe so but I honestly can't remember since I haven't checked since the first time I set it up.
Not specifically. It only blocks which sites you can access, not the content or functions which may be hidden in the site. Instagram is a great example - it makes it through the filter (unless you specify otherwise) and its' content can contain porn. So, bottom line - just make sure you set BUC to access the internet site supporting your application and you should be fine. BUC has the best technical support (real person on the phone) I've found. Call and talk with them if you have questions. It's a very good product.
From what ive read you have to play the 3d movie through your computer with addtl software. Download the users manual for the projector and it will explain the 3d
Yes? http://www.arctic.ac/worldwide_en/accelero-s1-plus.html
Not sure if this answers your question : SDXC = The Secure Digital eXtended Capacity (SDXC) format supports cards up to 2 TB (2048 GB), compared to a limit of 32 GB for SDHC cards in the SD 2.0 specification. Speed class 1 = Full higher potential of recording real-time broadcasts and capturing large-size HD videos
Hi, sorry we don't have it for sale. Thanks.
Once you get this mouse to handshake with your PC or Mac (I've used it with both), you should be able to configure it from the computer's interface. The mouse can sometimes get messed up and may need a battery-removal rebooting on occasion, however.
It's running android 4.04 and the screen is the big problem for me, not high resolution like the Google nexus 7 and 10 which are the ones I use the most. The screen looks grainy to me but I'm old with old eyes.
No. It will not work. A software driver is required and none is available for i devices.
plays mp3 very well
I would contact Cradlepoint by phone or email to confirm whether a certain card will work in this unit. I can only say that my VL600 does.
Yes. The charger comes with the headphones.
I had a Galaxy S3 and it worked fine....but recently upgraded to a Galaxy S5 and it does not work at all - very disappointing :(
It wouldn't pair to my Samsung Galaxy S5
No
Hi Craig, You are absolutely right to ask if it works in Windows 8.1 since there are several devices not supported. What I know is that for Windows 8 this device works well and for Windows 7 works great. I strongly suggest only use devices that specs says that Windows 8.1 is supported specially for 64 bit. Regards...
No
It can be attached either way, it's up to your preference with regards to space and area that you are trying to light
I use a timer on mine. One like I use on lamps when I go away for a week or so.
No Sodastream uses a proprietary threading, you would save money by not investing in the Sodastream hardware and make your own carbonation gear using off the shelf parts you can easily find on Amazon.
hello this item can work with your car . the bypass modulator is needed for the install and sold separately thanks
Yes. If your car starts with a key and not a push button.
12v/ Energizer A23
It didn't work with the one it was SUPPOSED to work with. Died after about 3 weeks. Don't buy it.
This color didn't.Some colors do come as a set with the keyboard cover AND the mac book cover.
No, the port is for a 4 or lower.
Hi Lorraine. Don't believe everything you hear. According to their site ( http://www.vanguardworld.com/index.php/en/pv/products/detail-1-1-229-726.html ) there is a rain cover on the 41 (point 5 - exterior functions).
I haven't tested it but it appears that it will do it because both my drives have data on them.
No, the USB port is for plugging an additional hard drive into the device for sharing.
Yes, it works with iPhone4.
No adapter needed with the 5
Yes it does
Please be informed that this item does not fit the Galaxy Pro 10.1, it maybe a little loose when put the tablet in the keyboard.
Your samsung speaker is better louder and clearer ,save your money and buy a better one theses things are junk
Yes
works on my MacBookPro A1226

It should....we used a galaxy s3 inside it just fine. Just look up the exact size to compare it.
Check your iMacs model specs and compare the part numbers. Every iMac has different specs
I was looking at the 2014 sport pics to make sure it's like my 2012 sport and it looks exactly like mine did, so if you can unscrew it then yes it should fit :)
They are somewhat universal but to be safe just enter 2011 Jeep Patriot antennas and it should be there.

The remote is wireless
It takes two AA batteries. My first pair was installed on 2/4/14 and then replaced them on 5/10/14. Haven't replaced the 5/10/14 replacement yet. Don't know why the first pair only lasted 3 months - could have been bad batteries. Hope this helps.
According to my research it does not support it. Why do you need ASIO?
Yes. To quote the PCI Express article in Wikipedia: "A PCIe card physically fits (and works correctly) in any slot that is at least as large as it is (e.g., an x1 sized card will work in any sized slot)." My own experience confirms this and I know I've used the card in either x4 or x16 slots previously.
Hello, the truth in the specifications of the card only refers to 5.1 is silent in relation to speakers 7.1, I use it with Ligitech 5.1 speakers, I think you should find another model that is more specific, I put a link here; you can check this model that is compatible with 7.1 speakers: http://www.amazon.com/Creative-Sound-Blaster-Audigy-SB1550/dp/B00EO6X7PG/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1405118509&sr=1-1&keywords=sound+card+7.1
No. You must choose just one port.
Just an enclosure.
Single stick
Yes, it will auto sleep and wake when you open and close the lid. Works like a charm.
It should fit a nook, my kindle fire & my friends nook are roughly the same size. So I would say probably yes it'll fit.
I've given up trying to make this work with my Mac.
I know it is a well built device and charges a 6Volt Stanley spot light. Check voltage output/input for radio vrs K-tor? good luck.
sorry, not sure. It works with American. The picture and sound quality are very good.
No Blue-rays, but this will play all region DVD and DIVX.
You can enter them in the search line on Amazon. Or, here is a link you can paste in your browser: http://www.amazon.com/Pairs-Black-earphone-Earphones-compatibility/dp/B00BIJTN5K/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1391281060&sr=1-1&keywords=EP-SQUF-BLK-3L
No, I don't think it will work
not work, azbox server sks is off
Dear Santiago, The price is the same. There is no discount in buying ten pieces.
yes it has but the system spec is lower that what the seller specified. and the screen is bad

Yes it comes with WiFi capabilities.
You'll have to get one. It does NOT come with anything but the adapter.
Yes
I'm afraid I don't know. If I still had it, I'd test it on my PS3, but I don't anymore. :(
There is no "Record" button on the player so I would say that you cannot transfer mp3 to cassette.
try: 1) other formats, e.g., MP3, cda. Also, not all .wav are created equal. That is, some proprietary software call itself .wav but... 2) another device. The problem could be with the device itself. 3) If you're using windows, try to reading Windows Media Player. It seems to be more tolerant than other protocols
I was able to convert several cassettes to cd and mp3 but the converter died and I had to find a different unit to finish my project. This USB unit is cheaply made and not reliable. Sorry.
I do not know which generation Ipod I have (5 years old) but it does function properly except for the charging indicator. My ipod is always plugged in, but when wokeup shows ipod battery is low. This does not affect how I use the unit-basically a storage/playback unit for my cd collection. I think they showed a compatibility chart in the online manual?
It comes with a small infrared remote which controls basic functions and volume of your docked device. It probably came with cables... I really don't remember now, there are so many cables around the house. It's a nice product and I recommend it.
Yes. As long as the adapter works, it should work just fine.
I use a 30 pin to 8 pin converter with my iPhone 5. I assume the same converter will work on the 6 but good luck
The sound quality could have more to do with the content than the device. Because of MP3's comparison they don't reproduce audiophile quality source. On the other hand, Pandora sounded much better.
Remove the center screw from the outlet cover and pug this on over the outlet cover and then you the longer screw included to screw into the outlet center.
If it has a USB end yes-- so far it has charged whatever I put in it that has a USB connection.
Hello, Yes we sell the fuses for $7.95 each plus tax if you are in California or Michigan. Please email us at sales @ discounttommy .com for futher assistance, please leave the spaces out in our email address. Thank you.
Mine came with a bowens mount. I have two with large soft boxes. I can send you some photo's if you would like to see them in action.
I have a V-1 and works great. Here is what it says about the Cobra..... Includes Plastic Clip for V1, or Stamped Metal Clip for Escort, Beltronics and Cobra.
It fits my Valentine, if your Passport is the same width then it would work. I would suggest checking the specs online for both the Valentine One and yours to compare.
Yes. I haven't used them very long so not sure how the charge from one compares to another. That's often a difficult thing to determine. So far, so good.
Yes, the LED is included.
At our school we found this product to be completely ineffectual in all possible configurations. We tried hdmi out -&gt; VGA in = nothing. We reversed that. Nothing. The same results with the yellow video line. Check the small print from the seller and you'll find they warn it only works if the devices being connected have built in conversion. Otherwise, nothing. You may need a converter, not just a cable. Rad up on your laptop's hdmi output... Good luck!
Depends on your motherboard. Vertically, the heatsink is lower than the ram, but horizontally, it doesn't extend to where it would touch the ram. The other cool thing is that the fans will passively cool you're ram if you don't use low profile modules. Hope that helps.
This is generic ddr3 ram. So it's works with all computers that accept ddr3 ram and meet computer specifications
Yes
Probably for quick spills but never tried heavy water.
Yep it will give it a snug and nice fit. I have a 13.3 inch Mac book pro and this sleeve is perfect and trendy too. :-)
I have this tower with the 5.25 bay still installed and I believe it is attached with screws.
Yes
Yes it will. It will work with virtually any Canon camera with a hotshoe mount. eTTL will only work on select cameras however, but it does work on the 5D MkIII.
Yes, it has "slope" data that shows steepness of current path (positive indicates uphill,negative indicates downhill). Here is the link of the user manual where he could check all the features of the device http://assets.timex.com/user_guides/W280_CycleTrainer/W280_CycleTrainer_NA_EN.pdf PS Im very happy with it, it works very well
The one I bought has 8 GB RAM and the product description clearly said 8 GB. I did ask the seller to confirm HD and RAM size before I placed my order.
Nope, it is not noise cancelling. For noise cancelling, you can look at bose. http://www.bose.com/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/noise_cancelling_headphones/quietcomfort_15/index.jsp
Personally, I set the gain at about 3/4 no more. With amplifiers maxing out the volume typically adds distortion which creates poor sound and overdrives the amp. I set the frequency at about 150 or so for music, 120 for movies.
Manual says USB ports are only for mouse and memstick (for video copy only). So, it has to be internal.
I haven't used it in this way however it seems if there are no scrambled channels involved that it should
Mitra, The camera does not come with a memory card, however you can purchase them separately from Amazon. This camera will work anywhere in the world, the wall charger is a US wall charger so you would have to charge the camera via your computer and the included USB cable.
When new, the battery life was around 7 hours if used at low power. Intensive CPU or graphics activity would shorten it to almost half, which was remarkably good at the time. Two years on, it has reduced to around &#8532;, which I also find very good. The original Apple warranty lasts for a year, and you could buy the extended plan for two additional years. Don't know if that applies to refurbished units.
No, this is late 2011 version. New version will have "Retina" in its description.
First of all, don't order this battery. It's not oem as described and won't work. To change the battery you have to take off the whole screen (hard to do without breaking it) then take out the motherboard and all internal parts possible. Then heat with a heat gun or worst case blow dryer. Slowly pull the old battery out and put in the new one. It's not as simple as it sounds.
As long as you didn't break anything when taking apart you would just need new adhesive strips to hold the glass back on
I dont know about the warranty, though ive been using this battery on my ipad and its been good so far (im on a little less than a year with this battery). Ive also purchased this battery for customers I've had.
The specs say it does.
yes just register it when you get it.
i don't know, but the cables are not worth buying they are very poor quality
you can get net flix that has epix programs thats a movie channel like hbo
I have a kindle fire. It won't fit this.
We just have the tv on it. I am not sure of the sound bar. Did you try the peerless website?
It is a universal mount, so make sure your unit has the necessary screw ports. Shouldn't be a worry. It worked for my 55" Samsung
I'm sorry I don't know the one I got does not hold a charge more than 20 minutes
Yes it is
8 on both
I wouldn't recommend that, the speaker normally requires an amplifier.
nope.
If you are asking if it needs N electric plug in yes it does. If your asking does the tower need to be attached to a wall for stability, no it doesn't. It is not bluetooth but has a nice aux plug in.
Yes it is !!
This is what I replaced the screen on my with http://www.amazon.com/DELL-INSPIRON-1750-SUBSTITUTE-REPLACEMENT/dp/B004KT7XY8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1381511429&sr=8-1&keywords=Inspiron+1750+replacement+screen. Works very well and can't tell its not an OEM screen. Took about 10 minutes to replace it.
Go into Skype set up and choose this device as your audio source.
No charge beyond the initial purchase
No. You must buy the Bluetooth adapter separately.
I use the tablet as an ereader and for entertainment. I did not connected a printer to it yet. However I don't think that printing from the tablet will be hard. There are several apps for printing on Google Apps. I found this article which may help you http://www.howtogeek.com/165778/everything-you-need-to-know-about-printing-from-your-android-phone-or-tablet/
I would guess that any IR reflective surface would work for your purpose. I found that the NEEWER 52mm 52 mm IR 760 nm 760nm Infrared Infra Red Filter fits exactly over the Crazy Cart IR source (but doesn't attach - would need tape or adaptor to hold it) and completely blocks visible light, and still gives exellent IR illumination.
No, as the sony website states the PS Vita can only use three types of cards: PS Vita memory card, PS Vita card, and a SIM card(3G/WiFi only).
Not really. About like a midgrade power supply. I an very satisfies. Mine is still working. If my deal goes through for building these computers I will be using these. My computer is used for graphics design and gaming sometimes on 96 hours at a time and I have had mine atleast 6 months.
No, it is only a 110V input, There is no voltage switch, sorry
Yes it will
Si son compatible funcionan perfecto !!!
Yes, they connect to the TV to recharge.
The exact diameter of the base where it connects to a tripod top plate, is 1.58"... A little more than 1-1/2" inches.
No, this is supposed to be an in dash video camera. Mine was crap and I suspect most of them are. Amazon sells crap like this because they are made in China.
My first choice would be a non-acidic RTV automotive sealant or adhesive. You might also try a plastic bonding Epoxy if the gates have flat surfaces available to mount them. These switches work very well and should work very well on non-magnetic surfaces like the aluminum.
1.5v according to Crucial's web site.
You need one of these on each end, unless you have a modem/router than has a built in output. The one we have from Uverse does, so we only need it on the far end. You should use RG-6 coax. Ours is in the house, so I can tell you anything about burial depth. The units simply act as a long ethernet cable, extending the range of your wired network.
UHF band only goes to 806 and Satellite needs down to 1000Mhz. To operate correctly, the VHF/UHF port must begin cutoff at 806 and be fully cutoff by 950. See the spec sheet here. http://www.hollandelectronics.com/catalog/upload_file/DPD2.pdf.
I paired mine with a Galaxy S3, speaker phone didn't work initially until I rebooted the Clarity. Working fine since.
It does fit, but ensure the docking station is brand new with warranty. The one I purchased has a bad connection when I place my tablet in the slot.. and I have to move the screen backwards and forwards until I have a clear picture.. #frustrating.. I just purchased another tablet and not an ASUS one either. Their customer service is for the birds.
If that is the TF700t, I don't believe it does. It does fit the TF700 perfectly.
yes.
I'm not sure.. But mine is not the retina model and it fits great!
The battery arrives partially charged which is how lithium batteries are typically sold before being used. I should also add that I have used this battery through several charging cycles and have noticed that the battery discharges fairly quickly on its own without being used - within a few weeks. The OEM version of this battery holds its charge much longer.
No, this is a MP3 player and an outstanding one at that. You can load up to four gigabytes of MP3 songs and enjoy them in the gym, on a run,in the pool or anywhere. Of course it is wireless but not bluetooth capable. If you want a great MP3 player buy this MP3 player.
Yes...it has a flip out plug on the back side.
I have two of these batteries and have successfully charged the two using this charger without any problems.
Not 100% sure. I have iphone 4 that does dock with one of the inserts that come with this unit. If 4S is the same size as the 4 then I would say yes. If not then I don't know whether any of the inserts will work.
The monitor comes with a sony adapter plate for use with Sony's F550 brand battery. I have 3 of these batteries which are cheaper to purchase from third-party manufacturers. I get just under 2 hours of performance from these batteries.
I've used the Kingston HyperX as an OS X 10.9.x and 10.10.x utility disk. Wish I had bought the 128, but still very usable with reasonable boot time.
Because there's no driver software or program it doesn't appear so.
Yes. Upper right above 'PB' key, but it is poor lit.
The answer is no. It has the standard 3-prong plug. It worked OK for me, but I let the furniture stay out from the wall a bit. The unit is just great otherwise. I would buy a 90 deg. replacement plug and exchange it.
This model has only the standard, bulky, three prong 15A male power plug. To my knowledge there exists no flat plug version of this surge protector. It may be possible to purchase a flat plug with an extension cord, but this device already has a long power cord and you may not wish to extend its length further.
I'm not sure if this is what you are looking for but, it comes with a 5 watt UV bulb.
Pull off the top attachment while in operation and look down the neck of the unit. You will see a green light through the water that is being pumped if working. I've had mine for several years with no problems.
I want to say 3 weeks. This is not a functional unit for business, and there is no customer service on zmodo end. I would recommend qsee
Thanks for your interest in our product. I'm not sure what does it means of two way audio, please let me know what specifically, thanks.
Hi Gustavo, you are Brazilian? About this model, i bought last year i think, and i like it. The Cameras are good, have good focus, nightvision is good also.
This system comes with a 1TB drive installed and ready to record.
must be hardwired through a router.
The Sharkk has its own rechargeable battery built in. This way it doesn't drain the ipad battery. The mini USB cord can be plugged into a USB port on a pc or a USB power adapter to get charged up.
Doesn't seem to be a problem. I even hear a sound indicating that it's switching off.
Yes, it fits well. It's a case with good quality. I recommend it.
It should def work with a 6 disc even no i have no experience working with 6 disc cd changers so im not much help sorry bud.
yes i believe there is 1 output on the back. If you type the name and model f the stereo into YouTube there are videos of people showing you all the specs.
We do apologize, but we are out of inventory for the moment. Thank you.
Yeah, absolutely
It wont work. Your imac uses SODIMM modules, this is a DIMM module.
I didn't try but I doubt it'd work. For Mac parts use Other World Computing.
There are two different types of caches. The 32 MB cache is the usual cache used in any hard drive all of which have such a cache up to 64MB. What makes this a hybrid is the 8GB of SLC Nand flash memory (SLC Nand is more expensive than the MLC Nand used in consumer SSDs and does not have the limited lifetime issues). It is the latter that makes this different from the regular hard drives. See my review of Dec 15, 2012 for when this is good and when not... http://www.amazon.com/review/R36HPN679UBDZ8/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00691WMJG&linkCode=&nodeID=&tag=
No just the drive. I guess they expect the motherboard comes with the cables, or that you will be replacing out an older drive.
Works great in my PS3. Faster than the 500Gb Momentus XT I upgraded from. Backup and restore was 16+ hours but it worked without a problem.
Yes supports and its works greatly
yes, it has no impact on the touchscreen other than the onscreen keyboard won't be necessary and with most Os's will not pop up.
This product is just a cable, so there isn't a software driver. If you need a driver for a device that you're connecting to this cable, then you'll need to look on that device's website.
It absolutely is! I just received my order today, installed it and it works perfectly! Be sure to install in the same locations as the two memory cards you remove. As far as I can tell though it was money well spent.
I have a samsung galaxy 3 tablet. I have the micro card in and it doesn't heat up my tablet.
75w
Michael, if your clock is originally rated for 220V 50Hz you may find trouble with operating your clock. However, you should also be aware that it also steps up the frequency. So your clock which is set for 50Hz would burn up quicker in an environment of 60Hz. Unless it is rated for both frequencies and voltages(220/110V and 50/60Hz). Hope that helped.
yes
Yes, this cable is rated for underground use. I have had great experience with this cable outdoors and I highly recommend it!
This is a laptop case...there is no battery.
Measure the device and you may need to go a case larger. I have leather covers for my Macs 11,13,15 and 17. With the cubed inserts, I drew a cardboard trace for the large 17 inch Toshiba with the oversized battery and cut out the cubes for a snug fit. I could not be more pleased. When I need them I open the safe and pull out the one I need and don't worry about damage since I dropped one 2 years ago!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Yes, it will fit
Yes. It'll work with any 30pin connection.
Yes...only the 4 s...not the 5 or 6
yes, it does.
Works with any laptop that uses a 2.5 sata hd. Most laptop have an adapter that connects to the drive to connect to the motherboard. If you are replacing a drive u can use the adapter from the old drive.
Not me after 24 hrs it chargered 40 percent that's it.
I ordered this charger and it NEVER worked with my nook. Some reviews say it will but it didn't with mine.
It's very close to the picture. I love it.
It is just a docking station for ipads and iphones. You will have to have printing installed on of the device, not the docking station.
Yes it does.
As long as you are going from one LTE USB stick to another you should be fine. With 4G LTE all the info is on a SIM card so it's easy to move from one device to another.
No you will need a SIM card which gives your Modem access to the Verizon network. You can use a SIM card from another Modem if you have one that is enabled. You will also need to download the Verizon Software to the computer that you are going to plug the Modem into.
no, just pop in the SIM card and go!
Yes
The Orion Camera mount fits on the eye piece of your optic and will secure tightly. Gun does not matter. I mounted mine on a Benjamin Marauder. Camera options are endless. It all depends on what you want to do, slow mo, high def and on and on.
I'm guessing you want to use this with some type of telescope? To mount your kodak PlaySport to? The PlaySport will only mount to this if it has a tripod screw hole on it somewhere, and if it does, then you would have to make sure you could line up the camera lens with the telescope. I hope that helps. I'm guessing that it won't work with the kodak.
Eyepiece goes in the Barlow which goes in the scope. Filters can be attached to the eyepiece or the Barlow. If you want to use the filter for any eyepiece you put in the Barlow, attach it to the Barlow. If you only want to use the filter for one eyepiece, put the filter on the eyepiece.
I gave this as a gift so I am sorry that I can't help you, although I know they have only what came with it and enjoy it as it is.
Yes. There is a controller built in which you can access through a PCI slot
No, it only fits on the Galaxy tab 10.1
It comes with a tripod, pretty sturdy and easy to use.
No it does not. You will need either a Dual Band card or a Wireless N card.
That's what mines in and it works great.
I can clearly state that I have have used this device in my radio in the 10 meter band as well as side band with much success. As I have not used this device with a HYX-100, I can not advise you in that matter. Although I can disclose that this device has exceeded my expiations. Best of luck.
I returned ours because you needed Administrator rights to not only install the software on the laptop, but also each time you used it, which is ok if you're on your home computer, but this was for work. Sorry, I can't answer your question.
It works. Probably works better with windows before 8.1. Getting driver to install on 8.1 is a problem for some reason. This is a GREAT Unit however, small and great picture once you get it installed. Newer version of the machine are probably even better but this one works OK.
I don't have one to try it with. My 700 infinity works great
Yes it will, I bought the same keyboard for my laptop and it works as good as the original.
Probably if you use this:
as long as your phone is compatible with radio which it should be
Since the unit has an auxiliary input, then yes you should be able to plug your satellite unit into this radio using a standard input cable. Now, if you use your satellite radio app on your phone, then you simply use the bluetooth connection. Of course the third way to use satellite with this unit would be to use the built in FM modulator on your satellite radio, if it is so equipped.
Yes
Yes it does that's the operating system I have believe I just plugged it in and it automatically installed
No It does not have Lightscribe. Thanks Srinivas
Yes, It can burn to a dual-layer BD-R (6x) (it can use all the way up to quad layer media)
Be careful. The fit on my daughter's kindle was poor. We gave up on it after a few days and its been in the shelf ever since.
The prints are normal looking with no designs. The only problem with my prints were that they were all dark and bad quality because my guests couldn't figure out how to use the flash.
Honestly, I can't answer that question. I use my Vello with the Nikon D7100, and don't have experience with either of the camera's you asked about. I would suspect the Vello would work, but there's no guarantee. You might wish to enquire with the good people at B&H; they also sell Vello units and are very knowledgeable about them. Wish I could have been of more help to you.
I used it on D90 and it works fine but not sure about D7100
It is, just don't hold the dryer in one place for too long.
Yes
Yes, it will work.
It does have a backup camera input as well as RCA inputs for auxiliary devices.
Yes
Are u Useing a music app? Cuz those wont work then.
to be honest, I never waited for the blue light to turn off. I would charge it for an hour or a little more and it lasts for quite sometime.
I wouldn't buy these again but yes they plug into any headphones jack
Yes it would for anything phones mp3 players anything
I don't believe you can replace them. They appear to be built in to the headphone. The only way possible to do so would be to completely take apart the headphone
Not the one I bought
It will as long as you have the screw mount (under camera) for a tripod.
this is manly to charge the battery when it goes down
Yes, a light should come on while your Kindle is charging.
It is a 4 foot long usb cable. you can swap it out for your own usb cable though.
I found they are very comfortable but they don't work. I went through 2 pairs before I gave up. Junk!!!!
Yes, the Mac Mini has the power brick included.
Bluetooth is Bluetooth. There are different generations. The Motorola keyboard will work with Windows 8.On the distance issue, as with all radio systems, the are many variables. You might get 10 meters sometimes, other times not.
i would say its a little more quiet than average ... its not silent you can still hear a noise from it but its not as bad as say a mechanical keyboard id put it a step over my laptop keyboard
I NEVER received the battery I ordered, therefore I can't answer this question!!!
I have the galaxy s4 and its great
that is what this for but i didnt like it. it was A LOT of static. it was a waste of money to purchase this exact one.
Hope you find this article helpful. https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4740340?start=0&tstart=0 Keyboard does not come with key. You have to press n and select either or &#324;. Regards
The manufacturer says it does. In fact, the list of compatibility is huge. Searh for it in their website.
Yes. you can have any # of devices connected to the repeater.
I can't get an accurate measurement without disassembling my case but if I remember correctly it was at least 8 inches. However you may want to consider a USB 3 Pin Header Extension instead of a new reader, it would be cheaper and easier to install.
Make sure that the motherboard drivers to support USB 3.0 are installed and operating correctly.
No, it does not show up in Windows 7. Can't vouch for other operating systems.
Yes. There is a stock of black in our shop.Please consider.
can be used on both
what is the question?
As long as you have a couple of free USB ports you can...
Yes.
You'll need apower inserter & a 8-way switch asdepicted here if it works. http://i.ebayimg.com/00/s/NTA0WDk5OA==/z/niwAAMXQm7FR6qzq/$T2eC16J,!yUE9s6NEGyfBR6qzqT-Kw~~60_57.JPG
Try asking your question at http://www.dbstalk.com/forum/54-directv-installationmdu-discussion/ I think you may need to provide some more details. Good luck!
No sorry I use Canon glass.
Yes this matrix is super adjustable you will not have a problem with the adjustment.
Yes!
It should work in an external enclosure just fine. But TRIM is not supported over USB (I think). You need to partition and format the drive before Windows can see it. Right click My Computer, select Manage, then go to Disk Management. This should show you if the drive is present. If the drive was partitioned and formatted prior to being inserted in the USB case, then something is wrong somewhere. The USB enclosure is bad or something is wrong with the drive.
Sorry, I do not have an answer to that.
This drive is defective and has no TRIM support, buy a Drive with a Marvell Controller or a Samsung.
Yes!
I would say yes. Taken from Corsair's product page: "Vengeance laptop memory upgrade kits are designed to work with any PC or notebook which accepts standard DDR3 SODIMMs." Taken from a review on Newegg: "Got my first stick of this RAM about a month ago. I put it in a Lenovo Z565 with AMD N660 replacing Samsung PC3 10600(1333MHz) CAS 9 Stock RAM. Took Win7 x86 memory index from 5.5 to 7.0!!!"
Answer here...yes it does
Yes it is
None
Yes, just have a power outlet and HDMI cable. Great product.
Pretty stiff, heavy duty. I would definitely have to say for out door use.
It appears to have a native resolution of 800x600 which I found on another website.
I received 5 pcs.
It will Not Work On anything! Except Laptop or USB charger. Mine had a male USB End On both Ends. Only 1 as well. No idea what the X5 stands for unless it is their model number. I only received 1 of these and trash it because it was to short to charge with and not a female USB on either end. Meaning the cable, on both ends plugs into something. Can Not Plug Anything Into Either End Of This Cable.
Yes, that's the way I installed it. Note: My light only lasted 3 months. The halogen bulbs would burn out regularly. The ends of the bulb fused with light rendering it inoperable. I bought a camera for the inside of my house for monitoring. If I buy an outdoor camera it will be of better quality.
Not good enough. Poor quality.
Thats what i thought but only one came
I bought these for a Nexus 7, and they do NOT bend in the correct direction. Sit the microusb connector on a flat surface so that the 'wide' side is facing up(with the two metal hooks). The connector bends to the RIGHT. For a Nexus 7 sitting on the dock with pogo-pins down...the connector should bend down, but theser bend so that they point UP. Good Luck finding the ones you want.
Yes it does.
Image quality is very good, but is directly related to the quality of the source content and source hardware. HD from my laptop is best. Streaming from my iPad sometimes is not full screen, depending on the app I stream from. Overall, very pleased.
Yes, ours will come with the LFF Brackets.. Thanks a lot and I hope this answers your question Scott All Computer Parts
Mine only came with low profile - even though a high profile was pictured...
This will work as long the Samsung has a DVI input connection. This is not a VGA connector, it only works with DVI not VGA.
Not sure about this. But the canon has to be thunderbolt and I don't think it has that.
It will fit the camera and your lens - and the grip, depending the size.
Yes. It will fit that camera and lens.
It might be a little snug but it might fit. We have 3 7" tablets ( a Samsung, Blackberry & a kindle HDX) and there is still room in the case with these in them.
I can only speak for my experience with the Polaroid 8 inch tablet. I purchase the stand with the USB keyboard and it worked like a charm.
I honestly don't know. I only bought it cause its compatible with my 8" Nextbook Sorry, But i still had to buy an adapter for mine. You can try using an adapter. usb to mini usb, That's what i had to do.
If your remote is configured the same as this unit. Remember, this is only a shell. It does not have any of the insides but after you have transferred all the chips and sensors, you will have a new and reliable keyfob in addition to saving you a lot of money.
There are no electronics on this key. I went to Home Depot and they don't cut keys you bring, they cut their own. I had to go to the Sears locksmith. A google search will helo you find the nearest one to you.
I wouldn't see why not it comes with te program on a disk that you install on your laptop or pc
The manual for my LG 55LW6500 states the VC-300 will also work with the 47LW5600
No
It works on 110v and 240v. Auto switiching like a laptop's power brick. Pin wise it is USA 2 pin plug. So got to find an adapter. Not sure if it will fit Dell XPS 15 touch. But it does has a few different adapter heads.
I got somewhat less than 2 hrs (but I wasn't doing much other than moving the mouse to keep the screen from going to sleep) - about what I expected. This is a basic (6-cell) battery. there are extended (9-cell) batteries that will last longer. Also important to follow the "break-in" procedure (full charge - full drain - full charge, etc). Some laptops may have to "learn" how to charge a new battery before it can do it efficiently, and fully.
I have spec-d tunning projector headlamps on my car. I see no problems when I installed these hid in them.
Miguel, I would check the internet or your Acura dealer. I own a 2002 VW New Beetle that had custom light kit placed in the car (non-factory). I purchased these lights to replace both bulbs since one burned out. The color is sightly different between manufacturers. Sorry I cannot be of more help to you regarding your MDX.
Use the "osram" online bulb fitment guide to determine the proper size bulb for your vehicle. This is JUST a pair of bulbs. No ballasts or wiring.
Not sure about Iphone but works with my Galaxy S3 & S4. Good luck.
it needs to register with the internet carrier
Hi Jeff... Not sure of the context here, got an email from Amazon saying I bought this item and might be able to help! The reason I bought this was to use my Rega as a second system in my lounge, through my hoe AV system. The phono pre om my Pioneer was not powerful enough, so I picked up this unit as a cheap alternative. Works fine, and just plugs and plays fine. as variable attenuation to make it easy to use. Hope this helps.
Mine just recently stopped scrolling altogether, but when it did scroll, I pushed the scroll button down, it moved the page up. Logitech isn't what it used to be.
No, not without some other device or extension.
Hi, it is a thunderbolt as it says on the title. The picture is not the best but it is definitely bigger than a lightning
Yes the micro USB will fit it.
Nabi
Yes, there are 2 small magnets that hold the cover closed when not in use
Yes
There are at least two different sizes of charger fittings used by HP.. It is impossible to tell without actually matching up both the computer and the charger.
I believe so I have a g6 and it works fine
Yes, it does, and an indicator on the base showing mute status. When I was using it with Windows XP, it fully integrated with Microsoft Lync, as well; but under Win7 x64, the mute on the headset is independent of Lync mute status (both work, but neither knows what the other has done). That can be a plus -- nobody else can un-mute you.
Not the 920. I believe the 930 is PC based.
No
No, it's only designed for desk top phones, not cell phones.
It is in the box.
yes. press in the headset volume lever until you hear a beep. microphone is then muted. press again to unmute
Yes the come in small Skullcandy case
I did just that. With the regular leaf I could not get my PBS station in Detroit at all. I purchased this amplified version and ran it through a 1 in and 4 out splitter, and all TV's in the house get that channel that the regular one couldn't get. AMAZING! No cable saves me over $300 a year.
All depends on what you watch. If you're looking for the basic networks as well as some PBS, you'll be fine. If you want to watch Foodnetwork, Discovery, TLC, etc you'd be best sticking with cable. There are workarounds to getting the above-mentioned networks but you'll need to subscribe to Playon
Yes, just run your channel search after switching from cable to antenna and vice versa if it doesn't work. Also the installation of the leaf is very simple...try different locations on your wall before you attach, we found that we got better reception on the east.
i dont know the ohms of the sub cause i never removed it from the box. it comes as a kit with sub and enclosure with amp and wiring that is all a mopar accessory, has all factory type connectors on the amp and sub box, so without a bunch of mods it doesnt look like itll be able to mount to an aftermarket amp
Yes it does come with what you see in this picture
Hello, It does but don't rotate it too far as it will start to unscrew! I use this on two of my telescopes and you can rotate the eyepiece for a more comfortable view as long as you are careful.
No
I just saw your note. Yes, it would work. I used what I bought as a temporary viewing solution, I would be happy to sell it to you or send you a small sample so you can play with it. (beerd at cox dot net)
It's opaque not translucent. You could see light through it. But that's about it.
well for me, I used arduino mega 2560 r3, arduino uno r3 & fez panda ii, but if I had chose only one of those to work with, I say the mega 2560 r3 it had much more extra pins & flash memory 256 KB (the uno 32KB & the panda ii 148KB). PS. arduino due has all the benefits of the mega plus more flush memory & clock speed if you don't want to buy this instant the arduino tre looks very interesting, but I don't know the release date they only say it's coming soon http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardTre
No. The board can be powered through USB, and you can purchase an external battery pack or wall wart to provide DC power away from a computer.
3rd graders can do much more than we ever could. The UNO may also be a good option as I used the MEGA for a mechatronic project that had quite a digital and analogue points.
No
Yes i have a galaxy s5 same size as your phone
Absolutely. I installed a 2TB drive in mine 6 months ago. Works like a charm.
Hi, From the information given, I believe you will are looking for a different cable. This cable can extend a printer cable. Most printers use a cable that has USB-A to USB 2.0-B connectors. This is because routers with USB printing support normally have a USB-A connector. Most printers with USB interface is through a USB-B 2.0 port. Best regards, Bargain Cable
I don't know I used it on a PC
Even if it does, I suggest not buying it. The sound and mic quality is horrible and they break easily!
You can view your Screen image of what ever you are watching on apple device. Except for any software that is used for movies. You can not watch hulu, netflix, or cable media. So when you ask if you can view your IOS, I am assuming you meant, can you view what you are watching on your apple devise on your computer.
Should be able to. I run Astros but they have similar hookups
No, it uses rechargeable ones. You could use two projectors and a special adapter I think, but polarized usually requires a special screen.
just place it on top and it will stay there. no effort at all.
Yes it does. I believe it can take up to 16 pictures.
It is supposed to come with one, however when I received my package everything was missing. The store I received it from refunded me for all that was missing
It is a very good camera but I would not call it a professional camera.
Yes, has built-in mic. Haven't used it so don't know about the quality. Everything else works great, and is small enough to use in my car.
very very little, just enough to insert a cv/dvd.
No, it does not.
Yes it Will work with both 1080p and 4K.
If you'll read the product description, you'll find that the answer is yes. Supports 50-600 KHz, and 4K res.
I had RCA red ,white,and yellow,didn't work for me !
It's not waterproof. You could only use it outside if it was completely protected from the rain .
It's not great. It works but can be hard to understand at times. But for the price it's probably about right.
Sure, it's got room for two 140mm fans. Although, I opted for the Hyper212 EVO.
Not a common question, but, yes. It will lay still on a flat surface. But, considering the way your HDD is inserted in the case, if you use HDD in your system, it might not be a good idea to let the disk spinning at 7200rpm vertically.
I'm using a Gigabyte Z97X-UD3H-BK - fits fine. From the looks of the 2 R9 270 GPU crossfire I see no problem. You will have room to spare.
you can only hookup One router to this modem.. as far as router connections I think you mean how many eternet conection..and that depends on your router mine has 8...
Not without extra attachments and plates.
I'm not sure exactly... it's definitely not 1/4-20 standard... my guess is that it's 1/8th -- it's pretty small.
Hey Kim. Yes you can. What you need is an adaptor which apple sells on line. It should have hdmi on one end and whatever the display port is for your macbook on the other. I've also done this with this projector with my iphone and ipad to watch movies with an adaptor that has the multi pin apple ios port on one side and hdmi on the other. The projector has worked well for me, just make sure that the short throw distance of this model is appropriate for your space- the screen is huge at longer distances.
Yes, but It died very soon (7 months ) after I purchased. Very disappointing as my original Acer Aspire one lasted years and worked well. Now I using a chromebook and I love it. It works well for my purposes.
Yes, connected easily
It's good enough for me. I'm very happy with this product and very satisfied.
They should because these also come with a chord that you can plug into the device if you can't establish a Bluetooth connection.
Sorry, that I can't answer. These binoculars fit me fine and I know of several other people that have them.
Please visit this very informative website: http://www.birdwatching-bliss.com/nikon-monarch-binoculars.html They have a good comparison of several Nikon Monarch binos, charts and videos. Happy birding!
Yes.
Yes, this device will solve your problem if you set it up according to the directions and make sureto locate it centered between your wireless router and the TV. I have a setup like yours and have no problems.
Honestly, I do not remember if it did or not. I am NOT an IT guy and it was very easy to set up using the web interface. You can search online for the instruction manual before purchase.
Yes, any video (or DSLR) camera that outputs HDMI while operating works but, the LiveShell is only SD Video quality encoding. You need to go with the LiveShell Pro or Livu product from Teradek to take advantage of the HD out of the camera.
Yep...had mine since April 2012 and still going strong. Great little Radio. 73 de N5CSU.
when purchased new these come with adapters to suit c type power. But I would call linksys support to be sure this setup will work.
Arca Swiss type mount.
I say yes! The field of view is larger than my built-in cam on my desktop computer and the resolution is higher.
yes you can record 8 continuous hours because I leave mine on in my office and it is setup for motion sensor recording continuously
Only AA NiCD and NiMH rechargeable batteries of any brand. Not AAA...
Meaning? It recharges batteries that are supposed to be recharged so that part of it is green. Not really sure what you are asking?
I don't know. I ended up throwing my HDE Cassette Deck away. It never worked very good for me. Paid $80 for a new tape deck that I can actually use....WD
Yes, I use it on my Windows 7 powered laptop.
Yes, it is.
Yes, the N3-C works fine with the series nikon d3xx, d5xx, d7xx and d600. The n3-c is better than the original nikon geottager specially on very rougged terrain.
Dear customer, Yes, the N3-c can work with Nikon CoolPix7800, because: 1/ We have CoolPix 7700, it is OK; 2/ A customer reported to us that his P7800 does work with N3-c; 3/ The N3-c is Compatible with Nikon GP-1 and also has more functions than it. Thank you! Dauphinus Team
Feels like neoprene (wetsuit material). Sort of soft and spongy.
No
I do know as of yet I have not used it but it is well made and my power shot Is a little bit to big for the camera I do not yet it is a bit small for the power shot and two extra batterie .
To remove the filter from your lens you have to unscrew it holding the bottom part of the lens, not the top part because the top part adjust only the polarization of the filter. I hope this will help you Rejean
I don't know if it could be used with a Nikon1 J3, but it does not have a mini USB connector.
1. Yes it shuts off automatically. 2. The mouse is laser. 3. http://www.logitech.com/product/wireless-mouse-m510
I cannot remember...maybe 6 months. I sent an request for info back to amazon and they forwarded it to the seller and they responded directly back to me. Sorry I cannot remember
No. Speaker cables never are, but the signal should only be going from your receiver to your speakers.
It is completely sealed and the isolation is thick enough, so I guess there is no problem to use this cable with outdoor speakers. However I would use some banana plugs terminals (if your speakers accept them) to protect the exposed cooper from the weather and bugs and prolong the life of the connection.
There is no center post
Yes you can definetly mount it on the 60D, I actually use it for that camera!
very good for night photography.
No. Looks like a giant bluetooth ear peice. Works wonderfully.
It works for me--going from hdmi on the output of my amplifier to the vga input on my projector
The adapter can convert digital HDMI signal into analog VGA video and audio signal With this converter, the DVD player, PS3, XBOX360, and some other video devices which with HDMI output can connect to large HD screens or HD projectors with VGA input The product only changes the signal format from digital to analog, but doesn't have impact on the quality of input signal.It supports input and output to the maximum of 19201080 resolution Support HDMI1.3 version (compatible with 1.0/1.1/1.2), automatic detection HDCP
Many satellites are listed in its database,also you can add a new satellites just by adding its location/degree.for example 113.0W etc.
Yes, I use it with a desktop that had no WiFi.
It should help for sure, this is exactly what I use it for but in a marina and it works great!
yes it would.
Yes
No. It does not have tripod screw hole.
25 watts total.
no
This item never worked. They never back me the money.
Hi Jeremy: All I can tell you is what I have used them for. That is to hook a Blu-Ray DVD player to an Epson 82C projector. For that, it works fine. It took me a good bit of investation work just to find a converter that would go from digital to analog. Seems most of the converters on the market go the other way. Good luck! Paul.
I compared 3 units, including this one, they all work. But the unit from J&R did a better job, better quality image. http://www.amazon.com/ViewHD-Universal-Composite-S-Video-Converter/dp/B00AQ4HF7G
The power key is located on the left side of this device directly above the volume keys. If you are still the process of purchasing this Inwould keep looking.
Not at all just don't rip out of the wall and you be alright
No, microphone is built-in.
You can import videos directly to your computer if they are in the standard format only. If you wish to import viedos in the HD format, you will need the proper CODEC to do so. Sony Play Memories software includes this CODEC. In my case, I used this software from Sony to import and view HD videos in my laptop. The thing is, in my case, I could not get Play Memories software to run under Windows Vista. I had to resort to using Windows XP. I hope this helps you. Good luck!
I haven't use this yet.
NTSC
It comes with a Sony battery and a charger with it.
Yes, I use mine to record my pastors sermon on Sunday and connect the sound board to the camera and it works great. This is a very good camera.
Yes as stated by others it does come with the attachment as shown in the product picture but it is merely a snap on sort of light sheild. IMHO not very useful attachment for a small camera like this as it makes the camera look bulky. It works without it. It is not a wide angle attachment as one might think. It is just a plastic snap-on more or less like "flower" type lens hood found in DSLRs to avoid flare when stray light strikes the front element from bright light sources.
No case, SD card, etc.... Has a but in USB cable to make transferring video files to your computer easy and also comes with a charger. After that, nothing else.
I has HDMI, USB and a A/V R ports. The A/V R port looks like 10 pin video output.
It's reasonable...for the average user.
Comes with a battery, wrist strap, transfer cable, and charger, but no memory card, and no carry case. You'll need to buy a memory card of course ($10 to $15), and I HIGHLY recommend some kind of protective carrying case to at least protect the LCD screen. I just bought a soft case to protect the screen (about $10), but you can get better ones that'll help protect it from falls or drops. Absolutely essential to at least protect that screen though, so even a cheap one (with soft inside liner) is better than nothing.
Although you've probably already purchased a camera, the DSC-HX10V comes with an AC adapter that charges the battery in the camera through an included USB cable. That said, there are plenty of NP-BG1 battery chargers availabe if you wish to charge the battery outside of the camera.
My experience--Excellent HD video ! And you can zoom in and out while recording.
Yes it does, in the settings menu.
for us is working great, a full charge can manage to take +300 pics and the usual "let me see it" review
SDHC
I never checked as I already had Photoshop already in my computer, sorry
The charger works on 120 or 240 volts, 50 or 60 cycles. You don't do anything to switch from one voltage to the other.
You can put your camera on the continuous shooting mode and as long as you depress the button, it will continue to shoot. I do not think you can set the self timer to automatically do the same.
I bought this camera and the screen stopped working only after using it a few days. Sony would not cover the repair, stating that I must have done something to cause the problem. I would not recommend buying this product. Unfortunately, I researched the camera AFTER buying it and found that many other consumers had the same complaint. This was my first bad experience with a Sony product.
I did not need to disable the internal Wi-Fi on my Dell desktop or Macbook Air. However I believe the instructions do say to disable it. I would try it without disabling first.
This is only the CASE to the fob. It uses the internals of an original fob. Two fobs I had broke off the loop for the key chain and these worked perfectly to fit the internal electronics. I changed the battery too. This is only the plastic case not a functional fob.
The longest clip I've recorded was around 20 minutes. I never received any warning about a time limit. I've always figured that it was based on the battery life and storage space in my SD Card, which it does tell you how much time is left given those two factors.
No it does not work well. I had to return my battery.
No unfortunately not. But still love the case!
Yes Shelley P this system does work on the front point security system. Call up the 800 number and asked them to walk threw the setup with you. It's painless.
The alarm is designed to be plugged into your wall like any other appliance. If you have a bit of electrical knowledge you could hard wire it. I simply plugged mine in since I had an open receptacle. Hope this helps.
Yes, this will fit. You will need the proper mounting kit, wiring harness, and antenna adaptor to make it work, though. You can find all of these on amazon for somewhere between 20.00 to 25.00.
I would say it should work with them. As long as its the right size. The holder is adjustable by a little bit. I would not reccomend this product, it fell apart shortly after barely using it. The stand breaks off and the holders become loose.
I'm not sure. I know it works with android devices.
Absolutely. There are several on YouTube showing this stabilizer with various camera systems.
You can wrest your hand on the tablet while you write, without issue.
I don't know what you mean by "drop protection" but I bought the three year extended warranty which I normally wouldn't do for personal equipment. It's my business computer.
Comes with 1 year Samsung Warrenty
you can buy it today
The very short cord is wrapped around an indented area on the bittom of the speaker. I LOVE this speaker BTW.
I use it with my Nexus 4, so I don't see why it wouldn't work with the Nexus 7.
This case is designed specifically for the Nook book and Nook color. It will fit your BNTV250 perfectly.
Hi, Unfortunately the case is only available in black. Thank you. Kindest Regards TheSnugg
We bought this so long ago for our grandson that I would not have a clue. I have a Nook and my husband has a Kindle (3 generations old). He doesn't think so.
Hi, As far as I know they never set the Zi12 in full production. This listing is legit however, the product exists, so someone probably got hold of the few(?) ones that were actually made. If you buy it (like I did) there will be no support from Kodak or firmware updates etc. The camera in itself is wonderful and works perfectly though!
Yes
Dust is always a problem but the case is very quite. My h75 fits just fine. The motherboard might be tight but this case is built to take most boards. Check the specs to ensure it is supported. I highly recommend this case.
This fan makes very little noise. At best, it is a slight "whirring" sound. I too need a fan to help me go to sleep and I would not sure this fan for that purpose.
I do not have this device
No it unfortunately doesn't work with an antenna. There is a tivo that does, though: https://www.tivo.com/discover/antenna
Nope, it's only for iPhone 4 or 4s
I never been in Afghanistan but this unlocked of Huawei is wonderful. Just put sim card of any network, it'll work. I used it in mali and guinea
I really don't know. I know you can't use it for a camera but it might work on a scanner since nothing is moving like it would on a camera. Go to a Best Buy store and as the Geek Squad. I just dealt with them two weeks ago and I'm very satisfied with how they work. At least in the Kankakee/Bourbonnais store.
I am not sure whether it would fit or not, but it only worked about 3 months for me. I would suggest looking for a more expensive unit with some sort of guarantee.
12
It's a 3.5mm jack.
I had the "sudden stop" happen a couple of times. I had been using the "power off" button on the remote, thinking that doing this forced a "hard reboot"; it would restart the unit but didn't fix the problem. Now I use the power button on the back of the unit to turn it off after I've finished watching something and turn it back on using the same button; I have not had the "video stop problem" since.
Yes it is rechargeable. I have had my for almost a year. I put mine in a dry bag and run a fish finder off of the batter on my kayak. I also bought the battery tender 021-0123 junior battery charger. I have only had to charge the battery once in the year I have had it. My trips are somewhere between 6-8 hours long two to there time a month in warm months.
Dave I have a lowarance fish finder and I use this little battery all day without a major drop in its charge!! I use a couple of alligator clips like those used on a circuit tester, they do not get over heated and I do not use any type fuses. You can probably check the manuals on your equipment to see what size fuse, maybe a fuse say 10 amps should be just fine. I have charged and re-charged this little battery many times and still performs perfect. butch
Hello, It is a wired keyboard. Rehab Solutions
2.54 cm per inch. 12 inches per foot. 6 Ft X 12 in/Ft X 2.54 cm/in = 183 cm or 1.83 meters.
no idea
I use this cable with my Nikon 7000, but one of the problems you are going to have is that the computer doesn't provide what's called "phantom power" which is power from the source. If you want a mic to computer cable, I found this to be a great solution: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050CEEIW/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. It provides both power to the XLR mic and works really well with both instruments and vocals.
yes, it's 1/8 of an inch TRS to XLR so the signal is balanced.
It's a marker so you can tell which wire is which on both ends. You can use it however you want according to your application. I always use the marked wire as positive, but so long as you use the same wire on both ends, or throughout for the same purpose you will be fine.
Probably 5mm wide by about 3 thick, best guess
As of December 2014 the Amazon description states: "Material: CCA - Copper Clad Aluminum (The top of the cable where the data transfers is copper and the base metal is aluminum)".
This is a good computer though, i would recommend to play this for gaming because i7 lets you make and play smoother games such as. cod or black ops, and if intel hd 3000 has i7 core, you will max out settings. this is a i7 quad core processor
it should hold a 100+ full dvd movies with extra content and over 200 movies if you are one of those people who download from those torrent sites ;)

Got it as a gift for a family member, she said it doesn't include a SD card, so she had to buy one. Battery charges via USB, so she didn't have to buy a battery.
Yes, definitely it will connect up to 30 km but must have line of sight for connection.
I have two mounted than 45 deg. with excellent signal strength. The distance bet. them is about 30"
I do a lot of geocaching and the XGPS150 works great. The navagation program I mostly use is called copilot and it does have voice directions but I don't think that has anything to do with the XGPS150 but with the program. I have not tried it with google maps but again that would depend on if google maps supports voice directions. I am using it with 2 different iPads, a 2 and a mini and it works great on both. Not sure if this will help you or not but I hope so. PS, I am using iOS7.1
Yes, it works. I use this on my wifi-only ipad for off-road use and it works fantastic.
Doubtful, I think. For the size reasons already mentioned, and because the Bluefin is shaped so the Apple devices mount using their protruding battery compartments.
The ear cushion measures 3 in. high
I am not sure as I do not have a galaxy 10.1
Nvidia geforce gt 640 has twice the ram and a higher cuda count for just a little more. I bought the diamond card and was disappointed with it. Useless for modern gaming but decent for Blu ray.
the only games I play are through steam. civ4 and 5 and portal. both work quite well with this
It handles very, very well. I watch netflix off this motherboard all the time on my lcd tv
any 800 and 1800 band should work, just check out which band your cell phone use.
Its: 11-TELYHD-01-01
Yes. It's a canon EF mount lens. It will fit any crop or full sensor body.
Yes, there are other waterproof headphones that you can get. I bought the pyle and there was too much static. Maybe spending a little more money on them will help with unit.
No. The iKross extension is a great device to keep kids easy and having fun. I love it
It's micro USB.
As long as the tab 3 has a micro slot it should - but with one important caveat ... if you have a case on the tab 3 the case very likely will not allow the very short plug on this device to reach the slot.
I would say fairy quiet, it's not as quite as the silicon ones, but definitely better than many logitech keyboards. the best way is to go to the shop a try it out, I did that.
That key is not on the keyboard. Not sure what you are asking, sorry.
It tilts but does not fold
We don't use an ipad mini with it, but I cannot imagine this not working with any tablet in either position. I just tried it with my 7inch Kindle and it is fine so should be fine with the mini. By the way, it works with our Kindle and a full size ipad and both are in thin cases. No problem.
yes that is what I use it for!
Yes. Adjustable, fades when not in use, comes up when used. RR
I had that happen, I just reverted to the factory driver and I haven't had any trouble since.
theres no usb port can use 12 volt. all of them only can carry (originaly) 5 volts.
I don't think it will work due to the angel, Its designed to be mounted on the trunk lid...seems like if you mount it on the tailgate you will only have a vertical view of your bumper which im sure your not interested in. My suggestion would be to get a license plate cam, thats what I have used in the past for truck and works perfect!
From what I remember when I installed this it was not mirrored
This is a 4x2 kit.
No they are not however they do isolate sound quite well and are comfortable. Real leather ones would set you back a bit more than these.
Yes, the exact same ones.
I will put them up on Amazon - look for them by noon EST 12-11-13
Yes. I bought this pack for my FZ70.
My iPhone 5s barely fits. Don't know the size difference between that and the Galaxy.
No
It is the vivatar. I tried to post that in the review and it was rejected. So far no problems but this is definitely misrepresented.
Yes
No, autofocus doesn't work. You have to set the camera to manual mode and manually focus. However, it's not that difficult once you activate the zooming mode to help you focus.
Yes it will. It fit mine perfectly
Yes just as long as its 7"
iPad chargers are dual voltage. You don't need a transformer for them.
It looks like the curling iron is rated at 85 Watts, which would make it unusable with this product. Its rated 50 Watts Maximum or 35 continuous.
I purchased this in Oct 2013 and it came with an AC adapter.
This is how this device is supposed to work: buy a stand-alone SIM card from a GSM cellphone carrier (such as AT&T or T-Mobile--whichever has better reception in your area), activate the SIM card, and insert the SIM card into this listening device. Then follow the instructions on the manual (or the instructions posted in a certain customer review for this product on Amazon.com). I hope this helps and I'm sorry I am not proficient enough in Spanish to answer in Spanish. Good luck.
Hi Oscar. seve your money the device work the first time you set it up charge it put in the youy sym card. then it dose not do another thing. I think they should stop seling them. I am A P.I Out of Barbados.
Yes
It's a universal fit, so it should be okay. The hook-and-loop (velcro) elastic band stretches pretty far.
Yes, the WTR-C works with Pentax K-30. For further assistance, please email support@satechi.com. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
The controller uses 2 AAA's. The wireless device uses a CR2. I've been using the Satechi to do time-lapse of a construction project connecting the controller directly to the camera and the AAA's last a long time. Thousands of frames and the batteries work fine. I haven't used the wireless feature and can't speak to that.
The maximum number is programable exposures is 399. However, there is also an infinite setting for endless exposures.
No it does not..I wrote the company and they did not answer...
I'm not sure, but it fit on both lenses for my canon rebel ts2i
According to some pictures of batteries for the G560 here in Amazon, I would say NO.
It's only suitable to sit on a desk or flat surface. If you want to put it on the wall or ceiling you need the mounting kit.
It is NOT bluetooth. I think it might work with your M3d550KD but I am not sure. Call vizio customer number and they will confirm
7.5 deep X 17 wide x 26 long
Not the one I purchased
No
Yes, nothing to buy either. It comes with the single optic cable or you can use the included RCA cables
As of today they have been installed for 3 months and still flashing.
Unfortunately, I don't ship overseas.
The Sims 2 does run on this laptop.
I believe it is compatible with any computer that has a VGA or DVI connection.
Yes.
it should. cause i am able to run games flawlessly so it should handle well
It is dual layer capable. Be patient, though. It depends on the application for the speed.It's touchy.
Yes. That is what I have!
No
I would believe there would be a one-year warranty
I'm not entirely sure on that. The replacement includes a new LCD along with the digitizer. My first thought would be it wouldn't. It sounds like a problem within the display driver which doesn't come with the replacement. However, the replacement is cheap enough to give it a try.
my desk is pretty skinny, around 18mm thick laminated fiberboard kind. It mounts fine though it leans a little forward with 2x 24" led screens. The screens are at a height of 220mm above the desk so that contributes to the lean. A workaround I can think of is adding one or two more scrap wood boards underneath the desk upon using the clamp.
I think it should, both are 1333MHz. They have been working great for over a year in my 13" MBP 2011. Here is an install guide: for the 27" http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iMac+Intel+27-Inch+EMC+2429+RAM+Replacement/7570 for the 21": http://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iMac+Intel+21.5-Inch+EMC+2428+RAM+Replacement/5660
Yes. I run the signal from my DSL modem into the adapter and to my office where I run an Ethernet cable from the adapter to my router and transmit wireless to the whole house. My office is more central to the house and the router works great from there.
It contains both mapa and application. This the latest version but is 4 years old. Chrysler does not support this version anymore. I doubt whether it will work in a 2014 Gran Creokee. That is a different GPS system. Google it you will find the right one.
Yes
According to the Dell manual the power supply is only 305W and it does have the pcie slot, but I wouldn't want to be below the recommended power limit. It seems from the drawings it has a standard type power supply so I would recommend upgrading the power to at least 500W but personally when I replace power supplies I go 600W.
I am not sure about that, but I do not recommend this if you want to do ANY kind of gaming, there are way better options out there. Not sure what you mean about low profile but if you mean size, the thing was significantly smaller than my 2600xt and that one fit into a small sized tower. Hope this helps but honestly, I don't recommend this card to anyone for anyreason. Stick with MSI, EVGA, Saphire, Gigabyte or ASUS. A few extra bucks will go a long way. And definitely try to get GDDR5
It should. Most HDMI ports are built for that much like the R/W/Y and R/G/B cord sets. It is designed to be that way. Yes, it will work. I have tested it on a 42" HDTV and the sound comes right through.
Yes, works great! I use mine at work all day. I can't beleave the batt life. Should get a coupler for it too, I fine I'm plugging male head phone jack to another a lot.
You will need to use your original charger. Mine didn't come with a new one.
That might be a question for Acer or your owners manuel. You might want to check their compatibility list to make sure that the screw holes will line up and connector is the equivalent. My Acer was an older model.
Yes it will... the have the same pin setup... but it mount from the bottom so you have to be careful bending it
No headphone jack. I'm not sure what you would even use it for. This device doesn't transmit any kind of sound. It's an input device for your computer and TV, VCR, DVD player, ect.
The Price is controlled by HP
Hewlett Packard 64GB Slate 2 Tablet PC, HP Slate Dock, Case, HP Digital Pen, 2x 30W AC Adapter, and Software Bundle
Unfortunately no, the USB plug is how the speakers get power, so it would need to be plugged in, in order for the speakers to be turned on.
there are holes on the back , keep in mind they are very small ( so if the hoes do not work out you can use double sided tape
It will have the basic functions, however it also comes with a downloadable driver for the Mac, so the answer is yes.
This camera use battery (serie H) not FV
I bought it for mac book pro 13.3 inch and it fits very neatly. It is not a tight fit' I am satisfied with the fit. Not sure about the air. Sorry
yes it will work with Iphone.
It has a USB plug right in it.
It's actually a 1920x1080p....the display is also LED backlit...the screen is REALLY nice; HD photos/ video looks amazing on this laptop.
I don't know. I had the Kindle touch and the cover did not fit
I'm sorry but it won't fit a Kindle Keyboard.
Hi Karen what I can tell you about the cover is that when I received it, my kindle didn't fit into the cover. Bottom line, what was advertised and what I received were two different items. I returned the cover.
Radio is FM only. I have had two of these and quality if very poor & customer service non existant.
Yes I use it daily with ps4 controller. Only thing, when setting the sound of ps4 controller to "chat" audio only the left side works. However if you set the audio to "all sound" you can hear through both. I think it was part of the design but it should and will work with ps4.
I am not sure but this one definitely will. http://www.amazon.com/Eathtek%C2%AE-Dealheroes-Replacement-Keyboard-Layout/dp/B006Q6X50O/ref=cm_cd_al_qh_dp_t After I looked for a second I realized it was the same keyboard. My bad. But it will definitely work.
Yes it is compatible ... for you're laptop .....
yes , and it is really easy to do.. watch a video...
The conection it's the same for almost of the laptop of the g series. Just make sure the keyboard looks exactly like the one that you have, my sister has a g6 and before I order this keyboard, I put her keyboard on my laptop to prove the problem. So I don't see any reason why it won't work.
A Sata Hard drive are very easy to come by in many sizes. Just seach amazon for a SATA hard drive and pick your size. Be sure to check what type of sata drive you need. I think this unit needs a SATA 2 or 3. I purchased a 400GB hard drive and it works great. Something like this ... http://www.amazon.com/Black-320-Mobile-Hard-Drive/dp/B001CO3EKQ/ref=sr_1_9?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1365438733&sr=1-9&keywords=sata+2+hard+drive
No. But you can get a 12v to ac plug
Yes. It will fit snug at first. But the leather will eventually give and it will be just right :)
Yes it works great for a basic line
I think it may work for your machine. You may give it a try.If it does not work you may request a refund. The customer care is excellent.
the keyboard is Bluetooth so it will work with any tablet or Bluetooth device. However i could not tell you if your tablet would fit in the carrying case. sorry i dont know anyone with a tab 2 to test it with
I chiecked with Invellop. The wake/sleep problem is now fixed. The following is their reply. Yes, it has been fixed. The black once is available at this moment, and colored once will be available this Saturday. Sincerely, INVELLOP
Its just a blank replacement without the electronic chip inside. I used it to replace my worn out and beat up shell by getting the key cut at a home improvement store and then stuffed the chip in from the old one.
Not remotely true, nonsense. I have the D800 and a YN-565EX, and they work fine together. On hot shoe, or as a wireless remote, with my other Nikon flashes. It will work on any Nikon DSLR with iTTL - any after the D1, any since 2003.. Certainly will work with any current Nikon DSLR.
I use this for direct genie and my slingbox. It does broadcast in high Def
Yes, 2 coax cables for stereo audio plus 3 coax for component video (YPbPr)
the usb on the thinkpad and tablet are the same so it will work
Yes, no cable needed, it's wireless.
Yes.
It is only HD ready so yes would need to buy an accessory to have that feature.
Yes
Sounds like it is bad...I have used mine on 2 MSI boards and 3 asus boards and have had readouts on all to where I could fix the problem.
I used it to create gift cards for our store, will not work with POS I don't think?
Yes
16 or 18 gauge wire will work. I am using 18 gauge wire on mine.
dont know ours broke 5 months after we bought it
Yes
The first step is make the voltages on your original power adapter match that of this adapter, if you don't have the original adapter you may be able to find the voltage info on the bottom of the laptop.Make sure it's rated at 19volts,3.42 amps @ 65 watts like this adapter is
I'm not completely sure.I know that some of the theatrical showings In 48 frames that may or may not be the problem.maybe someone else can answer with a definite yes.
they're not perfect. they do a pretty good job blocking out ambient light. the best way is to try them out for yourself each room and viewing environment Is different. you could always return them if they're not satisfactory.
Sorry, US map only.
It comes with 83/200 transducer.. Im using it depths reaching more than 60 fts and still working nicely.. But im not really depending on the fish finder for fishing.
Yes, it works great
The manufacturer or distributor will need to advise on whether it will work with that model. They should have a cross reference for the different model numbers.
180 flat
No
If your tv is not 3d you can't watch 3d movies even with a 3d blu ray, the tv does not have the capability to transmit 3d
Amazon forwarded this question to me via email, but I don't know the answer.
It only designed for iPad 3 and possible fit for iPad 2 and would NOT fit for mini iPad 3 because there is so different size and thickness.
It is for ipad 2 3 4 generation.
Yes it supports DTS and Dolby Digital surround sound (5.1/6.1). Don't know about 7.1 as my receiver doesn't have that.
you should be able to do so but it may depend on your operating system software
A quick google search for britta products foubd a website and phone number 562-209-8270 pacific time 9to5 , m-f. Explain what u need I am sure they will help out.
In the license agreement, it says one portable and one desk top. I'm assuming that Microsoft thinks one student will have both.
Yes, it does.
You must have a university email (example@email.vccs.edu). The code to activate this product is not included with this item. Microsoft will email that code to a university email and without you will NOT be able to activate your software, deeming it absolutely useless.
If I remember I had to enter the school code (it is a number for the school) I am sure you can get it from their tech support.
No, it did not. It does come with the belt clip. I strongly suggest getting the Invisible Shield for Garmin G6 to protect the screen.
Hi Stephen, Thanks for the inquiry! From the home screen, you will need to click on "settings" button. Then find the "voice settings" area and adjust it to whatever male voice you desire. In addition, you may want to adjust the volume settings too if you haven't tried that. I know I like to listen to music when I drive, so I typicially have to turn it up pretty loud. I hope this helps!
A LOT.....................................period...................................................
Yes it does...
It is a fixed position & will not turn tv but the tv will slide left & right on the mount
I have a 32 and can see maybe an inch along the bottom. Might be something you could bring down a little as there is some excess asking the top. To be honest it doesn't bother me and neither me or my husband are real good with that stuff. Just happy the tv is still on the wall :)
Yes
I bought that pen to use on my iPad and iPhone but it wouldn't work. I still have it if your interested I will send it to you. Let me know it just sits in the cupboard.
10-10-10-30
It does work. I used it running win 7. 64 bits. but the intefase its horrible. I wouldn't recommend it.
This MP3 can only be charged by plugging into a computer with the supplied adapter.
No. This is better for close-up photography. You would be better off with a speed lite.
Just the camera. The SD card you have to buy separate. It uses double AA batteries and there's no case. I think it did have a mini USB cord to connect to the computer. Not sure though, it's been a while since I first bought it.
The one we purchased did.
29 minutes
Not sure what you mean. If you are talking about red eye reduction, then yes, you can set the built in flash to fire a pre-flash before the flash. Do not know if it will synch with the Canon. I have not had to use a remote flash. Hope this helps.
I scored the deal yesterday and have it in hand today. Serial Number 33.......... This tells me that it was produced in 2013, 3rd quarter so it definitely is the new sensor. It doesn't exibit lens droop or unwind. There is a little play in the lens when extended, but not like I saw on Utube videos of the problem. Battery is charging and I'm fired up!
You could totally use this item connect it to your 360 and stream to twitch. The software that it comes with makes it extremely simple to stream straight to twitch without having to do anything else. If you want to use a second monitor to display you Xbox game play but you don't need it. The stream displays what you're playing on the screen so you don't have to use a second monitor if you don't want to.
Mine does not retract & does have a cap.
No, this one is a data plug, and doesn't have the power pins.
Yes they would work fine. Lightweight and pretty comfortable.
yes, the device and work in cab-over truck camper situation.
That's the ground wire so any place that's metal.
Sell it or junk it. I had to by a better system, still wirelesss but much better. Chech with Tadibrothers Team 2376 Westwood Blvd, Los Angeles CA 90064 Toll Free: 866.966.5550, Fax: 310.728.6596 Their 5th wheel back-up systems.
Yes, it worth it. Have far less chromatic aberrations, more definition across all the frame, and weights far less. This lens is very good starting F1.8, but at the range F4-F8 it shines, even better than Nikkor 105 mm F1.8, which was my previous sharper lens
I have not owned that lens so I can not tell you. I would say that the 85 can be occasionally slow to focus in comparison to my 50 1.8d.
Yes
With this kit, yes you'd have to buy the bluetooth dongle separately. No navigation is fine. Check out Grom's website to find what kit is best for you. They have kits geared towards iPhone and Android phones, kits that already come with bluetooth, etc. I went with this kit for its charging capabilities, the aux cable to connect to any phone or mp3 player, and added bluetooth for hands free calling and wireless music. They may have better kits out now
I think this would be an excellent camera to start off with. The camera is low price for what you get and the manual settings are great. This camera in my opinion can teach you a lot about photography.
I am currently driving three WD My Book hard discs from the hub (2 Tb, 1Tb, 0.5 Tb), plus a printer and a scanner with no problems.
No
The board is an ATX board according to Amazon (http://www.amazon.com/Asus-Z87-PRO-1150-Motherboard/dp/B00CRJSXR4) so it will fit.
Yes
No LEDs on the included fans. The included fans are quiet enough. My CPU fan is louder than both of them. As for coolness, I have all the fan slots filled so... yes? I think its a decent case for the price. It's got enough space for most GPU's and plenty of space for cables.
It does not, only 3.5" covers on the entire face of the case. No filters behind the grill ether so be prepared for a lot of dust inside, since I'm using a arm processor for a media server with passive cooling I don't have clean it as often as my main PC.
From my research the heads are all compatible along the series.
NO PAPERWORK NOR DISKS CAME WITH THE ORDER
These binoculars are great for long distances but not for close range. Good focus starts at 40-50 ft
Feels like two pounds.
Depends on the kid, but they are full sized binoculars, if they are small kids too big to carry, might work if you handed it them to look through.
Depends on the kid, but they are full sized binoculars, if they are small kids too big to carry, might work if you handed it them to look through.
They weigh 27 to 34 ounces depending on which size you get. Most are around 27 ounces so just over a pound and a half.
Yes, wide comfortable neck strap on binoculars is included. Loved these--lightweight, clear and strong enough, took them on a cruise to Alaska last summer, they were great for seeing the bald eagles, and other sights.
Yes, probably will .
I wish I can tell you I remembered, but the screw thread that goes into the shoulderpad shattered, rendered this whole setup useless, on the first day I used it.
You can, but not through an HDMI cable. I had to get these to make it work: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004C4WPXA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00016W75E/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Once I did, it worked like a dream.
I had a similar issue and contacted my ISP. The rep tested the signal strength and told me it was low because I had one of their older cable modems. He upgraded it at no charge and I haven't had any problems since. My cable company is notorious for always upgrading their hardware, but only new customers get it until you complain. Hope this helps.
Nope.
I have just the one surround sound so I can't say what's best. I can say that my Yamaha srround sound system is great with it. Of course source material takes consideration. Standard TV is okay, but my computer, Wii U, and PS3 sound fantastic.
Hi Minilith, firmware upgrade for this Sony BDPSX910 is being done using a disc (CD) only, Using a flash drive on a USB port will not work. -Ely
No, there is no option to lighten or darken the picture.
Yes and no, you can set it to night mode which helps a bit but there is no bass up, down control and it's very powerful, I would not reccomend for an apartment. But you can set up the surround sound bass level for each individual speaker in the settings. By far the best system for the money!
Its says its wireless but what they meant is that your rear speakers don't connect into the main console. Its still wired but the rear speakers uses wires that plug into a seperate console that you can place anywhere. The rear speaker console and main console feed a wireless connection to one another. I hope this helps, its kinda hard to describe.
Since the blue ray player is also the sound device it will accept 3 hdmi inputs. It also has 1 hdmi output for your TV.
Sony BDPS790 Blu-Ray Player not honoring External subtitle and closed caption for all video streams. It supports External Subtitile only for AVI video format. Sony support keeps big silence for this kind of queries.
The BDPS790 3D is a good player for 3D movies but you need a good 3d hi def tv and also a paired 3d glasses.
OK I found this on the operating manual and I do not believe it will play mp3 on DVD disc. From the manual: Discs that cannot be played * BDs with cartridge * BDXLs * DVD-RAMs * HD DVDs * DVD Audio discs * PHOTO CDs * Data part of CD-Extras * Super VCDs * Audio material side on DualDiscs * A disc recorded in a color system other than NTSC, such as PAL (this player conforms to the NTSC color system).
If the TV has a HDMI input, yes
I currently have them plugged into the Sony STR-DE697 no problems. I was looking to upgrade to Onkyo or Yamaha, but the new Sony network receivers look great at the price.
I used 14 gauge, and it fits with plenty of room. Appears as if 12 gauge will work too. The trick is to have just enough wire coming out and over the edge to make a proper connection. Works like a charm.
Not really. The screen views are so tiny, and the software performs so poorly, that the crumbs are useless.
5 Years
Nothing here. When did you order? I ordered on March 12th. They've put the shipping estimate back twice - (to which I complained about 'fake' dates). They now have no estimated date for delivery [which I prefer].
No camera hole on the back.
where can I find one for $59.99?
If the caravan has a tv with infrared it will work. I have a 7 yr old and a 9 yr old and it fits them fine.
10" xoom
Hi Ivan. Sure you can. The connectors are standard speaker wire. It will work like a speaker, but if you want it as a center speaker, be sure to get a receiver which will send a 3.x, 5.x, or 7.x signal. Also, to maximize this speaker it is a good idea to match power range (and rarely resistance of your wire expressed in Ohms). It's a good speaker. Enjoy.
I don't know. I use it only with a Lenovo laptop. If you have a USB port available, I would assume it will work.
Yep it has the contours and the Canadian border throughout the lake
You can go to garmins web site and see if your unit is comparable
If your question refers to Wi-Fi, the answer is NO! This modem is not Wi-Fi ready. YOU will need a router connected to the modem to access a wireless Wi-Fi connection.
I don't think that Fuji made multiple versions of this lens. Just multiple versions of the firmware.
Yes
its 3.5mm and remember, your mic has to be "self powered". Cheers
Hi Sara, you don't get a camera bag with the Canon Vixia HF M50 but I'm sure that a search of google would find you a suitable one you could purchase. R.K. Pittsburgh
I bought another brand (azden?) to use as an external mic and the shoe did not fit. Instead of clicking it on, we just had to have people hold the receiver. I assume the shoe on this camera only fits the Canon brand ones. Hope that helps!
Approximately 170-200 shots per fully charged battery. If you ever need to take more shots at any given time, the suggestion would be to carry with you an extra standard 3.6v lithium-ion battery. It is relatively inexpensive.
Yes go to the guide on the menu button and select panoramic
I'm not sure if it does--but I really don't see why it wouldn't. Even though I'm a Windows kinda guy, I usually just drag-and-drop the video files via USB and import the footage into my editing software from there.
I had the same issue with a different model. I forced it open slightly manually once and it was ok. I know it sounds crude. But it worked in the past.
The camera should have come with a wall plug-in charger. First remove the battery from camera, insert it into the charger, and plug into any 110volt socket. Camera should have come with an instructional manual. If you do not have any of the aforementioned, contact Canon customer service and they should be able to help you. Hope this helps.
I bought this camera early last summer and have used it extensively. I have not noticed any distortion of "people" pictures, as long as you honor the "close foocusing" distance. I have taken some really nice pictures with this camera and probably use it 80% for family pictures, and 20% for landscapes, when I don't want to carry my Canon 5D. Hope this helps.
There is no lag time on the shutter. It only takes a second to be ready for the next shot. Tough, compact, and great camera. Battery lasts through more than 200 photos. I have two and it is easy to load the new battery and keep on shooting. The battery charges in about an hour. I also have a car charger.
Sorry - the 520 is the only Elph that I have owned. Still very pleased with it.
Yes. It has an HDMI port and cable as well as a USB cable to download to computer.
This camera does indeed have both an external mic port and a headphone jack.
it is the good quality the only problem i had with it was that the battery did not last long for long.
No, but I wish it did!
If you keep it charged (as in, constant power connection), then yes, it will continue to stay on and record when needed until you turn it off.
nope
X-Pro 1 has a hybrid optical + electronic view finder whereas X-E1/E2 only has an electronic viewfinder. The X-E1/E2 has a built-in flash and the X-Pro 1 does not. X-E1/E2 is also smaller than the X-Pro 1. Finally, X-E1/E2 is about $200 less.
I'd imagine it would work with the Yamaha receiver HDMI output; but it has delay. I went through a few different ones that all had the delay. The video usually freezes quickly and doesn't restart. I've been using a HP Wireless TV Connect Kit. All other devices I've tested can't keep a 1080p video synced; much less a 240 video. http://www.amazon.com/HP-Wireless-TV-Connect/dp/B0062FZ2UA/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1393365414&sr=8-1&keywords=HP+Wireless+TV+Connect+Kit
I'm not sure. I haven't done it but in theory it should work. I do know the signal can't go through several walls.
Not 100% sure if you will be able to extend that far but what I can tell you is when extending the wifi signal you lose performance and internet speed the farther the extender is from the router and the farther your products that you will be using are from the extender hope this helps
Yes it works with Centurylink. Yes on the smart TV. How fast you get on devices dep3nds in what speed you are paying Centurylink.
I don't have that problem
Yes it does, it's like an iPhone.. You can disconnect the wall charger and it becomes a USB end.
one year warranty from HP
I don't know. That one I bought ,I have to send it right away back, because something was wrong with it.
Yes it is interchangble.
Not sure what that is But it was deminstrated on Denver news in front of hwy patrol And said it was legal
No you need an adaptor
With 4/4s but not 5
It has 10/100/1000 Lan port
I do not know. Mine is an alpha 77 which seems to be a different instrument from one end to the other.
I have a HP 15.6" laptop. It is the max size that will fit.
I'm not sure. I'd start by contacting the manufacturer.
Im pretty sure you will have no issues filming. Its a great cam for the price with hd quality. I love the fact that the zoom is awesome as well.
HDMI for VIDEO/AUDIO signals, USB port is for FILES.
I'm not sure...it can be removed and it is partially visible.
Can't answer about shipping to Israel, but can answer that yes, it works great with Aladin Tec 2g. Just tested on both my Mac and PC
Yes
Short Answer: Yes it's Universal control. Long Answer: Yes Universe However i only tested it on HTC ONE, Samsung Galaxy Note 2, and the nexus 4 & 5 with popular apps(Spotify, Pandora, Google Access, and the phones custom UI default music apps) It most likely will work for any smart phone but may vary how (might answer calls but not control music for certain Apps, or vice versa). Even the apple version works with other smart phones.

the item itself is 5.9x5.5x3.4 in inches the packing box is 9x8.4x3.6 in inches
I bought the Galaxy Tab 2 7.0 (WiFi only) from Amazon. This tablet is Samsung model #P3113. The tablet dock for it is available on Samsung's website. At the present time, it is back ordered. The correct keyboard dock is Samsung product ID EKD-K11AWEBSTD. Price. $79.99 free shipping. Contact Samsung 1-800-757-0280, accessories.
I believe so. It is a great keyboard!!
I play Battlefield 4 and Guild Wars 2. Both keep a smooth steady 60fps. It would probably be higher if my system was a little beefier. I have an AMD940 with ddr2 ram. I don't overclock, and it always stays a tad below 70c under load. My machine gets a little loud when everything is running at full speed, but Im not sure if I can hear the GPU fan above the power supply and CPU fan which will speed up under load. I think its a great card for the money.
D90 is a bit big for this sling, but it might work.
29" is the folded length including attachment ring. The total length (mobius strip style) is 52" at it's max.
yes my test board did come with a manual .
the amazon basic slide in case fits perfect, its $5.99 tell me how you like the elsse, and if it is as good as it is represented jim
Sorry, folks, but this has Android 2.2 (Froyo). 4.0 is Ice Cream Sandwich, which came out *after* this device was made. As far as I know, it can't be upgraded.
This one should get netflix it has android 4.0 Ice cream Sandwich mine is older version it has android 2.2 and does not get netflix
Works great on Windows 7! No software required.
I Have Used it with Android and Windows don't have any Mac equipment. hope this helps
No
Hey Sue. There are other sites on line that have those plug ins to match to. Just check that the model numbers match up.
I received 2 wires as well. I was taken back by it because it didn't look like there was two in the picture. All and all its a good product and works like its suppose to.
I don't know of one that comes with it.
Looks like it's sold by Amazon themselves
I don't believe so, as I plan on continuing to re-save my stuff as needed.
You could do this on this device. Just keep in mind that downloading movies is a violation of law . If you still do this, make sure your TV has a compatible USB port on it somewhere, and refer to your user manual on how to connect to the USB device.
I Haven't formatted mine I just plugged it in and started storing stuff on it but it is a 32 GB so I would imagine it should have enough space,hope that helps.
Esther: A flash drive is a memory device that stores information with non-volatile, chip memory. That means that when you unplug it from a computer, whatever information you put on it will stay. This is a very convenient way to move files from one computer to another, or share those files with a friend. I use mine for presentations. Wherever I go, I can plug into my host's computer and present on the spot. This particular drive is compact and very durable. I can keep it on my keychain without worrying about it falling off.
Probably. You will have to give it a try.
It is Compatible with devices with HDMI "Type D" (HDMI port approx size of micro usb)
the way I read it is 80 per speaker with a max of 170
Not so. From memory, it's about 2 1/2"x6x6
&#128529; no
Pretty sure its standard CTIA since it works perfectly with my Nexus 4 (so doesn't seem OMTP).
This speaker doubled the volume on my laptop. I don't see why it wouldn't do the same for everybody. Great sound.
Should as long as it has usb port
yes
4 cores 8 threads
Yes, when I originally installed it, I was running xp sp3.
No it is for a computer. A tv will not recognize it.
This will only work for 1 computer at a time, just like a USB hub can only connect to one computer at a time. This is a wireless adapter used for connecting to a wireless router that connects you to the internet and other computers in your home.
Are you locking the remote in locking position?
Yes. You slide the tab under the switch button. You don't have to hold the button down for a long exposure.
Yes, it does.
Yes, the device did come with charger but any micro charger will work with the keyboard. I have thoroughly enjoyed my keyboard and it goes everywhere with me.
The "Certified Servers" team appreciates your question. Our server comes with 2x Intel Xeon Processor E5440 (12M Cache, 2.83 GHz, 1333 MHz FSB) . According to intel these processors support Intel Virtualization Technology (VT-x).
Yes
Worked for me. But....you have to be as delicate as a plastic surgeon to fit it into place. It's quite snug. I used hemostat clamps to connect the electrodes together.
Yes and they are the best thing we have purchased. We have even given them to friends to use for trips.
I bought this for my two year old and fit her perfectly
Yep! Also works great on phones too! My daughter loves them!
Yes. That's an LGA1155 and z68 based mother board. It will take this ram
From my experience I would think so. You can always tighten the screw with a screw driver to really tighten it up if your hand alone won't do the trick. I would also use the grip with the water proof frame like the picture shows for added security. This will also reduce a lot of the wind noise while filming at high speeds. I also have the regular gopro frame but I wouldn't trust that to hold on a coaster. Happy coaster bombing!
Battery works great in my T5i.
All I have is a T3i and it works fine but it should not matter what camera you are using, if your T5i uses battery part number LP-E8 then it should work just fine. a few cameras use this part number. look at your battery or the camera manual or online under "specifications". I just checked it out for you on the Canon site and it says that the T5i uses the LP-E8 battery so this one should work just fine :)
60&#937; I believe
No, it's not. You will need a harness and a dash kit, also if you want the steering wheel features you need the module interface
You have to move the location of a pin in the harness. There are instructions all over the web and video on YouTube. Do a search for bypass instructions avic140bh. Otherwise there is nothing to buy. My one caution about this unit is that it currently does not integrate with the iPhone 5.
Do you have the parking brake engaged.
I am not certain about the GPS because the maps are for the North America continent . Is this car a US model? If it is check Crutchfield.com for the faceplate to install this unit in your car
It is OEM Pioneer. Very sturdy but a bit bulky.
it is GPS ready and the unit avic-u220 is around 300.00 to 400.00. Just bought a new RV with AVH-p1400DVD which is GPS ready and the same deal. Looking for a new unit
Yes, I believe you can transfer videos to the usb and play it from there.
The server will support up to 64GB of RAM maximum, however you would need to install 8 x 8GB Modules. For 32GB you need 8 x 4GB Modules.
You can configure the Pioneer to take over (iPod mode), or you can configure it to allow the ipod to keep control and just receive the sound (APP mode). Refer to the manual: top-left of page 10.
"Kit" just means they are tested and sold as a set of 2 sticks. As long as your motherboard supports 4x4GB sticks of DDR3 1600 then you should have no issues.
It should be fine did you just break the screen? It comes all in one I think on this model!
at least 2 hours. maybe even 3. Its been a year now and I still have 2 hours remaining in my battery and I'm a student. So i've been using my laptop extensibly.
Don't know what that is
Ask seller if u can return it cause it wasn't in the condition u thought it was
It can record multiple ones. Just stop and go to start recording again
Recently when I was searching for a replacement for my data transfer cable for my portable hard drive, somehow it came up that I could use the charger cable that came with my Samsung Galaxy S3. I hope this is helpful.
Yes it will. This eye price will fit any telescope with a 1.25 eyepiece receptical.
There is a circle cut (9/16") for a back facing camera, hole center is 1" down and 1" in (upper left hand corner in the back as you look at the tablet screen). Nothing on the cover that closes over the screen.
Negative. The dimensions of the Nexstar Case are External Length 23 in (584 mm); External Width 15 in (381 mm); External Height 14 in (356 mm); Internal Length 19 in (483 mm); Internal Width 11 in (279 mm); Internal Height 10 in (254 mm). The listed Optical Tube Length of the Omni XLT 150 is 34 in (864 mm). It's too big for the case.
Comes with a charger.
The low light performance is the best I've seen in this price range. I've noticed that in low light conditions that the auto focus can sometimes cause a few out of focus moments like when somebody walks through the shot slowly. I take videos of bands in dimly lit bars and they usually come out fairly good. If low light is critical, try doing a search for reviews on more expensive cameras.
It does not. It only has the zoom mic.
They say about 1.4 oz they are great love them
no you would need a reciever
The switch is equivalent of you unplugging the device from one computer and then plugging it into another computer. From other comments I see it even works if you extend the output with a USB hub. I see no reason why this wouldn't work.
I have almost never used this tablet. It has an HDMI port, but I have never had any of my monitors or TVs recognize it... there's no manual... I just kissed off the money I spent on this tablet
Yes, Each card act like an individual drive. It has to be separate with unique drive letter. If you want to hide them this can be from windows setting -- view options -- hide empty drives and it'll appear when card inserted. Hope that will help you.
The device (as shown in the documentation) has 2 cables molded into a single connector. The motherboard "internal" usb3 connector is a dual channel.
yes, and a strap to put around your wrist.
No..I had to buy it myself.
yes I have not used it yet but I know I saw it in the settings
This 14mp camera is awesome... It has the iauto feature plus drama shot and 5x zoom... It would make a great replacement to your camera... having 30 different scenes and filters and illuminated screen are great features... If you can afford 10 USD more you can get te 16MP VR-340 if you want better zoom... That has 10x zoom and a make-up filter... however it has less filters an scenes so... I would recommend either one for a replacement to your camera...
No it does not.
I did a lot of research and reviewing and determined the best was the latest high speed versions, specifically this one at http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ADFTUG/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1 . I am happy to say the choice was on the money as this card is amazingly fast, and greatly improves the use and experience with this camera. Hopefully this helpful, good luck!
chatpal, this camera comes with a rechargeable battery pack.
The battery is rechargable. It comes with a USB cord that can attach to your computer and can also be plugged in to the wall charger, just like many mobile phones nowadays. Hope that answers your question!
No
I have no idea, mine was okay. I had no SD card When I purchased it and it was working fine.
I'm not a camera buff and don't understand the question. If the question is how does it do in low-light conditions without the flash - then, not very good.
If new, it should also come with a manual, software, battery and charger, wrist strap and depending on where you buy it the SD card may or may not be included...
I wouldn't say it is 'apple red' but more burgundy red, definitely not pink-ish.
Yes to both.
This camera runs off a rechargeable battery; you just plug the charger into the camera and into an outlet with the battery in it charging. My son loves this camera, it's perfect for him!!
Yes. I use a 4GB SDHC card.
I've only had mine for about a month but no problem so far. I would definitely contact Olympus support. I had a question about the camera when I first received it and they could not have been any nicer. If that doesn't resolve the issue, I would then contact Amazon for an exchange.
It will record audio during video. Ive not triewd zooming so cant answer your second question. I have to say that as time goes by,m Im less enthused byb this camera. It was cheap, being an old model, but I dont think Id buy it again. It takes too long to zoom in or out and serches way too long to focus in lower light conditions.
yes, you can charge it without external charger
Plug the USB cable into the computer and it will charge the battery...
As long as you have USB 3.0 on board your laptop.
Yes
It worked fine as replacement EN-EL5 for my Coolpix P6000, so it ought to work for the 5200 which lists the EN-EL5 as its battery. Actually bought a 2nd Photive EN-EL5 6 months after my first purchase because my second Nikon EN-EL5 expanded from heat in the middle so much that it wouldn't slide easily into the battery compartment.
The model I have 40M is for the NEX-5 and will not work for the NEX-3. There is a model for the NEX-3.
I believe it workable
I would say no, it would not work with my NEX 3. Looks like only certain NEX 5 models will
No, you have to preset the zoom before going down. Other then that, definitely use flash attachment.
It seemed to work for me. I'd been told slowness was due to registry errors, so I'd been using CCleaner but the Fix Me Stick found and quarantined several viruses and the computer IS running faster.
Thank you for question. yes.it fit.
Happy hoildays! I think u should check again it there we have hook it up to the Tv and watch video and movies.
mine came with 4.0 on it even thought it didn't say that on the ad. yes you can upgrade memory by buying a mini sd chip I put 16 gig in mine. This has been a great tablet for the price.
Yes, so far it is working well.
My actually battery has the # PA3819U-1BRS written on it.
Make sure that you have the proper type batteries selected. In the setting, select power and make sure that the battery type shown matches what you have. Some people have reported that a mismatch will tell you that the battery is dead too soon.
The warranty on the Anker Laptop Battery is for 18 months from date of purchase. Any inquiries concerning their products you can send an email to: support@ianker.com and they are very good at responding. If you purchased the product through a different retailer other than Anker, you will be instructed to contact that retailer for any exchange or refund recess. If a quality-related issue with the product, you may request a REPLACEMENT OR REFUND by submitting a request form at www.ianker.com/support. All the above information is from the instruction manual I received with my laptop battery in February, 2014.
Have you completely charged the battery? Maybe after charging, try to shut down and recheck battery status. I did not have any issues with mine, I just popped mine in and it worked great. It said they had a great support system, I would give Anker a call. Good Luck!
No. See specs System Requirements: 1.6GHz or higher processor. Intel Pentium/Celeron family, or AMD K6/AMD Athlon/AMD Duron family, or compatible processor recommended (Intel Core 2 Duo 1.4 GB or higher processor recommended for optimal performance) Microsoft Windows 8, Window 7, Vista or XP (32-bit with SP2/SP3) OS 1GB memory or higher (2GB or higher recommended) USB 3.0 or 2.0 port (3.0 recommended for optimal performance) 50 MB of available hard disk space CD-ROM drive (or Internet access to download driver) One-year limited warranty
No. It doesn't stream Amazon prime, however I stream directly from my PS3. Lord points out some other alternatives as well. The software is somewhat slow and buffers simultaneously on some apps (Such as YT & Google...) However Netflix streams flawlessly & it's energy efficient.
It is a 2012 model.
I was told the only difference is the size of the bezel. Newer model has a thinner bezel.
Nuevo,pero aqui mismo en amazon podrias conseguirlo usado a un buen precio,yo mismo compre uno casi nuevo pero en casi 300 dolares menos, !
No it does not
There is NO truemotion controls. The higher end LG model DO have this feature but not the 6200 series. It was something keeping me from buying but with "Marty's" review of a 47" i'm buying today and he is a "Vine". He's very helpful. See his review and make a comment he will respone. I also found the 47" and others in the 6200 series at a discounted price compare to Amazon and Amazon HAS matched the prices for me. I'm getting the 47" for $989, cool!
Return the TV, it has very limited features/flexibility. I don't know about WIDI but I'm guessing it will not work on this TV based on my frustrations.
I have the 42", and yes it does. Even the description of the TV om the product page indicates that it does.
6
It has WiDi.. It doesn't work very well with my Lenevo ideapad. My Laptop doesn't recognize the TV. After several attempts when it does and connects, it works fine. However, the quality is not as good as Apple's Airplay.
the series 6200 is compatible with 220 volt the 7600 series is not
Yes the grill is a fabric...and I bet your cat would love these!!!
This camera is equipped with a 1.25" barrel so that it will work in place of any 1.25" eyepiece. It will work with any telescope that accepts a 1.25" eyepiece, including the Nexstar130 SLT.
Most certainly! You should have absolutely NO issues in viewing objects in that range.
Yes, the charger will work on 100v to 240v. I have used it is Europe. The Wasabi Batteries are excellent.
No, no microphone on the headset, these are just for listening.
Mine automatically powers on when the power is turned on to the unit. I don't have to push the power button to turn it on. I just have one camera hooked up and it automatically uses that camera. Input 1.
Yes this antenna works fine with RG 6 ands also includes the RG6 to sirius antenna adapter with it. I used this on a commercial florist install and it worked perfect.
Antenna has connector with it to convert RG59 to what us required by sirius receiver
The software included is NOT from Blue Iris. You can buy Blue Iris for $50 for any amount of cameras your system can support. You will need a decent processor in your computer to run multiple cameras.
No
Unfortunately, it's only available for PC because of compatibility issues.
Nope it's pretty sturdy....it has gripper pads too so it holds the tablet pretty well
Yes, it does, vertical and horizontal.
yes, you will have to use the clear disk. It doesn't work with out it.
I charge an iPad with it can't see why it can't charge kindle. According to my teenage son he said "it should charge anything with a USB"
Just checked the box in came in and the info sais it will work with mist mobile devices, it doesnt specify the motorola brand. Hope this helps
You should follow the directions to select the memory card then you will be able to select music from the memory card
I'm not sure what an i-POD Classic is, if that means one that uses the wide plug adapter to go in the i-Pod, then yes. It does not accept the new small adapters on the 5.
Well I have picked up other sounds that have yet to be identified in the woods (cryptozoology research). But I strongly believe you may be able to pick up what you are looking for (just my opinion). The microphone is very sensitive and with the Microphone boost enabled, it allows me to put away the parabolic dish more often (Unless the sounds are very, very far away). I hope this helps.
Yes it does and the results are amazing
Records in MP3 format. Mac compatible.
Yes . . . Good backpack but purchased less than 1 month ago.
Go to the Timbuk2 website. They have a laptop fit guide where you can put in your specific model and see what bags will fit.
Yes it is all the same material.
the flap that covers the main compartment is water proof (same material as the rest of the bag) I like the bag but prefer the closure clips to be metal (like the older models) not the current plastic.
Tim, depends on how many books and what size are the books. The main compartment is approx 5-6 inches before stretching the bag and before it starts looking overpacked. This is for the medium size but according to Timbuk2's website, the large is about the same in width but is bigger which is wider. It works perfect for me as I only carry my comic books to read, paper and pens, my laptop, some work paperwork and enough room for some my food container for lunch.
Yes . . . Good backpack but purchased less than 1 month ago.
No it does not but there are enough loops and other possibilities that I am sure you could affix your own
Yes it is all the same material.
I think you did find a typo. I looked on the company website ( http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/products/commute-laptop-tsa-friendly-messenger-bag ) and it looks like the medium has a height of 10.8". Good catch!
Yes.
Yes it can....mine is connected thru the radio.
given that you need a waterproof cover, I don't think it can be flush mounted. I guess you could recess it and install a clear shield that is flush in the dashboard. this has a remote so that would work. good luck.
No it wont its just a small remote smaller than a credit card
These speakers are not wireless.
Yes, you can set multiple way points (destinations). You can also select your route by fastest, shortest, major roads etc. Unit has many options.
don't know yet....got it after boating season finished....
Yes.
don't know about camera, but has plenty of amps to operate most items.
I does have a volume control. I use it with my non apple cell so I do not know how it works with an apple product.
I went with the nnr coilover. It's the shock and spring combo. Nnr is the sister company to the coilovers all the bmw's ride on. They are inexpensive and respond incredibly well. I have eibach sway bars and nnr shocks and coilovers. I have had them for about 10,000 miles and they are perfect comers at 75-80 mph are no sweat the tires barely start to squeal. Great buys!!
Yes! It comes withe the cord that plugs into the headphone hole in the phone.
this amp distorted quite a bit with 60 ohm AKG 702 headphones at only medium high volume. this is all i know. there was allot of treble and base produced at all times by this amp.
I fit them in the front doors of my old Tahoe. I hade to use the factory housing, it will take a bit of pressure to remove it safely and properly. Without the housing the speaker is too small.
Mostly a defect warranty from what I remember but not from over powering them or misuse
Mary, According to the Canon website, the BP-727 high capacity battery is compatible with the Vixia HF R300. It has definitely lasted longer for us.
I had to look up what it was. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_U-verse It is the AT&T version of Verizon's FIOS, which is glass fibre to the house. I don't believe there is any metal in the fibre cable. So, there is no chance for a difference in electric potentials. I would expect there to be no similar problem that would need the ground loop isolator. HTH.
It can be used as a stand alone or paired with e9 or e11. Right now I'm using it as a stand alone. Works great! Love it
Sure as long as your stereo accepts the appropriate jack. Check the connection options.
The microphone works for me (Samsung Galaxy Note 2) in calls and voice commands, but as another poster posted, playback controls do not work.
I do not know the answer to that one as I do not work on BMW vehicles. I would have to refer you to Pioneer.
It's not compatible with this unit you would have to get the updated Bluetooth version with Sirius and Pandora
http://www.security.honeywell.com/hsc/products/keypad/gr/ad/317517.html link at Honeywell says yes.
It is rated 152w rms at 8 ohms. 250w at 4 ohms. It will work just won't be able to run subs to fill power.
Yes it is ethernet
Just a couple of screw drivers. Unscrew the silver phillips head screws on the front and back of the amp to permit you to remove the circuit board. Also unscrew the bigger black phillips screw on the side. That holds the clamp that braces the mosfets against the heatsink. When you pull out the board, you'll have access to the chip to apply the thermal paste.
a)yes it does b)for its size and power is very thumping c)for its prize is very good speaker system
No
6 feet
no its Bluetooth
There is a dim setting on the device its self as well as angel adjustment... Please don't buy these products tho... When you reach the tech department. "THEY KNOW THAT IT IS A MALFUNCTIONING PRODUCT AND WILL ONLY PLAY AVI VIDEOS PART OF THE TIME" THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT AND THEN SIT ON THE PHONE QUIETLY WAITING FOR YOUR NEXT QUESTION.......
Yes this phone has great bass, but in my case it just stopped working and I have no idea why.
No mic. Just good sounding ear buds for the price.
It does work for the headphone part or the microphone part, but not both combined. You'd need a jack that accepts headphone-mic combined like on an iPad or cellphone device which most PC's are not equipped.
Hi Cris, yes it works on android phones.
They work well with iPhone 6
If it has a 3.5 mm (standard size) headphone jack on it, which is most likely the case, then yes. They should work just fine.
I believe so, yes.
Long enough to put your phone or I pod in your pants pocket and have 8 inches to spare.
I'm almost positive, since I use mine for iPhone, but I always try to check a local store the read the box or skullcandy,com Before I buy online.... Hope this helps
Ours broke so soon I don't remember. But I think it was real.... Thin though.
I don't think they are big and bulky - very comfortable.
There is no mic on the cord. There is no iPod/iPhone control on the cord either. The only positive thing about the cord is that it is detachable. But on a side note, I believe (not 100%) that you can buy a cord with a mic/iPod control and use that on the Hesh 2. Just google or Youtube it! Hopefully this helps...Merry Christmas!
Yes 30 day
Yes. I used it with an old iBook and it worked.
I have considered that but have not approached any expert about it. My guess, consider the source, is no. If you hear otherwise please let me know. Thanks.
Greetings, To the best of my understanding, any volume adjustments made to the X-Mini will only effect the speaker itself, while connected to a PC. While in use with a cell phone, the X-Mini will control both the volume of the speaker and that of the phone it is paired with. I hope this answers any questions you may have had.
I check the instructions and it does not identify if it works on 240v. Just says AC or DC power and you can plug in with a USB. Sorry.
The radio does use 110v but you can also charge it through a USB port or the hand crank so you really don't have to have electricity to use this. My son keeps his in the window to use the solar charge and when he wants to use the radio or flashlight if there isn't enough of a charge to run it he just cranks it a few times and it is fully charged. Electricity is not required to use this.
Yes, I used it when I went running over vacation in Paris and London. It worked in both areas.
no
Isabelle, I took this watch with me to Costa Rica and it worked there. I was a bit hesitant that it would work, but to my surprise it started to connect and was used during my runs alongside the beach. Hope this helped!
This monitor will work with Windows XP or Windows 7 or Vista since no special hardware is needed to run this monitor.
Hello and thank you for the response. Yes, this unit does come with a CD-RW / DVD-RW Drive. If you have any additional questions feel free to ask.
No
Good question, I tried to charge mine using solar recently and they did not charge . I have been very busy recently and haven't had a chance to figure out what is wrong
Naw it would not work upside down I tried it
Yes it does have a video output last I checked. It also has an input for a rear camera.
Not that im aware of
Yes it can! I have a screen protector on my ipad and the keyboard works just fine over it.
No, it doesn't
Yes, it does have a ZOOM function. It has six settings; three to enlarge and three to reduce. I did not notice any distortion at all.
Doesn't have an battery pack. You plug in to charge the dvd player to charger with the port that it comes with
300 Watts RMS / 600 Watts Max Power. The other rating was for a single coil speaker not the dual coil..
Dan, I think you're trying to ask if it comes with a speaker enclosure box. The answer is no, its just the speaker. It's shipped in a cardboard box.
I just went out and measured all the way around and the measurement is between 3-13/16 to 3-7/8. Hope this helps you.
It is a 12 volt system for autos or boats. It would work but you would have to use a 12 volt DC converter to power it. A subwoofer with a built in amp that is powered with 110 volts would probably be a better solution.
this adapter is include in package, 110-220v to 12v
Yes
Mine has a TRIPATH TA2020. An online search will give you the datasheet.
It came with the AC adapter to plug into the wall but not the one to plug into your car
You can connect source audio three ways (stereo rca or 3.5mm jack in the back and 2.5mm jack in the front).
3 inch
Yes
This system is analog, to get the full 7 channel sound you need seven connections. Or a/v cables and just get sound from 7 speakers as if mono.
No
Don't understand &#65279;the question..&#65279;the system looks great but &#65279;the performance is terrible.definately not 800 watts.
The unit has only 300 watt output
150 per channel.this radio sucks though wouldn't take it if you gave it to me. When u turn it up it starts to make the speakers distort sounds like crap
Dimensions (H X W X D) 15 3/4 X 7 X 13
yes it is.
No. It does not. No netbook can play dvd's for the fact that they don't contain a drive.
Check specs on maximum size sd card the camera will support
Yes - it'll adapt to your earphones jack to the USB connection. I also use mine with Skype and other VOIP applications in Windows7.
Yes; however, several of us have tried using this to connect our PCs to use Skype and they have all eventually stopped working. It seems to burn out. We are now using a splitter that works much better! If you are interested the item is Startech audio cables 3.5 mm 4 pin to 2x3 pin 3.5 headset splitter adapter - f/m. Hope this helps!
Yes it is as the title reads OEM repl, steering wheel radio control function is not effected.
Yes, completely plug and play on the base 05-11 stereo.
One of the commenters on a review indicated that you can attach a $5 RCA mini jack to the headphone out to do that! It's not the usual RCA out, but the commenter said it works wonderfully. It was also what Samsung recommended to the owner.
Most LCD TVs do not come with a wall mount - I have this TV and it does not come with one.
You will have to use a digital optical cable to connect your amplifier to this T.V the input is on the back of the amp you will also see the input on the back of the T.V
I use one of these TVs for my PC gaming, and another of the same model for Xbox 360 gaming. I haven't noticed any issues once properly configured (See Game Mode answer from Samsung rep on this page).
Yes, there are three types of Audio out connections, (1) left and right analog audio out for stereo connection, (2) a fiber optic connection for audio out connection to a amp. and (3) there is a single mini analog audio out that should supply audio to a external speaker. This tv does have USB connection near two HD connections.
TV RUNS COOL. VERY ENERGY EFFECIENT
I used the coaxial port for my incoming signal. It works fine.
If you order from '24/7 Cases,' it will ship from the USA.
Yes
My guess is no. When I did a search and found a picture of the same one I needed, the title only seems to reference any of the DMC-TZ_x_ where x is the model number.
No. There isn't room on the face for any more stuff. With two source devices plugged in, you turn one off and then turn the other one on.
I don't know how big the otterbox is. But I have my iPad connected to a logitec keyboard. Which basically doubles the thickness of the iPad. And it fits just fine.
It will work just fine but it is getting past the tier 1 tech support the real issue. Any DOCSIS 3.0 modem will work but they go by the book and say it won't. You can request to be sent to a higher tech support or just tell them it is a "SB6141" model. All they really need to do is register the "MAC address" on the bottom of the modem and you are done. I already already installed over 9x SB6180 modems.
Im really not sure what you are talking about but I use a regular plug in the wall.
There is a password which you set on your smartphone.
I have a Samsung RV711 ..... The replacement battery is excellent. Great quality for a cheap price. I'm very satisfied.
We ordered this for our samsung laptoo at a fraction of the price at batteries plus. It works pwrfectly
I don't connect camera to TV for playback. I burn DVD'S and they do playback in full screen. =)
Yes, the Camera was in the retail box and it included USB cable, charger, software CD...
Yes, there is a feature called "OIS" which reduces camera shake. Also, when focusing the focusing rectangle changes from a red outline, i.e., Out of Focus to a green outline - in focus.
Is not included :(
According to the manual: The maximum continuous recording time is under 20 minutes. The maximum video file size is 1.8GB. When a video recording time is more than 20 minutes or a video file exceeds 1.8GB, a new video file is created automatically.
Most versatile camera ever; in Smart mode switches from Macro to landscape flawlessly. For shots in darkness (another auto setting) it fills in with "back light" feature. After 5 cameras, this is the only one that impresses me with it's capability & cost. Bought the first one for my office, but since have bought 2 more. I use this over my PowerShot S900
Not suitable for underwater use without a waterproof case.
nothing. we ordered the case and memory chip separately.
Yes they can be mounted upside down and the video oriented the proper way. I am sure they would work outside. But they are definitely not weatherproof, so the protected area, better be just that, protected.
The keyboard is a copy of the genius, design at 'Think Outside' I have had three of their Bluetooth keyboards an now this, Geyes imitation. Geyes just without thinking used some obscure camera connector, where it is difficult to find a neat cable. However my next purchase will be a hub, which will enable me to type all day, without changing my Note 4 or Galaxy 2 battery. If Geyes supplied 150 mm OTG type cables, it would be perfect, however I do not seem able to find the company.
I don't believe so. You can set f stop and shutter speed manually for a still frame picture, but I believe once you put the camera on video, it is all automatic.
yes. it is independent from the photo button. 14 or 15 photos can be taken while recording video as well. nice feature.
Yes. I have used it on occasion to make sure I have it ready in social situations. More often I have it mounted on a tripod for time lapse photography or video. Also I have it mounted for action video on my canoe.
No it doesn't...you have to buy one for more memory.
No it does not - 3 months
Yes
Japan
this will NOT charge your tablet, it most likely isn't the right wattage- my ipads (1st gen and latest) don't even show the device as connected. This WILL charge phones quite nicely and for the cost is much cheaper than a Mophie
No, the camera is very grainy in low light. It looks okay at first, but it is more noticeable when you zoom in a bit.
Yes. Just connect it with the USB cable included. iMovie 11 can play iFrame and 1080/50i AVCHD. I just received this camera and was happy to see I could play AVCHD as I read on some places that mac has issues with AVCHD, but this is not the case anymore. Only the highest setting, 1080/50p needs to be converted first before it can be used in iMovie. However I see pretty much no difference in quality between 1080/50p and 1080/50i.
The provided software CD-ROM is only for PC and not Mac. You don't need any software because the camera is compatible with iMovie 11 but you can only record in iFrame format and not in AVCHD. If you need to record in AVCHD, you can always purchase Adobe Premier Elements. Works great! Here is my review I just posted. Hope this helps.
go to you tube and type in san antonio texas death city i made them all at one time with this camera it works as long as the sd card will hold use the most sd card that you can use
I really don't know. I don't see the reason why not but you would need to look this info up on the internet.
The kindle fits snugly in this case. I wouldn't think that you could fit both the kindle and the keyboard. The kindle just fits.
No
Yes, the zoom and picture quality are great features to have when shooting sports photography. It also has a feature where the camera anticipates the photograph to eliminate blur. I've used it for basketball and bowling (in low-light conditions) and it works great.
I think that not fit in his ASUS Tab because the connector is just for Galaxy Tab 10.1
I haven't had any issues with the unit on my 350Z. It's the Bose system so I'm not sure how much of that is the adapter and how much of that is the head unit. The only issues I've experienced were phone based as my iPod and anyone elses phone sounds fine but my Nexus 4 required rooting, a new kernel, and tweaking to match.
Clamp stretches fairly big has 2 different sets of "hooks" to latch onto the tablet. I have a Surface 1 hooked up on it right now and was able to latch in a Surface 3 with the larger L hooks. I will have to get a measuring tape to know the exact sizes. I can say that this arm has impressed me and I thought of the two I bought this one would be the one I would want to return.
Hi The two arms are 10 inches each plus a little bit for the mounting part. The smallest opening before putting in the tablet is 6 inches. The head does rotate so you could turn it 90 degrees. I have a ipad and love it it's built very well. You have to know if it has a width or length of over 6 inches to fie inside the spring area. Hope this helps
Yes, this is a very sturdy stand and held my TF700 quite well in many positions. I never aimed it facing downward, but I think the grip would be sufficient
It depends on the options you have and if your vehicle has a "double din" opening.
remote, some bracket, instructions , and thats about it
to my knowledge there is no cell phone that has the option of video inputs of this size.
Yes it does have distance lines
No, I had to splice the cables and buy a car charger and re wire it that way.
No you can't
I don't know about wattage, but the antenna is not removable.
They have an iphone and android version as far as I know. I am not sure if it is a matter if changing apps. You need an app for the fm transmitter portion, not the Bluetooth.
The front digital display is removable and comes with a nice velvet bag to store it in. I did not purchase a Digital TV reciever module which would have to be purchased seperately to make TV channels come through on the front display. I have watched a DVD Movie and it plays really clear and the sound is awesome through my Trucks speakers.
These come standard with the unit. Front Panel 3.5mm AUX A/V Input Connect the audio output of an auxiliary device like MP3 player or handheld game console for playback through the entire audio system. A/V Input from Auxiliary Source Join the outputs of a ceiling mounted or headrest entertainment system to the A/V RCA inputs for total systems integration.
If it has a single din deck it should from the info I found it is a perfect replacement for your stock deck.remember to get a wiring harness as well it will save you time
yes it does
You change the the setting with a small screwdriver. It makes a noticeable click between settings.
Radio was not great. I ended up returning it
Mine has similar problems and I plan on fixing it by installing a different brand unit .
Good Morning, This will come with basic wiring but nit vehicle specific wiring harnesses. Thank you.
Yes, it fits in mine
I don't think its compatible with any wheel mounted interface.
No it doesn't play cd's!
Unit has no OnStar or xm radio fits to your vehicle it won't effect OnStar mirrors
I haven't connected an iPod up to it yet. It can be fully functional with any USB drive or other MP3 player though.
I don't know, i have to some one as a gift
No sure. I returned it and bought a Logitech...
Yes, AMD FX 4100 should work.
Yes, you can rewind - by simply pressing the left side of the outer circular button in the middle as the message is playing. Press the right side in order to fast-forward. These two functions allow you to quickly get to any segment of a longer message.
When I purchased the armorsuit military shield for my Acer Iconia Tab it fit perfect. Just follow the simple direction 1. 2. 3. and you will be done, in about 3-5 min.
Hi, do you mean if it comes in black? We only have this item in silver color.
SD reader, Yes. USB 2.0 x1 USB 3.0 x2 HDMI x1
I get roughy a half hour per battery
worth the money
Sorry I just have the one.
yes
No
Thank you for contacting Parts Express. While we do not require a signature when shipping with UPS, it is up to them whether or not they are comfortable leaving a package unattended. If the address is a multi dwelling building or an area that experiences high theft of packages, they may opt to have the package signed for. They will typically make 3 attempts to deliver a package. Regards, Customer Service Team
Yes you can, but the line out is variable and not fixed. I didn't like this feature but it may work for you
this are for the quier confort 3 those are the ones with noo se cancelation over the ear, hope this helps
No, the QC3 ear cushions will not fit on the QC15 headphones. To order replacement QC15 cushions, please call us at 800-367-4008.
Yes It's easy to snap on replaces the foam pads
http://www.nikonusa.com/en/About-Nikon/Search.page Try this link to download the manual. Disconnect the cable from the camera and computer. Try turning on and off again. Make sure you see a full charge on the battery icon display screen. If battery is not holding a charge, then you may have to purchase a new one.
It does come with a charger but the battery charges while being inside the camera. If you buy a spare battery you cannot charge it without the camera.
The camera should have come with a cable that plugs into the camera at one end and the computer at the other. You just plug it in and then turn on the camera and it will upload a program to your computer and then a little window will appear that asks what task you want to perform. You choose download pictures and it will put them in your computer. Only takes a few seconds!
Yes, you just have to import the photos from the camera to your computer. A cord comes with the camera to do that. So as long as you have a computer (not an ipad) you can do that. Then you can either email them or upload them to a Photo site like Shutterfly where you can share them over the internet. The easiest way to send photos though is by taking your pictures with a smart phone or ipad if you have one.
I am not using rechargeable batteries in mine. So far the battery life seems to be good. I do keep my camera turned off when not in use. I've had the camera about 2 mos. now, have taken quite a few pictures and still on the first set of batteries. Note: with the 26x optical and 26x digital on top of that this camera takes great moon shots. Looks like they were taken through a telescope. Craters are in sharp detail.
The spot (button) where you press to take a picture has an outer ring with a small handle... move the ring with the small handle right or left to zoom in or out. On a full sized DSLR, this outer ring in the on/off toggle.
Not to bad. It uses AA batteries. My wife used it alot through our last week long cruise and changed the batteries once.
EN-EL19
It is scheduled to be released on or about 3/22/12 according to B&H Photo...
No memory card included, just the camera. I don't have the camera anymore but I think it has small amount of internal memory too.
It's in the manual but the camera has a setting to override the dof focus etc. In that respect it's not really intuitive.
Yes, one setting for 2 seconds and one setting for 10 seconds. Works beautifully.
3.5 inches tall (without flash raised) 4.5 inches deep (without lense in front extended or flip up monitor in back raised) 5" wide not counting camera straps that might poke out a bit from that.
It has a macro setting for closer up pic but if you true super close macro you will need to use a camera with interchangeable lens. You can set it to continue to take pics as long as you hold down the button.
You can buy a memory card with various sizes. I have seen them as high as 64MB
This rig is less likely to fit your camera as the camera plate does not have the adjustability of the last kit you asked about.......................Video Gear Direct
Charger cord, USB Cord to download pictures to your computer, wrist strap
Yes, it does.
I noticed the same thing. The true answer is...because they can. Amazon probably noticed a trend in purchase and decided to raise the price, although, I can't say that for sure.
Software wise the motherboard can handle both ATI & Nvidia cards. Make sure card slot type it the right one
Yes it is.
It has good sound quality, put you do not get an entire screen viewing. I have tried everything, Blue Ray is only in a captioned or shown as a cinema view. I would not recommend this unit.
AM3+
Not more then one pound, it's very light and handy.
Yes it does come with a neck strap
Yes, right in front.
I'm no installation expert but it should fit in any double DIN hole. Mine was installed with a 3rd-parrty module that paired it to my steering wheel controls (Chevrolet) so I think the answer to that question is yes.
Only for a few seconds. Not sure about the equalizer.
Unfortunately not, looks like only the European units got that. There is a fake crappy looking fake cd player face that will suction cup itself to the screen for sale
Japan
Yes it does. http://www.dpcauto.com/kenwood-ddx419-dvd-receiver-ddx419/ I STILL WOULDN'T BUY A KENWOOD!!! Their customer service is beyond horrible and they don't update their equipment when there are new updates for smartphones.
I can't know for sure. I installed it on a Toyota Rav4 2006. I think that if your car has a double din size for your car stereo, it will be ok.
According to the cravenspeed.com (the Manufacturer) web page, there is a different part number for the 2012 Traverse then for the Equinox, however they do have one for the Traverse (part # CRMC-0704-TR) . I recently drove from Chicago to Madison Wisconsin and I had no issues with radio, satellite, or cellular.
Look at the spec and your car mount angle and you should be able to estimate the total height. On my Equinox the height is not more than 6 inches.
Yes you can used this case. It fits really well and protects your headphones .
Yes, but small. Holds spare batteries but not much more.
This antenna IMO is only good if you want to get rid of the larger factory antenna or you only listen to Sirius/XM, as AM/FM reception is worse (I live approx. 35 miles outside of a major city) and the AM/FM stations were barely coming in.
I have no clue. I took out the stock unit and this one screwed right in on an 13 F150
I replaced the Stubby... Was not happy with it at all..
No problem with my unit. The picture comes up very promptly after you turn it on.
yes
It has enough built in for about 5 or 6 shots, so yes you will need to grab a card. I have used class 4 thru 10, from 2gb up to 16gb with no problems. It is a great bridge camera IMHO....
37.5 inches.
Standard
No
Not sure the full weight but I've easily put a 5d mk iii on it with a tamron 24-70 w a led light with no problem
hello no
Yes it even came with a strap and bag for the camera. (:
the camera was in perfect condition, and the packaging was good.
Hi... does NOT work because the dock is for iphone 4s as well itouch or ipad model with the big docks
If your TV, DVD, Blue Ray has a mini-plug audio outlet, I suppose it would be possible using the speaker's "aux in". However my experience with this tower is that the built-in TV speaker has better sound.
it is 12 long 7.5 inches tall and about 4 inches deep and it is nice and heavy, very well built and sounds great.
s.w.#1 goes from 4.4-4.2 4.0 3.8-3.5-3.3 MHZ #2 5.4-5.3-5.0-4.7-4.4-4.2- MHZ #3 6.7-6.6-6.3-6.0-5.6-5.4- #4 10-9.5-8.8-7.7-7.0-6.6 #5 14-13.6-13-12-11.3-10 6 18-17.8-16-15-14- 7 21.8-21-20-19.5-18.5-17.7 I hope this is of use to you and answers your question.
The model I purchased restarted the USB at the beginning.
It is fixed in place!
Yes, it fits my laptop perfectly.
I'm really sorry. I've been really ill and don't much about this product as I purchased it solely for my 77-yr old father. I hope you find the answer that you are looking for.
You get the camera, charging/upload usb cable, and the instruction manual. I don't think it comes with a warranty on Amazon, but I'm sure it does on the olympus website.
You receive the same standard parts as if you purchased directs from Apple. Power supply with the 30 pin cable.
It is the original 30 pin.
Yes with an air printer
No, it can be used on any network.
Very fast
yes it does
Not a 100% sure how to answer your question, but no. I ordered my IPad from Amazon about a year ago. It came in all original packaging. Works awesome, I love it. So no, no scam.
Yes
No it wasn't isn't just the mini older version. But honestly it's wonderful and worth the money
Not for the extra money required to get it. You can go to a store and compare the difference; it wasn't big enough to impress me...:)
Yes ... Also nook app.
2013
i have no idea. i bought it for my wife.
It has: Apple Bluetooth Software, version: 4.3.1f12 So I guess yes!
No
The screen is excellent and very sharp for photo viewing. For the type of photo editing I do professionally, I'd say it's too small, but for amateur snapshot editing it would be fine. I don't have a very good frame of reference for judging the processor, but I'm able to open large files on this computer much more quickly than on the PCs I use at work.
If you will be on the go often, you should get the MacBook Air due to its great battery life of 12 hours! If you want something that's durable and doesn't have a horrible screen, get the MacBook Pro from last year.
Do you mean jailbreaked? If that's what you mean than no, otherwise you setup you're own apple ID in which case you would set the settings for locking.
It came with original box and so no question of scratches on the Ipad
Fix you right up!
Yes a charger, the one I bought had new battery too!
oh hell yes
Yes!
Not at all. It's a standard size keyboard, same size as a 13 inch Macbook Air or Macbook Pro. The only keys that are smaller are the function keys at the top of the keyboard.
After installing Words, Excel, PowerPoint and some essential applications, you'll be left with about 90 gig of hard drive. I think that's more than enough for everyday tasking. I store about a thousand songs and 50 full HD music videos and it only takes up 20 gig. I still have 70 gig left and don't know how to use them up haha. FYI, with 1 gig, you can store hundreds of words/excel/powerpoint files.
Go for the new air it is powerful enough for most users and very handy. Nothing beats the looks and usability of an air.
Hi Brock. Yes, the MacBook Air comes with a very basic word processor called "TextEdit." You can also download "Pages" from the Mac App store, which is the Mac equivalent of Microsoft Word. Also, this might be of interest: http://www.apple.com/iwork-for-icloud/
The battery life is close to 7 hours. I surpassed 4-5 hours multiple times with regular use. If you are only getting three hours, you have a defective battery.
Brand new and Yes! My daughter loves her MacBook.
You can actually run Windows (any flavor) on the mac using VirtualBox. Once you have that in place you can run any Windows application in your mac
It comes with a wall/USB charger nothing else
I am no an expert, but I do know at times amazon will price match other competitors. As of September 2nd, Bestbuy has this item at this sale price. Hope this helps.
It is model I guess it comes in original package,but the one I got Showed a picture of it with 32 instead of 16 so beware of what you see and what you get
The warranty would be valid anywhere as long as you get it serviced in a country where there is an apple store or a country serviced by apple
25w
I believe you do get that. Its best to ask for the serial number and check it via apple.com to make sure of the warranty before you buy. good luck
No, the newest has Touch ID. You can find it searching for "iPad Mini 3"
I love my ipad mini because i have a macbook and iphone where i can easily share photos, music etc. via icloud. I am travelling and its easy to take along with me anywhere i go. I have downlaoded the kindle app and im able to store and read all my books on there. Its just like having a kindle but with faster internet acess and more apps! I hope this helps :)
There is nothing but portability, but the ability to go anywhere with the internet and computing power has a bunch of advantages.
Yes, it means you can use it on any provider.
No, refurbished devices have a 90 day warranty, I can purchase apple care if I chose to but considering my personal experience with apple products I don't find that investment worth it. Also the 90 days count from the time the seller purchased or obtained the product, which means I'm just outside the guidelines.
Call your local APPLE STORE
It has iMovie. I don't really use it so by all set up and ready to use if you mean it starts and I am able to import files in it, I should say yes.
yes.
No you have to buy the monitor seperatly, but you can use any other manufaturer's monitor. It does not have to be Apple. HP is the only brand that have the silver that matches Apple and they have several sizes and prices.
That is all depending on how your budget is ... under ideal configuration, An Apple Monitor would be the best option, but we are all aware that they tend to run close to 4 digits, at least ... and that is not always within a regular John Dow's Budget. the nice thing with this unit is that it has inbuild HDMI option, so in absence of better options, just use your regular HDTV ... it should do just fine.
Actually yes you can,. Its a very powerful machine
I cannot help; you may check a web site www.cnet.com; Best regards.
1 year standard can be expanded with apple care
yes, it REALLY MATTER! You should buy 8G! Heavily programs use much RAM! (Sorry bad english)
Yes
Not sure... I would send an email to Apple in your country to confirm.
It's a 256gb SSD.
I don't see why not. I am currently running OS 10.10 on this machine. All of my apps work just fine with maybe an update here and there.
No, but it is a quad-core processor.
Yes.
If you are willing to spend that much money on a Mac Pro, you should be able to build it to your specifications. They are VERY dependable computers.
The new macbook pros do not have a cd/dvd drive. You have to buy an add on if you need. The smart drive is about $80. I bought one for my imac and use it for my macbook pro as well. I think I have used it once. It is really for old stuff since most software purchased is downloaded and music can be streamed.
Yes
Yes! You can install windows with the aid of other softwares such as Parallels in which case you can switch between Mac apps and windows programmes without rebooting your Mac. Your Mac also comes with boot camp assistant which also enables you to install windows with the exception that you have to reboot you Mac each time you want to switch to windows. Hope this helps!
There were a few early issues with certain monitors and an earlier release of OS X Mavericks, but any 4K monitor should work just fine with the proper HDMI cable.
This masterpiece features all the jiggabits you could possibly fit. Unfortunately no ram. Apple uses exclusively merino breeds.
8GB
No never worked. Waste of money
I have had mine for a while and I have not noticed any warmth in the keyboard. The letters on the keys have not faded or come off. Have not noticed any of the keys sticking at all. All in all I love this keyboard and wish I had gotten it years ago.
YES IT HAS
Yes it does :) one front camera!
It depends on your phone....most smartphones will route audio to the Bluetooth speaker when your Bluetooth is engaged.
Yes it does.
It looks like Amazon does this for all TV's that fall under the same model number.
There will still be a USB port, and HDMI port available. Depends on what your computer has in the way of output ports.
This web site has a calculator to handle different TV base on resolution and size . . . http://www.hdtvtest.co.uk/Article/How-Far-Should-I-Sit.php It appears 7 feet is a good distance . . .
About 40 lbs.
No
Im using a Microsoft Wireless Keyboard 3000 V2.0 and works perfectly with mine, just plugged the usb and go.....
I did...a logitech k400. It works ok.Makes browsing the net and manuerving the screen alot easier. For some strange reason, when I try to set up netflix,vudu etc it wouldnt let me enter info via keyboard only via the remote.Will troubleshoot it at a later time.
I don't think so
Get a bluetooth connector from amazon. It's only 5 dollars and add it. That's what I did. Works flawlessly.
Amazon Woman, It does not have a SD-Card slot. However, there is a USB input that may support an SD-to-USB converter. --Mr. S
Easiest way is to push the camera down which will turn the motion off. I only use the camera for Skype, however not on a regular basis. I don't miss the motion functionality at all.
You would have to do a conversion from 240 to 110. Maybe get a power strip that has the conversion built in.
Absolutely. Just plug it in via HDMI and you're good to go!
no they are not the same. The FXZA is a more advanced TV
No ,, this is a great tv and has an excellent picture ,, the only thing is you have to set the color and settings to your preference,,you can find the settings in the review section ,,hope this helps.
If you are asking if you can get Netflix on this television the answer is yes. However, you have to either have wired or wireless Internet connection for the TV. Mine uses wireless and connects fast and has had no problems at all. Hope this helps.
Yes it connects wireless
If you don't have a newer Digital TV then you need a conversion box.
Most antennas in Seattle seem to be around Kerry Park. If you have a decent line of sight to that area, you should get good reception. Remember that the higher you can mount the antenna on a mast, the better your reception.
You will need a pole to mount it on and cable to connect it to your TV. The pole I got is this http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WOVD1Y/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i01 I would try it without an amplifier. Unless your signal is really weak you shouldn't need one.
i called nikon to find out which usb cord i needed. try calling them. i am sorry i could not be more help.
I can't tell you! My little camera is Coolpix S01. I ordered it because I lost the one that came with the camera. The lost one showed up, now I have two.
I had to use it for my sony blue ray player. Works great picks up my comcast wireless perfect. I use it to watch Netflix
Yes as long as the model has a USB port.
No
No, ATT is Dsl, sbg941 is not. Do not know what will?
Japan, I think.
Hi Elizabeth.... One of the things I like most about this camera is that it is very easy to change settings. For me, the menus are very intuitive and that would include the menu for turning off the focus beep. When you go into the settings menu, go to "D" and scroll to the last screen of D and you will find the sound on focusing setting. Set to "off" and you are good to go.
It will only do this if you select it in the menu. All 3d tv's give you the choice between 2d and 3d.
Noooopppe
Love this bag, currently traveling all over Africa with it. You can remove the compartments (dividers in the lower part). So this would give you two separate areas but they would be separate.
Not sure about that camera but it is a big rugged bag. Well worth it IMHO
I would imagine you will have to look into whether or not it is compatible by going to http://panasonic.jp/support/global/cs/tv/ ...... this site will tell you if it is
what does the TV say when you switch to the component input? Does the DVD player have composite (yellow/red/white) output or HDMI?
Yes. As the official technical specs says: *Supports high-end water cooling solutions: top 360/420mm and bottom 140/240mm radiator support
when i installed it on my system (not a dell XPS 8300) i ran into a few issues because the driver from the cd-rom and from the ati website over clocked the video card without any notification, when i notice that (after a week trying in many systems) i have uncheck the overclock and after that it worked just fine. hope that help you.
You should be able to find it here: http://www.pasc.panasonic.com/EpartR/PartsList.asp
It's the type that breaks in a year because this TV sucks and you shouldn't buy it.
Here's what I think about that question. Don't buy this TV because it broke after a little over 2 years and is a waste of money.
Yes. I purchased a pair of Sharper Image wireless headphones and they were easy to set up and worked great
just HDMI and 3D glasses if you have a 3D tv and want to watch bluray 3D movies.
Looks like 400mm x 400mm. See manual pg 8 below. Hope this helps! http://service.us.panasonic.com/OPERMANPDF/TCL32E5.PDF
I'm pretty sure that it is.......... however, I've been thinking about putting an extra coat of scotchguard over it, Just to make sure........ by the way, I love my bag,,,,,,,
As long as you have wireless internet, you shouldn't have a problem
There are no S-Video outputs. There is a component, optical and a Panasonic adapter-type RCA audio and/or video connections through the supplied Panasonic adapter.
Unfortunately there is no head phone connection you have to use you main stereo.
I concerted this TV to a AV receiver.
This is my third Panasonic viera. My first is 7-8 years old and I paid $1100. I'd weigh the value to you versus the price for the warranty. Knock on wood, I haven't had any problems with them!!
The 87 doesn't have amazon support. You'd have to get the 220, or above for amazon support.
I have two, lasted for over 2 years... and I love them. No better DEAL anywhere! Buy it.
To tell the truth, I'm not that concerned with 3D. I did plan on trying it out, but since I ended up buying a TV that doesn't come with them, I'm probably not going to buy any. I know AVSforum.com has a thread specifically for this TV and many people say a lot of the Samsung ones are compatible and work well. The Panasonic glasses are only $30 a piece now, I know that. Sorry I couldn't be of much help, but I would definitely check out AVS.
Yes, it does. If you power off and leave the disk in, it will also resume playing when you turn the machine back on. This is setup in the menu.
I agree. Dropping that much on a TV may be ok with you if your a millionaire and 10,000 plus for the TV and surround system isn't a problem for you but for the average joe the money saved buying the VT50 will allow you to get a kick ass surround system and even some blurays to complete the ultimate home theater and you'll still pay less than just gettin the Elite
Yes, you can connect a Roku box to this TV.
There are 3 hdmi ports,1usb port, 1 sd card slot, 1 rca av input,1 pc input, misc av.
Hi I havent tried connecting to pc with this tv yet. I use it for my wii u and with hdmi, upon booting up the game system it detects it as 1080p. Hope that helps
yes
No keyboard.
I just got mine today and yes it is compatible with Amazon Prime Videos once you link it to your account.
Yes the new Panasonic Blu ray DVD player does the same thing
At the most 3 to 4 hours a day.
Not clear on your question, but the TV supports Netflix, Hulu, etc streaming content (i.e., it's not directly usable to web surf, if that was your query).
I did not have this exact problem but there has been a rash of bad circuit boards axcording to the tech. Its unusual yours works intermittent ly versus complete failure. If I had to guess it sounds like you have a cooling problem and theset shuts down to save itself. Try putting a small fan behind it.
has to be either the modem or the router, my guess is the modem. my gt50 streams absolutely perfect.
Actually, it's XLR input ONLY. There is no 1/8" input on the iRig Pre.
They are RCA
it is 5.5 volt, not 7.5 volt, check you panasonic phone, if t is 5.5 volt then you can use it, you will have no problem.
i bought these adapters to use in india on panasonic phones.working perfectly until now.should work,i think.
Sure yes... You will use a small flat screwdriver on the 8ish clips around the top and sides of the keyboard ... Once the keyboard lifts remove the jaw connecter that holds the keyboard ribbon then remove any screw labled door. Once these screws are removed use the screwdriver and push down on the part that says door open latch and push down... Then the whole piece will remove from the bottom and you will easily be able to release the ram.
Depends on if you are a student or not & the features are listed by cost.Around 65 to 75 dollars for students and 100 to 149 dollars depending on features needed.Microsoft will not offer the office starter option on newer netbooks!
I found online that it supports OS X 10.6 and up. I am not familiar with OS X in general so I can't fully commit and say it will be easy to use. Many users are claiming it to be hard to find a good program for burning the data. Apple has never endorsed Blu-Ray so this shouldn't be surprising. I would check some forums before committing to a purchase, but I must say its a great BD burner.
Yes, I don't know why other people are saying you don't! Ordered this two days ago and yesterday I got an email with a code and instructions to redeem the games. On the checkout page it should say "Congratulations. Your purchase qualifies for the external token bounce back reward." - that means you will get the games.
Yes
No.
Hi Brenda! Maureen here from The Friendly Swede:-) Yes our stylus will work beautifully with most applications on a touchscreen (capacitive) device. I have never personally tried the chalkboard app, but we are very generous with our return/replacement policy if it ends up that it does not work to your satisfaction. Hope this helps, please do contact us at our storefront email if you have further questions. Here is the link:
These are universal they work with all of our devices. I have a Galaxy Tab 2, husband, daughter, son-n-law have I-Pads & l-Phones works great for them as well. Grandson uses for his Nintendo DS. Have micro fiber tips that will touch & scroll for all the devices. Nice colors well made. Have paid as much or more for just one this is a bargain 8 for $8.99. PAB
Yes. They work perfectly on all smartphones.
A large screwdriver wedged between them, with a good amount of force applied. :)
It comes with a wrist-strap, a computer plug-in cord, a battery, and a battery charger. Hope that helps!
No, it's quite slow. I recommend you spend a little more $ and get a Canon DSLR that can take at least 10 frames within a second.
Yes, mine came with both.
It takes really good video that can be uploaded. But not as a web cam.
It's a CCD.
Yes, it has 2 seconds and 10 seconds setting on automatic timer.
There is sound while videoing but it is very faint. Cannot have background sound.
I do not have the camera- My son thought the quality was not that good, so we wrapped it up and shipped back to amazon. Sorry!
Sorry, no idea about filter. However there are no threads on the retracting lens assembly so probably not unless someone makes an after market adapter that can clamp on. The camera has a built in self timer function for delayed picture taking but no remote shutter control that I can detect.
It has a very easy to read manual.
no...once you stop the video, that video is over. You will start a new video when you begin to record again. Also, don't talk while taking the video, unless you want YOUR voice to be heard.
Yes it does come with the USB cable. The CD is so that you can download the camera's program to your computer, laptop or other device. This enables you to better utilize your camera, by downloading and saving your pictures, editing with the Canon software, etc, etc.
Well if you use just 5 MP its around 10000 pics
Which memory card would work best all around in the canon sx260, a sandisk card rated 6 or a faster rated 10? Some have suggest either would do fine for still pictures while others suggested that a 10 rated card would be better for HD video. But is there a big difference in performance in this camera between the two?
shipping weight is one pound.. that is with the box and packing etc.. it is less.. I don't have a scale that would weigh less than a pound, but its very light. would fit easily in the breast pocket of a man's shirt.
Definitely NOT pink.
They are always releasing new models. If you keep waiting for a new model, you'll never buy a camera. I got the D-10 and now the D-20, I like both.
When you first set it up do a channel search. Make sure you have it set to cable and not antenna
Allana you can contact CobyUSA.com/technicianssupport Maybe you can find a manual there. This model is extinct. But it is similar to the Coby TFDVD-1595. There is a manual for that out there. http://www.manualowl.com/swfviewer/viewer.php?FitPageOnLoad=false&SwfFile=%2Fmanualswf%2Ephp%3Fid%3D185330%26manual%5Ftype%3Dproduct%26d%3D5de0130289e28d40e13b9300f3f36761&FullScreenAsMaxWindow=true&ViewModeToolsVisible=true&FitWidthOnLoad=true&Scale=0%2E6&SearchToolsVisible=true&ZoomTransition=easeOut&localeChain=en%5FUS&ZoomToolsVisible=true&ZoomTime=0%2E5&NavToolsVisible=true&ProgressiveLoading=true&ZoomInterval=0%2E1&CursorToolsVisible=trueCursorToolsVisible=true&FullScreenAsMaxWindow=true&ZoomInterval=0%2E1&localeChain=en%5FUS&ViewModeToolsVisible=true&ZoomToolsVisible=true&FitWidthOnLoad=true&ZoomTime=0%2E5&Scale=0%2E6&FitPageOnLoad=false&NavToolsVisible=true&SearchToolsVisible=true&SwfFile=%2Fmanualswf%2Ephp%3Fid%3D185330%26manual%5Ftype%3Dproduct%26d%3D5de0130289e28d40e13b9300f3f36761&ProgressiveLoading=true&ZoomTransition=easeOut
Sorry I am not technical ... our little coby has served well in our RV travels over the last two plus years.
I think so there are connections to audio and video
Sadly not
Hold the power button and the down volume button for 30 sec and it will reset factor setting but you will lose everything you put on it
6-7 hours.
Hi. I have not connected 2 of them to each other. What I have is ONE extension/surge protector and 2 Nugiant connected to it. One on each night table next to my bed. This allows us to connect our devices on night tables to power overnight
If I remember correctly, it was either 30 or 90 days. Good luck trying to contact them.
No camera and I bought two of these and both were defective, luckily amazon refunded my money.
It's only a black friday special. Though, I spoke with their large items department and they said they are not guaranteeing the $179 price. That is a possible rumor and they may or may not discount the price. And if they do they do not know what prices they will be taking these down to. They will do their best to be competitive with other black friday sales. That's just what they told me
It does have an audio out (looks to be standard 3.5mm headphone jack) and you can also use the optical out to a wireless receiver if you have wireless headphones.
YES. Here's what I found out on the internet..."The universal design allows it to be used on cables from 60% braid through quad-shield while maintaining excellent hold strength against the cable."
Devices itselft - can, but You are describing very complex and layered setup, probably, INSIDE the Linux running under virtual box - no, but running under KVM with IO paravirtualization - yes. But that's very "layered" setup..
It is new - but this is the body only - no lens is included.
Amazon.com has the black and white cameras also.
It doesn't say unfortunately sorry.
No, this is not compatible with the model asus F200CA
Not sure. I don't eecommend it. It blew out my computer battery portal.
I have no idea but I would not buy this, I have only had mine for 4 months and already it doesn't work, plugged it in the other night and my computer wasn't charging then i smelled electrical burning and it made a pop noise, I quickly unplugged it
Yes. It's OK
I can only say probably. It's the one used by Time Warner. It's a Motorola, I'd give it a good shot but be careful where you purchase it from. Read their feed backs.
I think so, though you'll probably want a stabilizing set up. 24mm on a crop sensor is hard to keep steady hand held. I shot this documentary with it: http://insearchofthemoment.com/waiting-for-water I also used the 50mm 1.8 but it should be obvious which one is which.
Hi, We bought this lens for our daughter's birthday. She is a Photojournalist on Martha's Vineyard, she absolutely loves the lens.
The new one is made of fancy plastic and the old one has some metal. The new one is slightly sharper. Another major difference is that the old one has 77mm filter size and the new one had 82mm filter size. You have to be pretty finicky about image quality to notice the difference.
My daughter uses this bag. She does not put a laptop in it but has some books. I don't think it is as big a bag as a back pack would be, but if a lot of books aren't needed then it could work. Don't expect a lot of heavy texts to carry.
That's what mine is, 17" & it fits great! Love it!

I don't believe so. It is a pocket with zippers on either side, but the bottom is enclosed. Hope this helps.
I have used it on Sony camera and it is a very good lens. I am not familiar with Black Magic Design camera unfortunately. Mir
Should be, as long as you make sure and get the Micro Four Thirds version.
Dear Customer, thanks for your inquiry. As you can see you model was listed on the titil, so it will fot for your laptop. Hope this can help you. Bets regards Ice
I just checked the back of my tv and it does have the 4 holes aligned in a square. I'm very impressed with my tv it has an awesome picture and the sound can be turned up loud enough to here it in another room and low enough that it doesn't bother someone in another room.
It did mine and has worked fine.
Is Sony
I am not sure it's gonna be work on your laptop or no, you have to make sure order same battery as you use before
Working area is 9" x 6" I love it and could never go back to a mouse.
this is for drawing on computer monitor.
The space bars and all the keys are extremely smooth and easy to press. I'm a writer/editor/grad student so I type hours a day and I also have arthritis in my hands and wrists. This keyboard has been a big help overall. I had a keyboard with a sticky space bar so I know what you mean but you won't have a problem with this one.
Yes, it will. Worked just fine with Windows 7.
Worked with my 2012 MacBook pro. The caveat is that I had to use the included PS/2 -&gt; USB adapter, whereas other adapters didn't work.
I'd recommend buying a keyboard made for Macs. This keyboard will work with a Mac (like all USB keyboards) but because it's a PC keyboard, the placement of the Mac "Command" key will be different from what you're used to. This can be problematic if you're switching back and forth between the macbook keyboard. However if you're tech savvy you can customize the key placement in settings.
I have never used the pause on the Aquos remote. I have only ever used the DirectTV remote to pause a DVD. Sorry!
Optimus
Our 640u did not have this feature but Amazon free 30 day tech support is very helpful and knowledgeable and friendly. Give them a call.
YES, 844, 845 are 240Hz, 735, 745 series are 120Hz
No problem with the signal from my Sharp DVD player, but you may have a HDMI cable problem. Try a different cable.
I have not tried this specifically from Amazon Prime, but I do have the TV connected to my home wireless and I have streamed video on the TV from other sources, such as youtube, on the TV's browser. So I would suspect Amazon Prime video would work just the same as other sources.
Not sure what you mean but volume range is plenty loud with decent headphones. I've had mine for over a year now with plenty of abuse and it still works good.
Yes, very well, but you will need a audio blue tooth transmitter that plugs into your audio out on the back of your TV. They can be purchased for under 20.00 here on Amazon. The only downside of it is you have to pair the devices every time you turn on the TV, but that only takes a few seconds. I am very hard of hearing and make watching TV a pleasure again and not having too hear my wife complain of it being too loud. MC
yes!!! just like a lot of the major brands of binos, i.e. nikon monarchs 5,7s etc.....
It fits my iPad 4 with no issues.
No it won't.
Not sure, but I doubt it because the IPad Air isn't as thick as the previous generation IPad. So probably won't securely lock into place.
Yes it will
I'm sorry I don't even know what a VCD is so I cannot answer your question. I would just google that question if I were you. GOOGLE knows everything :-)
We have had no troubles from it
The Samsung BD-E5900 is not sold as a Region-Free device but you can make yours region free by following the instructions at this link: http://www.videohelp.com/dvdhacks/samsung-bd-e5900/11828
I do not know.
They do but not at the same sound level as with a Blu-ray or high end streaming service like Vudu.
Shane Rodney, This model has a digital optical input for incoming audio signals. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
yes
One year on parts and labor; some units shipped with the offer to extend the warranty an additional 6 months if purchaser registered the unit's purchase online at Samsung's website.
yes it does very well
I've owned from a veriety different brand speakers (pioneer, alpine, infinty...) and I say these are the best speakers I've had. They get real loud and are crispy clear (got heads turning) I'm running 4 punch pros on my 600.4rms RF amp
Mainly its for awesome mid range , not for mid bass or anything a sub would play , but it very loud for mid range .. If you have a spl set up , you really should have this up front , sound stage ..... Hope that helpz
4 ohms
This product comes with 2 speakers unless stated.
4 ohms
No, you can only hear one frequency at a time
Set of two
You may have a defective unit.. Mine works at 12 feet away just fine and also I programmed the soundbar to my directv remote.. I don't even use the soundbar remote anymore. Hope that helps
Not sure I know what a battery grip is? Fits my camera perfectly.
Yes, but barely. The velcro does not completely overlap.
Will this MD12 work with the upcoming D810? It should. Nikon has it included in their list of power accessories on the D810 webpage.
Yes, you can install it but only if you replace it. Don't add-on memory. You can install up to 32GB memory in your new notebook.
Yes, even with a case.
I looked up your phone and it won't fit. It only fits the note.
Yes,it worked in the U.K. Fine with 240 volts, so you will just need an Australian plug adapter for their socket fitting.
Our DVR takes BNC, it should work if you put BNC to RCA adapter on your RCA cameras.
I did not get the accessory kit since I had several of the items already (headphones and USB Cables) and just wanted a USB Mini to micro adapter and a mini USB cable to charge my phone. The kit is not a bad price but you may also have things already and it might not supply what you really need.
it's been awhile, but i believe several owners reported it having an auto alert preset that would drain the battery. i could be mistaken. i was researching this and the NOAA radio, at the time.
"Does this unit come with PRINTED owners manual?" Mine did.
If I understand the question, yes. You see the video that is being recorded via the outputs on this unit.
I believe this does not work with a Blackberry. This is the USB model which is designed to plug into a laptop or desktop computer. There is also the Speak 510 model ( http://www.amazon.com/Jabra-SPEAK-510-Bluetooth-Softphone/dp/B00AQUO5RI/ ) which has bluetooth connectivity in addition to USB- so assuming your Blackberry has bluetooth, I would recommend that instead. It's more expensive but it works like a champ.
Yes. Works on both Win 7 and Win 8.
Yes, if you have pci-e slot on the motherboard.
26 inches
It comes with one
That's to log in to the device and manage it. ID is left blank and the PW is admin
the case i got was a snugg. a little expensive but its extremely tough and well made. theres so many different kinds that i got on google and researched it to get the right one for mine.
It should be, although I seem to remember it as formatted NTFS to start with. If your build supports standard SATA interface, you should not have any problems. It has been a very reliable drive for my Windows system. The only caveat is that an SSD does require periodic "garbage collection" by the operating system. You might want to check if your intended OS will support this. This would apply to any SSD that you may be considering.
Sorry, I can't answer this question.
yes, the one i got is a 1080p hd tv. but the show has to be in 1080p hd to get the full effects. but the picture is great on everything. sherman
It has a sleep timer mode on it. It will shut off automatically after setting it for desired time.
There is a normal coaxial connection for an antenna but no headphone jack as far as I can tell.
Luke, I don't know. I haven't tried to hook up any external speakers. Sorry
Have not seen any problem with the battery indicator with our SX-280 with either the Canon battery or the batteries from this kit.
It depends on what you need. Here is the price list: https://www.watchguardrenewals.com/OnlineStore/ProductSelection/ProductSelection
I don't think so. This amp simple only 100 W mini amp and only one 4 ohm out put. Trminal. You can find brigible amp another BOSS model.
Most likely if you have the correct bracket
Dont know if the screen is blue when i connect my phone its just like the pic above just with features and I have a samsung phone
This is not a motorized face....
Yes, but it will be best if you order the installation kit and the wire adapter kit for the car. add about $30 for this. Just search Amazon. Get the installation kit for the 2004 Toyota Corolla, and the wire adapter kit for the Boss to Toyota. The wire kit is optional, but makes it easier to connect the Boss to the Toyota harness. Look for something like the the Metra wiring harness for 2004 Toyota cars. The Dash kit will be something like a Scosche Dash Kit for Toyota Cars.
No. You control volume and mute on the computer.
As Shette answered earlier, you can use it for listening but not for talking because on single ported cell phones it's all wired through a single wire under different configuration.
No. The Sennheiser PC 31 has separate microphone and headphone plugs. It is meant for use with a PC. If your landline phone has a headset jack on it, it is probably a 2.5mm jack for a headset like this one: http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-KX-TCA60-Hands-Free-Headband-Cordless/dp/B00007M1TZ
Air-P is based on Silicon Image 2nd generation 60 GHZ chipset. Smaller Air3 is based on 3rd generation chipset. Wireless performance essentially the same, only advantages for 3rd gen are smaller size and much lower DC power consumption.
No
No, this is a docking station that can also be connected to your computer, amplifier or speakers.
I use default. Did not do any calibrate on it
There is a service bulletin out for this tv. I just had mine fixed by best buy under warrantee. The motherboard and the cable going to it short out and cause this issue. It will slowly get worse. Service bulletin ASC20130429001
I just checked mine--it comes with a combo wall charger/USB charger. The cable plugs in to the GolfBuddy at one end and into the wall plug at the other, using a USB connector in to the wall plug device. Bottom-line it comes with all you need to enable either wall plug charging, or via computer using the USB connector.
sure thing buddy. i use mine for that with an HDMI cable.
I do not think it does. I have the first edition Kindle Fire in mine. I believe that's only 7 in. and the button cutouts will not match up. Sorry.
You put it on. There is the rubber part which you place on the back side of the kindle, then there is the outer line plastic part that goes in the front and the screen protector you attach behind it if that makes any sense... I have had the case for a little over a year and still love it. Hope this was helpful :)
Yes......I love it, it's perfect! Get it for this price of $28, I paid $33 for mine, I should have waited. (smile) Ed D
Mine did not come with a keyboard. Only item included was the remote control device. Not certain there was an option for a keyboard.
Try the factory default. Very bright but very effective to my eye. Good luck. WO
sure thing buddy. i use mine for that with an HDMI cable.
Depends how good the singer is.
Yes this unit has am and fm tuner. The included fm antennae is adequate.
It comes with everything you need, though depending on how your room is set up you may want some extra speaker wire in order to get the surrounds where you want without tripping over wires. I got some stands for my surrounds as well because walls were not convenient, but if you're just mounting to walls I believe it has everything you need.
That I don't know. I don't believe so. You can find the manual online if you google it. It should be in there. Let me say though that I have had and continue to have major problems with mine. I have to reset it constantly because I lose audio for some reason. Then I have to go through the setup process all over. Also have problems with the hdmi connections. Wouldn't recommend this receiver to anyone.
That's probably not going to work since there is only one output source for the speakers - and those are for the speaker wires. the coax, component video, and optical cable are all inputs, only one hdmi output to connnect to your tv, the rest of the hdmi are all input from your other devices as well. do some search you may find a coax output for speakers, but it may be difficult because a lot of newer receivers are either hdmi, optical, component video and even bluetooth.
Not that I see
Definetly will
Yes
Yes. I currently use it as a 5.1 receiver. The other two speaker outputs can be toggled for 7.1 or as a separate powered 2.0 zone.
Yes, this will work in a 5.1 environment.
I'm fairly sure it will. Contact the seller to make certain.
Mine has a significant amount of padding on the bottom.
The original battery gave out after only about 30 minutes of talk and the new one hangs in there for a much longer time. I have had a 70 minute conversation with the new battery.
Yea
They're dark metal and yes, they should come with screws. They're good quality you won't be disappointed.
this unit does not have any kind of input or output connections in the back, there is a ipod dock for the older generation i-phone/touch family, also this unit will connect to your regular router, no need for apple router(airport express). i have installed airfoil for windows on my laptop and it works great, the laptop and this unit have to be on the same unit to talk to each other. if the other reviewer is talking about the shiny chrome input jack above the power jack --it is a fm antenna input and not a speaker out
No, there is not.
If you were misfortunate enough to have bought thr BTT195, simply route the HDMI output of your Roku to the input of the BTT. However - if you have not yet bought the BTT - run like a banshee. This was the single worst audio product I have ever owner - sent back after a month of trying to live with it. Life is too short. Get a Pioneer.
yes
Yes it does have AM FM radio.
No, but it also doesn't go and retrieve the disc for you. I suppose they figure since you have to get up and go get the disc anyways, you might as well hit the eject button while your over there.
No, digital only.
You should be ok. I have a grip on my camera & it fits fine.
nope....and in reality you could purchase a messenger bag of your choice & then purchase the separate SLR organizer to put in it....fundamentally this is merely a messenger bag.
The zoom lens will fit in side compartment with the Day holster on camera in the middle section. To remove the lens from case, however, I had to remove camera first since it is a very snug fit.
I have a 7D with a Tamron 18-270 - both fit in this although a little snuggly in the internal travel bag but it works for my needs. I love the bag because it has a base that allows the camera to sit upright.
yes. I carry my D5200 in it with either an 18-55mm or 55-300mm lens attached and the other in the storage pocket.
Yes, it should, although there will most likely be little space remaining for other accessories. It is a handy bag for a single camera.
Yes. I got it in the mail while I was gone for a trip and never opened it. Is something wrong or missing?
Yes, you can. Won't exactly be of super high end professional quality, but it will do it, and pretty well. I gave this as a Wedding gift and when the happy couple returned to show me photos, we actually connected the HDMI to a big screen and took a penny picture. It focused well and fast, and took a decent shot.
I have NO idea., Sorry!

Yes I think so
Top of the TV to the top holes is approximately nine inches (9"). Distance between the holes is 400mm (about 15.75 inches) per the manual.
Sorry can't help, we have slow internet speeds and have only fair response at best
yes, all you have do is hook up a hdmi cable from the laptop to the tv.
This TV doesn't have a headphone jack.

Yes. Any time one person initiates the intercom it breaks into the music feed. The nice little British voice tells you "intercom active"
No
Hello Jake, The Cambridge Audio 551R is produced in China. Please let us know if you have any other questions. Regards, Andrew Kovacs Audio Advisor, Inc.
I don't believe there is a volume limit and I certainly made one volume using 3TB drives across 1 extender, but I can tell you that I wouldn't do it again. I wish I made the extender a separate volume. If a drive dies and you replace it, you've got a full rebuild to do which will be that more intensive and if another drive dies in that process, you've lost everything.
It is $1000 the demand is very high at the moment and seller are cashing in. Wait for a while and it will go back to $1000.
Yes works with 220 Volts.
Yes,but had problem with volume knob working
push the dsp button. push and hold till numbers blink, then turn volume to raise or lower numbers. do again for minutes and set for am or pm time.. hope this helps.. bob.
It does not support any devices add media players, only as storage devices. Unless your Apple product is capable of entering a "mass storage device" usb mode, then no. Most modern phones will not be compatible without tweaking.
This pen is for tablet pc's with wacom interface. I don't think it'll work with your ACER. It doesn't work with Cintiqs and the like or Bamboos.
Yes, it does!
Yes, the battery will work.
You need a SIM card just for the alarm system. There is no programming of your cell phone.
No, a big disappointment.
My understanding is that this DVD player is for Zone 1 only.
Yes
Actually, the cards are basic photography tips and best practice. There are very rare references to Nikon menu settings (maybe 2?) which I was able to abstract to my Lumix FZ150, so model of camera really won't affect usefulness of these cards for your applications. But they ARE useful to troubleshoot lighting conditions for better shots on the fly with recommendations for aperture and shutter speed. Professionals will know these things by heart, but these cards will be useful to the beginner/intermediate amateur and for the experienced who just want a refresher tip when they need it.
No, it's general enough to apply to all models of DSLRs. Yet, the detailed suggestions are really helpful. For example, I used suggestions from the Sports topic and the Indoor Shooting topic to prepare to photograph my nine year old granddaughter's first basketball series. It gave me confidence that compensated for lack of experience. The format (guidelines & suggestions) is particularly helpful. Thanks for your inquiry.
Yes it does
Hi: I bought this for my wife, and yes, it has those controls, and many, many more. You will be happy with this package, I must say. Not only do you get plenty of quality extras, but the player itself is highest quality. It has GREAT sound, through the headphones or earbuds, and it is so stable that it is more like a pod than a CD player. You can toss it across the room, and it won't skip a note of music. So, that's my impression. I hope it helps.
I don't think this 'Sony Walkman' can be connected to an electric outlet period. The Walkman did not come with any transformer to accommodate the low voltage that operates the device. Plus there is no jack to accomplish this. It is strictly powered by two AA 1.5 batteries.
It doesn't go on the camera it fits on the end of the lens using adapters. so as long as you lenses filter size is the same as one of the adapters that are included it will work.
They are complete on their own. They will fit in a Cokin mount. It's a really good set. Not certain what the reference to notched means. The mounts for the filters has multiple slots so you can add multiple filters to one mount to get different effects. Maybe that's what is being referenced.
The card has 2 sep processors....providing gpu processing of 512mb per
Don't buy it! i couldn't get the damn thing to work and it was missing the drivers, original packaging and cables. Buy something else!!!
No, it does not.
12 volts, everything in your car runs off of 12 volts.
It has it's own control
When you configure the Nero HomeMedia software that comes with the LG SP520 you configure the add the drive\directory to the media library and start the media server. Then using the remote with the device, you select the Nero mediaServer and go to the video folder to select from the available media files on your system to view. The system does not like some media formats, but I have not found that many. Generally if your video is .avi, .mpg or.mp4 you wont have any problems. I have mostly 1080p video files.
This is the newest model for jvc go on the jvc web site and it has everything there or call them there customer service is awesome. I only buy jvc head units
It has been a while but I think it came with one USB Bluetooth adaptor and the wires to hook it up. Manual of course, What specfically were you looking for?
no steering wheel controls
Yes. You'll have to buy a universal camera, but the hookup is there.
Hard to really say, but check here: http://www.f150forum.com/f38/ford-sync-aftermarket-radio-87985/
It works w/ the Bluetooth on a Samsung Galaxy S2, so it should also work w/ the 3.
You don't need one. If your receiver has an Audio Out - you can run a RCA (red/white) to 3.5mm cord from your receiver's audio out to the input on the back of the LG soundbar and it will play whatever the receiver is playing. The soundbar does NOT have an audio out so you cannot hook it up the reverse way.
If it's more than 20' away it will have trouble connecting and if there's a bunch of big objects in between
You know this system has been a pretty big pain for me. Sometimes it will work and then it just wont depending on what I have it hooked up to (TV, computer, etc.) I havent had that problem but I do know that you can go into the system through the TV and adjust the volume levels. You can also do a test to check all the speaker levels. Also try pressing "optical" on the remote.
I'm realy not sure. That was the number on cables I bought. I'm happy with them, they look very well made.I was impressed for the money.I did read somewhare that there's not a whole lot of quality difference in the lower priced hdmi cables.
No
If your truck has the factory 6x8 speakers then yes they will. They come with the wires to connect them to the trucks speaker wire. You'll have to cut the factory plug off and wire them. You can measure them by pullino your door panel off and get your measurements unless you can get them without taking it off
Bought this for a trip to Europe. Plugged it in the first day. There was a spark and it stopped working. This was while using a flat iron. Does not work. Ruined my trip. I couldn't charge my phone or use any of my things.
The one I got was glossy. Looked better than the original. Unfortunately my computer got stolen and I ended up having to buy a entire new Toshiba. lol
I didn't replace the cable and mine is still working fine. I would say no unless you see evidence of unusual wear. Also cost would also be a consideration... If it is $5-10, no problem. If it is $25, I'd say nah...
Should work for any Dell Inspiron N5110. It was a perfect fit for mine and easy to install!
Yes
CMOS
You might be able to do that, but I don't know how you'd be able to get the camera off to take pictures. Using this the way it was intended does not really put strain on your back- that's the beauty of the design. I wear mine while hiking all day without discomfort and I'm 69 years old.
I have mine connected to an ext cord. Only 6 or 8 ft with no issues. As long as the cord allows an input of 110v to the adapter, it shouldn't matter.
Yes. No service in my area even though it said I would...
Each one already come to the Sim card. The monthly fee you pay covers the subscription that is tied to a Sim card in the device
No it is for the ipad 2,3 or 4.
It's 10" by 7.5" so the iPad fits good in the pocket.
Actually, it can hold a monitor. I got this model to not only hold my Lilliput monitor with the extension arm but to also hold the telescopic mike. There is little stress on the hotshoe as the screw plate works effectively. Hope this give you some assurance with the product. Just balance your monitor in a manner that it's more centered with your camera if you have any reservations about the strength of the hotshoe.
Did it arrive that way? It should look smooth and clear. I bought mine on black Friday through Amazon and it still looks goid. I would contact Visual Land there should be a 1 year warranty. Good luck.
So far I have been using this projector for a year and the bulb is as bright as when I bought it.
Hi Jacob, Here is the link where you can plug in the camera and brand you have and it tells you which wire you will need. http://www.pocketwizard.com/support/cable_finder/
No - That one is backwards to what you need.
yes. I am usuing them with a pioneer vsx82 as rear speakers they work very well as main speakers as well.
Even though I haven't listened to both, I thought I'd reply anyway. I combed thru the net for reviews on both. There are many for the 10.1 and only a couple for the 10.2. None compared the two. Obviously, 10.2 will produce more bass, but I was afraid that larger woofer wouldn't handle the upper midrange as well. No review discussed that, so it's my own supposition. I bought the 10.1, and the bass is very solid and goes lower than I anticipated. Very happy with it. Hope this helps at least a little bit.
i dont think u need a seperate pre-amp - i have a turntable and all i use is a speaker bar (large powered speakers... not the best, but for now it works) that plugs into the pre-amp, and then the preamp hooks into the record player
They are both well regarded at this price level but only your ears will tell you how they compare. I have heard it said that if your cartridge suits the PP2 loading then its not bad at all. Technically the 651 is a much better design with better overload margin. Audition both and see what you think.
Yes it does cone with a steadicam case.
The one I received was 3TB and don't have the box anymore to see what it said when i opened it! Sorry.
Yes, the 7770 is crossfire compatable. It can be paired with a 7750,7770 and i would figure the new 7790 as well...
Yes
It does have a web camera and will take pictures. They will not be awesome as I believe it only has a 1.8 MP camera. It uses a software suite called "youcam".
I'm not positive but I think so. I had to remove my iPad case to sit in the device.
It should.
yes you can go to Yada .com and you can get all replacements parts
I just got back from several flights with my computer and that bag. I always put it in the overhead bin.
Hi! I think I have the same laptop and I thought this bag would fit and it was way too big! I got a samsonite laptop bag for $20 and it was perfect!
I purchased this item in February. My HP 2000 15'6 laptop fits perfectly. The item is light weight which gives no additional weight and it easy to carry. It has the necessary compartments to carry accessories. It also comes with a shoulder strap. Up to now I have no complaints.
I think so. I am using it with a Nikon D5200 with an 18-200 lens. The lens fits. Don't know how big your camera is. I like the way it provides one compact unit to carry.
Not sure. Fits my D40 perfectly with the 200mm lens on it. Try measuring your camera and compare it to the measurements in the diagram that is shown with all the pics of the case. That's what I did.
Not when I got this amp. You have to manual adjust settings on the amp itself
Yes. And well worth the money omho.
13 Street Glide. Has been installed for 2 months. Running a component set and 2 6x9's, at 2.1 ohms. Mounted on top of radio, and I've had no issues. No clipping, and doesn't shut down. Gain is set at 9, and running in high pass at 85Hz.
Yes, they will fit, and are an excellent choice. Mine is putting out 379 watts at 4 ohms. I love it!
It has a small cap as a cross over. I still use the crossover on my amp though. I have these in my truck and they are incredible! They are bigger than the look in the picture, about the same size as a 4" mid and can handle a lot of power. I'm very happy with mine
No this thing is heavy duty!! No grill is necessary.
I don't think any of the t61's came with a webcam, but there are many small webcams that can be attached to the top of the computer with a USB port.
Overall Dimensions: Width = 18.4" Height = 11.4" Depth = 1.25" Width = 16" Height = 9" Diagonal = 18.4"
It does have to be plugged in. Nowhere in the advertising does it say wireless.
check online here http://www.nix-digital.com/file-attachment/x15b-user-manual
It should work just fine. It has some different buttons so that you can play games through your roku. It has the home key and works like the original.
All I can tell you is, it works with mine :)
It has 2 dual link dvi
The P1 has a unique input connector but is shipped with a dongle that does VGA and composite video. I have used the projector with an iPod Touch, so I presume that it can be used with an iPad OK as well. You do need to have the video adapter from the iPad to VGA, which is a separate accessory.
This is the best information I can provide: Type Headphones - Binaural, Headphones Form Factor - Full size, Headphones Technology - Dynamic, Connectivity Technology - Wired, Sound Output Mode - Stereo, Frequency Response: 10 - 23000 Hz, Sensitivity - 106 dB, Impedance - 32 Ohm, Diaphragm - 1.6 in, Magnet Material - Neodymium. Hope this provides some help.
yes
any camera should work if you have either RCA or BNC connectors...whichever you have you can buy adapters really cheap to work.
Yes, it does. A bit tricky to set up, but it does work.
Yes I believe it would be. This is a very reliable product and I have overclocked my chip w/out issues.
It's 92mm.
I can only guess that the right hand (looking at the back) is the receiver antenna, but that's just a SWAG on my part. I'd suggest you contact Hawking to get the 100% correct answer.
Besides the differences in connectivity, the "newer model" does not have speakers and this one does. Jim
Yes
Line out should be great if your source is set up right.
It has the standard 3.5mm audio output which doubles as an areial when you plug in your earphones for the inbuilt FM radio.
Yes it does
Yes there is just like on your phone.Hit the mute button and you get the incoming call.Hit mute again and return to your previous call.
Unpair it from your cell phone by going into the settings and deleting or "forgetting" the connected device.
Sorry, I have not connected the cell phones yet.
The box feature lists/confirms that the phone base unit WILL work with just land-line power. The wireless handset will not work, and most base unit extra features also will not work (eg caller ID). As long as the land line phone company lines are working, the base unit will let you make and receive calls during a power outage. it's one of the reasons we were glad to buy this since it means we won't have to change the phone out to a trimline etc in a power-off situation.
I unplugged the power supply to the base unit and it stopped working.
It will play then sequentially. I have so many tracks that I still haven't reached the last one. But, if I remember correctly you have the option to loop, shuffle, or stop at the end.
I did not have that problem. It should have switched to green by now. Are you sure you are using the right power cord? Maybe it is not getting enough juice. Let me know how it works out for you. I keep mine in my car and it gets powered there as I am using it. Have never had a problem with the green light showing.
It completely depends on the format and length of the songs. The average size of a song in MP3 format can be anywhere from 3 to 6 MB per file, if it was ripped at 128kbs which is one of the most popular quality levels. If the file was created in a higher quality than that, then the file size will be larger. Generally speaking, it is fairly safe to say you could fit between 200 and 400 songs on a 2GB player.
You would have to check the specs for that camera go to Canon's website
Bustergolf I don't know enough about the 660 to answer. Works great on my XPS 410. Good luck.
It does work with 3DS. As long have the latest software update for it then it'll work.
Nope, it's just a basic LED HDTV
yes if you buy a tv mount
hi Faith.....i think you meant Pixel rate which is the number of picture elements that composes the picture, the higher the number of pixels the more picture elements and thus better resolution.....hope this helps you out.
you need to buy Philips' internet card for $50, or it will never work.
No, it's just 1
Yes press the menu button on the right side below the screen a menu pops up delete is the bottum choice.
Make sure its the reset button not the mic porthole.
Yes
Bend Over
I have not dropped mine in water and only handled with damp hands so not fully tested by me concerning waterproof.
Yes
Yes
It comes with the headphones and the usb charger/transfer cord to hook to your computer.

Hi the samu small buttons for skip the tracks but your must hols them ...
No, it can't be used with Rhapsody. It can be accessed like a file system. If your sound system can normally access data off of a flash drive then this will also work in that fashion.
It's drag & drop. Super simple.
Yes, in fact I could not get it to work on my added USB 3 card
Yes, I believe a 4 year old could. The button isn't very hard to press and is fairly big. My son was 5 and had no problem.
This does not provide wireless service so there is no radio.
Max 16 at the same time.
Yes. You can connect this to your cable modem and use it as a wired router to distribute your internet connection throughout your home or business. The key word is "wired" as this does not have wireless capability. Connections will require ethernet cables.
Yes, the non-stick insert is required. Under that is just the heating element.
Contact nesco directly. They will ask you to ship it to them to repair. Mine was repaired and has been working fine ever since.
Yes, all kinds of rice, white or brown, it does a pretty good job. Just follow the instructions.
Any device with a typical mini headphone jack can use this, but this iHome speaker system does not charge anything.
the clip can be detached, and when you look at a two Prong mic you want to look at the botton pin (also the smallest) and see if it has two o-rings on it. anything midland compatible/ icom ect as long as it has two orings on the bottom prong http://www.amazon.com/Rainproof-Shoulder-Speaker-Microphone-Midland/dp/B00G1DLT50/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1394520045&sr=8-4&keywords=midland+speaker+mic
These can be used anywhere on earth
I am now on my second at&t phone set and once again I have a battery issue which made me replace the previous set in the first place! I enjoyed its functions but now I have decided to purchase a different phone set to replace it and will go with a different company this time!!! but yes you can silence the caller id by going into menu and select caller id and choose on or off to both the base or handset. if I did not have this battery issue I would highly recommend this phone.......
No.
They don't work within the range
Yes, they does sounds vary clearly.
Yes, I just used one yesterday and have since ordered one for myself. I had purchased off brand cable which was working with a friend's MacBook air but not on the surface so this is the first adapter I've used which has worked with the surface pro
yes it does
Hello, i dont think that may work, it is a stand alone system.
no. i have no problems with reflections from lamps or any other light nearby my tv.
Yes, it does. There is a jack in the back that says it's a Digital Audio Out (Optical). This is a very nice TV! And it works well with DirecTv's 3D programming. When I bought mine it came with a Samsung 3D DVD player and that renders exceptional 3D as well.
i already sold out. and with remote contral
It does not support pal only NTSC but you get NTSC pal covertor which will serve the need
Yes
No... It is probably 1/2 that size, the box it comes in is closer to that size.
This is a great camera and takes awesome pictures. Technical Details Brand Name: Samsung Model: EC-DV300FBPRUS Optical Sensor Resolution: 16 MP Optical Sensor Technology: CCD Optical zoom: 5 x Display Size: 3 inches Viewfinder Type: optical viewfinder
Yes, as long as you see the micro sd slot on the side of the phone it will work. Absolutely worth the money.
It will fit into any single din or normal aftermarket radio.
Yes from the Amazon and inside the manufacturer warranty.
Yes - the data files from the device are mp3 format. Pretty much any disk burning software will be able to save the mp3 to a CD as a data file OR convert the mp3 and burn a CD capable of being played in an average CD player.
Yes it has adjustable arms.
Here's a good phone number to call to get quick, expert technical information about the Peplink Pepwave: 866-463-0129.
http://www.peplink.com/technology/4g3g-modem-support/ Look on this website for modems supported by Surf on the Go
I ordered one and returned it. It didnt work for me as a stand alone umit(wifi booster) i missread add or they added more info. Looks know like this unit is supposed to hook up to router then send you wifi signal. I wish i had called seller to ask why it didnt work before returning it. If it works it is one of the only ways to get a mobil network with wifi router in a mobil vehicle like my rv.
You have to remove the front panel. Once you do, you will see screwholes for a fan.
I installed 4 120mm fans, one on the bottom just in front of the power supply, one in front behind the front cover of the case (that just pulls off) one in back of the case and one on top of the case. If you have a mid to full size mobo, the top fan will have to be moved over a bit and then secured with just 2 case fan screws as it will not line up properly, mid to full size mobos tend to block the fan from being installed on the pre fit holes.
Hello Maria, I believe that PSU will work and fit just fine, even though it seems to be a little large. I recently add a "Rosewill RD500-2DB PSU", and I still had more space in the case, to fit an extra ventilation fan in the botton vent next to the PSU. Hope this info is helpful for you! Good luck with your buying!
dont try that case..your h100i wont fit because of the clearance is very low to you motherboard..this case it wasnt design for that type of cooler..my suggestion get a corsair case that supports h100i water cooler or any other cases
great- love it, everything I have fits , takes up less space from my old tower
My battery never worked. They would allow a return, but I would have had to pay shipping myself. Wasn't worth my time, just recycled it. Buy a better battery.
It's brand new and manufacturing date is always no more than 3 months from current date.
This was bought for my daughter. She got Mac from her college. I like smaller laptops (11-12 inches). I am actually selling one with Office 2013 loaded on it. You cannot go wrong with this one.
USB port on the back of the radio
Yes it will but u will need a mounting kit
My advice to you is to the update you entertaiment system by getting a new blueray player or a ps3 (something that uses an HDMI ccable.) You are not getting your money worth by using rca cable on your 50 in HDTV. But if you refuse you could always by a rca splitter box. Can connect up to four devices into it and the box into the tv to view one device at a time.
it does
32" to 42"
in settings
No, I wouldn't recommend it either. it stopped syncing with my computer ani haven't been able to find a way to fix it.
yes
There is a USB port on the NEO. Enjoy the NEO. I've been very happy with mine!
uses usb cord that plugs into computers or into outlet if the usb plug adaptor
There's a clip on the side, so you drill it to the right size and slide it in past the clip and that holds it in
One inch. I used a 1" hole saw and it worked perfectly.
I can only guess that it is not a compatible disk. I don't own a cool pix
Theoretically any FRS (Family Radio Service) or GMRS (General Mobil Radio Service) radio (same radio, just that channels 16-22 are the higher power GMRS) should work with any other regardless of brand. I have used my older Cobras seamlessly with Motorolas being used by others. FYI, technically, you are supposed to get an FCC license if you use the GMRS channels.
Yes it will work . Canon T5i use the same shutter release Canon RS 60-E3 as all the rebel cameras , including the 60D as well . The Yongnuo MC 36R/C1 has the same pin to connect with the camera .
I used this card on a Nikon D7100 with no problems. Some older or smaller camera's can't handle the larger GB SD cards. I have a laptop that can't see larger GB SD cards either. Hope this helps.
I believe it is because it is a Prime purchase, If you belong to Prime, you get free shipping and 2 day delivery on most items labeled PRIME.
Everything you mention but a paint pen.
Yes. the battery remains in the camera while charging.
Yes. These are made in Japan. I make tons of DVDs everyday, I only get 1 error in 500+. Super high quality.
If you have the camera set for a long exposure it will start that. I don't think you can hold the button like a manual cable used to do. Stay away from this one though, it is cheap, too small and easy to lose. I never did get mine to work at all, but not worth returning,
Unfortunately the D3100 doesn't have the infrared receiver required for this shutter release remote to work. Meanwhile if you need a remote controller for your camera but will cost you a little more check out this product: http://www.amazon.com/Yongnuo-Wireless-Trigger-Shutter-Transceiver/dp/B004YW79F4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1385769926&sr=8-3&keywords=Yongnuo+RF-603. This radio transmitter allows you to half press to focus and full press to shoot just like the shutter release button on your camera, from any direction and from long distances (unlike the infrared controllers), plus it will allow you to do bulb and long exposures as well. I hope you find this answer useful and good luck.
It's as much psychoacoustics as it is science, lurking somewhere between reality and wayward dreaming. At least that's my take on it. Basically it's just playing noise that contains all audible frequencies through them for a period of time to break or burn them in. You'll do it over time just by using them so no need worry about it. Does it improve the sound? That's for the user to decide, no one else really can.
They are the length of regular headphones. Approximately 4 feet from their earbuds to the jack. They are great headphones, lightweight with a surprisingly great sound just burn them in first.
Don't know if it fits a 2009 Hond Acc, however, perfect fit for my 2003 Hond Accord.
It is not OEM but, it worked very well when you transfer your existing internals to the new shell. Looks very close to OEM as well, I was very happy with the result
Its alright. I find the cord length a bit annoying when lifting weights. But when running and doing cardio they are great and stay put on your head. I don't recommend these headphones if you're planning on doing sit-ups or pushups, they tend to slip, bit it mainly depends on your head/hair (bald, conditioned hair, etc.)... Oh yeah, after having mines for about 1 year. The plastic construction of these cans, make this hollow sound when running. Its hard to describe
I don't remember this being a problem. So I must not have had a problem with tangling any more than with other earbud wires. The wires are smooth, and are probably less likely to catch on each other than some other more rubbery wires.
Yes, and they sound great.
I use them to cut grass, they drown out the sound of my riding mower surprisingly well. I could imagine they would be great in a gym setting.
have not tried this other one...
nope, no mic no volume control, no buttons. nothing. at least on the model that I have
Angled.
Yes. It should fit fine.
About 40 inches end to end. When wearing over my shoulder and across my laptop sit at waist level. YMMV
Don't know but it's the same as advertised on amazon
Orange
Aproximately 4lbs
A laptop should be able to use any sd card. If it has a slot for it, this should work.
Thamk You!
This will be up to the reader built in or added via USB to your machine. If you give more details you may get more help here. Generally speaking this should work unless the reader is extremely old.
This is a full size sd card so it will not work in a phone that requires a micro sd card.
The iPad air is smaller then the IPad 3 and 4, so I would say no
The board does not have onboard hdmi, it is set up for gpu type video cards, and works with cross fire so you can have multiple video cards running at once.
I had to use parts from my old lamp assembly to make this one work. The bulb itself is fine but the housing was junk.
No because the iPad 1 and the 2 are different sizes.
I really don't know but you can check the speakers size from the Hyundai accent. I have a 2001 Silverado it fit.
Pair
2 speakers,you will love them
each speaker is 4 ohm
It may, the ripsaw heatsinks are tall. Worse case y'all have to remove the lower fan?
This cooler is big and heavy. So if you are cramped for space or have a small mobo, there are other lighter coolers out there to consider.Although this is an outstanding cooler!
I don't know about that Gateway, but I am using it in my HTPC that has a case that is only 3.5" wide and it works fine.
What do you mean by "normal"? It won't work with CB. It will work with GMRS, MURS, or FRS.
Around 16 km for simplex, but it varies widely. Altitude is very important. If one of the two people communicating is at a high, unobstructed location, then it could be 35km or more. In many cases, people make use of a repeater, which could allow a 50 km range. Also, if you attach a better antenna than the included "rubber duck", that range could double or even triple.
Since I don't have an SB-26 I can't be 100% sure, but it works on my SB-25. I think the SB-25 and SB-26 are the same flash except that the SB-26 includes the delay mode and an optical slave. That delay mode sounds pretty cool if you mix TTL and non-TTL, though I have to imagine you sacrifice sync speed at high-power settings. If you have the time, let us know what you think of it.
i use it for my nikon sb800 & meike mk900 with a godox speedlight flash pack, everything works fine.. i don't have this flash, but it looks like the Yongnuo YN560 III will...
Yes
Yes, but it's debatably worse than the built-in screen.
I use it with my 5100 and it works just fine.
Synology website says it is 100 to 240 V. http://www.synology.com/products/spec.php?product_name=DS1512%2B&lang=us#p_submenu
Yes it does. I have been using it on mine for over 101 hours now. I did get a strange problem with it once or twice where the projector would not light up and the lamp warning light would come on. I just powered the projector off and on and it worked fine after that.
Yes
Yes there is a charger cable included. This was one of the reasons I purchased this camera. It plugs into the camera and then into an outlet, for my previous camera I had to take battery out to charge. The Samsumg makes great pictures too.
No the triod is very small but is useful keep camera steady on a table or cabinet. Taller tripods are not that expensive if you search online for one.
7DKDR4J
Yes, it will work with desktops, laptops, and netbooks (Mac or PC).
Hi Marilyn. Yes it will work with Mac OS 10.4 especially since it does not need a driver to work. It's basically a plug and play device.
Yes, I use it for Comcast.
The cover very carefully guards the edge of the iPad it does not extend more than a quarter of an inch at most on the front. It does not interfere with the smart cover
Yes
No, it does not have a head phone jack (sorry about the delay in answering your question. I didn't realize anyone had a question inasmuch as I don't frequent the web site very often).
There is a battery icon on mine in the corner, however I usually have it plugged in
No one makes a sound card like that anymore really, I'm building a new comp and I'm looking for a built in mobo. But if you must get one read the reviews. The soundblasters don't have the 7.1 jacks for the tiamats.
Yes, absolutely it is. Each individual speaker in the head set harmonise around your ears. You feel like your in the game itself more so than any other gaming headphones I have tried. The only problem with it is that since razer put so much to the sound quality of the tiamat the built-in mic is not the best. Like I said in my review the mic broke in mine but since the sound quality itself was so good I kept it and opted for a stand alone mic to skirt the issue.
Yes.
it should because it works for my hubby's samsung galaxy 5 player
No idea sorry can you check with supplier?
Yes this will work perfectly. Love my Intensity Pro.
Records onto the computer
No I already tried that
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!!!
The KD-X40 is marketed for the IPHONE. I haven't tried to use my Android, but I will try here soon.
Did not compare them with any of the above mentioned headphones but they definitely sound a lot more interesting than Q710.
Thailand.
I used the projector for about 9hrs no issues
The color reproduct at least for photos was terrible if it is imp to you spend more
Yes!
No issues with that. I put it in the middle of my truck back seat on a trip and kids could both see it fine from the sides.
Yes it works with Roku 3.
Not sure. I use with my quantum qflashes and it works fine. I have a cable that powers my 580EX AND 600s, but I have yet to use it in that capacity.
I'm not sure about the warranty I didn't really look at it I bought one lite to try. I loved it so much I bought 5 more! i use them with a I R video camera and one lite will work very well in a room that is fifty feet by fifty feet. I video large ware house size places so some times I use two lights with one camera. Bottom line these lights work very well.
Go to Radio Shack, or simply take a power supply unit that comes with most camera's and just use the power side of the wire that connects to a standard camera. Problem solved : ) Dan
Camera box contains battery, strap, USB cable, AV cable, USB-AC adapter, and CD-ROM with software. Didn't find yet to buy an extra battery which is a must when traveling. Had to purchase an SD card. The camera comes without it.
The one I got my wife was new. If it's refurbished item I think the description should say that. For what it's worth the camera we got is great.
It fits your car but Don't Support x m radio.
There are a couple different methods of snapping pictures, holding the button down, or simply pressing and releasing. In the correct settings for your lighting it's very fast, but in low light and very dark scenarios it can tak a second. Especially if the desired target is far away. In normal lighting in auto, the photos come quickly and if you are new to the camera, you can accidentally take sever pictures without realizing it. In other words, pretty damn fast, but for split second photos, you will still need to time it a little, it's not a dslr
I have read everything I can find about this tablet and have not seen any info about a dock. (or any accessories for that matter) According to the manual, it will come with a usb adapter for the mini-usb port. I believe you could use a traditional USB keyboard with the adapter. I have one pre-ordered, unless I change my mind before they release it (could they be more vague on the date?!) and intend to get a bluetooth keyboard to go with it. Here's a link to the manual if you haven't seen it: http://global-download.acer.com/GDFiles/Document/User%20Manual/User%20Manual_Acer_1.0_A_A.zip?acerid=634685991372961583&Step1=Tablet&Step2=ICONIA%20TAB&Step3=A510&OS=a09&LC=en&BC=Acer&SC=PA_6
Depends on your graphics card. If you have a DVI-I output, then no. If you have a DVI-D, then maybe. This page here (http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/221/~/what-is-the-difference-between-dvi-i-and-dvi-d?) will show the difference between the two outputs. This adapter didn't work for my card, I had to purchase an active adapter which costs $20-$30, but each cards is different. Hope it helped.
Yes it will, but you need tech support to get it working. If you purchase from Amazon, you will be buying an unauthorized product and will receive no tech support unless you are lucky and get a tech that cares. This company really does not care about it's products or customers. Nevertheless, I bought 4 of these and will buy new ones when these die. Don't expect any help from the company. If the first tech does not help call back. Some of their techs are great.
The Platinum is our older model. It offers six different 3D settings where the Diamond offers 11 different setting of depth which can be combined in many different ways with the 11 options of magnitude. The Platinum comes with our original Honey Bee Depth Engine. The Diamond is equipped with the Wasp Depth Engine which provides a better 3D quality. You can buy the Diamond and Platinum from Amazon or just the Diamond from our website.
Thank you for your question. It does require a 3DTV and the 3D glasses for the TV.
No I believe not. The ST30 was a 2011 Viera so according to Panasonics graph you need the TY-EW3D3 pair. Those are IR as opposed to RF.
Yes
If your TV is a 2012 model or needs active shutter glasses I know it will not work. Not sure if it will work though. Hope that helps a little.
I had someone install it. It did come with step by step directions. Also you can go on the Lexus forums, they have a lot of very helpful information including how to install your mast. Good Luck.
Yes it does . However if you own ipad 4 you might get discoloration on your iPad screen . Adapter is too tight , you may not even be able to securely close all 4 corners. if you do please read my first response to your question
The film does not reduce brightness and might hide tiny scratches; scratches that are buff looking will show.
Yes it can, but really it's an issue with your motherboard (e.g. what populating the 16_2 does to the 16_1 slot) Since the Rocket 640L only uses 4 lanes and since PCIe 3.0 is backwards compatible to accept PCIe 2.0 and so on. You shouldn't have any problems with this card plugging into the slot.
It is standard VESA. Four bolts. I took my old unit off its mount and put this one right in.
My son had his XBox360 hooked up to it and was blown away by it. We have hooked to PC up to it, but only to watch live feed we had very good results. Honestly, I can find nothing wrong with this TV at all.
Mine is a 47" (48" -forgot) and does have audio outputs. I am very pleased with my TV for the price but I bought it several months ago on sale. TCL has an excellent web site where you can easily find the answer for sure.
I tested it with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006OY4I8G/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Atech Flash Pro-37U USB 3.0 True SuperSpeed 3.5" Internal / External Flash Memory Card Reader w/ Front USB 3.0 Port. Works fine, but need hi-speed USD Flash or similar device.
I believe they are ironman earphones just different style. I bought the white ones, i like the sound but the gummy earbuds keep coming off and i lost one already. I dont know if i would buy them again. Im searching for other ones
I just put it on my EM-1. perfect fit. Had purchased it originally for my EM-5.
Yes it is.
Yes, each intercom was connected to three different androids, in my case, and they all had working intercoms. The third rider could even listen to music from his phone while the other two are paired, and when one of the others switch, the music will stop and the intercom will kick in.
Yes
No u have to b in a city area
Not while driving, only when sitting idle!
Before I can make an effort at answer your question, I need to know what brand is you laptop and the watts of your current charger?
Ofir, I have a dv7 and it works fine. It makes it sit up a little higher in the back, but nothing else is different in the way the screen opens or closes. OH-it does last a lot longer than the factory battery ever did and mine came with the extended duty battery. HTH
The keyboard fits every standard USB port I've tried it in on both laptop and desktop computers
Not specifically. Go to the website for details. Last I checked, some basic keyboard features may work, but others will not. No guarantees.
No, it does not. It came with composite and audio cables.
Thanks for your question. I'm not familiar with such an adapter. The manufacturer's tech support might be a good resource for this question. . This is a fantastic sounding unit. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud ARCAM dealer.
If the Capture is a CTL model (which I believe it is) then yes, it should work
Absolutely. I carry scan discs myself and they work perfectly.
is not big, the base is 10x6 cm and high 2,5, Plus is actually working very well
Battery life is poor, I couldn't get more than 2.5 hours max. Different antenna is a must as reception is poor at best with the existing antenna. Do some research on this as I ended up giving mine away. (Very poor quality in my opinion, very poor screen, waste of money)
It comes with a 115VAC adapter, but no 12VDC power supply.
It comes with a pull out one in the back I recall. The tv broke very quickly and I haven't looked at it for months.
"40W 2-Channel speaker system for rich, full sound", right from the description of the item.
If you record off a HD over the air feed, it will record in a .ts format. There are various videos players (check the web) that you can download to view this format. Otherwise, you need a video editing software to convert the .ts file to something more mainstream such as .mp4 or mpeg-2. I found a way to record off my Dish as well but even though it's a HD Dish channel, it records in analog and the format is mpeg-2.
How far away did you move it from your WiFi access point?
You can add it in yes, it's an option within the settings
Does not. Just speaker wires. Great system.
The grip for the 70D is the BG-E14
No.
Yes it's made by Canon one year warranty
I havent had any problem, maybe you should check if your units has the same group ID!!! if the problems continue you should sent you unit to service... have try to fired your flas with another master unit?
Yes and no - Yes it works as traditional IR way, but that requires clear line of sight between two. You cannot use radio feature of 600ex-rt to trigger 430ex
The following is an answer to a similar question for this product on this site. "Yes it is compatible EOS 1Ds Mark III EOS 1D Mark III / IV 5D Mark II / III 7D 60D / 50D / 40D Rebel T3i / T2i / T1i / XSi / T3 / XS." There are probably some limitations. I suggest that you call Canon support at 1-800-OK-CANON (toll free) 1-800-652-2666.
Yup, 4 AAs just like the previous models. You can use your preferred type of battery of course , but that's the size. Side note/update that I may post later: You are paying big bucks for only a little bit more power and recycle time and built in radio transmitter. If you really know how to make the most of your flash, you can get the same results using much cheaper flashes. Worthwhile reference: Scott Robert Lim courses. Sorry, prob more info than you asked for!
Yes
It says it is 1080, It has 2 HDMI inputs. I have it connected by HDMI but not to HD, so I cannot say for sure. There are RCA outputs for external speakers and you can shut internal speakers off in the menu.
No, it does not.
NO. well not that i can tell ?
Nope, not at all
It is straight bass boost for the amp. So you can set your levels on the amp as far as frequency and boost etc. The remote allows you to lower the total bass, or increase it. So you set the amp up so it thunders at full and then the remote allows you to lower the gain to almost off when your parents or whatever are in the car.
Yes I believe so. I've used it with the SPA301 and the SPA303, so it should work with the whole SPA series.
Yes it seems to work fine.
Yes it does
All I know is the information given on the back of the speakers, which is 4 ohm 8 watts.
Mine didn't. Just an ordinary wall plug.
It's a great little machine, but the question you are asking is all GREEK to me.
Absolutely. Depending on the college notebook!
Maybe. It just barley fit my Mac pro 13. And if you plan on putting more than a computer and charger just get the next size up.
You will need an adaptor from 30 pin (input) to lighting (output) to then connect to your phone as the connector that comes on the system is 30 pin only.
No, only the air play app on iPhone will work. I tried to use amazon video, and it didn't work.
Since it outputs through the 30-pin connector, it doesn't matter if it is sd or hd. For that size screen, there won't be any noticeable difference.
They work perfectly with my D3100 and D7100, so I'd assume they'd work with everything in between.
I am not sure about the D3200 but I have a D5100 and it works well with it.
When there is no signal, the screen is blue, and reads no signall in red
Yes it will. Says so in the description.
If you are buying it new, the I/O panel is included. If you purchase used, ask your vendor.
Yes!
Yes it's a color camera.
Yes we put a couple of them on the ceiling
Yes, there is an included remote to do this. I have operated it from about 25 feet away without a problem.
If the talking could be described as a constant drone, maybe. Like when you're in a coffee shop and there is an even level of noise where you don't hear any one single conversation. But if Sally just won't shut up about her weekend in the Adirondacks and keeps monopolizing the conversation with Jim in the next cubicle, get some earbuds instead. In my small office, earbuds are superior. The downside is that they don't visibly indicate to others to leave you alone.
These will not be sufficient enough for your needs. Dr Dre's will work but at $200- they break easily. Recommend that you get the ear muffs that they use at the gun range or move or call the police
No, it does not have that.
Yes they help but not as much as you are led to believe. The battery power makes no difference at all. r
Over the ear'but smallish in size.
No. This requires power and BNC video cables.
I'm sorry I can't answer that, I have not tryed to do it.
my friend uses them strictly for recording. The sound is really really balanced so that you can hear every detail. In my opinion it could use alot more bass in order for it to be super enjoyable for casual music listening
Unsure. I wouldn't buy this one. I returned it.
small headphone/earplug connector found on all portable audio players. The audio out volume is controlled by TV. I haven't tried unpowered speakers or headphones, however, I use a cheap amplified soundbar which has a similar input connector and never had to crank the volume higher that 5 (out of 30).
I don't know what a slim card is. If you mean a SIM card...then no. This is not 4G or LTE it's 802.11b/g/n and is not compatible with mobile phone company networks.
They work with just about anything I've tried them on. Requires an ethernet port and power. Powered by usb. USB can be powered by external brick. USB is not the interface for providing networking so if your chromebook doesn't have an ethernet port then this will not work.
Since Power = Volts times Amps = 125V X 15A = 1875 Watts
I haven't bought this, but it say on the box pictured thas it's an HDD not SSD.... The fact that kas said it was spinning inside proofs it even more.
it's no original.. but really work it's all you need i guess
I am sorry for the misunderstanding. The listing was changed and it takes some take for the changes to apply.
I have and it fits if it is not too full
I haven't tried it out on a long pull anywhere yet, but the handle does have a shorter position that feels like it will "lock" in place. My measurements are: 37 inches from floor to bottom of t-handle when fully extended and 27 inches from floor to bottom of t-handle in shorter locked position. I hope that helps your decision making.
Yes.. It fits perfectly under an airplane seat and I even had room to stuff my purse right next to it two weeks ago when I was traveling by air.
Yes, if you have a converter. It would be a 3.5 jack to USB. I used it an on PS3 like that. It actually was a mic, with the way I had it hooked up. They may actually now have a 3.5 jack on the Xbox or PS4, I do not own one though.
Same item, different sellers.
20-20000 hz. Pretty average.
My husband has a these and I borrow them quite often. They fit me pretty well too :) however they do make some meant for women!
Yes they do, 1 year, but not international. Only national.
They have bad sound quality and literally broke 5 min out the box. I expected so much but big disappoint ment
I am not exactly sure as I didn't try them with an S5. But probably not coz its an android too. You can listen to music but the controls won't work. And you can't answer the calls too.
No, they are not noise cancelling. In fact, I've used mine on flights before. While they block the engine noise better than my earbuds, they are far from completely eliminating the engine noise.
Sure, you can leave your device in the case. My wife (it's her iPad) has a hard case with a fold back cover and it has no problems. I've propped my iPad with a soft leather case on it and it fits too, though I don't do the hours of drawing on the desk she does. She remains delighted with the desk.
It works with my 10 inch Galaxy Tab 4 so I don't see any reason it wouldn't. If I want to leave mine plugged in I need to put the bottom of the tablet in the up position so the power cord has a place to go. Takes a little getting used to but it's easy. I also use it to rest my Kindle on when I'm doing a lot of reading.
No,it does not.
it doesn't look like a regular keyboard, the numbers are on the top of the board like all laptops. Hope this helps
maybe it would. If u have audio rca out on tv , then convert to 3m plug
From what I understand your source can only be Bluetooth or auxiliary, so if you are using the same phone or device to run both speakers it probably wont happen
We use ours in an outside bar and it is plenty loud enough. Not sure if you are wanting to use this just to play a song / songs during the ceremony (which should be fine) or wanting to use it for the reception party (def will not be sufficient). If just wanting to play some background music or a special song during the ceremony it should be fine.
It doesn't use 110 or 220v. It has a buttery and you can charge it with a usb cable which it comes with the radio.
Yes. I bought this for my D40x and upgraded to the D7000. Works great for both cameras.
Don't know about the D3200 but it does work with the D70.
I have a D50, so I am not 100% sure, but I am fairly sure it will work. It works great with the D50. For the price, its worth trying.
The charging base is powered by a 12.5 volt 500 milliamp wall wart. You'd need a solar panel capable of providing 12.5 volts to the charging base.
No
My car is a Peugeot 406 V6 2001
no its just a cover for your nook or ipad..but I really like it....)
I just use a damp cloth and wipe it down.
no its just a cover for your nook or ipad..but I really like it....)
I have a Pavillion DV6-6190us. As I wrote, the fit is a bit tight and requires a little force and pulling the battery release slider to the side. But once it's in, it wirks perfectly (3 months now). DV6 has two flavors. If yours is DV6-6xxx, this is the one for you. If it is DV6-1xxx,2xxx,3xxx, you should probably get a different one.
if the ipad has 3.5mm output.. then yes but it has to be USB powered.
no. has slot to install. I installed OS with USB ram drive and external DVD as needed.
You should be able to install any OS - I used Fedora, but I don't know of any reason you couldn't load Win7. I know nothing about using Win7 as a server.
These are the specifications listed with this system: General: Power source: AC 120-60 Hz Power consumption: Power on: 22 W Speaker max. input power: 50 W/channel Speaker rated input power: 25 W/channel Amplifier: Output power: RMS: Total 50 W (25 W per channel into 6 ohms at 1 kHz, 10% T.H.D. Headphones: 16 ohms (recommended 32 ohms) Input terminals: 500 mV/7 k ohms CD player Frequency response: 20 - 20,000 Hz Dynamic range: 90 dB (l kHz) I don't know if this is the info you need but I hope this helps you.
Yes but you would have to have a 110 to 220 adapter.
110v I've never heard of any company making any electronic devise 220v!!!
I'm not really sure if it will or not but it is a very universal microphone. It worked with both mine and my fianc's head units and they are both different. Good luck :)
Yea I believe what it meaning to say is that it's a mic for your Bluetooth radio but it isn't buletooth the mic is very good and I use it all the time when driving
I had same problem. My charger was a 1029YA, but I could only find -ZB or -ZS. The compatibility list for both of these does not include the TGA470B. I spent hours on the web looking, and contacting Panasonic. There is no -YA out there...only solution is to buy the entire handset, just to get the miserable cheap plastic base part that failed....nice work Panasonic, why do you fail to support all of your products with replacement parts?
It set up just like I was using a PC. I would suggest you make sure your routers work with wireless computers before you try setting them up with your Panasonic TV. It may be something like upper case lower case passwords. You do have to figure out the TV and Remote to get the routers passwords entered.
not really, I wouldn't recommend that unless if you want your TV to be connected to the internet when your Apple TV box is switched off.
No
More expensive model CT-HD100E supports HDMI v1.4.
not sure, but If you have an android phone and can access HK tvb live, then there is a good chance you will be able to access it on this device.
Thats the discount given.. item is ready to ship.. brand NEW
It is crap.......normal sound too it cannot process.
Perfect fit.
I searched and it should, but you're OFF YOUR ROCKER if you buy this. I own it. It worked fine for about 4 months, degraded over the next 4 months, and now it won't make it 20-minutes on battery. I can't say this anymore bluntly, you're a glutton for punishment if you buy this battery after reading this answer.
Meaning? Manufacture Warranty?
If the screen on the back that shows what the picture will be qualifies as a viewfinder, then, yes. By the way, my wife and I are very happy with this camera.
That is true, however the extras in the bundle are mostly junk and I never could get the second battery to charge. I would buy the camera then go to radio shack (or look at amazon) for just a second battery. You don't need 2 chargers! Camera comes with one charger.
I could only find that the BT20N is 3 grams heavier than the BT30N. Otherwise, looking at LG's website, they seem to be identical spec wise. The BT20N has been performing great for me; I have already burned several BD-25 & BD-50 discs and it's fast enough.
has neither of those
To use this keyboard on your Mac Open "System Preferences" . Cleck on the keyboard icon. When menu appears, n the lower left corner click on "Change Keyboard Type" then follow instructions. This keyboard works fine with a Mac.
Sorry but I haven't managed to make it work myself. I was just told that my ATT gateway needs to be set up so that it recognizes the IP number of the Netgear device; otherwise, it won't let it into the network. Good luck! Did you try to find instructions online?
CL60127
It fits perfectly for the 4th generation IPAD.
Sorry, but cannot answer that. Mine is 3rd gen. Dick
AC powered, adapter included, but no battery backup.
Yes. It can be reformatted if not in the correct windows format. I only two formats I know are FAT-32 (Mac and pc) and Windows NT (Mac read and PC readwrite).
Sorry.. don't know. Check the Apple discussion forums.
I cannot answer that question, I use my G Drive as a backup only for my MAC. Sorry.
The tripod mount was a great purchase. It attaches to any tripod because it uses the tripods own mounting clip. I've used it with at least 4 different tripods; I had to use the mounting clip from each of the tripods since the mounting clips aren't often interchangeable.
Yes
You could attach the band without pushing down the bar that locks It would just rest on the band
Well no because sli is nvidias product. It will work on crossfire though.
If you haven't shut off your auto gain control (most, if not all dslr video cameras have this default enabled, some are able to turn off, others not), then no.
It does come with it. It comes with both indoor and outdoor hull. The only thing I would advise for you to buy separately is a backup battery.
You would have to hear it for yourself... the extra bass is more pronounced. It's hard to verbalize the sound difference. You would have to listen to the same song with each.
My film has expiration of June 2015.
I can only assure you that this fits the Pro 13 inch... But the seller is very friendly and willing to answer questions. I would send an email to them or call their service number. I hope this helps you. Also the Kuzy is a good product and they do make a MacBook Air specific case.
Yes it will fit.. Fits mine perfect
Yes, all the opening slots that you need are there. So no different from using your computer without the case. Just prevents scratches and looks great
It has little molded tabs that clip on to the body of the laptop. Holds on very securely. I am completely satisfied with mine.
Extremely easy. Snaps on in seconds.
It does fit!
It should. There is a bunch of room
Yes
Cool mist
I don't think it is but the screen is sharp and you can adjust the brightness very easiily
Yes, it plugs in the back on the left side.
It came with widows 7, that was it.
We bought black and it looks great! Don't know about cognac brown? But a couple of things to keep in mind. Black is harder to see when left in a car. If they can't see it they wont steal it. Second Black goes with anything.
Yes it does!
I don't know of any stand available for the gumdrop.. But the case is great !!
No this will not as as far as I know the company does not make an ipad 1 cover. We have an Otterbox cover on our ipad 1
Yes. I have a case that I bought thinking the same because it is not in the title. It does fit mine just fine and snug.
If you go to Gumdrop's website, you can buy just the screen replacement without having to invest in a whole new case.
I have not bought a stand, but as for color it is army green like an olive green. Not light green
Yes you can directly from their website.
James R. Claxton, This model is not compatible with your TV. The UN75H6350 doesn't have Bluetooth, which is how the keyboard operates. However, you can use an HID-compliant wired keyboard (USB) and enable it in the TV's "Device Manager" menu. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Any normal receiver will work for these, I have them currently hooked up to a Sony reciever that outputs 85 watts per channel, they sound great but they can handle over double the power than that. To be honest, you will need something over 50 watts per channel to really drive these guys, anything over 130 watts per channel is overkill. Hope this helps.
You do get 2 speakers and they are new in the original box.
Yes
AMD Radeon HD 6490M
Nope. It's micro USB - the standard for most non-apple devices
I have no idea what a Mighty Purse is, however, this is the correct tip for a iPhone 4S, which uses a 30 pin connector. Just remember this only a charging tip and not a syncing tip.
If your laptop has a slim drive then yes it will fit.
Its only blue ray reader.. I am not sure about dual layer capacity...
I would say matte simply because it is not as shiny as an LCD TV screen.
As far as I know, it is just used as a monitor. I don't believe it even has a tuner. Lee
I believe mine is plugged into the wall outlet directly as per Netgear's instructions. :-) I know it's a "guy thing," we don't read instructions, but right there on page 3 of the Installation Guide says in bold red WARNING! Do not plug Powerline devices into a power strip.
I order 2 sets and opened only one which did not work. I even took it to a computer repair business and they could not get it to work. Bought a Netgear Universal N600 Dual Band WiFi to Ethernet Adapter WNCE3001 which is working at a distance of about 400'.
On Samsung see http://www.samsung.com/us/support/service/warranty/LT22B350ND/ZA. As for extending the warranty, that depends on where you buy it or how you buy it. Costco does for free. Best Buy, Sears, ... will do it but will charge. Some credit cards will extend the warranty free of charge if you have one of their premium charge cards
Yes it can be connected. Set up very easy.
That because the screen size is measured on the diagonal (ie from the bottom left corner to the top right corner). This site might help explain http://www.screenmath.com/ .
There is a locking screw on the bottom of the foot (the flat, oval part) which will allow you to remove the foot from the leg. Then you can easily grab the leg of the base and pull it while rocking it back and forth. It will come right out, assuming whoever assembled it used no glue. If they did, hunt them down for a refund!
Im really not sure but my thought is there is a newer model the a58 and then some others since. i do think it is an overlooked gem.
I think it's one year. Note: A57 is discontinued in favor of the A58, so make sure it's sharply discounted.
I don't know, I just registered it with the Sony website.
I use it in a warehouse in an industrial area it works just fine.
We have an HP Office Jet 8600 on this system and all wireless printing works great both with our three iPads and with windows computers.
No it does not.
I would think that verizon would take it back and offer you a replacement. Or perhaps HTC. I've had mine for about 2 years and no problems. Email customer support on the htc website and maybe attach a pic of your receipt. Maybe they will help. Must just be a dud.
For the Bluetooth devices I've connected including an iPhone, it doesn't seem to support hands free calling
Absolutely -- I use it at home in Cali all the time and the Euro plug (which is just a prong adapter) works like a charm when traveling abroad. This was a great value purchase for me and I highly recommend it.
Not sure I have a HC -V700 they work with that
If you look at the image carefully you will notice there are 6 legs. You are able to trim the ones you don't need off to make this fit your cam.
Yes. I have the iPad 4 and this case. Great combination.
there usually is -- but i have had several ipads and covers and this is far the best one i have ever had and they shipped it to me in 2 days buying one for my ipad 3
499.99 for the pair. The wattage question is tricky as the ohms are 4 to 6. In the end, I would say you need at least 125 to 150 watts per channel to drive them properly. I have heard people getting away with 100 to 115 watts, but the amp will run kind of hot. I'm still loving my pair and highly recommend them, they're also incredibly dynamic. I'm always impressed by how great both movies and classical \ jazz sound through them.
The Posrus is not a tablet. It is a cover sheet for the Wacom tablet. The tablet you get is going to cost you hundreds of dollars.
the one I got is white
It does not.
With the SwannView application, you can view live video footage from anywhere in the world via broadband internet connection on your PC, Smartphone, or tablet.,, best to read the specs of a product.

The set has two basic HDMI inputs. I don't use them for audio, but if you have an amplifier with that feature, I'm sure they would work for that purpose. The set also has one optical digital audio output (the square kind) and a standard analog stereo RCA cable audio output.
No, it does not.
Yes it does work with your model. It's a bit fiddly to connect but it does allow you to work without worrying if the power (as with batteries) suddenly runs out. I use rechargeable NiMh batteries which last considerably longer than standard batteries for the time I use the camera to pc.
Yes it does. However I would suggest looking at my review
No unless you have a life proof case in which you can get an extension for the docking space so that you do not have to remove the case.
Yes, but you may have to take it out of its case.
I gave this speaker dock as a gift so I can't speak from experience, but I don't think you would want to use the magnetic cover (if you have an iPad 2) since it would put the device to sleep.
Yes. Not as tight but irks and secures them together. Hadn't thought about it before
NO TREBLE, BUT A MEGA BASS BUTTON
Not real leather.
If it does it will be snug. I have an 18-55 and have about 1/2 inch of space within the case.
No it doesn't
No, it only takes 115 v
I have both. The biggest difference is the internet connectivity so the 473 has Pandora and app control from your phone. There is a small power difference as well.
It depends on where the song is "coming from" (i.e., what the source is). The second zone will only play audio that is coming from non-digital sources. E.g., the tuner. Any audio coming from a digital source, through an HDMI cable will not play in the second zone. Practically, this means the second zone cannot play audio coming from something like a Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, or similar devices when those devices are connected via HDMI.
If you plugged the unit into the wall, hit the power switch and the unit doesn't even light up, there is only two possible problems. You have a bad outlet or your amp needs to be returned.
This devise did not connect my blue tooth headset !!!
No! Not with this product. I think you can purchase separate screen protectors, like with iphones!
I do not think it will fit the mini. I used it for the ipad 2.
Small on / off button and cable us a standard micro plug to USB to charge from a PC or "block"
There may be a Zagg that fits the iPad one. But the one I purchased is for the 2,3 and 4th generations.
No Speakers.
It does not have an hdmi (if that is what you meant by dvi) input. It has the std 15 pin (3 staggered 5 pin rows) video/audio port only and I am pretty sure cord was included. Hope this helps.
No, unfortunately it does not fit the iBool laptop g4 12.1" model. I tried looking for a case on and off of amazon but was unable to find one. There are cases pouch cases made from fabric like this one (Apple iBook G4 12 Inch Laptop Case - Carry Handle & Adjustable Shoulder Strap - Black/Gray - Adjustable & Removable... by Synergy Digital) but none that were a case that would stay on as you use it.
Neville, The rails slide in and out so that your server will come out all the way with out having to be removed from the rails at all. Yes the rails should fit in a Valrack rack. They will fit into almost any standard server rack available.
the only wireless connection is from the speakers to the subwoofer. The only wired connection is the subwoofer that has to be wired to your tv and the speakers, which have to be wired to eash other--no wires from the speakers to the tv. There are no soundbars with this item, unless you connect the two speakers together which would turn your two speaker into one soundbar.
Yes, it runs off an AC Converter. 110 or 220 v
I am not sure what you mean by replacement. Sony has several different cases, but this one provides some protection without requiring a large bag... there is another case that is thicker but there is no quick access to the camera inside and no shoulder strap that connects to the camera itself for safety...
They are extremely light, weighing around 8 ounces.
In my experience, there is no 'Best' speaker. It depends on the qualities of your hearing, the room acoustics, the kinds of media being listened to, etc. Find a dealer that lets you try out speakers not only in the showroom, but in your home, and listen to a variety of media, CDs of various types, TVs, Blu Ray.
I don't believe you can record tv shows or have a pause and rewind of live TV with the Apple TV as it relies on you getting the shows from the Internet. So to answer your question you will need the TIVO for the DVR features.
the august dta240 antenna will bring a stronger signal than the single pole type antenna. it has a magnetic base and placing it on a metal surface strengthens the signal. i've tried several antennae for my 7" portable tv and this model is not perfect but is much better than the others. place the dta240 in sevral spots to locate the strongest signal.
The antenna does no better than the cheap antenna that came with my TV. I do not recommend.
Not sure what you mean but this card works great for me holding all my music and pictures but yet with 8gb free. Get it because it is cheap and will work great for you.
Nope, sorry J, I have not unfortunately.
I am using the S3.....and it worked fine right from the package..... I wouldn't hesitate to buy it for the S4...but dont own it.
A "bare drive" is a drive offered by a seller without cables, literature or any other materials normally provided and packaged by retail manufacturer/seller. Such "bare drives" are typically packaged appropriately for protection during shipping. My experience with "bare drives" has been as good.
All 2TB+ drives drives are manufactured in either China or Thailand. It's on the internet.
It's adjustable. I haven't measured it when it's been fully extended, but it is probably around 7.5-8 feet. I love this set! Hope that helps!
Just single antena wire....
It works great!
I don't think so. I think it's only for tablets. But I'm not 100% sure.
The power adapter works with 127v,but you may use your USB charger.. In the end the unit uses 5vdc
Yes. The power supply will only draw about 2 amps at 120 volts.
There is a rechargeable battery that comes with the headphones. It's non-standard (i.e. not AA or anything you can just buy at the drug store). You can buy an extra, search for the Sennheiser BA 370 PX Accupack Replacement Battery for PXC310 Series
I too use an XL hemet. They are snug I use them on board aircraft all the time. I have two kids so never have the opportunity to where for an entire flight. I have completed a coast to coast round trip in a day and don't remember any discomfort; but in all honesty that over a year and a half ago.
Yes, all GoPro mounts are universal among each camera
It will bed three - 2 inch binders not big enough To hold multiple books.
Sure-- I have a wire going from the left side of my laptop to the bottom intake on my flat screen tv. I watch videos from youtube and Netflix with great surround sound. You'll enjoy it. ++++ It is a WIDE plug with two screw in holders on the side of it. If you have any trouble getting that wire, Google "hooking up laptop to surround sound" and I'm sure that you'll find what you want with instructions, or go to your local Best Buy or Radio Shack. MERRY CHRISTMAS, Steve
I'm using it with a laptop (MSI) running Win 7 Pro, and no driver necessary. Just plug and play in the USB port.
The correct battery for your camcorder can be found on this page http://www.amazon.com/dp/B006P2SZ6S
No. You need the NP-FM500H REPLACEMENT BATTERY it has a groove along the mid length of the battery...it is available on Amazon.
Don't know but they work great with my 51
Yes and yes.
I got the Kingston 1333 MHz , laptop memory it also DDR 3, like the other answer here mine boots up really quick as well and have lots of services running because of this that way I added the extra memory, having couchpotato, sickbeard and recently my own usenet nbz server hosted on the qnap the extra memory is a must. If you order it with prime try to get a replacement or order the Kingston kvr1333d3s8s9/2g Good luck!
Hi, Per checked,this cable can connect to YN 622n. Any other question,pls feel free to let me know. Wish you have a nice day. Rayna CC world
I am not too sure it if will work with the light meter and the trigger. I would assume it would as it is just a sink cord. I haven't personally used this one yet because I bought a studio strobe and thought I would need one to trigger it. Fortunately the light system came with one. It looks exactly the same as the sink cord that came with the studio strobe and that sink cable works fine with my Yongnuo triggers and light. For the price it's worth taking a chance.
Yes it does. Comes with an adapter to make the 1/8 plug. 1/4 plug for the alien bees
Yes. The only thing that I would suggest is to let it hang for a while before its needed. The fabric will have wrinkles in it upon arrival. Other than that I don't think it would be a problem. I hope that this helps. Good luck
Yeah I did this before I built my frame and it worked just fine. Just make sure it is stretched tight.
Depends on the weight of the frame and the surface you are hanging it on. I used some small brackets to attach it to the wall and they hold it securely. The material isn't that heavy and if the frame isn't heavy, it doesn't take much to attach this.
Easily, you will get a screen of nearly 300" if needed.
Hello and thank you for your interest in Carl's Place! We offer rolled shipping as well as boxed shipping and this material requires tension mounting for proper installation. We would be more than happy to provide installation options for you if you give us a call at 608.352.0002.
Yes, this should work. A1082 has a DVI input and A1297 has a mini displayport output. This cable will connect the two.
Thunderbolt is Apple's replacement of Firewire I/O and the peripherals using it range for monitors to external hard drives and the like. I do not know if this adapter will work with your Surface Pro.
don't know took me for ever to get mine
I'm sorry I don't know the answer to your question. This was bought in WA state, USA
I'm not sure about the MX moniker. If you are asking if this is a laptop version of the card, I would say no. It looks like a standard GTX 680 of which I have used in the past. It is a good card.
You can measure the dimension of screen from inside the border. Actual screen size. Or You can find actual size of your screen from user manual of your devise or manufacturer's website or you can search on internet with model number and you will get the actual screen size. This perfectly fitted with my Garmin nuvi 50LM.
I don't know about Amazon Prime. I can mirror my MacBook Pro on the TV by using a cord, but for Netflix I just use an AppleTV in one of the HDMI slots and stream all day long--works great. You can also get a WiFi capable DVD player and stream to Netflix from there and also Hulu. So far as I know, you can't stream Amazon Prime to your TV unless you are connecting your computer to the TV with a cord and mirroring the screen from there....I just use my iPad if watching Amazon Prime.
Yes
I would say no...too small...
As far as I know the newer iphones 5 & 5S will not work on this unit. Sorry!!
600mAH 3.6 volts.
The crank is made of plastic. I don't have the answer to your other questions.
Yes. The GH cameras are micro 4 / 3
No problem, put it on blue slot . You need 1000w or up power supply to power on this motherboard .
This is probably a question for Asus. The mobo works just fine with the xeon e5 v2 series...2011 socket. In theory, it should work with the xeon v3 series as long as the 2011 socket configuration didn't change. But the xeon v3 is so new only Asus would know for certain.
The adapter works fine....but it will only go as fast as the 2.0 because thats as fast as the motherboard can handle
It worked well. no complains. The picture look fine on the big TV screen.
Yep hdmi is audio and video
Yes, I am using windows 8.1
you can get a PCI Express USB 3.0 card, then connect this unit onto it from the inside using the blue 3.0 connector.
I have an HP G72 17 inch screen, and it woks fine for me.I have it adjusted so I do not get sore wrists from typing.
yes it fit nice but i put velcro on the bottom of my laptop to keep it from moving in my car
Yep it fits
I am not sure. I used my battery for a PowerShot A2500. Sorry I could not be more help.
Well I thought that the part would connect a computer to the tv but the pin config is different than my computer and I have never used the part.
No. This piece of hardware converts an OPTICAL digital signal to an ANALOG voltage signal. It does not convert SD resolution to HD resolution.
It should work. Caution, best to have the audio adapter powered up only when the sound source is in use.
Yes...i have mine bi wired with two adcom 555s.
All ports are gigabit. The specs of the switch are here: http://support.wdc.com/product/install.asp?groupid=1705&lang=en
2000 mbps on a gb switch just means full duplex. It means that you can transmit 1000 mbps in each direction. I can't find any info on the actual throughput or whether or not jumbo frames are supported. Even if you enabled them on both the source and destination, you would still have to run wireshark or some similar solution to know if they were actually being sent. Since there are QoS port assignments, presumably the switch doesn't function at wirespeed though.
excelent
I believe the N600 will be fine. the range and distance does not seem to be an issue for you
There's no reason why it shouldn't.
Yep. We're an all Mac household and it works great!
Just one remote
Yes, it can.
If your net book supports Bluetooth, it should work fine
It has Office 4.0.1
Have used only on pc's. Contact Plugable, they will be happy to answer questions.
Yes, it can Best Regards,
Hi Rick, i have a d600 and Works!, take a beautifull pictures, a Little slow to make focus, but take a beautifull pictures, great luminosity, great cristal clarity, a great one to small budgage! i love it! Juan Cisternas, sorry for my english, spanish are my native language!, Im from Chile! God bless you!
I don't know if Amazon will do it, but most small computer stores (mom&pop shops) will do it for relatively cheap. If you want to go to a big box store, check out Best Buy's geek squad although they are a bit more expensive than a small shop usually.
No this is not a feature on this camera
60 Hz Full comparison is here http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/vp2770-led-s27b970d-review,3426.html
Yes.
Yes
No. Just a wall charger
Return it and buy a better brand.
Bought this for my macbook pro 15 inch and provides enough room for charger and extra stuff. Good pads for protection. Looks good too.

i I am not sure i dont think so its built in my other one was removable this isnt.. but it works great so far...
Swivels all the way around. In fact, you can turn it around and push the screen down and cover the controls, like a tablet. If you wanted to.
So...whats the question? lol Anyway, try going somewhere else and seeing if it gets a signal? Could be trees, buildings, a mountain, whatever blocking it from getting a signal. I often have trouble getting a signal at my home since there's a mountain behind my house. But if I go just 1 or 2 houses down the street I can get a signal pretty fast. Have the same issue with cell phone reception.
NO
I have this tomtom and love it! I almost never connect it to my computer and it seems to still work fine. I have only noticed slightly longer connection and route calculating times (maybe 30 seconds) by not regularly connecting it
you can switch the language
I find that it reroutes almost instantly. There's an odd time it may take a few seconds longer but mostly you hardly know you missed a turn!
Although I haven't tried comics I've read in other Questions that they work great. I think the browser does a great job; fast and efficient. I would assume the "big guns" can do more, but you'll certainly pay a lot more. For the money, this is the best choice I can think of. You should know, however, that you can't load apps on the micro-SD card, only pictures, music, etc.
This one works great, I had it for a year no problems at all
Yes it comes with 8 different docking settings it's really good I love mine and use it the whole time
It's an iPod/ iPhone docking station. I've never known one to be android compatible
Well, all I can say is I bought 3 of them and all three were frozen within the second week, they are nothing but a piece of trash. Cannot go wrong with the Samsung. Sorry.
The utility software? That can be found on the Adata web site. Shouldn't need anything else to make the drive work, as long as you have a SATA port available.
MLC
I have no idea...all my computer are PC's. If you check some of the reviews for this ssd on other Websites, perhaps you'll find some info. Good luck. Bryant
N
I don't see why not. It works inside my 5th wheel and that is just a big aluminum box :~)
The camera records audio very well, it can be mounted to any kinds of helmet. Let us know if we have not answer your question.
Has a switch on the back you have to push to turn on and off. Yes it records audio.
Yes. I have an HP D110 connected to mine.
We apologize for the inconvenience. The programming of the router was designed to work with DynDNS and TZO DNS providers.
no
Contact the seller you bought it from
no, it is not.
Your looking at a component output so if the TV will accept component input it should work..
It will, yes. However, it will most likely not be 1080p.
Perfect fit, albeit with a sliver of a border.
No, it doesn't fit..
It kind of adjusts to any width, the pole comes in pieces so you can use the poles normal widths to fit or you can take a hack saw to make the width just perfect if you choose. I'm sure the normal pole pieces will fit just fine
I haven't tried. This decal is good quality and has lasted me a year. I feel as if I were to take it off, it wouldn't be a problem.
I am not sure. I used it for a speaker that I connected to my phone for outside use.
The minimum is a 500 watt power supply
It Requires two 6-pin 12v connectors from the power supply, minimum of 500w required
Probably not, because the keyboard with backlight has a second ribbin cable to support the backlight. If there is no connection for the second cable in your computer, it will not work.
It's not. Judgin' by the laptop (ASUS N53SV), the keys in that model have beveled ends; this doesn't.
The keyboard is part of the case. The only way to remove the keyboard is to take the tablet out of the case.
Well without going virtual, it has 2 mini display ports, a DVI, and hdmi, so a total of 4? I recommend no more than 3. If you want to game on 3 monitors then this is not the gpu for you if you expect super high quality graphics. If you want 3 monitor gaming, get the gtx 670 or radeon 7990
I have a HP 2000 and it worked great
Yes
It definitly worked on mine....with all the features....mine is sharp aquos LC40LE700UN
No, I'm afraid not. There's a wrist strap and a neck strap, but that's it.
This case was made for the Canon PowerShot S100. You should look at the other cases available from Eynpire to see if there is one specifically for your model of Sony. I love mine and if you can find the right model, I think you will be very satisfied. Good luck!
I have not and it would take some time and a lot of effort to remove. Not to say it could not be done but I feel safe leaving my tv hang in the fridgid northeast year round and so far it has held up with the original tv. Hope that helps
that shield is a joke i tried it was crap waiste of money and it took less than 15 seconds to break in it and is not as water proof as they say my advise throw it away like i am cutting up for garbage
They do sell replacement shields, however it should be unnecessary if cleaned with the correct products. The front panel is made from optically clear, .25 inch LEXAN polycarbonate, the same material used in bullet proof "glass", spacecraft windshields, NASCAR type racecar windshields and many high end eye glasses. It is a very durable long lasting material that is outdoor rated. Once again, use approved cleaning materials, to avoid any type of chemical reaction and the "plastic" or LEXAN brand polycarbonate, will not detioriorate nor become hazy.
These are of good quality, they come as a pair two woofers and two tweeters. They would not be a competition set of speakers but are great to replace stock speakers
Yes. You can enable or disable the feature with the attached dip switches. Just review the instructions at installation
I'm not sure how far it swivels but I have a 60" and a 47" tv mounted on one of these and in the corner of the room and they fit perfect. Hope this helps you out.
Definitely two wall studs
Hi, it's been a while since I ordered and received this but as I recall, it did come with that European plug as well as the American one. You can insert either type to the unit. I heard they stopped selling these though. Maybe there are still some left out there.
Because it's a piece of crap. I had a similar problem. No solution.
Hi William, as any device that use DLP technology, this glasses work perfectly with your projector. DLP projectors emitts with flashes into the image projected that synchronize with The receptor in this glasses. I've purchased them and used with a Optoma HD 66. Great product, great price. Regards, Tomas.
They will work with all projectors marked with 3D DLP.
Because it is not an Oem it's not likely and could possibly cause damage as it had frozen up on my system.
Personally I believe those subs should fit. I have 2 kicker cv10s and they are about the same dimensions as those. And the mounting depth is the same also. So yes I believe they will fit. Plus the box is a great piece of equipment and sounds great
In my opinion I guesstimate 6 inches max. The range is not good because the base not support it well. I have an iPad and it tips over a lot when I move it too far off center. The center of gravity is terrible. I wouldn't waste money on this thing. Better to buy a nice one once than a few bad ones.
Definitely not, it is way too flimsy.
To the best of my knowledge, it does not. Just a USB port that powers it and allows data transfers (updates). I will carefully double check, however, next time I drive my car.
I purchased the MIO new thru Amazon and have had good luck with it
We plug it in to the router to view remotely on our phones but cameras work to view on a monitor without Internet these cameras are not wireless they come with 60 feet cords
I did a quick search and found several companies selling these on Amazon and E-Bay. Probably your best bet as opposed to going through nextbook customer support both time and price wise. Search for "NEXTBOOK10P12 charger. John
all metal
Sorry, I cannot help you as I returned the Tablet to the vendor. Thank you.
iPad- much better -does not have the issues / problems thie Polaroid had - this model of the Polaroid had major issues ( at telecast the one that I Had) including screen going totally gray after only few months of use.
no no bluetooth on this mini box
No, It uses USB mini to charge, not USB micro, which is what Samsung chargers are. Not sure what you mean by the second part, but you can only play music either through the mini 1/8"(3.5mm) jack, with a USB drive, or a micro SD card. Also it has a radio. It comes with the cables you need. That said, I don't really use this. The sound is too tinny for me. Too bad, since I like the features. The other mini speakers that open with the flexible accordion sleeves have a much fuller sound.
It does ..my experience with this product isn't a good one .product did not work on arrival.i have since thrown it away
I do not think so as it is very small and flimsy. It will just hold a small digi camera.
it's just for one. i think the prices have gone up because this card is no longer manufactured. You might want to try looking at the new amd r7 line of cards to get a better price
it depends on the case, it fits in most. all of your components are compatible
Not from what I have seen. At 100x, the distortion is beyond a focus adjustment.
No. And in case you haven't read elsewhere, the proprietary cable used to attach your computer's video signal to the projector is not included and is impossible to find. I highly advise you to look elsewhere.
it is 9.5mm standard height for 2.5 for factor. it is not 12mm
No, it needs to be in a sheltered area.
I'm not sure how the walls would affect the signal. Our transmitter is outside next to a tree; our receiver is on a window sill inside our log home and they are more than 50 feet apart. I hope this helps :) Our logs are 8 inches in diameter & the glass is triple-pane; signal makes it to the receiver just fine.
Yes it comes with a plug in cord.
the bottom of the d battery goes against the spring. If you have any more questions., ask me..
Definitely
2.4 GHz; NO.
Yes. The jack is on the back of the unit.
use the model number on your tv and compare to lights on amazon site they have reference to the product hope this helps
Regular speaker cables will fit. It will accept a banana plug, but the ones I have are too long and would prevent the speaker from hanging on the wall properly.
Yes
No. The US version is 120V only.
1.2
To a grounding point somewhere on the vehicle. IE chassis
The Progressive company site FAQs say the EMS series products are the maximum protection. They come in 50 and 30 amp. My opinion is to get the hard wired permanent unit. Your unit is not our for weather for theft. Also easier, just to plug in and not have extra stuff. My advice applies if you are going to keep your RV long enough to justify the cost.
No. Power, Coax, and Ethernet only.
NO. No USB Connection.
No, Only the second generation and third generation Core i series. Eg. core i3, core i5, core i7.(Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge) Not including the Extreme core i7 processors.
Hello....has a wheel on the side that like a volume control in off/on and dimming. Works great from very dim to very bright.
yes
Only apple products that use the original charger can be docked, unless you buy the pin converter for newer devices. You can play music from any device with an auxiliary port/headphone jack.
I do not believe so. You would have to find a way to plug in your TV into the device or vice verse. You would be better off connecting your MP3 device directly into your tv without using the iLive device. This may be done via a usb connection.
This is the complete unit from wall outlet to the laptop, 2 parts altogether, and yes it worked great.
Mine is a Toshiba Satelaite A215-S5837 and it works fine. Sorry don't know if it will work with yours or not.
The one I received is a genuine Toshiba instead of just a generic one, so it is original Toshiba in my case. I am not sure for anyone else.
11 feet, 6 inches
Yes this charger is compatible with the type of laptop.
Yes
Yes, you do plug the bot. stand into the TV and the electrical outlet. It also charges your listening devise above. Works good. Fred
No you cannot record with this phone or any other cordless phones for that matter that I know of that sort of think went out in the 80's as the laws have changed there are still ways to get your task accomplished you just have to research it on the net.
Yes, it does.... and it works great. the volume is v.good also!
Tokina USA will honor the warranty if your lens is US model and not international or imported model. You should enquire from the seller if it's a US model or not. You can check with Tokina USA with the serial number if it's US model or not.
Yes and no. At 16mm, it will work on full frame Canons, with a slight vigniette on the extreme corners. At 11-15mm, however, the entire frame is not covered. I occassionally use this lens on my 5D mark 1 and get some amazing results! It's the only "crop" lens I kept after upgrading from my t2i =)
4.4 inches
It is because the lens uses a 37mm thread, to attach to your lens use the adapter for the H-PS14042.
Sure will! This lens work with DX body Nikons, and will autofocus.
Yes, at the bottom there's a thread. The main purpose is for attaching counterweight plates which come included to compensate the buoyancy of the case while underwater, but it is also the proper size to attach a tripod mount.
I do not believe it fits the ZS30 but I did a search on Google and it came up with this "Panasonic Underwater Marine Case for Lumix DMC-ZS30/TZ40 Digital Camera" Sorry I do not know for sure but just Google it!
I don't believe this case supports the zs25 model. The Panasonic website lists the following supported models:DMC-ZS19K , DMC-ZS20K , DMC-ZS20S , DMC-ZS20R , DMC-ZS20W. The DMW-MCTZ35 model of underwater case should support your camera. The Panasonic website states that it supports the following models: DMC-ZS25S , DMC-ZS25K. Overall, I've been very pleased with the Panasonic underwater cases and the quality of the photos!
Yes, the original components are included. The non Canon batteries supplied also work well, but they lack the capacity of the Canon battery and only have about one half the battery life that the Canon battery has.
No, it doesn't.
Cambiembe el aparato por un sony
I honestly do not know but you can go to Trident Kraken's site and ask them.
Had the same problem. Could not fix it at a reasonable cost. Sold it for parts and bought a samsung tablet
No. You have to have the subscription to run the app. I tried running Hulu through the browser, but they have the mobile flash locked down. That being said, between Crackle, Youtube, and Crunchyroll, there isn't much you will miss. The flash on board did ok with some webstreams (I really only tried SyFy's to watch some Eureka). Oh, and another thing that sucks about Hulu is they kill the stream to the tablet if you plug it in using HDMI.
Not sure. Can only suggest you try it. Or purchase the olympus 7200 digital recorder it runs around $30 and is a fantastic product. Used it to record my father's memories...runs for hours and can transfer files to pc. I uploaded to dropbox Free cloud and gave family members access to recordings.
You can use a tape recorder - mini or otherwise.
Sure - it will fit all Pentax digitals. Actually, it will fit all Pentax K-mount cameras - as long as you don't mind shooting wide open for the film units.
This little speaker packs a punch. I sometimes use it while I'm taking a shower. It's loud enough to drown out the noise, but just be warned, extended and prolonged use while in the shower could possibly damage the speaker. The steam in the bathroom might get in the speaker and mess with the circuitry. Other than that, it can totally drown out the sound of the water while in the shower. (No pun intended)
It comes with a 12V car adapater and it needs to be plugged in all the time. There is no 'charger' as such because the device doesn't have a battery and cannot run under its own power. It needs to be connected to the car power supply at all times.
Yes it will work anything with a standard audio headphone jack or a micro USB. I charge mine on the computer. But it probably can be charged using a wall char get.
I'm pretty sure it cannot function as a "2-way" communication device because the 3.5mm standard earphone jack has only 2 stereo bands... left and right earbud channels for the speaker's quality. To have an input for speaking, the third black band connection is needed on earbuds with microphone speaker capability. I'm guessing your phone has a tap-switch for speaker or earphone for incoming calls while listening to music or the radio. To have your 2-way comm, the external jack buds (speakers) are disconnected. Hope this helps you.
Barely... but, yes... Holds pretty well too.
There is one extra pocket under the stripe can store the sd card and extra battery (is hard to see from the picture)
The range is decent I use it in my kayak. I don't think I would recommend it if you plan to go to far off shore without other people. You may not be able to reach back to the coast guard. That being said I could send and receive about 2 miles away over 7ft rolling waves.
88 channels
I did not purchase this camera, but I am currently replacing my older Pentax. I purchased one, and first time in the water it leaked, they sent me another one (this time refurbished),and it also leaked. After much argument, they sent me a third one, and on my last trip in September it locked up on me. I decided to go with the Panasonic Lulmix

If you already have this modem, your best bet is to just use it as a modem only and disable the routing and wifi functionality. Then you could easily pick up yourself up a nice ASUS RT-N66U and it will last many years to come.
Yes, I had to restart this modem at least a few times a week.

No, LGA1155 motherboards and processors are not compatible with LGA1156 motherboards and processors. They must both be the same chip set.
The opening is smaller than the width of the case. Papers will fit but they will have to be bent to get them in there. You wouldn't be able to put a folder in there at all
It is surprisingly roomy on the inside and has an adjustable divider that can be moved to accomadate any tablet, even a surface pro 2
The card itself will be able to handle up to 4TB drives. However, whether the card is compatible with the HP motherboard you will have to discover or ask HP tech support. There's a good chance it will work, but I know the proprietary hardware/firmware servers some times have incompatibilities with off the shelf components.
The documentation states support for Windows 7, Vista, and Server 2008. I am running the 642L with Server 2012. There are x32 and x64 versions of the drivers, but it doesn't appear that Windows Server 2003 (which reaches end-of-life on 7/15/2015) is supported.
Yes, you can configure the RAID management software to send an email in case of some kind of event. Also the controller emits a steady beep noise in case of RAID failure (I did have a drive fail on me) so if you're anywhere in the vicinity of the server, you'll know!
Sorry Ding. I don't know but it does not list your computer in the criteria, I did some internet surfing and found one that does.. its a 550 watt http://www.cputopia.com/psu-replacement-hp-pavilion-a1430n.html?utm_source=googlepepla&utm_medium=adwords&id=20206522684&utm_content=pla&gclid=CNTz2u3YwLcCFc9xQgodxSMAEg
It will not fit any other ipad except the new ipad air2.
No it does not
I do not k ow if it fits the T300 but it does allow for charging and using the tablet at the same time. It took me 3 purchases to find one that worked.
Hi Cathy E Harrison, The Sony ALCF49S front lens cap will fit if the lens diameter is 49 mm. Hope this helps. - Omar
Hi Finlay, this cap is not going to fit the lens. The lens diameter of the SELP1650 is only 40.5. We recommend using the ALC-F405S lens cap model instead. Thanks_Mitch
Hi Casie, yes, this lens cap is compatible with the lens that you have. Thanks_Mitch
Hi Rodolfo, the lens cap size would depend on the lens attached to the camera. Thanks_Mitch
I don't know. Mine has been working perfectly for a long time and they are dirt cheap to buy. I would think Amazon is the one that misinformed. Nobody gives a 3 year warranty unless you buy a new car.
Just one shoulder.
Yes
Yes. it was for my iPad Air.
No
Yes
My Air is a late 2012 model, but according to several review sites, the 2013 Air cases are identical in size to the 2012's. It should fit.
hi, when i applied it i tried to be careful when i lined it up. it was easy to remove but i haven't tried to take it off since. sorry maybe try to remove from the edges and slowly pull up.
I do not know the answer to this question.
I use a HP Chromebook 14. This mouse works flawlessly with it.
The older model Logitech 305 (which I currently have) works great with Windows 8 which is installed on my Laptop. Thinking this is a 325 is a newer model, it should work with Windows 8.
You need to download the logitech unifying software. http://support.logitech.com/product/6254 This is not described well. It took me a little while to figure it out. I have more than one mouse and a wireless keyboard and they all work with one dongle in the laptop. I believe you can have up to 8 devices paired with the dongle.
I haven't tried this for gaming but I use it for programming with an excellent response and performance! This one does not have backlight! I do have another model from Logitech that is specifically what you are looking for and I really recommend it. It's the K800.
You don't have to, but if you do, you will extend the life of the battery because all circuitry within the mouse (including the transmitter) is shut down.
Absolutely!
The measurement of the bottom of the device is 3.25 x 2". There is a grip on the sides that contours in for comfort that is 1.5' at its tallest point.
Very small.
The Mouse is not Bluetooth equipped, have to use the adapter. Sorry
Yes a sound card will take the sound processing off the CPU you games will have higher FPS and reproduce sound effects in games better, I would recommend Sound Blaster for my gaming rig I'm using the Sound Blaster Core 3D Fatality Champion not sure if the sound could be directed though the HDMI I have mine though the SPDIF on the card out to my RCA 5.1 receiver.
Yes
Yes. you must have a wired controller. I highly recommend you order a Microsoft wired controller. Some people say the AIMON works with third party wired controllers but those break a lot faster.
5 volts. this is the best charger I have ever used I have two of them
No
That is not an option offered by this camera.
color. But black and white at night w/o lights
"Memory: 2x DDR3-1600/1333/1066 DIMM Slots, Dual Channel, Unbuffered, Max Capacity up to 16GB"
Depends on what processor you are planning on running (look up the specs for how much power the processor you plan on putting in it takes). I'd say you probably need to upgrade your power supply to be honest but you might can squeak by.
Usually between 60C and 80C.
This is Fully Buffered ECC Registered memory and not Unbuffered NOn ECC memory. We do ship to UK.
Maybe this would work in your gateway, but you need to look the reference your motherboard and the RAM's pin.
Yes
This is "Fully Buffered" RAM that is used in server motherboards with Xeon processors. If your motherboard does not have Xeon processor(s) then I would it would not. "Fully Buffered" RAM have the same number of pins that other "PC2" memory, but are notched differently and will not fit into most motherboards.
If you have the GPS device connected to the camera, the date/time/zone should update automatic
Has been for me (Thunderbolt and Galaxy Nexus).
No
It might, I'm really not sure. It fits mine perfect. But it's made for Asus Transformer. I'm sure you typed in your brand and model and it came up with this case. So I guess it's a 50/50 chance it works. But I love this case. Would highly recommend if your laptop/tablet is close to the style.
Mine is real leather. If they changed it, then it was after I got mine about 8 months ago. Don't know if that helps.
I did not test it with THNSNS256GMCP but with five different mSATA SSDs and they all worked. It should work well with the Toshiba THNSNS256GMCP.
Not sure sorry :( Best to just call Cannon
I do not think so
I have never tried to tell you the truth. I have never tried to tell you the truth. Sorry. I do enjoy the quality of the sound from this unit. I feel it is everything I wanted . Sorry I was not much help with your question.
Connect the cable box straight to the tv and use an optical cable or audio cable to the recevier from the cable box
It will likely fit, but the general rule is "At minimum" 1" of air space, more is better, ventilated is best. These receivers run warm to the touch.
Spring-loaded insertion holes (except for the woofer). Wire is included but the holes will accept larger diameter if you want to use your own.
Actually those measurements are the box it comes in. The receiver is approximately 17 " wide, 5.5" tall and 11" front to back. The Subwoofer is approximately 11" wide, 12.5" front to back and 12" tall. The front and surround speakers are 7" tall, and 4.5 wide and 4.5 front to back. The center channel is 4.5" tall, 4.5" front to back and 11" wide. Remember all measurements are approximate.
I would simply not recommend buying it. It's a piece of crap and listed less than 4 months.
It is the voltage that is required to run the different options that operate the receiver.
Yes it will fit it.
It takes AAA batteries.
I am very happy with the quality of the pics both in and out of the water. Out of the water is as good as my smartphone. This was a great value for the money
No it has to have the base because it hooks into the audio out of the TV. The base has two places for ears and the base recharges the ears so there are two pairs of ears and one base in my house. They are very good if your hard of hearing or if the volume on the T.V. needs to be kept down.
Hello. It is a ring. Actually a bit bigger than a ring and it is $59.00
Yes. The device acts as a pass-through for the HDMI cable. The device plugs directly into the Wii then an HDMI cable (standard male to male) extends from the device to the monitor. Old A/V cables are not needed.
It worked for my original white Wii from 2006.
No....there is no speaker
2 x 5 W speakers. I just use mine in my garage and it does the job really well for me.
The HP Pavilion dv7 6c23cl uses DDR3 SDRAM, which is what these cards are, so you should have no trouble using this memory in your HP Pavilion dv7 6c23cl.
I don't have an iPad but my iPhone synced right up and will connect instantly when it is in range and the speaker is on.
Yes this works with an Ipod Nano... At least the newer version, which uses bluetooth 4.0. I have the newest Ipod nano touch 16gig and it works fine with it. Not sure about all the older versions which may not have bluetooth/wireless capability.
I have a Samsung 7". It's barely enough room for it and the charger. I wouldn't recommend it for you if yours is a 8".
You might ask your local jeweler if they clean pearls in an ultrasonic cleaner or if it will damage the pearl. I imagine you can but am unsure of any damage since pearls are not metal or stone/crystal like most jewelery.
Yes it supports Sata 3.
Yes
I have an asus eee pad. It works fine. No complaints.
If you go to the Cooler Master web site online they have an accessories section for the Cooler Master HAF XM where you can purchase it.
Yes it works perfectly for document processing
You should just be able to get your fingernail under an edge and then just peel it off. Not hard.
Try 0000 - I think that is what I used.
Yes
Hi. No there isn't a volume control on the speakers. It relys on your device. Yes it will work with windows phone with same micro port. ... But it does have an auxiliary port also.... So anything can connect easily.
Yes it has the exact same mounting slots as the camera itself. I've used head strap, and the flat adhesive mount on a helmet.
I don't think so. These are hardwired back to your home stereo/av equipment
Yes. It comes with a neck strap that has a quick release at the end so that the Loupe can be quickly handed to someone else to use and then easily snapped back on the strap.
It did fix the problem. I had no picture at all. And it was fairly simple to replace.
Dear Katie, I would be almost certain the answer is Yes. I have a Canon 5D MKII which fits nicely. I would be very surprised if the T3i is even as big as the 5D. By the way, in most positions within the cage, you actually can get to the battery. I have found this cage to be very helpful, and, with other arms, etc., added, to work well as a the basis of a full rig. Hope this works out well for you.
Yes..
Not sure...I bought it and had to return it, I had a 2007 sequoia and it would take major dash modification to make it work. For the tundra though it may work.
no
Yes. we do ship to Canada. When you check out and you will see the shipping cost. Please be noted that the shipping doesn't include potential landed charge like Custom inspection or other fee.
No, needs to be an Intel 1155 socket processor.
As long as you've got an audio output on the TV, this will work. It will definitely improve the sound. The TV we have has terrible audio, but this helped a bunch!!
No
You can use this device with serial port on your laptop. In this configuration, you would either connect to another identical unit connected to another serial port, or to any other laptop or computer with Bluetooth capability. Think of it as a Bluetooth wireless serial bridge. You either remote connect to a serial device or you use two of them to create a wireless serial bridge.
Draws external power. One of these models has a micro usb port to power it. I usually just plug it into the cisco device im using it on. It also comes with a pair of wire leads that you could use to fabricate a battery pack. Another option would be to use a usb powered cell phone charger battery pack. I love mine.
No it won't. A new wireless mouse has to talk to the USB device that it comes with. If you are trying to hook an old wired mouse to a new computer without a serial port you would have to try a USB to serial adapter.
Generally, any full tower case is going to do you right, but certain mid towers would do it as well. Just check to see if the case you are buying can support the graphics card(s) that you are buying (space wise.)
Nope, just speaker wire outputs.
No
This is a fine TV! Yes, it does have high definition connectivity.
I did it for a satellite S855-S5254. Yes, it added bluetooth which I have not used. It was very easy to change. The only problem I had was getting the cover off. I ended up watching u-tube videos to do it.
Most probably this will work in this acer. The only considerations are that it is a half-size card and if the Atheros is full length then you'll need a adapter to put the 6235 in the slot. Also, Bluetooth will probably only work under Windows from a cold boot rather than a restart.
Yes
Never feed it after midnight!
I've connected my laptop to the TV via HDMI and achieved 1080P. What is the maximum resolution on your laptop? Check your graphics settings. Are you duplicating, extending or using only the TV as the monitor? These settings will determine what resolution you can achieve via HDMI.
Yes
No this just PhotoShop CS6. The creative suite is a lot more $$$. I own PS-CS6, AI CS6 and Dreamweaver CS6.
It is a stand alone product, and yes it comes with disks in a nicely packaged box.
This is an internal drive as it includes no housing, your laptop must connect via SATA which is the interface that would allow these two to communicate.
Yes it does.
It depends on the gpu used. I have Xfire 7970 and I managed to only use the lowest two ports. Short answer u can mcguiver and use all ports with the right sata cables. Hope this helps.
Yes, Back Panel Connectors: 2 x USB 3.0/2.0 ports Internal I/O Connectors: 1 x USB 3.0/2.0 header USB: Up to 4 USB 3.0/2.0 ports
I'm gonna say no because that Dell tablet is almost 11" long and wouldn't allow the case to be zipped.
I am very pleased with this purchase. It has great sound quality and is easy to learn to use. For me, that is always important. As an "Old Lady", ease of operation is vital. I really like that it is compact yet, the screen is easy to see. I am also very happy with all of the features. I can load pictures, access a radio, and take videos with just one device.
Yes it works great i also put a shoulder strap on mine
It should it's smaller than 10 inches
I couldn't say for sure, but ours are Phillips brand and it's a pretty basic plug size.
I don't know-mine turns off!
Upgraded as far as I could ... to Snow Leopard. Mac OSX 10.6
I used Acronis to create an image file to an external drive. then, restore the image back to SSD. if you encounter any issues better to reinstall the OS than figuring out to fix the problem.
The only way I use it is my phone, you have to turn on your bluetooth, sorry I couldn't answer your question!
The speaker works with all Bluetooth-enabled devices and the ipod touch 4th generation is bluetooth enabled, so yes, they should work together.
No there is only an aux in, and a micro usb port for charging.
As long as the computer is Bluetooth enabled and the two have been successfully connected, the Jam Classic speaker will play any audio from the computer (including system sounds).
It works with my Dvp-fx930/l But not too sure about the other models its stated its compatible with. Sony Portable DVD Player Dvp-fx810/p Dvp-fx810/r Dvp-fx811k Dvp-fx820/l Dvp-fx820/p Dvp-fx820/r Dvp-fx820/w Dvp-fx921 Dvp-fx921k Dvp-fx930/l Dvp-fx930/p Dvp-fx930/r Dvp-fx930/w Dvp-fx94/b Dvp-fx955 Dvp-fx96/s Dvp-fx970 Dvp-fx975 ; DVP Fx710 Fx830 Fx850 Fx910 Fx920 Dvp-fx750 Dvpfx750/l Dvp-fx750/l Dvp-fx750/p Dvp-fx750/r Dvp-fx750/w Dvp-fx810/l Dvp-fx810/p Dvp-fx810/r Dvp-fx811k, They do have a good return policy, Up to you on what you want to do i am pleased with mine and have no issues.
This detachable lens has a motorized zoom from 14-42 using an intuitive button on the lens itself. Highly recommend this camera.
It's simply a mono RCA cable, meaning, a single RCA cable rather then a stereo one. If you have only a spare stereo RCA cable laying around you can just hook one end of it up to the receiver. However, on the subwoofer side you may need a Y jack to turn it into a stereo signal.
http://www.avsforum.com/t/1409431/the-official-denon-avr-xx13-model-owners-thread-faq/3390#post_22646765
No, the USB is just to connect a music player which has its own user interface. If u connect the hard drive, there is no operating system to access that drive
Yes, that's what I use! (And works with my t2i as well!)
I-CPU fan header, 3 system fan headers
It cannot be hung on the wall and is only meant for table top display. However I am very satisfied with the quality and it is much better for the price I paid for the Nix digital frame. If you do not have a strong reservation with it's feasibility to be hung on the wall, I'd recommend this product. Good luck!

Not entirely sure.
Yes. Blister pack.
If the device is turned on, the activity light oscillates on & off. If the device is turned off, the activity light is off.
Yes there are lines and yes they are in color. Red for super close, yellow for medium and green for far.
Not as good and doesnt have an adjustment for lights behind you
Im not sure what a home link connection is? But it doesn't connect to any WiFi or Bluetooth connections. It is hard wired directly to the reverse and backup lights
divide 6000.hrs by 24.hrs equal 250 days / so unless you run unit for 24.hrs for 250 days/ lamp should last at least a year .(good bet ! )
Product is warranted 150 days for any manufacturer's defect....... I don't think 1 year warranty is applicable here..
I don't know. I have thrown away my instructions, but the housings look exactly the same. I can't imagine there is much difference in the lamps. Just the size of the projection mirrors. Once you remove the back panel, there are only two screws holding the unit in place. A quick and easy replacement
Yes
You don't have to use them
The quiet edition draws 0.08A which at 12 volts is 0.96W. The high performance edition draws 0.18A which at 12 volts is 2.16W. Amps x Volts = Watts
Yes. It's basically two complete fan boxes that have been pre-attached.
Ubiquiti offers free NVR software that you can download and use on either Windows or Linux.
At http://ubnt.com, they don't come out and say anything about RTSP or Onvif in the data sheet: http://dl.ubnt.com/datasheets/airvision/airVision_ds.pdf I am using Blue Iris with my Aircams.
Unless they changed the app recently (haven't used it in a while) the only thing it really works with are mp3's you put on your media server and streamed audio stations.
Either one. I have 3 on my network to different areas of the house. You could use a splitter to run the audio to 2 stereos but you wouldn't have the option of playing different songs.
No. The PR1 is a receiver that works with your wifi router for lossless audio or Bluetooth if wifi not available. It then has to plug in to a stereo or receiver that is connected to speakers. I have two in my house and can play to two different stereo systems simultaneously. Phorus also makes speakers that have a built in amp.
To use the receiver you need a playback device of some kind - it has no speakers. They do have a unit with speakers, but at a higher price ... http://www.amazon.com/Phorus-PS1-Multi-Room-Wireless-Streaming/dp/B007RFLJ92/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1417902471&sr=8-1&keywords=phorus But based on my personal experience, I would recommend spending more and looking at the Sonos system(s)
Yes. It has a working USB port that supports most USB functioning items including external hard drives.
Save your money its not worth it
Mine says 5034 mAh! My charge cycle is only 2. Why???
Yes
if there is a pci-e slot and it fits then i don't see why not. depending on how your system was set on default you may have to enable a bios setting so your system can run this card as it is considered a certain kind of new software. i think its calle trinity or something but i dont remember. either way your computer wont be able to boot up unless this setting is enabled in the bios.
Yes it does.....I am using work laptop with Windows 8 and it works fine....haven't used any gps feature though, just the maps itself.
Yes. It has standard VESA mounting holes.
The first segment (bottom) is NOT 10' long', it is only 99.75 inches (8' - 3.75"). All other tube lengths are also in the 8' to under 9' range. The first segment (bottom) is 2.300" OD (outer diameter); 2.220" ID (inner diameter)... with the wall thickness of the galvanized tube at 0.040" thick, it is 19 GA (gauge). Since the tubes are not critically manufactured (high tolerances), you will commonly find small variances to the above measurement I took.
I think it should
Yes it will. It seems most early 2011 Mac book pros have SATA III chips which means you will be able to get the 550 MB\s but if you have a SATA II chip you won't get more then 300 MB\s
H87-I PLUS
Both the onboard network adapters support Gigabit 1Gbps connections.
Yes, I have one hooked up to my zmodo DVR and it works perfectly
Yes I have reported it to amazon it is supposed to say 3000
it does.
I have both and the S3 iOS much better. Touch screen and easier to navigate through.
Sorry
It does not have a "right angle" plug. It sticks straight out from the wall and needs about 3 inches clearance. You can, however, change this to about 1 1/2" by fitting a compact "cube tap" on the plug.
Hi this motherboard dosn't supports SLI but AMD crossfire is supported
See the link about halfway down the product page (http://www.esaitech.com/asus-p8h77-v-le-intel-h77-chipset-lga-1155-32gb-ddr3-2200mhz-atx-motherboard.html?gclid=CPXxp9bKs7sCFSvl7AodSH4Aqw).
Yes this projector works great with my iPad. You will need apple iPad to HDMI adapter sold at all apple stores. You will also need a standard HDMI cable.
Yes, works w Roku 3. Don't know about Roku stick
No there is not but it stores energy really well so you should be ok.
This is for a full size iPad. My iPad is not an Air, it is a few year old. The iPad snaps into place and then it folds over onto the keyboard.
I don't know. Have only used them with a Vizio smart TV. They sure work well w/it.
If you're asking if this camera has a rechargeable battery, yes it does.
There is an A/V jack on the side of the monitor, and an A/V cable is included so you can view with a computer monitor or TV.
Yes
4 ft or shorter.
I am not sure what they sell at Cabelas but this unit is complete with all of the parts, pieces and manuals. It has the transducers included as well and the built in insight mapping. This is a great deal on this unit, Lowrance is going to touch screen exclusively on these units so if you want one that you don't have to dirty up the screen on, get it while you still can.
I actually returned this and got the hds 9 touch that has lss2 builtin. But you do have sonar and structure scan with this. As far as down and side imaging goes I have yet to make heads or tails out of what that picture says to me
It will be fine but you can't do SLI for Nvidia if you want to go that route just single card. Great board btw.
It looks to me like mine is a true Dell charger. It works perfectly, that's for sure.
40 feet
It kind of depends on you for how wet the process will be... I usually make my screens pretty wet when I apply... However I don't think it's necessary to go overboard. My opinion is that you will be fine. Maybe even just spray the protector and not the screen. The wet just allows easy adjustment of the protector. You squeegee all the wet out once your happy with the placement. I'm not sure this will stop the crack from spreading though...
Mine did, but I ordered a year or so ago.
Yes it is. Love it!
Yes. I already tried it with the D800.
ok!! but not what i expected i was shipped a old lens that does not perform well
Yes it can since they only 2500 watts I have a solo x 18 and that's 10000 watts 5 ems and it pushes it no problem
Yes very powerful amp
THE CORD IS 23 INCHES LONG.
Yes it is..
Yes, in fact it does! Even an old one. We have that mouse connected to an old G3 and it works perfectly. No problems at all.
I believe that the unit is not designed to actually power a headphone that is directly plugged into it. It is just a converter that has no amplifier. I used it to convert the optical signal output from my Samsung TV. I plugged a wireless headphone unit into it. The wireless headphone has a built in amplifier and it works very well. Hope this helps.
NO....Not to where you can place on the doc...but you can use the cord they provide and play through the earphones if you put into auxillary mode. I have the old Ipad that docs but the new Iphone5 which doesnt. So it works great for both. It also serves as surround sound in my house and its easy to carry outside for cook outs and card playing.
There isn't a place for a microphone, but you could probably plug it in through a sound system such as the wireless microphone box and then use the tower as a speaker.
The dimensions are listed correctly as 10.5 x 4 x 7.5 inches. Not sure where anyone got 5.3" wide. However, the soft sides and velcro at the top make it totally work, as long as it's in another bag. There will be a gap between the velcro sides, of course. I carry my 7D sideways (5.5") with a lens attached inside a tote bag that is 6" wide. It works fine, and leaves room on both sides for lenses and hot shoe.
Don't know
Yes, it works
Yes
I have no idea. I would ask the vendor for this product. Sorry I can't help you out
I have a Satellite A665 and it fit just like the oem and works great
If your battery is a PA3817U-1BRS, then it should work. Keep in mind the batter is twice the height of an OEM, but it will slid into place. It will make your laptop become higher in the back. My Laptop wasn't listed completely either, but I was told what I've just told you about battery Model Number comparison.
I have mine connected to an amplifier. I'm assuming that, with the right cable, you should be able to hook it up to speakers. The unit has a volume control on it. The unit comes with ear buds for private listening. Hope this helps.
It should, I am running mine as a ground telemetry monitor for a drone FPV unit it is working fine a 11.1 LiPo battery I hope that helps, any 12v power source should run it
It could work as a display for a raspberry pi on it's RCA video plug the monitor runs on 12 to 14 volts.
No, It's entirely manual... but that's what you would want anyway for Macro which is it's primary use.
yes, this works very well in my mac mini 2011. I haven't had any problem with this.
This cable converts an HDMI output to a VGA output. That is, it does not add a new video output it merely changes the connector on an existing output. that being said if your are able to plug in an HDMI monitor or HDTV and extend your laptop video (most laptops WILL do this) then this cable will allow you to use a VGA monitor to extend your laptop display. To be sure search for your laptop make and model using Google and add "dual display" to the search string. Something will come up if this is possible.
Their website says it fits SLKs. http://hqrp.com/hqrp-media-interface-usb-cable-adapter-flash-drive-for-mercedes-benz-c-cls-slk-e-sl-glk-class.html
worked in my 2010 E350 4matic. One end is a female usb connector the other fits the connector in the glove box. Can't say if the iPhone 6 will work, but both my galaxy s3 and nexus 5 worked without issue, as did a standard usb flash drive, so I don't see why not.
Yes there is a volume control. You can use that as well as your ipod to control the volume. When you reach the highest volume on it, it well give you a double beep. I usually crank it to the highest level and then use my ipod to control the volume. It really is a neat little item, - I don't think you would be disappointed. I use mine in the bathroom alot while showering and can hear it well enough with the glass shower door closed.
I am not sure what you are trying to say. Speakers don't have any watts in them. They can accept a certain power input, measured in watts, before distorting. These are rated to accept 35W (thirty five watts) continuous, and up to 105W peak power. Visit www.InfinitySpeakers.com for details.
No, just a mini USB port where the charging cord plus in.
No, the mention of bluetooth is an error. This is a standard, corded stereo headphone. No batteries, no bluetooth, no mic, just a detachable stereo cable.
I purchased one from an eBay seller that had been updated to ICS. It works fine (though not AT&T) and I like it better than my old P with Honeycomb. The eBay seller, who is an IT guy, said it was that hardest device he ever rooted and upgraded and he would never do it again.
With the latest firmware it's basically identical but built better (as the Q10 is mostly plastic).
Do not have enough information to tell you if it will or not Go to this URL http://www.crutchfield.com/S-5i3gOuKZsSt/app/car/carselector.aspx Pick your make, model, size, car radio (Factory), and other things that they need. You can then see all the Stereos that fit in your car. I Believe Amazon has this feature but I don't know the URL or how to access it.
What are the symptoms? I haven't had issues.
No It did not
P5110 comes without 3G P5100 comes 3G slot
Yes to both
Yes, mine is a D1 card no issue here.
Yes
So this is more of a corporate unmanaged switch than the one you've listed. The status lights are on the front by the Ethernet cables and the power is on the rear. The layout is exactly the same as this, though without the PoE functionality. http://www.amazon.com/Cisco-SYSTEMS-8-Port-Gigabit-SG100D-08P-NA/dp/B007UQROJC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1400542738&sr=8-2&keywords=cisco+sg100-8. If you're looking for a reliable unmanaged switch, this is a good option. It's been very stable for me so far.
Yes. We bought this for the office and have found this to be a great device. All 8 ports are gigabit.
Yes
We have a nook HD, kindle fire HD's and I pads. They all work as well as our I pods, and our Bluetooth insignia MP3 player. Can't say for sure about a full android e tablet as we don't have one. But all our phones do.
The dock is rechargeable when you connect with the USB cable/cord. The tablet or phone would have to be charged with whatever separate USB or electric cable/cord came with the tablet. Since the dock is bluetooth, it should make no difference if you want to charge either the tablet or the docking station. However, the dock does not charge the tablet. It is merely a dock that you can set your tablet in if you would like or you can leave it off the dock and still use it.
Yes the GoPro 2 fits perfectly in this housing.
Yes. It comes exactly as pictured & is all as one piece. :)
Yes, the 8D would get you there.
As long as you have threads on the front of your lens, it should work. If there aren't any, you are stuck unless you just hold it up against the front of the lens. All filters have threading from what I've seen over many years for 35mm or digital. Box cameras and others have a different mounting system and some use gel filters w/holders.
I have never experienced any lens flare from the filter itself. If the sun is striking the filter, you will probably get flare though.
They should work with any phone as long as it has an audio jack port on it. It does not work with blue tooth, it needs to be plugged in.
What are you looking to upgrade to? Another i5? If so I don't think you will gain any noticable performance. Why are you upgrading? You may only need a memory upgrade.
Updated: These are not compatible as the cpu has different pins than the mb socket. Yes, it is listed as being compatible with the Core i7 / i5 / i3 processors.
If your motherboard supported an Intel i3 processor, it should support other Intel CPUs as well. You should go to the maker (ASUS, MSI, etc.) of your motherboard's web site and check the support section for your particular motherboard. It should provide information on the CPUs it will support in addition to other support features.
Hi Edgardo. The i7 3770K is a desktop processor that uses the LGA 1155 socket. As such, it will not fit in your laptop, but you could look for a hotter processor that will fit the socket P that is in your laptop. My research says the fastest processor you could be is the Core2Duo Mobile P9700.
You won't find a laptop with this processor. They make special i7 processors for laptops. You will want a laptop with one of these processors from the previous generation (3rd) http://ark.intel.com/products/family/65506/3rd-Generation-Intel-Core-i7-Processors#@Mobile or one of these from the present generation. (4th) http://ark.intel.com/products/family/75023/4th-Generation-Intel-Core-i7-Processors#@Mobile Best luck
Yes it does, and is actually compatible with netflix
Yes it does i use mine for that sometimes.I have 2
If your asus has Bluetooth, it should be compatible, it hooks up immediatly and is the best keyboard I purchased for iPad. I hooked up two different tablets with no issues. I had no issues with The Samsung galaxy, and other people seems to have had issues. Good luck.
yes, i believe so. any item with that size output jack.
Probably not, unless it says (usually on the face plate of the deck) "Sirius/XM ". As I have stated before,make sure the model you buy is compatable with the programming you want.
Yes. We used it in our church three times a weak on a not very friendly user lighted area and it works tremendously. Best we ever owned
No. There's a 3.5 mm port that could be used for line in (audio input only) from some device. I suppose you could possibly power the output from an audio output device through the Weather X built in speaker. You would need a cable from the output device to the Weather X which isn't included of course. Also the Weather X can be powered and recharged (internal battery only) with a 12V AC adapter which isn't included.
Has a small plug small round plug
No, I had to buy it separate.
You would have to contact whatever specific seller is listing a used unit, to verify it's condition and included accessories.
only if your GLK is pre-wired for becker. you can look on your window stciker and see if its pre wired. and also look inside the glove box, there should be a cradle for this unit.
I am not sure ...if you mean what becker offer for warranty, i have no idea....the gentleman you sold me the item was ready to exchange it . I am sure you can find you answer online Sorry
It is a hard case that snaps onto the computer. You definitely couldn't bend it in half or it would break. I hope that helps!
More of a hot pink! It's darker than the picture a little.
This case will only fit the Air. This won't fit the Pro.
Should be there within 3-5 days.
same issue here! spend few dollars more and buy one from walmart
No
Yes...
I just received the case, no mouse pad.
Hi~ This has been perfect for me. I don't know what you mean by "clips" because the case is smooth and fits snugly. I have a MacBook 13" Air. I hope this is helpful for you.
i bought for my niece on may 15, it was the thin pro air, i asumed it was the latest model. it fits perfect. my niece liked very much,lizzette. i dont know the model but the price was $1300 more or less in pueto rico
Work with I phone
Yes it does come with a sunshade.
The caveat to the following is that I just got the Marshall and haven't used it yet. I'm not familiar with the hf g10 but the monitor should work with any camera that has either HDMI, mini HDMI or plain old RCA video outputs. RCA connection will not give the same quality image, of course.
You need to ask the seller or ask Amazon. This link is to ask other customers, and we wouldn't know...
Yes you will be able to see it.
Use a old credit card and start at the edge that is the most loose. Never use metal and put the effort on the case not the computer.
Yes, the "source" button allows you to select among the TV's inputs, from my experience.
yes...
Go PDR. Just installed it. Amazing sound.
Total RMS is somewhere around 60, but the speakers are easily driven in the system and therefore make this a good sound system. Just don't expect to much out of them and you will be satisfied.
Yes, they are not IEEE Compliant.
Very well compared to similar priced items, scalable and vlan friendly. New version has the same tech specs with newer firmware.
It doesn't.
I own this tv and no, you cannot surf the web, not like a computer or tablet. There is a yahoo app but it is sooooo slow it would drive you crazy to use it for any real surfing. I use it for tv viewing, Pandora, amazon prime video. It also accesses Netflix well but I dropped that. very slow starting up.
No, just the regular single-sided Vizio Remote
It's possible, just search online. eBay might have it
can you email me the instruction manual
yes, it is wall mountable.
Yes, you can cut it at certain places along the strip. However, you might prefer to "wrap" it around the back of your TV so that you can still use the full length if you decide to buy a larger one later. Try it out and see if you like the look before you cut it. The product flyer on this page says you can: http://www.antec.com/soundscience/hdtv-bias-lighting.php
I am using this ram with this processor, and no problems. I am getting ready to buy 16 GB more to bring my new system up to 32 GB. I am using on a Gigabyte Z87X-UD5H mobo.
Yes
how much does it wt.
sure...on a shelf !!
how much does it wt.
The stand I bought was a Pinnacle But they are for sets fro 82 to 92 ....
They are super! I've installed 12 system in the past year. My customers love it. You want go wrong.
Hello Larry: To answer your question: I think it does, but I could not say for sure unless I turned the unit on. I can tell you, this 7" model comes with a long window bracket, which works great in trucks with large and deep dash: vans and semi trucks, not good choice for a car or pickup truck. If you are looking for a 7" screen, look at the 1700-LM, has a great bracket for use in the car and pickup trucks. If you have anymore question, I am just a click away. Tom
I think it works great , sound is good , I ware hearing aids and have no problem with road noise , people say they hear me fine.
It does not have a back. Just a top and the two tapered sides.
inner dimension (H/D/W) : 120mm*105mm*176mm
I don't have the M4 1S, but I would imagine that these are heavier than most headphones. They are absolutely amazing to listen to, but can only be worn for about 60-90 minutes at a time.
Hi You have to check the compatibility of your motherboard.
Hi AJ, I'm Jewel with Kingston Technical Support, here to address your question. I found that the HP Pavilion Slimline s3421p supports DDR2 800MHz memory up to 4GB with two 2GB memory modules. The HyperX Blu memory is DDR3 1600MHz and is not compatible with that system. The compatible part number is KTH-XW4400C6/2G. For any further assistance, please call us at 1-800-435-0640 (USA and Canada only) M - F 6am - 6pm PT and I or another available Technician will assist you. Thank you for selecting Kingston.
Yes, i go to 1600mhz without change in voltage with the same timings.
You can store any files, including media and will stream to your computer over USB. This unit works like any other USB drive.
3.5mmthey are
SL5- Depends on your location (usa) Locals may be carried on the 110 or the 119 Also Some sports packages are on the 119 - 110 is spanish lang. Some of Music channels are on 119 as well.
No switch it is in the sl3
Yes but the straps are short. They don't quite get around me wearing my gear
This holster is for the Boafang radio which is much thinner than the CP200. I also have the CP200 and it doesn't fit this holster. Holsters are available for the CP200 and are not very expensive.
I would suggest carefully reading the details, and/or searching with the name of your device.
I'm sorry but I don't know i just matched it up to the name of the samsung galaxy tab 2 or 3 I got my grandma for xmas the same that's in the pic. and it fit and works great she can't tell its on there.
Thank you for your inquiry. The lifetime warranty is for any random occurrences that may damage the protector.
Yes and no it will keep the crack from getting debris and other gunk in it and will temporarily hold it together but just like windshields the crack will spread slowly but surely.
Yes. The Military Sheild offers unbelievable resistance to scratches etc.It has self-healing technoloy, which helps eliminate minor scratches on the film all by itself. It requires no special care or maintenance. If you need to contact the seller they will answer ANY questions or concerns you may have. Therefore you will be getting the answer straight from the people that carry it and know their stuff. Hope this was helpful. So if you want to use the pen you do not have to fear scratches. I use a soft touch stylus.
yes it has a 3" semi adjustable belt loop. I would say Yes to a 2" tac belt. It would be snug at 3" belt but would fit . I have a 2" leather tool belt and it fits no prob.
Yes it is....and then some. You will be able to run to charger from the cigarette lighter to up one of the sides by a door and back upto the center of the windshield tuning along the top. That is how I have mine. It is hard to see my Cord unless you look for it.
No
Yes. I believe this would fit in a Vostro 1400. I'm not sure you need the "low profile" version, though. That's hard to tell by the specifications I've found on the internet. Your best bet would be to pull the existing hard drive from your Vostro, look up the model number and it's specifications, and compare the sizes between it and this one.
It comes with a tripod, the device, aluminum camera\telescope mounting hardwre, and a handheld controller. Made in USA. WARNING After I got mine I found out it is discontinued and not supported any more. Software and firmware updates are hard to find, look at forums for current info before buying this. If the box looks used, do not accept it, I think I got a refurbed one for full price.
No problem with either. It comes with roxio but you can use other tools if you like.
Yes and full access to Dell Webcam Central. Very nice setup.
It is quite discreet. I can't say for certain, but it should be hidden on a 32"
I've carried a hardcover book in it before, I think you will be fine.
No, it very snuggly fits my Samsung Chromebook 11.6.
very slow, a waste of money
It fit on mine, but it did block a memory slot. You can remove that fan though, and then no problem. I also had to do a small amount of grinding on the bracket that connects to the motherboard to clear heat sinks on the board. It's an Asus ROG board for the AMD chip, crosshair v formula z.
No for sure on that. I'm a network systems guy and I don't believe you will be able to do that with a hop spot if the unit does not "act as" a router. You will need to enable port forwarding to get the DVR to work.
Just comes with 4 cameras and 4 cables. They 600 TVL. No DVR included. Hard Drive space depends on how many cameras, what resolution it records, compression, and how many days you want to store, before they get written over. You can also use a motion detect feature, to reduce drive usage.
Well, the guy that installed our system said he could hook it up to any computer, phone or tablet. We're able to view from our phones, computers and ipads. I would assume it could be hooked up to a Macbook Pro as well, but not 100% sure. He really just needed the IP Address of where the system is located (from your home computer) and used an app for home camera's.
It does work, indeed, it says 100-240 Voltes. Hope this helps and u can enjoy.
I got it for my Tab 2 10.1 and it worked, not sure if Tab2 and 3 are identical.
no SW. FM only.
Nope. Probably why they're so cheap.
Yes it does. I don't have mine with me but I believe there are at least 3 different sizes included.
My receiver isn't chargeable, so I do not know. The station plugs in or uses regular batteries.
No, you have to select a color. I had to order without choosing a color and then they asked what color I wanted. I coud not find a place on original order to choose a color.
Mary, I bought my Le Pan 1 from my niece. I do not know what the trio stealth is. I am recovering from surgery at my mother but I think the case is apx 9x7 with a diameter of apx 11 in.
Yes
Yes. it is. Any HDTV. Excellent digital sound (Optical port). When compared to other sound bars, this is far best iam sure.
Yes. As you turn the volume up or down it will show on the LG display in green numbers.
Using the remote guide button the smart tv only displays the show that is on and not what is going to be on. I have to go on-line to find out what shows are going to be aired. I called vizio and was told that feature was not nolonger available. I suspect vizio expects everyone to be viewing tv via cable or satellite. I am old school and get my tv over the air for free.
I purchased it for my red Nikon Coolpix L820. It does fit and it has a pocket on the other side (not so large) that you can use for batteries, cable and other slim items. I like the bright color of the case - easier to spot when bringing back and forth to office, vehicles, home, etc. I would buy it again.
Hello, I would think it would be large enough. It is a nice case but I purchased it as a Christmas gift so unfortunately all wrapped up so I cannot look more closely at it, but do believe you will be fine.
So long as it's plugged in to charge, the red light will be on. I'd just give it a go. Mine's awesome.
No...
No not without the adapter
Yes, when i record games, i actually use the "capturing" window as my display... it has ZERO delay
Yes. The HDMI pass through will allow you to view the output of your PS3, but to record or stream, you'll need some way to strip the HDCP.
I got this cover for my glow light nook with a black frame. My nook measures 5 inches wide x. 6 inches high. And fits perfectly and it protects it just fine I love it
5 3\8 x 6 3\4 in wxl the nook fits perfectly
Yes. Mine is without glow light and it fits perfectly.
i don't know anything about games. works well on dvd's. should work well on all things. it is inexpensive so you really have nothing to lose.
I bought this for the same exact reason and it didn't work, I had an hdtv worth component out and this didn't work. Someone told me that I would need a powered one, dunno, sold my old tv and bought a new flat screen..problem solved. lol
What do you mean un-blocked ? its programmable within the supplied frequencies
Pretty much all cable can go in the drain. That is 15m/50ft. You probably want to connect it to your laptop so that will take 3-4 feet, everything else is good to go inside the drain. Be careful with the camera connection, it is very fragile. Mine stopped working pretty much immediately even if I used it tied to a regular drain snake to give it some support.
can't say for sure have not used it that far out yet. camera for me works ok so far but I can not say for sure if the integrity of the cable under water is good. I hope it is just a defective cable you have. that's all I can tell you right now.
Yes, just use photo booth. You won't need any additional software
My waterproof rating is -10 as whenever it touched water the picture went to snow.
Not sure but same maker so you would think they make it the same.
this is just the Tripod LEGS. it's pretty confusing. I made that mistake. if you want the whole set up, legs, head, ball and bag go here. http://www.amazon.com/Manfrotto-MVK502AM-Video-Telescoping-Carry/dp/B006LWHLSA/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1357845109&sr=8-4&keywords=manfrotto+tripod+502
No. Best to move everything you need to a third drive and install your new drive clean. Then move anything you need back. Anything that has to do with the operating system would have to be reinstalled on the new drive. Ie programs, the operating system itself, etc. you can use program specific saved files once the program is reinstalled.
If its built in to the radio, you would use it via touchscreen....
Yes....
It depends on what default files are stored on the drives from the manufacturer. You'll often find instructions, welcome files, and other stuff on the drive. Feel free to delete everything that you don't need on there.
Website's not for Filco, but the principles are the same. http://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/mechanical-keyboard-guide/#keyswitches
No ,stay clear unresponsive ,slow ,heavy and cheaply made.bought for my son last Xmas but after 1 day purchased the galaxy tab instead ,far happier .bought my other son the girl this year as it's got good reviews but keep away from the kocaso ,pile of rubbish
Yes, it fits an IPad 2 or an IPad 3
I used it for 2009 Outlander. Works fine. Not sure about any other model.
No
I believe so since I'm pretty sure that 1st, 2nd and 3rd are very much the same. But, be aware of one thing -- the flap does not have anything on it with which to keep the case closed. I finally had to put a piece of Velcro on each side in order to close the case completely.
I had this unit installed in my 2012 Silverado LTZ I have the back up camera so I had a Video cable added so it works with the back up camera in the mirror the GPS works great all the steering wheel controls work this is a quality unit. I'm glad I purchased it I would recommend this OEM unit to any one looking for quality. I would recommend having it installed by a professional
I have been in contact with a guy in China who informed me today 8/5/14 that there was a $81 cost to get the map updates. However mine was shipped (about 3 weeks ago) and it has the latest maps) for my area. I live in Missouri.
Currently I have this unit in a 2013 GMC, it's not compatibly with IPod Port, or OnStar does not show on the screen. Currently the Chimes or Turn signals lack an option to turn up the sound. So you won't hear either when music is up. I have not been able to contact Customer service for to-do or help. Research this more before purchasing this options. Fit well, great sounds, but no customer support for problems
Yes, it will work. You need to manually set the focal length for the image stabilization in your camera's menu.
Hi It can do both - check Youtube for a video review - turn a dial and it is click-less or turn it the other way and it clicks
No, because sony is a full frame sensor, voightlander is a Micro 4/3 lens. You can only use full frame lens with c mount. Or aps-c I think?
They do come in different sizes sp please double check before you purchase.I ordered two of them and the one that comes as 13.3 inches fits okay for a mid 2012 pro.Unfortunately the back side continues to fall of since the fit is a bit loose
yes, i believe you can.
When you connect an iPod to the dock, it should update automatically. Otherwise... 1. Press and hold the Power/Source button to turn the unit off. 2. Press the Clock button. 3. Press the Tun +/- buttons to adjust the hour. 4. Press the Clock button. 5. Press the Tun +/- buttons to adjust the minute. 6. Press the Clock button to finish setting the time.
We haven't lost the presets, but we do use battery back up option on clock.
It has a standard size headphone plug, so if the HDX has a headphone jack, I think it would work fine. The headphones fit all of our Kindle Fire models (we have 3 different ones, bought at different times) and our iPad.
That's what you need in order for the blue tooth to work
Your going to need a harness no matter what, basically that harness plugs up to your original radio wire harness
No, key caps are slightly larger than Apple's.
Yes it does. I am using it with my MacBook Pro as I write this.
Yes
I didn't buy this for myself, so I don't have access to operating it; but in reading the owners manual online, it certainly states that sound movies can be created (recorded), so I'm assuming that it DOES have audio. I took a screenshot of the instructions (page 40), but haven't the ability in this forum to attach the specific instruction. HTH
Yes
Maria, I have not had any experience with this question. Could you give me an idea if when this happens, then maybe I can assist, thanks.
I bought the one for 5517, works fine
I originally had the same question since I also received the 5200Ah, but I installed it and have been using it since June without any problems.
No
Yes, the keyboard comes with plug & charging cord. It is actually the same size usb size plug as my Galaxy 3. Yesthe tableg & keyboard fit together when closed
Yes
Check your TV's 3D settings. If it has 3D options that show a split vertical or horizontal screen then you're good.
Not directly, this camera is for use with a system recorder if you have that then you may be able to use your TV as a monitor. something like this http://www.amazon.com/Zmodo-PKD-DK4216-500GB-Internet-Accessible-4-Channel/dp/B005FM8UL4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1407958392&sr=8-1&keywords=survalliance+cameras Then monitor using HDMI connection to your TV.
Yes, two headphones included in pack.
no
I have a 1977 CJ7 with an AMC 304 v8. Do you have an HEI distributer? If you do, yes they will fit. I bought mine last winter and they do the job just fine.
It's made and pre cut and measured for a Chevy small block but if you have a v8 then possible
I don't see why it wouldn't....
Yes it would.
Just installed a logitech 502 wireless mouse on a comparable laptop; just attach the mini wireless usb adapter on your laptop; put batteries in the mouse; and you are ready to go. Any of the logitech mice in the $25.00 to $30.00 range work well. I got mine on Amazon. Brick and motor stores charge more. Good luck.
Mine didn't Gateway
It say's right in the product description that it is comparable with the emp-1. Yes it does come with the cable. It uses the usb 2.0 port on the side of the camera.
Yes, the package comes with instructions for using in Bulb Mode. Richard
It says right in the product description that it does.
I just did a quick test: it can charge and record at the same time, at least with the USB cable mine came with. But, here's the trick: I was only able to get it to do this by flipping the switch first, and then plugging the cable in. The camera will continue recording. Doing the reverse order does not result in a recording.
The Contour ROAM that I purchased came with a waterproof case that you put the camera in. The side mount has a lever that tightens the mount. It appears the lever could be closed over the strap of a diving mask. The case and camera would be held in place by the tension of the mask strap once donned. Perhaps the goggle strap on the Contour web site would work. See http://store.contour.com/ae/us/mounts/goggle-strap-mount/invt/2650&bklist=icat,4,shop,products,accessories.
Not by default, if you buy a video card with two DVI you can definitely make it happen
Yes, it works perfectly for mine.
No, I don't believe that it replaces that part number.
Not sure I bought one specifically made for the ipad2
Yes it has sensors in it that activate when your hands get near the keyboard. It's great, I recommend it.
I bought a very sturdy mount that swings back and forth. Got it through Amazon.
Yes. This is the case I use with my Canon SL1 with the 18-55 IS STM Lens. Fits perfectly!
considering you're paying less than $3 for it probably not
No, it needs AC power to run.
Well I can tell! you our setup. First of all the VCR combo doesn't have a HDMI output,, its YGB which our TV has on the back. We do have to switch inputs to access the VCR signal.
I am not sure what "in line" means in this context. This model DOES NOT have a tuner, so it has to be installed with an external tuner. I(n my case, we have Directv service, so that box provides the tuner for recording etc. If your TV has DVD/VCR connections on the back, you can just plug this into it with the cables supplied to watch DVD/VCR's. Hope this helps. So far, I am satisfied with the player...it works fine.
Yes, it is. I bought it for my wife's touch screen laptop and it works great!
Yes
Unless you use some additional method of securing your expensive phone onto the grip, I would not trust the strength of the spring alone on a motorcycle at all. It's not meant for anything other than typical stable tripod mounting for photography. Besides, RAM products make purpose-built phone mounts that are very secure for motorcycles for similar price.
All I can tell you is that it worked for me on my Mac OS X 10.9.4. It is so much fun to have those tapes preserved and my next step is to put them on CD's. Louise Jennings
No
I'm not familiar with the size of the steel cable, but if the diameter is around 1-3 mm, I think you should be ok.
Yes, it can work anywhere in the world as long there is internet connectivity or WIFI.
According to PNY's website (https://www3.pny.com/XLR8-SSD-120GB-P3161C517.aspx) it does support TRIM features from the OS.
all sata 3 drives are compatible with sata 2 interfaces, so yes it should work
Is it a desktop? I needed a SATA power source in my PC I just built for the SSD but not in my laptop.
Nope
No haven't tried it there but I have tried it in Afghanistan and it works good
No this model does not have that feature. The newer model does, but costs quite a bit more.
Ours never broke but they would not stay connected with the system in our car.
They work with the 2012 and amazon has a great return policy also if they don't
Yes. They are a great deal compared to purchasing similar ones at Frys, Best Buy, etc. They will work. They sound great and have an auto shut off feature if someone fails to turn them off.
nothing to plug in---its a wireless signal
Yes
The bass response was adequate - about what you would expect from this size of driver. Again, everything (including the bass response) hinges on a clean signal. Something that all wireless speakers have constant issues with.
I have Windows 7 and the install was easy. My speakers are about 40 feet from computer. Just plug the cable into any USB connection on your computer. These speakers are GREAT !!!!!
I have one speaker outside and one inside and haven't found any static even when having 10+ people in the house
Never had that problem , use wi-if throughout my home and outside , never a problem .
Connecting it to a hub is just fine. The keypad draws very little power, and is plug and play.
First off the USB plug is not compatible with the ipad charging port. If you have an adapter for the usb keypad to the ipad port it might. Haven't tried it. I have some adapters and might give it a try later.
about 4 feet
Yes
The amount of buttons available are software related. You can control them in your settings. I don't like all the buttons, so I've turned them off. PC users like having more activated.
Very nice lens,zoom is great!!! I like it.
Thank you for contacting us. Amazon will not allow us to provide our email address to you for security reasons but you are welcome to call us at 1-800-991-3350 between 9am-6pm EST.
Expeed is 3 FPS is 4
it stores enough backup power to charge an sgs3 to 25%.
USA
My power adapter says 100-240 vac 50-60 hz switching power adapter. I'm in the US so I just plug in the two prong into standard outlet. Overseas must have an adapter you plug this into.
Yes it comes with a usb cord.
No it does not come with an umb adaptor. Buy a Manfrotto 026 swivel umbrella adaptor and not a cheap plastic one. You'll be sorry if you buy a cheap plastic on
Yes, works well.
It should, I have a 14" dell laptop and there's room to spare.
I don't think there's a way unless you make modifications to the front panel (as in make a hole in it) While it wouldn't be integrated, you could install an external IR module somewhere nearby
It is not bad my grandson uses it to play games and does not have a problem
Yes, It has both. (apologies for answering so long after you asked. I just saw the question. (another amazon customer, who bought this machine). I have been very happy with it, and think it is a great value for what you get. Would recommend the brand/ similar desktops which are currently available. Too bad this one is not offered any more.
Yes I didn't have any problems doing transferring with mine
No, you can't. read Product Description, it's helpful .
Yes, it has SanDisk Logo on side of the drive; exactly the way you see in the photo.
I think it will. but I really didn't like how it preformed.
Its original
I use the mic/headphone separate jacks in the rear of the CPU. My transcriber says the sound is clearer because it plugs into the board more directly. The USB input takes a longer route and hence some quality is lost. The cord is about 8 feet. Hope that helps.
Came with a lens 18-55mm and lens hood, just like the picture shows.
I can't remember if it came with a memory card but mine did come with the battery and battery charger.
Dear Patrick, This is from the back of the box: APS-C size sensor; full stereo movie recording (1920 x 1080p) @30fps. Does this help? John
Comes with the standard 18-55mm lens
Yes it does I have 4 3tb drives in one and they work just fine, it will support up to 12tb
Hello Letitsnowletitsnow, This case is made specifically for TF300 and we also included opening for PRIME TF201. It's compatible with both models. Sincerely, rooCASE Customer Care
Hello Letitsnowletitsnow, This case is made specifically for TF300 and we also included opening for PRIME TF201. It's compatible with both models. Sincerely, rooCASE Customer Care
I cannot help you. Sorry. I do not work for the company, I just bought the battery. The battery was not very good and didn't last very long. So perhaps that will help you. Good luck.
Yes
I believe so, usually one battery works on many different pcs. The one I got from atbatt.com works fine but only holds a charge for about 2 hours or so, however, an OEM Toshiba battery is $125 instead of $30, the atbatt is worth the savings. Plus there's a guarantee. Get the exact battery model no. off your Pc when ordering and ask the rep if it's compatible.
I believe that I have the same model and mine works with it.
It can be a replacement but I'm not sure. Just try it and see if it works. Always save all the packaging, paperwork etc so you can return it if it doesn't work. The one I got works great. I hope this helps
No they dont it comes as a package but maybe you could contact griffin support and/or check ebay.
I just checked the instructions that came with the unit. It states that you can charge USB devices on AC or battery power but in order to save battery life the unit will cease charging external devices if being played on a high volume setting during battery operation. Hope that helps. ;)
Yes
It's light brown; by the way I decided not to use this strap mainly because I'm into street photography and this strap is too 'flashy' to be in the 'stealth' mode. But it is a nice strap if you don't mind the attention.
I think the coolpix use wrist straps with a thin cord looping through a single small hoop. This strap is made for traditional (D)SLRs. The bits that loop through the camera are about a quarter of an inch wide and intended to be looped through rings on either side of the camera.
This fits my 7" x 4" tablet. I guess this is what you wanted to know.
I've built a Motion Sensor with the Arduino and it didn't need any resistance to ground.... but maybe the Pi is different, that I don't know. check it out &gt;&gt;&gt;. http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/PIRsense
Hello, thank you for your inquiry. The range is limited by the travel of the internal threaded post that rotates when spinning the slow motion cable. It is not a worm gear assembly such as those found on some EQ mounts.
hi bob here yes it is amazing in low lite conditions I shoot pool in a bar and use it as helmet cam on my scooter and can see as good as daylite going thru town late nite in street lites
Yeah it does. great cam for the price man. You honestly Can't go wrong. Clear , Great battery.
all the way to the top Cannon camera. YES in other words.
yes, you need software to do it, that does not cost much. BlueIris is the name of the software I believe, and it works wonderful. Records sound too if you want it to. I think it is 40$ for the software. The foscam site has a link for the software.
all you have to do is screw the attachment in front of your 18-55 lens, if you are using the macro lens screw out the wide angle part, if you using the wide angle then screw out the macro piece, they come apart
Yes it is, unless your car already has remote start, then in addition to this you must purchase a bypass ring as well
Yes, that is my laptop model
Yes. I transferred all the user files from my old XP to my new win 7. Please note that it will not transfer the programs, just the user files. I assume that you have run the compatibility test to see what old programs will run under win 7. You may also have issue if you have set up win 7 to run 64 bit. If you have, you can sometimes have the program run as 32 bit. I would also download the latest version of Easy Transfer software from Microsoft. Good luck.
This is just a case for a 4th generation iPod.
The fan is on continuously but at quiet level ; the low battery beep is only noticeable to those in the same room , just one beep then shut down .
I don't know, I bought the case for an Olympus XZ-1 and its a very tight fit.
The RX-100 and a lens cloth fit in the main pocket of the TBC-403 with room to spare. The front pocket is roomy too - mine holds two extra batteries, a Sony BC-DCX USB charger, an SD card reader and an extra SD card.
1.1 x 3.9 x 2.3 inches. It's soft, so you could fudge a tiny bit in one dimension if the others are under.
4 3/4 by 3 1/4 outside and it is a perfect fit for my Panasonic DMC-ZS19.
Yes
No, it does not have a belt loop.
hey sorry I only seen your question now. yes it has 1 year manufacturer warranty
Yes, though some of the keys don't match up perfectly. The F5 key is blank when it shouldn't be. But that's about it.
Yes
I have never seen anything but the station name and frequency on the display.
I don't have that particular laptop but if it is similar to the DV7 then you won't be disappointed. It takes about 5 hours, depending on what you are doing, to drain it down to 10%. There have been times where I got 5-1/2 hours of use before it reached 10% but I try to avoid that since it isn't good for the battery.
yes, I use this combination.
Flash is built in.
From the Engadget review of the Series 5 550: If you're looking to connect your trusty wireless mouse, the Chromebook supports Bluetooth 3.0, though you'll need to plug a dongle into one of those two USB ports. (The Chromebox has native Bluetooth 3.0 support, in case you were wondering.)
I don't know. I actually fixed my issue with the cases with a small piece of sticky backed velcro. Tightened the case up and all of the holes line up now. I THINK they just sewed them a tad loose. The rest of the gadgets are OK. Starter set of chargers and other handy items.
Yes it does. On the left side
Yes it is
Call the 800 number. I have never had to replace the battery.
No...excellent buy for the money... I purchased 2 packs
Yes
It's not really designed for them. It has a hanging holder file system that locks when you close the lid. In order to maintain control of jewel cases you would have to keep it almost completely full
Sorry, I don't know the exact dimensions, bought this as a gift. I can tell you that it fit the nook color quite well. It was well liked. It also looked was lovely.
Yes
The card readers are all USB 2.0. Running a benchmark on a Class 10 SD yielded typical transfer rates of 30-35 MB/s.
The USB3 and USB2 cables are long enough that I needed to zip-tie the excess down on my full tower setup, I didn't measure but I'd say around 18 inches. The molex power connector was a bit shorter, but still had enough length to easily reach the adapter.
Pull it apart, solder, put it together (check for breaks in 3.5mm cord...replace accordingly)
Right side cover slides down so you can change the batteries.
Yes
call the company....they are very helpful or email them. I own two of their drives and have been very happy
Sorry - I have no idea. I bought it for China. To find out what might work there, I Googled something like "electrical adapters China." You'll probably find what's required in Peru the same way. These worked great in China, and it was definitely a good idea to have more than one in order to charge several pieces of equipment at once.
To my understanding Spain takes a Type-C adapter while the United Kingdom (England) uses a Type-G. I see that Spain also uses Type-G. Amazon has a Ceptics universal set that includes all types of adapters (Ceptics GP-5PK International Travel Worldwide Plug Adapter Set) for $10.23. To be on the safe side, this may be a better option for you. Here is a link for further information on adapter types (http://kropla.com/electric2.htm). Hope this helps. I used a Ceptics Type-G adapter in Italy and it worked great.
The adapters will accept grounded 3-prong plugs, yes. I don't see why they wouldn't run an oxygen concentrator, since they're pretty heavy-duty.
No. It does not have surge protection. Grounding is not surge protection.
Yes, I use mine for my ancient nikkor lenses.
This mount is designed for Nikons with an aperture ring. It is not designed to work with the auto series. Suggest you check the website yourself.
I believe you can get one from the HP website directly. Just search for it.
Yes, it's a sturdy elasticized loop on the side of the case. The stylus stays put, no slipping. Works just fine!
Yes but it will not fit all the bottoms as good as in the Galaxy. Is special for the Galaxy Tab.
Yes it does. It is a very good product & fast with a 3.0 USB.
Yes , it is. But speed decrease to 18-25 Mb/s.
hii.. i bought this sandisk usb drive in amazon work for me in win7 and win8 in usb 3.0 connection maybe your usb drive something wrong or damge contact your seller...
The Answer = Yes AND No. This unit holds a lot more music than some players can handle. Some cannot 'see' this large a drive. (I play music and videos on my LG TV with it fully loaded with no issues)
yes and no you could use it but is not guaranteed according to xbox.com they suggest that you use an xbox 360 labeled memory also they say it will recognize only 32gb of the memory stick
Given that your computer is not otherwise burdened, you should expect about 30MB/s on a USB2 device like this.
Yes, it comes with a hole for a lanyard, but does not come with one.
Yes
Here is a link to a 5 page list of compatible memory modules for your motherboard from the Gigabyte web-site. There are several Corsair memory modules that are compatible with your GA-X58A-UD5. http://download.gigabyte.us/FileList/Memory/mb_memory_ga-x58a-ud5_v2.0.pdf
You can use two of these with 2 of the 4GB you currently have with no problem. I'm currently doing the same myself. Just make sure you alternate the slots you place the in. Such as 1&3 for one set and 2&4 for the other set.
yes it does. but you may consider buying a better tripod especially if you intend using it with canon 5D......
Yes. It will fit any Canon EOS models having an EF or EF-S mount. I use it on both a Canon T3 and a Canon 70D.
Yes, Akaline Batteries don't last long....I Use Rechareable & keep extras charged; Amazon sells their own brand & they are excellent & charge quickly! Save $'s, Get rechargeable for all Battery Items. Now you can get Sleeves for C & D size Use, & they use AA rechargeable! Saves our landfills! I know you didn't ask, but when I discovered them, I was SOOOOO Impressed! I have 2 Auvio Wireless headphones, so I don't change batteries(only when worn out) I just keep one Headset charged for replacement! You're Welcome!
I believe it will
Yes. Additionally, the card is 4K Ready using DisplayPort 1.2 (4096X2160). You must use HDMI 1.4a (4096X3112) to get to the 4K and if you just want to use DVI (as a backup for example) it will drive your monitor at 2560X1600. Hope this helps.
The plate is white, but the arm and mounting hardware is silver or gray.
Not for sure, but the "spider" that holds the projector has a fairly wide range of adjustments to hold most projectors. The look in our ceiling makes it almost unnoticeable. It is easy to adjust the angle and position of the projector, but you have to make sure you tighten real well to prevent movement.
They are not wireless and I would not recommend them. I have had to replace nearly every camera I have ever purchased from this company. The wiring has poor quality and the cameras just burn out. The professional that I hired to trouble shoot called the Q-See cameras "disposa-cams." When they say "you get what you pay for," it is absolutely true here.
Yes, it is.
Actually, yeah. My laptop screen was a bit too thin. I just fixed it on the back with tape.
yeah it would fit well, you can check some of the pictures i uploaded on the product page to get an idea of the bag to laptop ratio
The power cord I have is a monster in size it fits perfectly into one of the other compartments plus I still can also fit my tablet my phone and my mini google chrome and a notebook etc so lots of room in this bag
It should, but I can't say for sure. My HP laptop has a 17 inch screen (measured diagonally), but with my laptop closed the external dimensions are 16.5" wide by 11 inches long and there's plenty of room for it. So if your dimensions are close to that, it should fit comfortably.
This laptop is so baseline! I wish I had never bought it, the keyboard quit working after 2 months and they would not exchange it, no software on it, not cd rom and I seriously doubt it can be upgraded at all!
im having the exact same problem... i havent being able to find one, but i will try ebay
I must confess I carry my 15-inch Mac in another manufacturer's bag. I use my 17-inch CaseLogic Bag for a 17-inch PC notebook. It all depends on whether you plan to buy a larger notebook, and whether you are concerned about smaller equipment moving around inside a larger bag. Also the smaller bag is more likely to fit under an airliner seat. I'm happy with my CaseLogic shoulder bag, but again, I use it with a large notebook computer.
The full dimensions of the package I received (with backpack accessory) were approximately: 28" x 20" x 6" Within this box was the backpack and a smaller box holding the laptop, and that box was only about 18" x 14" x 4"
It is 8G 1600Mhz. 4 USB 3.0
Yes. The keyboard is back lit kind of bluish white. There are three brightness levels - four if you count "off."
Mexico
It must be purchased separately. We bought them at the same time from Amazon. Had the best prices.
Ed, this battery is a Lott bigger. Believe it or not it does fit but sits up higher in the back about 1 1/2 higher. This makes my computer sit higher in the back also it is heavier. Since I take it to class it is a bit of a lug but I can get through a 4 hour class with out the ac adapter. So it is worth it.
Being compatible means that it is built to fit your computer. It either is compatible or it isn't. If it is, it will work great. This battery is larger than the smaller, original battery and lifts the back of the laptop up in the air about 1/2 inch. I like this. It allows for better air circulation and rotates the keyboard toward me just a little. I liked that there were so many positive reviews for this battery. Glad I bought it. It is working great for me.
Call Customer Service after checking your manual to find the phone number. They are very helpful!
It holds 4 cd's.
No, but you could feed the Pandora audio into the aux input of the Bose. I would go the web site and inquire and/or go to a computer store and ask.
It comes with one battery included. I don't know where you get the replacements. I bought 3 of these. Not impressive if you are giving them as a gift. They look as though they are worth about $5.... They do make a loud sound, however, that could deter any burglar, I believe.
The connector in the cradle is the apple proprietary so I would think not. It uses a standard stereo jack for plugging into the radio or amplifier
Yes, I played my iPod nano via the Wave Connect Kit. Paul
radio schack or best buy
That one in the picture works good!
No it does not have an eject button
Dawna, I dont know, I bought it for a Sony PSP 3000....
I dont think there is I used the 32 gig works fine
Yes. 2 chargers, one for each radio.
According to the compatibility list on http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007ZKEAS6/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1, it is compatible with the 5736z. I'm guessing the 4685 is a sub-model of the 5736z. So my best guess is that it would work. Please beware, the removal of the old keyboard isn't as easy as it looks on the video on YouTube. But once you get the old one out, installing the replacement is a breeze.
Dear Hiro. I am sorry, but I can't answer this question for you. I purchased one, but I installed it into a different model! Sorry! Tom
I assume you meant an Acer Aspire. I think it will but this KB's space bar failed after two months. I replaced it with this: Keyboard for Acer Aspire 7741 7741Z 7741ZG Series Laptop Keyboard Replacement AS5810T-8952 NSK-AL01D and it works fine. Physically it is identical to the LotFancy KB. BTW there are videos on YouTube showing the Acer KB replacement process.
David, While the unit does not ship with wireless networking capabilities, you could add either an internal (PCI or PCI-Express) or external adapter (USB) to the system.
I haven't tried them in the mountains but they are great I use them for my security company
I Actually Use a 24 In Lcd Hdtv. AOC Brand. Mine isHooked UpThrough Vga. I Get1080P AndItLooksGreat.
I don't know. But it is a great computer. I do recommend it.
I installed it for the retina display iPad 2 wifi version. I don't know about the IC579
Not sure, they stated they would work on my toyota tundra, and they were not even close
the unit hooks up to the bose radio unit which has speakers built in. Also, some units are nt compatable. Check with Bose for details
The Wave unit isn't set up for that. I was going to use it with some speakers for my patio and couldn't. I even took it to Best Buy when I was looking at the speakers so that I was sure they would be compatible.
You have to screw into the smooth side of the plastic like you would screw speakers onto a subwoofer box. Use sheet metal screws, self tapping screws, self piloting screws, etc.... And once speakers are attached to the bracket it can and will look like and install like the stock speakers, except for the wire modification
According to the description it will only fit in the front of the 2011 Altima. I only bought them for the front of my 2003 Nissan Maxima but I could have used them in the back with drilling one new hole.
Benchmark wise this is almost exactly the same as the stock clocked gtx 980. However keep in mind the 980 is the most up to date in terms of new features at the time of this answer (3/2/15). I am upgrading to a gtx 980 classified and will be selling my gtx 690 as I upgrade.
Yes you can. There are two monitor cable connection on it.
I just poor water on mine when it gets hot
Yes it does have vga input, as stated in the item description.
it has no power supply so you must find a 220V power supply that has DC 5V 3.5A output. A little research on the web will find you the right power supply for that unit.
It does
Yes. Obviously some will fit better than others, but I have used mine with Turtle Beach XP 500's and Turtle Beach XP Sevens without any difficulty. You obviously won't be able to fit the control units for these inside the case though.
Yes, they're for both.
Yes it did
This should be the default set-up. There are three set-ups: Bridge, Ethernet adapter, and Repeater. I have only set these up as repeaters, but am planning on switching at least one to Ethernet. Here is a link that was quite helpful to me: http://www.thinkbroadband.com/hardware/reviews/74-asus-ea-n66.html
Excellent range. I use my over one hundred feet inside a metal building from router. Best adapter i ever used
There are 2 connectors total, both are 4 pin connectors, 1 designated for CPU, the other is for a chassis fan.
Yes it will, the CPU socket will take that processor
yes, you have to select the audio device in sound options.
Not very good. Like an expensive webcam. Good for Skype
No 3G or sim card slot - that model was only available overseas
The letters take up pretty much the entire key and are easily viewable which is great because I have nearsightedness As for key size the PHYSICAL size is standard keyboard key. I apologise I don't have a measuring tape at hand lol Hope this helps ya
we have not experience an interroption of electicity for more than a minute, since we have a 16k generator in our house. but if you don't have a generator, this piece of equipment is highly recommendable.
5/8", or 16 mm measured with a digital caliper
6.3mm
Not detachable and can't change volume
Yes, absolutely. I find the autofocus to be a bit sluggish, and prefer to focus manually, but you'll find that to the case with just about any long zoom in this price range.
My son is 19 years old and an avid gamer and graphic design major ! I purchased this monitor for him and he loves it he tells me the quality is even better then he thought it would be ! I would highly reccomend this monitor for a gamer or graphic design student !
Depends on the type of gaming. The 5-6ms response time isnt great for FPS or games with a lot of things moving on the screen very quickly, you will notice ghosting. I run 2 of them in a triple screen setup though, with the 2 GW2450's on the outside. I bought a much faster 2ms BenQ for the center monitor and I dont notice any ghosting anywhere. Partly because I dont focus on the side screens because they serve as peripheral viewing but Id say in general, yes. For best results? No.
If I remember correctly its 4. I was impressed with this monitor so much I bought a second one. Games and video look amazing. Not noticed any tearing at all.
It comes in a flat box, you have to assemble the stand and monitor, so just leave it off.
Projector, remote, power cord, VGA cable, warranty information card, CD manual and Quick Start Guide booklet
It has the 30 pin adapter connection. You might need to buy the 30 pin to lightning adapter.
Yes.
Buy a optoma 3Dxl converter box
Sorry, I didnt this test!
I don t think so
Yes, if it performs properly. Mine has always been bad and the connection is on and off from one moment to the next.
Yes
I don't know about this model but it works for my D40
16 bnc connectors along the top in back along with the 10/100 ethernet and 15 pin vga connector.
Yes it will work just fine.
5 1/4"wide x 8"long
18"L x 12"W x 50"H fully incapsolated in a cardboard box.
Hi, sorry the only one we carry is the one for FJ Cruiser. Thank you
Yes you can charge the battery in the camera. U must have got the USB wire and adapter. This can even be harged in yourr car using the USP port
The camera does not come with a lens cap originally, but if you buy one of two additional lens to go with it you will need to buy an attachment ring and once installed it will accept a lens cover and a cover comes with the extra lens.
The official specs from Olympus's website indicate a 25mm-100mm (35mm equivalent) focal length range. http://www.getolympus.com/us/en/tough-tg-1.html
I am not sure about Dodge .I fit it into 2003 toyota .I feel it should fit .
Honestly it should work either way seeing as modern Ethernet is full duplex. However I typically use "in" as the cable coming from the "safe" side and "out" as the cable going to the "unsafe" side, aka the potentially dirty side. If you have two surge protectors on either end of a trunk cable that means that the two surge protectors would be connected to each others "out" ports. Works well for me.
Not at all.
No bluetooth on this. 3-4 hours typical battery life
yes
Yes this cable is applicable to both
IT DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS EIGHT. IN FACT MINE QUIT WORKING ALL TOGETHER ( shows the distance to any hole at 999 yds. It is hard to use and I consider it a piece of JUNK. Sorry.
Yes, I wear mine while wearing glasses all the time. I don't notice them causing any discomfort.
If you order from the Sony store, you can upgrade to Win7 Pro.
Its work with my Sony LG????
I am not sure. I have a 70" sharp aquos and it works just fine. Only prob with these glasses are that they're pretty small and only fit a small child. Hope that answers your question.
Yes but the battery life wasent as good as I thought but as long as the headset lasts for me I think its woth the money
That's what I bought it for and it works great, it actually charges it faster than the DELL one did. Just be careful about leaving it plugged in, it gets really warm.
I purchased it to power my Dell laptop and it worked fine!
I am not certain if it will, but my daughter and I have different HP laptops and it fits both of them. My laptop is about 3 years older than hers. Amazon has a fantastic return policy so if it doesn't fit, it is really simple to return the item. One of the reasons I like Amazon so much. This adapter works really well and I have had no issues with it.
Wolvol.com. see their f.a.q. page.....good experience, good product for a child.
It comes with a free trial of McAfee. Right now I just use Avast, it's free and it works.
Hello, Yes, this battery will work in that unit. Any MU06 battery will work (either 593554-001 or 593553-001). The 593554-001 is just a slightly stronger battery for a bit of a longer charge life. Thank you for checking before buying. - Julie - Mobile Parts Proz
If it supports 1.35volts and should work. In fact sometimes even those on the qualitfid vendors list also fail.. As i have experienced with the z97 and x99
I have this memory running on an ASUS Crosshair V Formula-Z with an FX-8350, it runs at the full speed 2400MHz. No issues at all.
I used standard "RCA audio/video cables" (you can see what these look like by searching Amazon for "Video Cables" in electronics) . I needed some longer cables so I went to my local RadioShack. These are available at most stores. These are not applicable to HD TVs. I don't know if there are adaptors available for that type of connect. Hope this helps.
after plugging it in ,,turn it on with the remote.
We would view video from youtube, but never attempted to upload a video. I'm sorry that I cannot be more helpful.
I was new to Wifi also. You have to purchase and install a router that connects to your desktop PC and ( if applicable) your cable modem.
Unless it was advertised as used, it should be brand new. The box should be sealed with an unbroken sticker on one of the folds and the static bag is usually sealed with clear tape that has the manufacturer's logo on it. If there are finger prints on the shroud I'd say you definitely have a used one. The people who assemble and box these things brand new wear gloves - you should never see a single print on a new GPU.
On your remote it has social networking, Netflix, basic internet. Its wonderful
You will see how you insert/remove sim card on Ipad4 through https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MI9uU5AFQzA. Jump to 3:20 on video. It has sim slot like Iphone and you can take the slot out easily. The slot is on back side of right top corner.
Absolutely yes
It came out just before the 4 and is the last version of the iPad 3 and it has all the bells and whistle and OS as the 4 the only difference is it doesn't have the HD retinal display; everything else is just like the iPad 4. Hope this helps. I don't even notice the difference and for the money it is a great deal. Kristina D.
I dont know Sorry
It has a base that screws on to the lens, then the hood bayonet-mounts to that base. So the answer to your question would be, "Yes".
My situation is a large L-shaped area, kitchen, dining, living. Long walls are 30' and 27'. Nine foot ceilings. Speakers are perched in the open space above my kitchen cabinets at one end of the L. (Not optimal placement for true audiophiles, I know.) For my kind of listening - mostly vocal/acoustic instrumental - ish at moderate loudness, the Vanatoos do really well filling up that space and I'm still *very* happy with them.
Yes it is, I replaced the keyboard on my xps m1330 with this keyboard
This is an expresscard adapter, do they make a GPU with an expresscard interface? If its video you're looking for,the thunderbolt port already doubles as the mini DVI port. Hope this helps in any way.
It does buffer out a lot, but with music it is amazing. I've made across the world trips with none of the headaches and fatigue from the past. I would not think this is the best answer for use without music.
I believe it was more around an hour maybe. Sorry if I'm not much help.
I suggest going full blown Office Space on it with bats and hammers and then being environmentally responsible and picking up all the broken, worthless pieces.
We bought one for the one. It is on BUT very snug and VERY difficult to get to the controls. When we ease it off to shut off and plug in we are back to the struggle....... However when it is on ..... and when the power is working- it does carry well and it angles well......
Ive found it easy to put in but tight to get out. But that could change over time when doing it over and over. It may become a bit more malibile.
I bought a used one from a private seller and the charger wasn't included but if you are thinking of ordering from a company or buying new then there should be a charger for it.
I had to just let the battery die when thus happened to me. Once it was dead, I plugged it into the charger and it seemed to work fine.
no.
It is a standard mouse. I have not tried it on a Chrome book but it will replace any mouse.
I never stated this, My order was cancelled because the item was sold out.
I don't think so.
I am not a professional photographer. That being said, I do not see how the pictures could be better! The colors are lifelike. I took hundreds while on a cruisetour of Alaska. Perfect! Kiawah Island at sunset, vivid colors. You can set the camera for aspect ratio 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, or 1:1. Settings are available for picture size and quality. Much more!
Google to compare the dimensions. If they are the same or similar, then yes.
It's probably about four inches wide, six inches long and two inches tall, the "antenna" adds another half inch or so. The receiver is even smaller. Amazing how well these little units work for me.
Try holding the power, and volume +/- buttons for 15 seconds
Nope! Stays on until you turn it off. Sounds great too!!
Similar.

yes
Yes, nice product and great price
Original Sony media.
I have only used it with the GoPro and I have had trouble downloading it to my Mac. It is very fragile and can easily bend.
All recording cameras have a limit on what size memory SD card they can record onto, I suggest checking with manufacturing company. not all models are from same maker are equally either.
I wouldn't consider my answer accurate but I believe it works in any phone it works perfectly in my Samsung Galaxy s5.
It works. But you need greater speed card such as SanDisk extreme plus 64gb or Samsung pro 64gb for better performance.
Approximately 3 feet long.
Very small mount ....approximately 3 in wide and 9 in tall ... I mounted directly to Stud no support bracket ....no issues ...screws are in a straight line. .... three screws.
This SHARP TV is listed as having 400x400 VESA mount which would fit perfectly with this mounts maximum size
The mount does have a full range of motion a good tilt up and down (these require the screw to be loosened) the side to side motion is spectacular, very easy smooth movement and it does not sway or creep to a new position (assuming its mounted level). It sticks out from the wall about 2 inches so its not an exact flush mount but it does pull away from the wall a considerable distance .
what do you mean two units. two cable boxes or like. yes it is stable
There is a N WiFi adapter and it works well.
You can do it but the heat from the two units I would not advise
I've had mine installed for 2 months in nothing but rainy east coast weather and so far so good......keeping my fingers crossed because it would be very difficult to swap it out.
I really don't know why you couldn't, but I would call Comcast and ask them. I have Charter Cable and it works great.
It's the DPI Switcher. It allows you to change your DPI on the fly. Best way to explain DPI is that it's very similar to Sensitivity in game. Higher DPI = less you move the physical mouse for how much the mouse moves on screen. From my memory (I may be wrong, I lost the mouse about a year ago) it just toggles between 2 preset DPIs
I got a battery charger...everything came a stated.
It is 120 volts only.
the box dimensions are 19"W x 10"H x 20 1/2"L
The One I purchased only cam with a cover cloth bag No carrying case was included
The only thing I was able to find online was that it will taking starting amps without a problem and since it's a battery isolation solenoid it can take continuous duty.
Yes it should, the piece with velcro that holds tablet in at bottom is not solid closed it also has cut out in it. Hope that helps. It it a good simple not bulky case
It's quite large, actually. I don't use all the backdrops and had use clamps to adjust their size, but it does take up quite a bit of space in the smallest room in my house. While the backdrop stand is adjustable and can be reduced in width, the lights and everything else take up some space.
It can be paired to multiple devices - ie: computer, phone, ipod, etc... but only one can be connected/in use at any given time.
It will fit. No adapter needed
Sorry not sure but I don't think so.
I have not done this BUT, according to the setup manual:"...You will be able to access files from a USB external hard drive or thumb drive that is plugged into the router from your local network or from the Internet using either a web browser or an app for your smartphone or tablet..." so I don't why the other two respondeers said no to you.
Sure can. I have a small Lexmark that now can be used on my pc, my tablet, and the grandkids laptops when they visit.
No, I don't believe they will. I cant find anything on the size of the lens on your camera, but from the pictures it appears much smaller than 58mm.
The unit is marked 100-240v 50/60Hz, so yes.
In repeater mode it is just extending the network you already have so it is pretty straight forward. It is a good idea to access the setup to make sure it is properly configured however.
Yes , it comes with remote: Included Accessories Carrying case, wireless remote control Cables Included 1 x VGA cable 1 x USB cable
For sure, full HD, small size and powerful projector. Fits a 200 inch screen in a short distance.
Unfortunately this player is not a multi voltage. I had to buy a transformer to work it on a 220V. It is built for a 110V originally.
I think your best bet would be to contact the point of purchase. They should be able to help you with warranty questions.
I would buy another Sceptre TV. I haven't had any problems with my 39". The 39" is the #1 selling LCD on Amazon.
This will work with Cannon, but metering modes will not work as it's not a real Speedlite. You have to adjust flash output, F stop and shutter speed unlike with a real Speedlite that does it for you. The T3i is just better then a T2i, same hot shoe.
it will work but it will not function as an 'auto' flash. everything must be done manually.
The current draw with provided lights it just under 100 watts total. The lamp house is fused with a 3 Amp fuse, so my best guess on paper is that it can take up to a 330 watt load before popping the fuse. I wouldn't push more than that through because most of the housing is plastic. I hope this answer helps.
Yes although you may want to purchase an extension cord for headphones, they are cheap, so you don't have to sit really close to the television. The extension will have a female 3.5 mm end and a 3.5 mm male end.
Yes, it comes with a nice case
No. The power must be ON for any sound to be transmitted.
No worries, it's a simple fix. Take the cable and unplug it from your Ipad, Next box it back up, send it back to Amazon. Get a refund and go buy one from Apple. Then complain to Amazon about them continuing to dupe customers with items that don't work even after numerous customers have complained about the product.
Mine did not work either, so I sent it back.
This never worked. Worst product ever! Try to get your money back.
Ubuntu 12.10
I do not have a Europian blue ray. But it shows Asian and Europian DVDs I have. Most probably it's the same with blue rays.
Yes! Ive used it with Skype.
No it doesn`t... that was really sad. But is an excellent computer!
Shipping weight is about 3lbs.
If you order it, check the model that arrives. Mine didn't have the SSD. I called Amazon and sent it back for one with the SSD. Waiting on the replacement... EDIT - its there, just not user accessible, see below:
Pixelation is when a series of patterns of squares join to gether and cause black squares where colors and parts of the picture should be.There by causing holes in the images on screen and making the viewing less then a desirable viewing experience. Hope this helps. Happens a lot when one uses Satillite. Carol
No
Yes, with the proper cable. This laptop has video out via the "mini-displayport" connector on the right-hand side. You can get a cable that will adapt this to an HDMI input on your Tv/Monitor.
Yes. "N" adapters are almost always downward compatible with a, b & g signals. You shouldn't have any problem. And, when you eventually upgrade to an "N" or even "AC" (pending new standard) wireless router, it will send/receive at much faster bit rates.
1 YEAR LIMITED HARDWARE WARRANTY . http://content.dell.com/us/en/gen/d/solutions/limited-hardware-warranties.aspx
No.
believe me it is really heavy&#65281;&#65281;&#65281;
"robust WiFi connection" , as stated in spec info.
Wireless N wi-fi adapter and a 1.3 megapixel camera
The MeFoto travel Tripod has a maximum height of 4.26 ft.
Not sure if it will or not. It supports my Nikon D7000,18-300 and auxillary battery with no problems. That set up weighs just shy of 5 pounds. It has a built in hook in the center. I hang my camera backpack there for extra stability especially if it is windy. Hope that info helps.
The ball head does unscrew from the tripod leaving a threaded post that would allow the head to be changed provided the post and threads are the same. sorry I don't know the size of the threaded post.
Not that I can see. It is solely a tripod. I think you will have to either purchase a monopod or find a Tripod with that capability.
No. Unless the new head unit put in has the same exact 3 pin slot. This unit is really specifically designed for the Rockford Fosgate 6 cd changer only
It holds my iPad 2 and iPad 4. We have one for each and we love it. I guess you could find the measurements for either of those, if the same, then the answer would be yes. I have also bought several for gifts and the recipients have their iPads in this holder all the time.
This item has the 30 pin iPhone connector on the base to connect to docks. It has no other output options and cannot be used with an RCA or line out/in.
I'm not 100% sure but I don't see why not. I have a 51" Samsung with a Samsung sound bar. I mounted the brackets to my current wall mount to for the TV. I then mounted the wall mount that came with the sound bar to these brackets.
Yes, the GoPro 3 fits nicely in the case. I wouldn't have the Go Pro without the case. It's easy to carry and packs well for going on trips or expeditions. All of the GOPRO gear fits like a glove in the case. I highly recommend it.
It is approximately 9 x 6 x 5. Large enough to hold my camera, all my accessories including chest strap, helmet strap and UTV mount.
Its not a Pelican. I can't remember the name of the company....All I remember is that it was to small. If you have GOPRO extras ie head band, wrist band, ect ect they will not fit. Not even close. Hope this helps.
No. The I phone screen kit has an extra screw driver which is needed to open up the Iphone. You can watch a full video of the protocol for the iphone four here :http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRnj-O4ORf4
I'm pretty sure it does. I honestly don't know
Through the aux input jack 3.5 mm. you can connect whatever device that has an 3.5 mm input for headphones. (The cable to do so is provided inside the package)
No, you can not. it wont allow you.
So Far Its Worked Fine With MP3 and WMA. I Have Not Tried It With The Other Two.
Yes, just tried it and I was able to .
I'm not sure if it this thing would work with your device, but it has worked with my iPhone 5 as well as my Samsung Galaxy 4S with no problem at all. All functions on the remote work with these 2 devices I mentioned. I would think that it would probably work with your Motorola android phone as well. Good luck!
Yes, it dose
Yes, it does, however, find a reputable vendor. I can't remember who I made the first off market purchase from. Laptop is now 3yrs old. Original Dell battery failed after one year. I replaced it with an off market battery. It also lasted one last year. The new battery ordered will not hold a charge and vendor has not responded to the problem.
Not sure what you mean by chips. The USB part slides out with a tab in the back.
yes but this is a product of china so very low grade quality
No the IPad air is thinner than the IPad, Pad 1, or IPad 2, this cover is strictly for the regular IPads.
Yes it fits very well.
You can use a 128G micro. I have w/out issues for a year. CAREFUL! Many pirate 128G cards around. Buy name brand.
Of course. I love mine! http://www.jetaudio.com/products/cowon/z2/
Yes Bob, btw, the sound is seriously good.
The typical answer is to put on a baffle or screen of foam; like those you see on announcer mics on TV at outdoor events. You could use a bit of packing foam to do the job, or even a layer of cloth. This will reduce the rumble from wind. Secure with a tie wrap or wire tie.
It requires a power supply (something similar to what a cell phone charger looks like). The power rating/requirements should be found on the device itself, or included documentation. Yes the power is red, should be a 2.1mm round standard for CCTV components as that is the application of what it is being sold for. and then the white RCA would be the mono audio output from the mic. This can be converted to 3.5mm or 1/4" audio plugs with adapters sold separately.
Mine came with the screw already screwed into the battery compartment door and I was unable to remove it without breaking the unit and consequently trashing it when it would not function AT ALL.
It's a universal remote. So yes it will Work for Emerson tv.
yeh, any os released after xp can use this just fine
Yes.
Yes eith room to spare
100-240 supported. It says so on the power plug(which is more than a cord because it has a plug that is rather large)
yes absolutely. my advice is to just ignore all the seagate info on the drive. I basically just put it all in a folder that says "seagate sys info" and never disturb it. If you let it set stuff up, then you could become a slave to its rules. Basically just treat it as a big fat flash drive. Copy all, and it will only update the new stuff. It is incredibly reliable and fast
About 5"x3.25"x0.6" and the cable is about 17.5"
I don't know; I don't have the Dock. Sorry.
That is correct.
Model: ADS-18E 12N 12018GPCU switching Adapter input 100-240v 50/60Hz Output 12V -----1.5A
I wish it had an ON/OFF switch, but it doesn't. You have to pull the power plug to power it down.
You can use any USB connection up to 3.0 which the drive is configured for. It also runs FW 800 with the special add on adapter. The USB connection speed is limited to the speed of you computer's port so if it is not USD 3.0, it will transfer at the lower speed based on your computer configuration. I have the 4TB version and speed is not an issue at USB 2.0.
I believe it should. The USB is backwards compatible. It will work in any USB 2 as well. It will just be slower.
easy to use and reliable to back up files.
Yes this works nicely with Windows 8 operating system.
Yes it fits all mac keyboards. Be cautious however with retina macs, as the eject button switched to the power button. I believe this is the same with the air.
The unit has a built-in webcam. Thanks
Yes, Has Webcam
I dont think so. This system is set up for outputs, a, b or a+b.
Yes but power will be split among the selected pairs of speakers.
It does retain extension digits, but all you have to do is scroll back to the original number and then click redial. The biggest issue I have with this phone is the volume is too low and when doing conference calls, you frequently cannot get it loud enough.
The frame that has the mounting holes is adjustable. However, to be sure and to save you a return in merchandise check the specification page for this product.
yes
I don't see why not. My only complaint is that it takes a 30-60 seconds sometimes to find a satalite after the car has been sitting. I received nothing this morning, couldnt even turn it off after 15min of driving. Had to turn the car off at an intersection and it booted back up. Good luck...
Unfortunately we cannot ship this product to Russia. Sorry about that.
You need to use a computer with a USB port to charge the speaker. I'm holding the charging cord, which looks to be a little over two feet long.
There should be a switch. I used it with a laptop so shouldn't be a problem with a phone.
Bought two of these drives, they were both new, shortened warranty period based on dated Mfg. date. These are very high quality enterprize drives and if they initually work they will last a very long time. Big advantage is they are not advanced format drives. They will work flawlessly with any operating system and run faster than advanced format drives.
It will work however you will not ce able connect the cable to the bottom of your Samsung. The swivel function is independent of phone.
Yes.
is this 1080p
Yes it can! The earpiece has 3 pivot points allowing it to go on either side with the boom still positioning naturally as well as the earpiece fitting properly in either ear.
Yes
Hi Andy, it depends which seller you are buying the headset through. We give a 1 year warranty on our refurbished headsets, but we are currently out of stock on this model.
Hi Chaz, yes this headset will work.
Yes, I use it on a mitel system, but its pretty generic honestly. I ignored the headphone jack and just ran it in-line with the headset cable. The base unit sits over the speaker for the ringer and that's what makes the headset ring in your ear. Though loud noises will trick the sensor to ring in your ear, but this is not a headset for loud locations
Yes, it does.
No. Mine came in its own carton. I did not order a lens.
Yes you can buy it!
Yes they do.
My K-30 came with a 55-300 lens and a 18-55 lens.
No
Yes, the Pentax Camera K30 comes with a card. The warranty is for one year,however, you must register the Camera on line at Pentax.com.
I have not used it with Windows 7 however when I used it on my Mac it definitely provides both Audio & Video
it might be in Battery Life Extender Mode
Here's the Samsung VGA dongle: http://www.samsung.com/us/computer/laptops-accessories/AA-AV2N12B/US-buy
Yes &lt;http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Series-900X3C-13-3-3517U/dp/B008FSERSK/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pdT1_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=VWQ6OTAL15V5&coliid=IGWGXSSQCYN02&gt;
Dont buy too many issues w plug i ve been though 2 of them already in 2 yrs the way they designed the power cord is a joke horrible
if it calls for an xdsc then that should be your card. I would say yes.
yes and the new generations of iPads
Yes, you need a back cover or case that has a wireless charging receiver. Or buy a wireless charging sticker that you can attach to the inside of your back cover. Must be PM compatible to use this charger and not Qi.
It will only work if there is a PMA compatible case for the the iPhone 5c. The case gives you the wireless charging.
Only if it has PMA charging instead of QI charging. This is a PMA charging mat only.
Yes, and yes. I have installed in my truck. You can have more then one and if you like bass you will need two. It's a good sub, but it doesn't hard really hard. I'm 46 yrs old, so I'm not trying to shatter glass, but even for me the bas was a little lite.
If you mean if it can fit, no! If you mean you can use one and set it close, yes!
It will only work if there is a PMA compatible case for the the iPhone 5c. The case gives you the wireless charging.
This projector did not come with a mount but should work with a universal mount.
I'm sorry but this cord is extremely low quality: huge delayed and poor sound. I tried it many times in different ways and it was just like that. So, it may work but you will be very disappointed. Try something a bit more expensive and it will worth. I bought the Behringer Guitar Link, and it's perfect -delayed wise, not much of good sound, but it's ok for me to practice at home.
Not under the supported systems. But most likely you will have to change to FAT32 in order to backup.
Yes, it will show up in your local explorer under network/router if you attach it to the router. works as just another drive if it is attached direct.
No. It's much larger. Somewhat larger than a paperback book. Also has AC adapter. So not really travel friendly.
Yes
I am out of state right now so unable to physically measure for you but i would say it is 8 inch deep. Based on the measurements of your camera, i think it will fit. I wish I could measure it for you to be exact. Maybe youtube has a review on it that can detail it for you ?! Hope I helped you. Happy Shooting :)
The compact fits a 6d with 24-105, barely. Had to go the bigger one for 70-300.
My Canon Sl1 (Dimensions (W x H x D) Approx. 4.60 x 3.57 x 2.74 in.1 / 116.8 x 90.7 x 69.4mm1 with Tamron 18-270 lens (3.5" l) fits perfectly with just enough room to lay a lens cloth over the LCD and fold the strap over the back of the camera. If the E30 plus the lens is much larger, it may not fit.
For sure it will fit.
Camera, neck strap, lens cover, kit lense, charger, USB cable, battery etc. great camera! Only thing not included to start taking pictures is the SD memory card! I recommend class 10, because this camera can record 1080p HD video and it's required.
Being a "DT" lens meaning the area of lens is designed for APSC, it can only be used in "crop" mode meaning the field of view will be APSC (~70%) of frame and the picture will be cropped to around 12 MP.
Hello, apparently this Sony Camera SLTA37 doesn't support camera control via computer or the tethered shooting feature. -Ely
Yes it is. Unequivocally. NO adapter needed.
I believe with all digital PENS. There used to be film Pens as well....
No, this lens is for micro Four Thirds (mirrorless) cameras. The Nikon mount is different and the mirror in your camera necessitates a large flange focal distance. Adapters would not work because this lens needs a short distance from mounting flange to the sensor.
Put it in laptop charge until full charge then use it without charger until laptop turns of due to complete discharge then plug in and charge for 8 hours. This will setup chip in the battery.
Brs is 4000mAh and Brm is 4800 mAh either will work.
Hello and thanks for contacting us. In relation to your question, Yes, this Headset work with Midland 75-822 Cb Radio. Thank You
Yes but it depends on the size of your ear
I have had pretty good luck using mag mount antennas mounted on something like a metal file cabinet or in fact even a pizza pan!
Yes, it can be wall-mounted and it will be a little over 4 inches from the wall where the handset is located.
No
As long as the phone has a micro USB cable, it should work.
The Phenom X4 is a socket AM2+ so it should work.
Works with power adapter
Quite honestly the only real way I can get this to really play good is via Bluetooth.
The enclosure is held together by a series of tongues and grooves,everything is snapped together. Spread the two larger sides apart starting from the back end using finger pressure.That's how mine opened.
Looks like a regular surveillance camera and can fool anyone who sees it. It hangs about 6 inches from ceiling and about the size of a soft ball, if that helps.
Yes it does play AVI, MP3, WMA, LPCM, FLAC, JPEG, DivX, MP4, and WMV. Hope this Helps
yes
Actually was used by my son who lost it without ever having used the video. He said the picture quality was great.
yes.
If you mean did not fit perfectly then you have the right one already. It worked on my t3i I just had to push it in pretty hard.
Im not sure what the difference is . I have the newest one and it works great. The only problem i had was reading the instructions, they ar written in broken English and don't make much sense. If you buy one and need help learning how to use it you can email me about it. Landrithjames54@gmail.com
Well I have recorded for 9 hours when I have needed it and to make sure I don't runout space I safe in my cp and then I clean the sd card and I use it again it works very good I have discover things that I didn't want ,if you need one it works nice.
warm air its exhasted by a top vent- on the top of the refrigerator unit-it can drain your battery if you turn off the motor of the vehichle
From the manual, "POWER REQUIREMENTS: 9.5 to 14.4 Volts DC, 4 Amperes @ 12 Volts DC Nominal. COOLING PERFORMANCE Cools from 38 F to 42 F below the average surrounding temperature. Empty cooler reaches minimum temperature in 3 hours."
yes, but if i were you i would not have them over 20 ft apart. i tried 40 ft and had problems staying on line the best thing is to run a cable. regard hosea
I don't think it would fit with a battery grip. I have nikon d800 no grip and with 70-200 lens and fits great and have space left. I love this bag.
We have used it for various presentation and the camera has worked great
Yes, it works with all Samsung phones.
Mine did. It comes with an IR remote and the ability to connect it to a computer monitor. It also comes with a mouse.
AFTER
There's no simple way to replace the battery. I see some screws that might be opened, but no idea what might be inside. For the price though... a typical lithium battery for a phone would cost you half what the whole keyboard does.
Yes, you can.
Hi, the player does both DVD and Blu-ray.
The TV has ethernet and can play music and video via AllShare Play. The Blu-ray player has ethernet, AllShare Play, and adds WiFi and apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Pandora just to name a few. So, between the TV and the Blu-ray you're pretty much covered as far as media and "smartness" goes. I don't think there's any need to have both a smart TV and a smart Blu-ray; one or the other is enough.
2
Haven't found a way to do this. I have tried long enough to say that it can't.
I've played avi and mkv by connecting my external hard drive to a usb port. They were played well but the subtitle integrated in my mkv files couldn't be read.
Video Electronics Standards Association
Yes it will I have the same bag actually the same color for my mac
I totally can! If you want a notebook to carry too it might be a little tight but my charger and wires go in the pocket adjacent to where my lap top goes. I love this product especially for the price! Hope this helps!
It folds over and is attached by a very good snap to hold and allow the tablet to rotate. The cover has a magnet inside to keep it secure. One end is thicker than the other so if you have small hands you may have a harder time holding it. It fits in my back pocket. Just don't sit down.
It does have GPS capability. I've used it in Antarctica. Can be turned on and off in settings/location services.
Yes...it has an ethernet hookup in the back. EXTERNAL PORTS * Front panel 15-in-1 memory card reader: Supports SmartMedia, xD, MultiMedia Card, Secure Digital (SD, SDHC), Mini Secure Digital, Compact Flash I, Compact Flash II, IBM Microdrive, Memory Stick, Memory Stick Pro, Memory Stick Duo, Memory Stick Pro Duo, RSMMC, MMC Mobile, MMC+ * Headphone and Microphone (Front) * 4 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0 ports (Back) * 2 USB 3.0 ports (Front) * Optical Audio Out; LAN; Microphone/Line-in/Line-out; Rear speaker-out; Side speaker out; Center (subwoofer) * 10/100/1000Mbps (Gigabit) Ethernet Support (Back)
it is a loop recorder, once the memory is full it will start recording over from the beginning
Both cameras are built in, you can see it on the picture - rearview is on the right side from the screen
No
Fast Start is a software mechanism from Samsung, so as long as the software is compatable, it should (in theory) still work with Windows 8. It WILL NOT work with Windows RT. Hope this helps!
I used it for iPhone 4S, no problem. I had an older unit so I am not sure if it is compatible. I would be surprised if it wasn't because it handled all the iPhone, iPod and iPod touches that I put in it. Never had any problem.
yes
Yes, it charges fine in the CB-2LC Canon charger and since it is 1800 mAh it you can take more pictures between charges. They are great batteries.
There is no separate velcro closure designed for such attachment. However as you can see from the photo it does have a velcro closure. You could simply close the case and run you belt or camera strap through the entire case. Better to put it in a vest pocket.
Not sure. I use it for my 72mm filters and it works well. Might be tight for your 82mm filters.
The T5 is a great unit. It gets better signal than the T4
Mine is 2014 work fine not sure if there is any change in the system. Find out from Mazda customer service and if there is any change then would work.
Hello. unfortunately the maps will not work since they are programmed for the U.S. the unit will work, but the maps wont.
Hi, So it is a European Mazda vehicle and you have the European SD card that you bought from Tom Tom. We sold a couple and that is what they did. This comes with an SD card for North America Mazda vehicles ONLY, and it did work. I would love to sell this to you, but I am not 100% since I am not sure if the SD card you have is compatible. My advise is, send an inquiry to TOM TOM if your SD card is compatible with this unit (KJY2-79-EZXB). THANKS, JEF
Made in China
No it wont work.
well its fits what it looks like i took a chance and it was not close to fitting my radio, i would not gamble on it
Physically it fit but I could not get reception after install... don't know if it was the radio or antenna. Sorry, all i know
yes 2.0 and 3.0
I am not sure. Best bet is to contact the manufacturer for correct answers
Unlikely, pick up the 650 Ti boost or something better IMO
No ... the dimension 3000 does not have a PCI-e slot
I would think so but here's a little advice. When making your purchase make sure that you ask about the refund policy. If going into a store to purchase it again, check their refund policy, bring your camera with you and try it right there, and don't go to one of those electronic places that only give a store credit. Hope that helps.
Nope but is a real good product
No
Not that I've found. Sorry.
Yes, I have been using this lens with the BMPCC and it is an excellent choice. It does work with the focus and iris buttons. With this camera, you have to push the focus button if you don't want to manually focus, it does not have continuous autofocus with any lens. The image stabilization is excellent.
Nope. The lens is clear.
Yes. Orange. Green. Tan. Silver. Yellow. Black.
The input range printed on the adapters is 100-240 VAC 50/60 Hz 0.5A Max, The output is listed as 5.0 VDC 2A. But really, do yourself a favor and don't buy this if you're looking for something that needs to last longer than 6 months. This system is poorly designed. Monoprice did eventually replace mine after I threatened to leave bad reviews all over the internet but the replacement lasted only 6 months or so before failing again. I just recently replaced the entire system with Redmere HDMI cables and a 1x8 HDMI splitter all bought on Amazon.
I don't think so, but then I could be wrong
Yes, although it is not shown, this notebook power adapter also comes with a 2 prong power cable/cord that goes between the "brick" and the wall outlet.
No
There has not been a problem with my iTunes and this drive. I migrated my iTunes to this drive, there was a duplication problem for about a week, and I resolved it by removing the old drive from the computer--problem went away.
No it is not. They do make a FireWire version however
Yes, this card requires an open PCIe X16 slot. As long as they are following IEEE standards (which if they were not, nothing would work for this motherboard), it should be fine.
Ive never had an issue with these cards, but I don't have temp analysis. We use these in business machines, not for gaming so we never have the need to monitor the temp.
HDMI carries both signals - it will plug into a HDMI monitor and work for both audio and video. IT may work for a TV with an HDMI input
Max Analog : 2048x1536 Max Digital : 2560x1600 (Dual Link DVI Only). see all specs here: http://www.evga.com/Products/Product.aspx?pn=02G-P3-2619-KR
I would recommend getting a different brand this one had massive compatibility issues.
Very likely, yes. It is PCIe 2.1, but PCIe is backwards compatible with 1.1 and 1.0 slots. This is a fairly low-power card as well. I've actually cut half the pins off and plugged it into an X8 slot and it still works perfectly for my needs. This card also comes with a low-profile bracket if you need that.
from what can see Warlords of Draenor is just a wow expansion so wow would be the determining syt req if this card works on wow then it should work i dont play wow sorry but i do run skyrim ok with this card
Sorry. We are a reseller and don't actually own this item.
sorry I do not know
Yes it will work with a tri-pod it has a standard camera adapter nut on the bottom built in
I have a small piece of Velcro on it. The total weight with the velcro is .52 oz or 14.xx grams. I used mine on quad copters.
Yes!
Yes it can I use it for my iphone
Yes it does both are wired
No, this computer does not have a dial-up modem. I connect to the internet with a wireless connection.
Call the Dell help line. Your warranty, unless you bought a separate one would be covered by dell if your system is still under warranty.
I purchased a Dell i660 and it does come with a DVD drive, which is also compatible with CD's. I am very happy with it.
Actual dimensions in inches are 14.8L, 3.9W and 10.7H
There should be no issues - this is backward compatible with USB2.0.
Yes.I have been using Wasabi for 5-6 years,never had a problem with them.
Yes, you can charge them in your Olympus charger, but don't charge your Olympus batteries in the Wasabi Power charger. Yes, they'll fit the OM-D E-M1.
If you mean to they last much less long in camera use than original Fuji battery, yes they do. If you mean do they hold their charge unused for as long as an original Fuji battery, they seem to. They are a good value for what they are and the charger that comes with them. But they are not the best if you are looking for a replacement battery that will go as long as the original Fuji. But while your Fuji battery is charging you can be using two of these.
Hi Peter, You are correct this kit is an FBA item. I just checked and the add to cart buy box does show that it is available from Amazon Prime. Kind regards, Terry 877-268-1235 x304
My wife play Fiesta ,Terra , LoL and my daughter play minecraft without any problem and the quality for teh graphics are awesome.
Yes
yes it does
Sorry I don't have an answer for you, the drive is for a Drobo Raid and it's not something that concerned me when I made the purchase. It was however physically an exact match to the Older drive it replaced, I hope that helps.
No. I don't think it is. I believe the only router I found that is was an Asus.
yes works fine with the drivers that comes with the device. i'm running windows 8.1 and tested on windows 8 as well :)
Yes you can...but any class 10 SD card you get will be worth more than this camera, so what's the point?
350
No reason why it shouldn't. India has the same socket.
These adapters only change the plugs... if the device is dual voltage (many, but not all, are) then all you need is the adapter. If your device is only 110-120 V, then you need a voltage converter....
Yes
I think it will, cause it fits s3 models
Not sure. my Acer is a S3
It is quiet, but I would suggest buying another cooling unit as this one is under powered.
Yes
As far as I can figure out the cord is simply to charge it w your computer. You have to add your own cord to charge your iPhone.
Yes, a bridge is required for this camera.
If you get 30Mbps to your wireless router, you will get approximately half that using the range extender. In my case, the half speed through the extender is rarely noticeable (only when playing some games).
Sorry but no, this unit will only connect to the network via a wireless connection. The LAN ports on the unit are access ports for clients not network ports.
Sorry but no, this unit only connects to a WIFI network not through an Ethernet connection. For Ethernet connections you need an access point like the AP20000G.
Yes it does, but it's pretty slow when saving games compared to my 8GB card. If you don't mind waiting sometimes 10 or 15 seconds to save a game, works great!
25, the system is only good for a small room. The base distorts.
The red and white should connect thru the tv's red and white "audio out" ports.
yes, you can use the extender for the speaker. I purchase the digital optical coax to analog RCA audio converter adapter

Neither, that is the skimmer your referring to in the 83/200 and 50/200. This one is 455khz
No, this is a DDR3 memory mid-2009 MacBook uses DDR2 @ 800mhz memory Ram so it won't fit in the physical space. Look for a DDR2 memory or you can open the laptop and check for the memory and buy an identical one. http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1651#link3
According to the FAQ on their site, its coverage only contains Canada, USA, and Mexico http://www.amberalertgps.com/faq/?cat=device
I had the same requirement. I bought a cable that had a 3.5 mm male connector on each end, and a copy of audio capture software. I bought the cable from CyberGuys. The software is called "MP3 Audio Recorder. Here's the website: http://www.mp3audiorecorder.com/ . Good luck. -Les
It fits perfectly with my lap top, the color is exactly what I was expecting.
It's basically the entire screen the black borders are actually small only about and inch thick.
Between the 2 USB ports is a micro connector that plugs into the external battery with a USB connector on the other end . You just plug that into any USB port and charge the external battery. Easy !
What actually chargers the device is a Mini-USB cable. Though if your looking for what it comes with, with the adapters, then this is what you need: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0034JKJ6Y/ref=s9_simh_gw_p422_d0_i6?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER
I believe it would! I got it for my MacBook Air 11-inch
I think so but I bought it for my samsung late tablet
It's a tight fit on my acer aspire one 11". So to be honest most likely no.
the instructions are in English and it worked fine for a day. I however..didn't use the included software as I have other software on my MAC that does the same thing. The advantage is the USB connection. The player is of very low quality and the pitch started to vary within a couple of days of use
NO
No, this the keyboard layout of the chromebook is different than this keyboard cover, several of the keys have different functions.
It will work on its own you do not have to use the internet or network access
This tv has a 3.5 input for the speakers which is very common. We feel the built in speaker is fine, but sometimes we'll plug in the speakers that we use on the i-phone. Hope that helps.
Yes, it's in the back. Almost dead center. Not very convenient.
That's a strange question, hdmi connector is one big head. But for analog, have you tried the head phone jack up top for audio out?
Mine came with a stand.
Yes it does. There are 2 speakers, one on either side of the stand. They point down, which could contribute to the poor found quality. I would like to update my original response too. I have since gotten into the sound settings. The tv offers preset options labeled dynamic, user, soft, etc. You can go deeper into those settings, however and adjust the bass, treble, and balance. Once I boosted the bass to 15 and brought the treble down low, it is so much better. I actually am enjoying it now.
I have not experienced this problem with my TV. My TV is plugged in all the time and comes on/off each time I press the power button.
yes, 120 minutes
Need to get one
Go to 52 or S2 and it will go with the music. we love our magic ball! best thing i ever bought!
It has to be unplugged
The lights rotate back and forth
Never tried it don't know , Maybe with a spliteryou could use a splitter
Did you push in the cable all the way in?
I believe they would work in the Ps4 because i can connect other headphones in and they work but unsure about xbox one. I think the older systems wouldn't work with this headset.
5-37,000 hz
Yes!! These puppies are SO light I look for them all over before realizing they're IN my ears! Sweat proof. Good over equip too--treadmill drone doesn't interfere with listening.
I dont know my friend, Im use wiht my IPod classic 160 GB. Good luck.
That means the battery is low on battery, if is connected to the charger then it means still needs charge, once is full charged the battery light will be solid. The bottom light is the GSM indicator and the top light is the GPS. Once the device is activated, you should see the bottom and top light blinking.
My battery also only lasts about 2 hours, before it needs to be charged.
No
It doesn't include a mount itself but you can use one (not sure of the actual measurements, sorry).
Yes
Yes, according to the manual. I never used it but the manual says it supports MP3, WMA AAC, FLAC and WAV. It does not support files encoded using WMA lossless, WMA voice, WMA 10 Professional nor files of any format which have DRM protection. Nice radio...
yes
Don't think that's possible since it's one piece. I suggest you buy two ...One for a spare for when you lose or wash one. Good luck.
Honestly, I don't know. My guess is - yes it will. It is supposed to work with any phone that has bluetooth. If you want to know for sure, you'll probably have to contact Motorola.
Hello Arthur, I do not use this Bluetooth Music Adapter with AVR. I used this device as BT (Bluetooth) transmitter so I can listen to music in my PC with my BT stereo headset. Just simple connect this device to headset output from PC. This device is also a BT receiver, you can use it to receive from your BT devices (Iphone, smart phone ....) you will need a Y wire connecter to connect to L/R audio input of your AVR. I did not try this configuration yet. Hope this help. John N.
Yes it is suppose to come with a plug for the wall outlet and for the phone jack
I bought this product and it did not work and when I tried to return it, I never got a response.
I never figured it out. I bought two. They really disappoint me. Even though I use cable to connect to the computer, there is noise. And the sound quality is not good. I don't even want to try for that blue tooth.
They should work fine. The viewsonic pjd5134 is only 120hz but these glasses are supposed to be compatible with 120hz and 144hz. The viewsonic works with an Irish signal same as these glasses so you shouldn't have any problems with these glasses at all
yes, I believe it will. The device attaches to the circular ring on the back of the stand. I am pretty sure that the ring is the same size as the 21in'' which is what I have.
The cable is made of carbon-strengthened steel. I'm sure there may be some bolt-cutter out there that could do the job, but not your ordinary bolt-cutter. I can't think of a safer solution other than locking your iMac up in a safe.
Something must be wrong with your unit. Mine chimes as it is supposed to. If it works only sometimes, then the unit must be malfunctioning. My guess would be a loose wire or moisture in the unit. I'm just guessing though.
Yes, it can suppot the second monitor.
This unit is made in China
No.
At the time of writing this, I have 5 of these cameras and it's only on iPhone/iPad.
Connect it to your Dropbox account if you have not. There you can see the videos. FYI it takes pictures @ videos
Yes.. came with simple directions to connect to home WiFi
Mario, I don't know what 'survival protection' is. I have a Pong case on my iPad 2 that almost doubles the thickness of the unit and the Ram Mount X-Grip fits and holds securely while traveling in my motorhome. Order it, if you are not satisfied, return it to Amazon for a refund.
I have an ipad air it works great. Yes I am sure it will work with all ipads due to the adjustability of the unit.
It probably will, but not absolutely certain. The statement on the Lenovo support site for this battery is "Compatible with T410/20/30, T510/20/30, W510/20/30, L410/12/20/21/30, L510/12/20/30" and you don't see "SL410" in that list. However, it appears that Lenovo often uses the same documentation for the L410 and the SL410. I don't know what the difference is between these two models, if any. Dig deeper into "support.lenovo.com" or take your chances and be ready to return to Amazon if it doesn't fit.
Mine stopped working 5 days sfter we got it. Snd had not worked sence
not a lot of noise, really do not notice when gaming.
Check the Lenovo website. They have all the listings for fit.
We are selling brand new, retail sealed Lenovo batteries. They are not our own/generic packaging.
We always keep the spare battery on a charger just to be safe since we are a medical practice. I purchased the battery charger from Amazon as well.
Sorry, we don't ship internationally.
Mine was. But your mileage will vary from supplier to supplier.
The load capacity on the head is 11 lbs. It's a very robust head but it is small and you may find the controls difficult to use if the camera is large. It should work fine with a 7 lb. camera and lens.
I have a Oben ACM-2400 monopod and it fits. Since it comes with a 3/8"-1/4" mounting threads, it should fit any Oben especially since it is the same product line.
Yes.
Hello, I'm not sure about the last digits, but I have one in my ThinkPad Edge 14, seems to do ok...think I've had it just over a year...and it still holds its charge, obviously not as long as in the beginning. I'm glad I got it. Hope that helps a bit. :)
It doesn't fit mine!
If you have internet connection and you download the text application from the app. store then the answer is yes you can text.
At least 4 hours
Not likely due to overall thickness. Most ultralights are still thicker than a MacBook Air
Yes, the n5550 will take up to 5 - 4TB drives.
In korea, it is not warranted.
No
No. H uma semana estou na luta tentando fazer o 3D funcionar aps atualizar para o Windows 8 Pro, mas sem sucesso at o momento.
not sure if it is a gaming laptop or not, the computer itself is good, design is very poor, hinges broke after 15 months for the second time , after being repaired one time, don't waste your money
Does not extend far enough for comfortably accessing it to play games for long trips
Yes
very small hand held item. 2.0 usb. with all the attachments that come with this recorder, it is well worth the money. i have really enjoyed using this and you can take it any and everywhere. recording sound is super great.
Excellent recorder but connecting it to the computer well the file is a different format, we had bout 2 one worked and one didn't we sent them both back....personally didn't like it....spend the money and get a good one....
si funciona pero con camaras de necesitan 1 amp no funciona pero de 0,5 amp si funciona
Because it, your camera, or you are broken
No it did not. It comes with a power cord or you can put batteries in it. Its cheap but decent product. I've had it for 6 months now and it works perfect.
16 mb
The USB port only plays music (I believe in mp3 format) and pictures (in jpg). Movies don't work, unfortunately.
No, this is not a smart TV, I watch Netflix though my Play station, great image quality!
no-just a good attenna
Sounds like the seller doesn't answer questions or really care.
This system has 4 Slots total, 2 Slots will be filled with memory.
Yes, it does.
I'm almost positive you would need a converter.
Yes.
It comes with one USB cord. That USB cord works to charge it and then by reversing direction, to charge other items. The connector works with any mini-USB connector--so most Android phones with the standard mini-USB connection. For other connection types, you need to bring your own USB connector. That includes iPhones.
It DOES fit the iphone 6! I use it every day.
Yes it works
Yes it fits. It's a bit difficult to get on though.
DB52 variant only ships with a 128GB SSD. The difference between the DB52 and DB51 is the fact that DB52 ships with a TPM - great for enterprise laptop users but really unnecessary for every day users. There is a chart out there that we can use for reference but it's hosted on another e-tailer website. Think of King Arthur's sword+PC...dot com. EDIT: DB52 also comes with Windows 7 Professional
The drive is a SATA III SSD drive and as such has no moving parts to spin.
I have searched for one. I've confirmed that neither Targus nor Duracell have support for it yet.
Our Naxa CD player only played for 1 night before stopping completely! DO NOT BUY!!
Speaker box is 9' x 5'(rectangular) and actual speaker output are (circle)a is 5'
Buy a receiver and hook up external speakers to the receiver. Only way you will get a decent sound out of this unit. I have a similar problem and after much debate, I am planning to buy Sherwood RX-41 9 105WAat model to augument this stereo system. Good Luck.
When it comes to any piece of audio equipment. You get what you pay for. This thing works great if your sitting around a campfire and you want some music for 10 people max and they better not be loud people at that. But for the price and what I use it for Id suggest it but if you want good sound you have to fork out the money.
In the past, the two-year protection plan has been for a couple of Kindles. However, the current one has yet to be used; therefore, I cannot say it is good or bad?
Here is a (*.pdf) of the Terms & Conditions for the Protection Plan . . . . ( http://www.protection-plans.com/static/terms/extensiondvdtoys.pdf )
Gail, I am not sure. You will have to contact Amazon directly for that info. I am sorry that I cannot help you
As "Arnie" answered in my question(very similar to yours), I guess this might be helpful: "There are limitations to the coverage. Clause 9 states: "This Contract Does Not Cover:" A. Any product located outside the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii." So, I would have to say no, it would not be covered."
It would have a manufacturer warranty of most likely a year. I am not positive of the length of the warranty. But it does have one. It is a great card.
The manufacturer of this item is "Cable To Go". It's a 3-meter (3M) cable. You maybe looking at different item.
Read up before you buy. Mine was not compatible.
No it is not.... As a matter of fact it does not work.
We do not have this player you are referring to.
7
Yes, backlit keyboard indeed.
Yes, it can use ASIO, WAV or WAVRT. I use Mixcraft with a Lexicon Alpha USB Interface
I heard logic pro was pretty good, i was initially trying to purchase it; but they don't make it for my computer. Mixcraft was recommended by a friend of mine.

802.3af and 802.3at PoE devices have internal voltage regulators. They may require 12v when using a DC power adapter. But, if they're powered using a PoE switch or mid-span PoE injector, they recieve a higher voltage (usually 48v) on the Category cable, then step the voltage down internally to whatever is needed. 802.3xx PoE technology allows each device manufacturer to design their equipment as they need, simply taking the "bus" voltage then dropping it using an internal voltage regulator. The supply side of the circuit sends a constant voltage, independent of the component or its needs.
it will give you 60watts - 8 cameras x 7.5watts = 60watts.. should work - if its this camera - DS-2CD2032-I 3MP IR Bullet Network Camera - hikvision shows max 7watts with ir, so the WS-POE-8-48v60w should be good
If it has the 30 pin (wide) connector. Yes
Works great for the 4S, but does not work for gen 2 ipad
bought a program from dvd fab and is working right. try it.
no. It's powered thru the PCIExpress slot on the mother board. Just pop it in and you are good to go.
Yes
Mine came with a little microphone that connects through the back of the head unit through an auxiliary jack
2x230mm fans located on the top to exhaust hot air. 2x140mm fans located at the bottom to take in cool air. 2x120mm fan located on side panel for cooling HDD. 1x120mm fan locate in the rear to exhaust the hot air. Hope this helps...
I have not used this in an XP system but it should work fine as it's a basic optical disc. No special drivers needed. Just plug and play.
Pretty sure it is. As I understand it, it's the same as the "Plugable" one and that one is shared ports according to its specs.
Plug and play. Had no issues.
Yes - it works on all emount cameras. But it doesn't support any auto features.
Yes, I use it on mine. It will fit in any Sony camera with an e-mount
This device sends a Bluetooth signal. The unit receiving the signal needs to have capability to receive the Bluetooth output from this device.
Lori, I haven't tried this before for I use the wireless speaker when I have my phone playing music. The only time I have had issues is when the speaker is in one place and my phone is in my pocket and I am moving all around my house. With that being said, I don't think you would have any issues with 35ft. Keep in mind if you have any type of wiring within the walls, that may cause some interference. Hope this helps!
Mine works with 500gb HDD USB 2
it works for my asus Me400c, both Flash Disk and external hard drive(usb2.0), mouse as well.
look here http://www.actiontec.com/products/faqs.php?pid=265#q0
I'm not sure what kind of adapter you're looking for but you should take a look at this site for a large assortment of cables and devices that might have what you need. http://www.monoprice.com/
No you dont
Hi Chris, Thank your for your interest. Normally the delivery takes 7-10 business days. So, yes, sure you will receive before February
We have a 42 inch cover which will fit a 39 inch flat screen.
yes
Well, I'm not sure I know how to answer this. Are you talking about being inside the McDonald's or being in your car? I use it in a classroom to be heard over students and it does that job very well. I'm not sure about the other. It is a good amplifier.
Think when I asked they said "No" but not entirely sure.
800
Yep, its basic USB mouse will work fine.
It feels slightly spongey and it makes a tiny little "rattley" noise, but it doesn't bother me. It is NOT an aggressive click click, but it is not absolutely silen.
yes of corse.
Yes
No
No Sir, these all connector are all different with Apple connectors.
Yes
Yes, I have carried this on with Southwest and United.
this unit is not controlled by a HAI system. I is a stand alone system, but has a remote that will let you control it completely. It can be down loaded play list by a account you setup on internet. It can play list of music on your pc's play list. I was looking for my manual but, no find yet ! If power is removed, the unit will not return last state, it go's to reset. I hope this helps you ! http://www.manualslib.com/ has the manuals
Hi, Yes it comes with both. Regards Frank
yes, we have ours fixed so we can watch it from the kitchen, or turn it 180 degrees towards the breakfast room. You can also turn it up/down as needed. Tilts various positions........
Single.
Yes this will work all u have to do is a restore. If that doesn't work just save all data on usb drive. Then transfer data. That's what I had to do because I had 1 corrupt file so it wouldn't restore but saving on the usb worked
Yes, it should if it has a SATA connection.
Hi yes it can, now a days mostly all modern 2.5 inch drives are compatible with modern day laptops like the Msi GE60-2OE,The answer is yes it will fit.
I have the pj 260 and this battery works, the cx160 lists the same stock battery as the 260 so it should work fine. Check the specs on both cameras, the stock battery is listed
The maxiumum RAM that the motherboard can hold is 32GBs. Currently installed is 2x 4GB sticks. There are 4 total slots available with 2 currently in use.
It should connect to the wi-fi u currently have in your home, I had no problem hooking mine up. Try to reset your wi-fi then try again. If you can't get it contact the seller, they are great to deal with.
Yes it does and it is very stable. Much better than the one that came with the GPS from the factory.
Don't waste your money on these things I bought one and used it on a Motorola radio and only one side would work i would not waste time on it
Thank you for your inquiry. Unfortunately we don't carry any lens. And we don't recommend buyers changing the lens on their own as any modifications to the camera unit will automatically void its warranty.
thank you for your inquiry. This camera bundle kit doesn't come with DVR; please visit our 4 channel DVR at: http://www.amazon.com/GW-Security-Professional-Channel-Realtime/dp/B00DJF77FY/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1382852674&sr=8-7&keywords=9704h Please note that the DVR doesn't come with a hard drive; you may add a hard drive for the following prices: -500G (2 weeks recording) $99 -1000G (4 weeks recording) $139 -2000G (8 weeks recording) $199
No, you have buy an adapter, the newer model may have bluetooth built in.
As long as the LG TV has HDMI or Component input, yes.
Yes
I have not used it n a heavy downpour. I've been in light rain situations and had no problems. The plugs all fit snugly. I'd be comfortable saying water resistant more than waterproof. That said, I've had mine (two units) nearly a year and have been very happy with the units.
Haven't tried 2 cellphones at the same time, but you can have a cellphone and an iPod in use at the same time. I do it with my IPhone 5 and my old 2nd gen iPod. The battery lasts longer on the iPod for music and I don't drain my phone. Although, I have learned that the battery on the headset only lasts for 4 hours of consistent play. Found that out on a trip from Houston TX to Albany GA
Yes it's very slim it's flat speakers and wires.
I'm not really certain if it will work with that set, but I don't see why it wouldn't. The setup is very easy and straightforward and you should not need anything other than a wifi connection.
No, I tried buying a wireless LAN adapter first but it didn't work for me so I had to buy Panasonic's. The packaging on my home theater was deceptive & their customer service was completely incompetent - they lost a customer. I hope you have better luck...
I also would like to know this
I don't have mine screwed in and it works perfectly fine.
I think it's too bulky for that. I like the idea but not sure it will work for that purpose.
Have you tried changing the ear cushions to see if one set works better than the other two?
It works with any IR device, just need to place the receiver in front of your device and transmitter on the location were you operate the remote.
Yes. I have the 15 inch macbook pro without retina display and I love this case. I also have a speck hardshell protective case on my macbook, and even with that it still fits in this case. :)
New
No app.
yes, i bought this not to long ago, it works fine with mine.
4cameras, 4 mounting brackets ( shown on cameras), power supply with a 4-plug pigtail to power all 4 cameras, and 4 50-ft lengths of cable.
This is a stand alone device. It does not connect to a computer. The D-link requires that you sing-in to the chosen service ie hulu, netflix and stream from there.
Yes. When you open Netflix, it will show all of your profiles.
Yes
Using RCA jacks, simply plug in the red and white males into the TV's "Audio Out" females in the rear of the TV, not in the side panel where you hook up gaming devices, etc. I then figured out through trial and error how to kill the internal speakers (look through the set-up menu from the ProScan remote and see if there's an audio control there). It may be as simple as moving the TV's volume to zero then only use the aftermarket sound systems volume controller. Good luck.
Yes, I believe so, as long as apple did not change to a front loading disk drive. I don't have the MacBook Pro, but my 13 inch Macbook fits perfectly. I get complements on my case all of the time.
Made to look like leather. Its very convenient and I get lots of compliments with it but its definitely fake
Yes I'm using that combination right now. You'll just need to pair it after plugging it in.
Yes it does. That's my model as well. It doesn't slip off or slide around. It makes it look like a huge iPad case. I love mine but the only issue is the magnetic closure tab. Basic wear and tear from folding. So just be aware of that.
More than likely you'll need the kit
I would use go to crutchfield or another online retailer who will tell you what fits your vehicle.
Yes It Will
I have no idea whatsoever. I only bought one, I don't make them! By the way, mine is probably the original model but it's absolutely brilliant!
It's made for an external flash only. I'm sure you could probably rig it to your camera.
i am having the same problem! i knew i should've stuck with apple.
Yes, it has Wi-Fi under the parental control set-up. You can chose to leave it off or turn it on and it will search automatically for any device that is near it with Wi=Fi. Once you see your device click on it and then it will ask you for the Wi-Fi Key.
Hi Decha, Minimum focus distance for the Sony RX100 is rated at 5cm (2 inches). Hope this helps! Keep shooting ~ zkot
Short version.... bigger sensor on the rx100 (better picture quality) versus faster/wider lenses on the lx7 (better low light performance and a more versatile zoom). Both are great cameras, if budget is not a problem go with the rx100. If you go otherwise with the lx7 you will get better Low light performance and a more versatile lenses for your money. Never the less... both are awesome cameras.
the power button is the ok button
Yes, provided you have flashed the TP-WDR4300 firmware from it's stock version (1.7 is the most current) to the appropriate corresponding DD-WRT bin file (firmware). Make certain to refer the DD-WRT build and it matches exactly to the boiler plate version label on the router. This router does support DNSmsq, with that you will need to write a script "hosts" file. No need to to go back to each individual computer. This should block unwanted ads from any specific site. Reseacrh DD-WRT, OPENwrt, Tomato and etc...Good Luck.
7 inches
2 years limited warranty. Advanced replacement service is available.
I don't know
Yes.
I would definitely think so, as long as they are wifi enabled and you are planning on having an active SIM card and data plan
Yes
NO and it is a very bad investment. Within one month the mouse pad stopped working, then about 5 months later the keyboard stopped working. I cannot give a good review but I hope this helps!
Not without another piece that it don't have I don't have
Yes to your questions. I've used mine on many occasions without a problem and downloaded the conversation via USB to my computer.
Yes. I use it to record conference calls from the speaker of the computer and works like a charm.
Amazon sometimes has incorrect specs. Thin + Light does not have a SD slot nor does it come with a backlit keyboard
You need an external DVD/CD player/writer. I happened to have one which does LightScribe, so I was okay. I did not check close enough in the specs to notice it did not come with the DVD/CD Writer.
Yes, it did -- they were about the same quality as the player. . . .
The Screen Protectors are very clear. Zagg has not impressed me personally. In my books Tech Armor is better.
Yes
It fit mine. Works great.
Yes if you turn off the sonr app then it will be external speakers.
I use Widows 7 and the WD hard drive works great. No issues what so ever!
yes. it works fine
Yes if one is HDMI.
I think it only reads jpg files as far as images go. I just used Microsoft publisher to reconfigure all my images to jpg files.
are you talking about using your wifi for your blu-ray and your tv.i don't see why not.i run 2 roku and a computer off of my wifi.the tv channel wifi and the blu-ray should come through on different channels.
The wireless never worked on mine so I couldn't get Netflix. I returned it.
I belive that it can. I would check the manufactures website on that model to make sure.
Yes
It will not. It will work for Sirius stratus 6 and 7
MS Office is pre-installed but you need to activate and costs you--also it has MS Windows 2010, but upgrades to MS Windows 2013. I did not get mine with OS CD. I am not sure if it upgrades to Windoe.
Yes, it has a bright green light on the top. In the picture, you can see a green thing along the top. This is the light. You could try putting some kind of tape over it to black it out.
It's 3.75" W x 5" H (standard wall plate is about 3" W x 4.5" H)
NO it will NOT fit the T100. Hopes this helps you out.
I would say the text is wrong unless the box is an older version
up to 75Wno additional PCIe power required
It did for our Dell XPS.
Linux mint 15
sorry, I didn't answer sooner, but it is powered by an electric cord or you can use 6 "C" size batteries. I bought it mainly for the cassette player. The CD, Radio and Cassette player all work fine for the price. It has good sound but not fantastic. Jensen is a good reliable company and I am very happy with this product. I hope this helps you.
Sorry but I'm not sure. They do work great with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and my son's Samsung Galaxy S3.
Yes
the one I got did not come with any cables. I bought a 50' HDMI cabe seperatly.
The anchors pivot and it is very accessible for many projectors. After fidgeting with the mount I was eventually able to get it to fit correctly. It works great and is really easy to maneuver!
Yes, it's a great lens on the SL1. It also serves well as a head and shoulders portrait lens, but consider an EF-S 60mm for head shots. Google Shawn Barnett + Canon SL1 for my review on Dpreview, and Canon 40mm + Shawn Barnett for my review of the lens on imaging resource, with lots of sample photos, including portraits.
The focus noise is normal. To avoid it you need to get the newer generation of Canon STM lens. For example the newer 18-55 STM and 18-135 STM have replaced the non STM versions of these lens. These will focus silently.
The new STM lens is an inch shorter and adds a zoom lock and instant manual-focus override to the older 18-135mm EF-S IS lens, however manual focus is electronic. The focus ring isn't connected to anything, and there is a tiny time delay between when you move the ring and the lens moving. Another huge improvement from the older 18-135mm EF-S IS is that the zoom range from 24mm to 18mm has been spread-out on the zoom ring, so it's much easier to set precise wide-angle framing. On the old lens, it was very cramped at the wide end.
I love my camera! I've never really used it for that type of pics, but for me it does great. I took some pics of my brothers wedding, Kind of an indoor outdoor setting & I'd did great both ways. I think you'll really like it.
Plug modem into WAN port, your computer into LAN port, open your browser and type 192.168.1.1 in the address bar. Enter default user name and password (you will need to find online). Being refurbished, it may be possible that the default UN and password had been changed and not reset (I had that with some different refurb units I bought elsewhere). If that's the case use the reset button on the back of the router. Go through on screen tabs to make the adjustments you need.
Only if you connect it using the WAN. This router does not have a coax port.
Try manual zoom instead. When using the automatic function, you're probably just hearing the mechanization. If you don't like manual zoom, try setting up an alternate sound capture device/location closer to your target, or remove some of that noise via a background sound reaction feature in your editing software.
Yes, works well with all Blu-ray players so far,
I saw somewhere, think the Delorme site, where you can download 2013. Didn't see if you could with 2014 though, I am looking for that answer.
The bracket that screws to the tv can slide up or down a small amount which will allow the tv to tilt downward. Unfortunately the tilt is not great. I did not have to loosen anything.
I think it would be ok. Mine are mounted about 10" down from the ceiling and it is just perfect to watch tv sitting up or laying in bed.
You can order the same item from Amazon.ca
Hi, I have a 22" tv on mine...I just tried that out and yes you can, the arms extend to the fullest and I was able to turn the tv 90 degrees. However because of the cables attached to the tv, it swiveled back to its original position. If your cables don't get in the way you won't have this problem.
Mine is at my business and NEVER gets turned off. No problems at all
no,it just splits and strips 1 to 2 all day long :)
haven't installed it yet, headed to michigan in may. will post how it works
This lnb works ok and has a good performance
Designed to connect to existing wifi router and extend wifi range. There is no need to connect to router with Ethernet cable. Connect to computer with Ethernet cable away from router and follow the installation instructions to setup the wifi connection to your existing wifi router.
I don't know. If you cannot get the specs on it then the only way is to get it and try it out.
No zoom, simply 3.6 wide angle camera does work well day and night. Decent image quality As usual amazon has them up for a good price I use 8 of these type in my home system
Prob. But it's junk...I have one and my stations come in whenever they want..the scree does not go in or out anymore..i had it professionally installed ..I wouldn't pay the money for it again..
By remote phones if you mean multiple telephones connected to a land line within your home, yes, it still allows caller ID to be displayed on them. But once a number is blocked, they will never ring so you won't be bothered with having to look at the caller ID to see who it is.
I should think so
Hi SuperNova23, Part number KVR16N11/8 is compatible and recommended for the Gigabyte GA-970A-UD3P Motherboard. Thank you for choosing Kingston as your upgrade partner! -Jewel, Kingston US Technical Support
That shouldn't be necessary. If you had read through all of the reviews, it's been stated a few times, that the older power supply- which people were having problems with- has been replaced in this build.
Yes, I have this pc and there are lots of open bays to install a SSD or HDD.
hi, I must be a not good configuration of Windows because it should not do that, I suggest going to power setting and click Restore Default let me know anything else
No it is way to big to fit any laptop and I'm pretty sure no laptop has the right connections for it to use.
If your computer has a pci express slot and windows OS. It will work.
I cannot answer for a Dell Machine. I used it on an MSI motherboard in a MSI case that I put together for myself. You need to know if your motherboard has a PCI- I cannot answer for a Dell machine. I used this video card on a MSI motherboard in a MSI case that I put together for myself. If you have a slim line Dell it will not fit. If you have a standard Dell case and a PCI-e 2.0 slot in the motherboard then it should fit. Works great, good video.
Sorry, I don't know. Our backup is an APC UPS ES 350, and it works great for us...
I would think that it would. I have a galaxy tab 2 and it works fine. I also use it on my smartphone.
Hello Rahat, Based on the official specifications of the ThinkPad X131e, it only supports up to 8GB using two 4GB memory modules. The recommended 4GB part number is KTL-TP3CS/4G, found here: http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Technology-PC3-12800-KTL-TP3CS-4G/dp/B008D6S0T6/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1432041991&sr=1-1&keywords=KTL-TP3CS%2F4G Thank you for choosing Kingston as your upgrade partner! -Jewel, Kingston US Technical Support
It is not necessary to install DDR3 memory sticks in pairs, however you will experience much better performance if you do because DDR3 memory is optimized to operate twice as fast in dual channel mode in matched pairs, as is your current configuration. Although the 2012 MacBook Pro has an "official" 8GB limit it can actually address 16GB. You will get much faster performance by upgrading to 8GB using two matched 4GB sticks rather than installing just one 8GB stick with the existing 2GB stick. Why upgrade memory capacity but downgrade performance by installing only one stick?
Hi Pravin, That memory module is not compatible with the C55-A5105 since it requires low voltage memory. The compatible part number is KTT-S3CL/8G, found here: http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Technology-PC3-12800-KTT-S3CL-8G/dp/B00D74FX62/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1429307533&sr=8-1&keywords=KTT-S3CL%2F8G Thank you for choosing Kingston as your upgrade partner! -Jewel, Kingston US Technical Support
I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work with that setup. I have the GT630 in a Windows 7 machine and it runs great.
Try on another computer system, to see if you can get it working there. This can rule in or out an issue with your MAC.
I've tried ZSNES and Winkawaks, I'll dare to say that will work fine with MAME, is plug and play, so all the buttons and sticks are ready to use as soon as you plug the Classic controller to the adaptor, I also have a PCEngine emulator but haven't tested it yet, but I'm sure it will work too.
I never tried the usb but I noticed bass loss when using rca cables, when it happens I turn it off and turn it back on and it goes back to normal, but it's annoying,
The SVF1421ACXB has an Intel Pentium 2117U processor. - Glenn
Bluetooth ok Wifi sucks
I'm not sure. I only have my phone that I pair with. My son used it once with his phone and I had to pair it again with my phone when he gave it back. Hope this helps.
Hi rick. Not sure what Sony has, but you have an on/off switch for noise cancelling and can pause your music with another button. However there is no actual need to switch off the noise cancelling, as this let conversation pass. It can cancel certain types of noise
Yes
When you say "sound", are you referring to the sound from the TV itself or sound from external speakers (e.g., soundbar)?
Hi. The wire was included on the one we purchased
You should be able to find a "brick" at Best Buy or Amazon. They sell generic chargers with several adaptors. they run around 10 to 20 dollars. http://www.amazon.com/K55a-hi5014l-X53sv-rh52-X54c-bbk22-X54c-bbk24-X55a-bcl092a/dp/B0099WYFI8/ref=pd_sim_e_9. Best buy costs more!
Hi Maria! Unfortunately, these cases are ONLY for the Macbook PRO, not the AIR. I believe these are the cases you are looking for: http://www.amazon.com/The-Friendly-Swede-Basics-Semi-Transparent/dp/B00AQAI5V0 If there's anything else, just let me know. I can be contacted directly via this link:
Yes, it does support Ubuntu. Running 12.10 on this with no problems, graphics card recognized and all drivers installed properly.
You should check with Garmin. They have made some sort of change since their new chartplotter will not work with older gps antennas. Must use this newer one. The reverse may be true.
No!
Hi, its flexible but too small, like 20 cm long
Yes. It has the holes for a VESA mount. (I have purchased a desk mount but have not set it up yet.)
no it's not.
I used this cable with Mac book pro, it worked fine but with frequent use it start to scratch the edges of the whole where it goes in the macbook. I have no Idea how it works with Mac book air.
Yes motion works great
I'm not sure. I have an iPad 2 and it fits perfectly! It's the best purchase yet!
No the iPad has to fit into the piece that attaches to the tripod. Your iPad has to be taken out of the Otterbox
DVD one player
Both are the same exact player. The "-c" refers to an included hdmi cable. That is the only difference.
Amazon Prime is not available on this player. I wish it would be.
Unfortunately, my answer would be a guess and I suggest you contact LG at http://www.lg.com/us. My best guess is that it is not "region free" or has an international format!
yup
Sorry, I have no idea b/c I don't know what G50-80 Signature is.
No
I have Windows 7 on it and it works just fine... Although I don't know how it handles on a day to day basis, I use mine as a Torrent Downloader and nothing else... Install was a breeze via USB THUMB DRIVE
Should be able to do that. I worked in Panama (PTY) through early 2014 and at first Netflix was not available but starting 2012 Netflix came online. I say yes. Go for it. Excellent device. Love it's slingplayer preloaded app.
This is the current year 2012 model, last year's model was Netgear PTV2000.
No, the stand is a rigid fixture. It cannot tilt or rotate. The flickering of the screen is noticeable only if you watch closely. Not always though. The monitor cannot tilt, buying a separate stand will not help.
The built-in speakers are "tinny" . . . No bass . . . I like music, so I have Bose speakers, one on each side of the screen. Sorry!
Yes, the power cord is included with the computer. Though I had problems registering, had to call, due to the date that the computer was made, ilike it very much.
my daughter had the iphone 5s and could control pandora via bluetooth but not sure about the iphone 6. This radio has a usb connection on the rear of the radio that you plug a bluetooth (flash drive type) that is supplied with the radio in and then select bluetooth connection on the radio to connect to the phone. That frees up the front usb for other uses. Hope this helps.
That's where mine is. At 70mm (2.75") it's not a short stick but on the upside: 1) the case itself is solid and seems like it will hold up to the rough-and-tumble environment of a keyring 2) the usb connector withdraws into the case rather than simply having a cap which can work itself loose 3) there's a mount for a split ring etc. built into the case
that is incorrect. It does not come with a keyboard.
Both made of metal and solid plastic good quality though.. I bought two of this but one seems not to be as fluid as the other.. For the price is a good choice
I am using it with Ubuntu. It works fine. Just remember that it is a TTL logic USB to serial converter. Check that is what you are looking for before buying this.
I could not find a way to use it. It did work very well with the non-zoom lens setting. I did have to remove the camera strap when I used this & use a strap on the housing. I hope that this answers your questions, I'm glad that I bought it.
my son tested it and he said it works great.
Yes - I has the lens also, for the 18-55 housing. It comes with 2 o-rings.
It is 8" long & 6 1/2 wide. My Nextbook 8 fits perfectly in it.
Yes. It comes with a software CD but should be recognized by your OS without the utilities. I'm using mine in a Dell OptiPlex 740 running Windows 7 32-bit with no issues.
Try reading this link www.likely-answer.com/.../Re--Getting-Gaming-Video-Card-For-Hpe-33 Also search on Google or Bing
Yes. It works perfect on my Mac w/Mountain Lion. Just plug it in and your set.
According to the user manual it should not be used vertically
Yes and no, it works only for small window time, then it conks out you. I tried ordering it twice and no success. The reason I wanted it so badly is due to the length. Nevertheless, I would suggest going through Samsung for the product...
No car adapter came with the unit.
No, you have to use the ear buds. Excellent sound.
Yes it has an outlet for extenal power, I hope that tthis answers your question my dear firend.
MagSafe and ms2 are different size connections to MacBooks. The newer MacBooks and airs have a different magnetic connection but same power need as older ones. I bought a 2013 MacBook Air but had several power supplies from an older air. These allow me to use my power supplies I have in multiple places (travel bag, vacation place, etc.) to change from old to new. And still let's spouse use same power cord for his older macbook. Saved me from spending more on MagSafe 2 power supplies.
It should read this just fine....I have used photo discs with this Superdrive with no problems.
You need the std 85w MagSafe, not the 85w magsafe 2 You have an older style tip that looks similar to the 2 series charger, but it's actually smaller. The std charger with the tubular style tip is the perfect fit
Yes you'll need an external antenna to get any signal at all. I used a set of poly planar's water proof speakers. As long as you keep within the radio output specifications, you should be fine
Yes, awesome radio
Yes ; it has the relay output ; I purchased one of these a few months ago; and the documentation wasn't clear, but it has the relay output.
If it does not come with a US warranty, it is gray market, and Amazon should not allow it.
I've used it in some very challenging light conditions and it performed excellently.
Yes, only if you register with online
Yes. My husband transferred some old cassette audio tapes to his hard drive with this item, and then burned a CD. Works well. Very happy with results.
Yes. I have never used headphones.
Yes, it will work on on both Windows 7 and 8.
It comes with 3 sheets, but they go on the front only. It is a protector for the screen of the phone only. A case will protect the back and sides, but you will need to purchase one separately.
Skinit has pre-made and custom skin protectors for all Apple devices. I bought one for my girlfriends iPad and she loves it. Can be purchased through Amazon or directly from Skinit.
Based on my wife's usage, and believe me she takes about 50-100 pictures a day; she has told me that she can see the screen better, no more glare on the screen before/after taking picture. Because of the privacy portion of the screen protector, when showing people pictures on the iPhone, they have to either look over her shoulder or hold the phone itself to see the pictures clearly, looking at them from the side are obstructed. Hope this helps? Overall my wife is very pleased with the screen protector.
Yes but DO NOT get the one sold by Tech Armor, it is junk and the company will not honor their warranty if anything goes wrong. Instead buy the ZAGG InvisibleShield Glass for Apple iPhone - Case Friendly. Trust me, if that one does you wrong, I will personally reimburse you!! Lol
It's not glass.
Yes...To Both Questions. But Dash Mount Is A Sticky Mount. It Also Comes With A Suction Cup Mount For Windshield. That'sThe Mount I Use And It WorkS Great.
I have had both the 9970g and currently using the vendetta... I lean more towards the 9970g more seemed to pick up way more, tell when emergency vehicles approaching, and railroad alerts. Kind of got annoying but worked great
No. The GPS function serves as accurate speed if the vehicle. It also serves the purpose of photo enforcement cameras ect.
No
This item is not available for the iPad Mini. We apologize for the inconvenience. Brian Customer Service
Yes
No. It is designed to be connected through a Bose subwoofer. It does not mean that it will not produce sound with other receivers but it will be flat and may eventually get damaged. For Bose subwoofers only. Loose~lips~sink~ships Sent from iPhone 6 Via international
I'm not familiar with that specific mobo, but if it has a PCI- e slot on it, that video card will work and has been a great video card for me
Didn't work for me had to return it
It can do both. Mirror or be used for seperate monitor
No, we are sorry but we don't ship over-seas.
Yes
Windows 7 came pre-installed. No OS disk was provided. The only option is to make a recovery disk.
Yea, it does
This model comes with a one slot ExpressCard/34.
hi, i think that your Nikon D50 DSLR have a 52 mm lense size for their 18-55 original lense, therefore should not require an adapter ring for your .43 wide angle lens. however if you have another kind of lense on your DSLR ( normal lense, wideangle or telephoto lens for example) you need check the external size of your lense and verify if is a 52 mm ring. in this case you need an adapter ring for this size
I tried to use it with LG 47LN5400 and it would not work because the vents were recessed and not on the sutface.
TAB3AN YA MADAM. IT WILL WORK
No it does not.
I don't have a DirectTV DVR so I don't know. However, the camera has a BNC connector that is convertible to a RCA connector. A power supply that comes with the camera.
It fits all the Nikon DSLRs
www.swann.com/s/products/view/?product=1366 - It states 75 degree viewing angle
Yes. Up down, side to side can be adj to your need.
Yes it will. And, quite well, I would imagine. Sigma DC lenses are similar to Canon EF-S lenses in that they will only work with APS-C sensor models, such as the Rebel line (also known as EOS xxxD and xxxxD) and 2-digit EOS models like 40D, 50D, and 60D, as well as the single digit 7D. FYI - It will not work with Full-Frame sensor models, such as 6D, 5D, and 1D.
same thing just a newer model, by the way I love my monitor you'll be amazed with the quality of picture & resolution specially if you edit video or work on pictures
Yes they originals great price and they sound great
Yes.
DDR2 and DDR3 use different memory slots, and this board is for DDR3 only. Chipset also made for DDR3 only
Yes it is. I got the same one in December 2014 , in light blue colour and am very happy with it
It fits my air pad 2. It's nice,; after using for some time, would prefer one that is more stable on propping up. Probably where the prop goes to the top-this folds and props at the bottom. I like it, but sometimes it actually falls over if you don't prop it just right!:(
It would be fine to workout in them as long as it wasn't too intense that they would not stay put. But for most things it would be ok.
I'm so sorry i can't Thank you
Yes, that is what I have and it is made for the 3rd and 4th generation. I actually saw some of these at our local Target last week.&#128522;
I do not think it will. It fits my iPad 2 perfectly.
Hello Jose, go to this site. http://ftazeta.com/viewsat-ultra-ultra-lite/2727-viewsat-xfta-how-complete-guide.html
yes is a splitter any system use hdmi clone the signal in two o more
You can connect it to any port on the switch. Most modern switches use N-Way ports so you can connect it to any port without a crossover cable.
Kate, I bought these expressly for that purpose, and they work great for that!
They aren't gonna be much use against daylight, not v strong
I've only copied DVD to DVD or CD to CD with it. I've never tried DVD to CD or CD to DVD, so I am unsure...but my guess is that it will not.
Yes
No you cannot copy protected movies directly.there are no copiers that will do that.you would first have find a program to remove the protection using your computer making a unprotected copy of the disk which is called a backup than your able to copy from that point.
Component Video Inputs 1 PC Inputs 1 USB Inputs 1 (Music and Photo) Coaxial Output 1 Headphone Jack As Far as gaming, I haven't used it for that.
Yes warranty is included for 1yr
You receive all four lights for the price listed, not just one :)
Most DX lenses are "G" designated and missing the aperture ring. This adapter does not carry any data from the lens to the camera. It also has no mechanical connection. Therefore, most DX lenses will be stuck at the smallest aperture and photos would be severely underexposed. With this adapter, you must focus and set your exposure manually. If your lens has an aperture ring and focus ring, this well-built adapter works fabulously. With focus peaking, manually focusing is a pretty quick and easy task. Keep in mind, the exif data will be missing info like aperture setting.
Hello, Yes, that lens works with this adapter and Fuji X mount cameras.
Don't forget to manually adjust the aperture (the adjustment ring on the adapter). Wider aperture - &gt; more light gets in.
I have a Nikon D5100 and it worked seamlessly. Just take note that the electronics are different so you wont have the Auto Focus feature (or any other feature at all), meaning you have to use it in full manual control. This is a good choice for using Minolta lenses on your Nikon.
Hello. This adapter did not work with my Nikon D3200. I received an error message on my camera that it could not find a lens so would not take any pictures. I could not even focus the lens manually since the camera did not recognize there was a lens at all.
This adapter is used for mounting Nikon brand and "Nikon mount" lenses on Canon cameras such as T3i Rebel. I cannot be used with screw in lenses.
Yea I probably, the only think you need to have in mind is, you gonna need to focus yourself
Since the Canon Rebel T5 is compatible with any Canon EF or EF-S lens, then yes: this adapter should work with your T5.
The filter size for your lens is : Filter/attachment size 52mm, Choose the Neutral Density filter 52mm for your lens.
Soft
No
No this will only fit the 70/300L lens.
Yeah but I kind if regret it now because I can't fold it up and its just collecting dust.the side that connects to the the plastic rips kind of easy if you are not careful. If you can learn to fold it right it will be ok.
Full power strobe they put out enough power to set my camera to f/16, ISO 100, 1/250...they recharge less than 1/2 sec...they have model lights but I don't use them so I don't have the measurements.
About three feet
It does include the boom arm. Max load weight is listed at 20 lbs and maximum arm length is 7 feet.
Yes this works with windows 7 out of the box
Hi Duke10, since the Internet TV has a browser, you may access your email. -Vincent
Harvey, I have never taken if off I LOVE IT and the fact my screen is SO protected!! I am ordering more in case it gets messed up is how much I love and trust it. It is only sticky around the edges and yes pulls off clean and easy!! I WOULD RECOMMEND!!
Yes.
It is a computer which uses android OS. If you attach it to a TV or monitor which has an HDMI connector and plug a mouse into the USB port, you can search the internet and download android apps.
You can upload content on the micro SD card slot that is available and play it while connected via USB. Otherwise you'll need a wifi connection for other streaming functions
The IHBS112-04 will burn (record to) both DVD and Blu-Ray disks. The IHES112-04 will only read Blu-Ray disks (and burn DVD disks).
Yes you can.
It's perfectly fine for an everyday watch and has great battery life (over a year) when not in GPS mode. It's not super stylish as it's a sports watch but it can definitely do the trick for both running and daily use.
Hi Keith - this chestband does not but the Runtastic Heart Rate Combo Monitor does.
Try Ebay
Put it on my gtx 780 works fine. Not as well as a full cooling system. But keeps my graphics card from overheating like it did before I put this on. Before installing this I could only play games in 4k for about an hour before my pc would crash from overheating. After installing it never overheats. Keeps at a comfortable 65 Celsius. Also was relatively simple to install and comes with full instructions.
No
Yes. There is a plastic "thumb screw" at the top, just above the large "turn handle". Turn it counterclockwise to loosen it, then rotate the head up to a vertical position and tighten the "thumb screw" to hold it in place.
I do not recomend this battery. It didn't work for my Vaio computer and I had to return it to Amazon. Keep away from this battery!
It works fine for everything except our Cablevision and this is because our provider has the iPad blocked.
The specification label on the power supplies (3 of them) state that the input voltage is 100-240 V, but I have only used them on a 120V supply so I cannot personally say that they will work.
1366 x 768
This is a piece of junk. Returned it within days.
They should as Skull Candy Headphones have an exterior aux outlet.
2 straight just like the picture!
Nope. You can only turn on and off and skip a track by pressing it twice real fast. IDK what twiz718 got in the mail but mine does NOT control volume. Good luck.
Not sure what you want to know. I have used it to clone my new SSD from my old hard drive. The important thing is that you have a computer hard drive that has a SATA connection. The adapter doesn't care if it is SATA or SATA II connection. The reason I bought this adapter was because it was USB III, which is much faster than USB II. Your computer must have a USB III port on your computer to take advantage of the extra speed, however should be backwards compatible with USB II. Hope this helps.
If you have the one with the Bowens mounting system the 30" Neewer Beehive should work. The speedlight mount is found here: http://www.amazon.com/Neewer-Bracket-Speedlite-Reflector-Umbrella/dp/B00JAAXH1A/ref=pd_bxgy_p_img_y Looks a bit ungainly at first but it works great. Link for the 30" Beehive is HERE: http://www.amazon.com/80cmX80cm-Speedlite-Speedring-Panasonic-Neewer/dp/B00KQDTU8O/ref=sr_1_14?s=photo&ie=UTF8&qid=1421211161&sr=1-14 I'm considering it myself. Just do a search on softboxes on the Amazon site and specify the Neewer brand. Several styles are listed.
I haven't weighed it but it is not super light it has some heft.
Yes. Audio outputs on left side of TV include headset, RCA (L&R) and coaxial audio.
I'm not sure about all that you are asking, all I know is that I had to plug in my Soundbar to the headphones jack for sound to come out of my soundbar. Hope this helps a littl
not very well. you have to have clear view to the south.
I doubt it would perform well. This is an omni-directional microphone. A directional mike would be better for voice recognition.
Brand new, unopened. Regards, The AV House Team
Hi there I have placed mine in my galaxy s4 phone. The s4 and the s5 are pretty much the same phone. It will work with your galaxy s5 phone.
Works fine with mavericks on MacBook Pro.
Use a VGA or HDMI cord to connect to the monitor(not included). Use the included USB cord to connect to the desktop.
Like a charm... the EVGA+ adapters are the BEST of the USB adapters hands down... Less quirks than any other brand! I have several in the field.
No, Just a power supply with U.S. AC plug.
According to the manufacturer's website, you need a "WiFi Qumi Dongle" to use that feature. I have not located such a thing as yet. It is not listed as a purchasable accessory on that site.
I removed and replaced mine works perfectly
It is approx. 1 foot to 1.5 foot
It needs to be docked
I think, if your USB port has enough power, it will work with one plug. There are versions available on Amazon with only one plug and they do work.
You do have to interact with a menu. It is simple and intuitive. I have never let it have access to only one movie at a time, so I cannot speak to its behavior when it only has access to one movie. Mine runs off a 500 MB hard drive with a couple hundred movies on it.
My son reports that the headphone gear he has used (Triton, Turtle Beach) plug into the back of his Xbox, not the monitor.
It doesnt come with wifi... If you're considering buying this product man just dont buy it...
i had issues with both the ethernet and coax speed when i used this to split both. i would recommend using a coax splitter to have the TV signal NOT run though this adapter. then, assuming that your coax network is part of your router's LAN, use this to convert coax to ethernet for the PS4. assuming that you have FIOS, refer to this for networking info: http://www.dslreports.com/faq/verizonfios/3.0_Networking
Yes, it is slightly different than the OEM and you will need to request an extension for the ribbon cable for it to install properly.
Yes
yes. It will work in 2000-2b27NR
u d better open the laptop and check it
Yes
I believe you are asking does it look like an ipad /iphone screen, then the answer is no. It looks like the laptop screens that have been around for the last 10 years.
I bought it when I did because it has Windows 7. It may have been updated since I got it in September, but the one I have is Windows 7.
Yes.
I find that about 50% of the noise intensity is reduced. I do hear the keyboard noises when I am typing at work and not playing any music on the headphones. But I believe it differs from person to person and how well the headphones will fit on their ears.
yes - but you need to download the Android version of the Kindle app. I have many Kindle books on my Asus tablet
Looking at the HD720 spec, I immediately notice this difference ~ "Built In 3.5" SATA/SATA2 Hard Disk Drive Bay With Up To 3TB of Storage Space (HDD is not included). It Can Also Be Used as USB 3.0 High Speed External Hard Drive Enclosure" HD700 does not have HDD enclosure.
I've used a 4tb and it worked fine.
Great One, lifetime!
I'm pretty sure it has no connection to your Mac computer. It's made as a keyboard for Ipads. It took me less than 3 minutes to hook it up to my Ipad 2. Just follow the directions on the box & it should have typing you typing right away. It will look similar to a laptop, only smaller.
Keyboard is white. cover exterior is metallic.
This is for the original Kindle Fire 7" screen. Works like a charm. This is not the Kindle Fire HD screen. Also, I dismantled mine first to confirm the right connection as two different electronic connections were used depending on the date of manufacture. Ive been very pleased with this product. If you don't have the screen removal tool kit it will help you in the long run to not create more damage to your Kindle.
Not that I know of. I bought this for the second generation Kindle Fire 7".
I used it to replace on my wife's 2nd gen, so that's the only one I know for sure it will work on
I just installed this digitizer on my Kindle with serial number starting with D026. Open your kindle up first to compare the shape of the plug. Ordered with prime shipping.
I am an electronic repair technician. It is likely the charge port that has gone bad (the part where you plug your charger in. Luckily, the piece can be replaced in the Kindle Fire. You just have to find a technician who can repair it or Amazon may have a repair plan.
It supposed too
I was not successful getting it to work so far. I've tried the supplied driver, used the Windows 7 plug and play driver, neither recognizes it. It was under $10, so I'm not going to try to mail it back to China, now sits in the bottom of a drawer and I'm just using my USB 2 ports instead of trying to add a USB 3 and/or eSATA ports. When I have a hour to kill, I may try installing it again, but faster to just use USB 2. You get what you pay for...
I would recommend a sturdy tripod with heavy duty head, or something similar. I've used this with my regular tripod and fluid head and it worked, but it was not sturdy. I eventually got a heavy duty speaker stand and custom made a mount for it with hardware from Lowe's. Although the jib crane is not that heavy, by the time you get the counter balances (I used small 2 and 5 lb weights for exercise) on and are moving the thing around it needs a strong base.
Yes
You can simply arrange two application windows. The monitor is wide enough to do this easily.
Yes, this monitor does come with a cable, however, I don't know if it connect to a Mac Air.
Yes, based on product information it should work for 2000 Toyota Avalon. Good luck.
There really isn't a wiring diagram. There are 4 wires, each clearly marked. The four wires are +48 VDC In (+ side of battery array), Ground in (- side of battery array), +12 VDC Out and GND (-) Out. Connect the input side to your battery array and the output side to whatever 12 volt device you need to power. Keep in mind that there is a 10 Amp limit, which should be plenty for most applications, but something to be aware of.
No, this is not a charger, it reduces the voltage from a 48 volt battery pack to 12 volts so that 12 volt accessories use all the batteries equally.
Yes, depending on how many amps it draws. If you have lights or other accessories you would have to go with a more substantial converter.
Yes it will... Although they are small but the quality and crispness of the speakers comes through. You can increase the output of speakers to fit a 28x20 hall. That's what I have... Klipsch hasn't disappointed me and honestly I am impressed.
Yes, it does burn dual layer DVDs. I have burned three so far.
If it works as well as the one I bought no
Yes, they do. Not terribly, but they do leak sound when on full blast everyone can hear it. I think it is okay in the gym, because treadmills make a lot of noise as well, but you can't have them on full volume in an office setting.
Good
No
They have a one year warranty.
They work on all models using the standard earphone jack. Yes, android models.
I would go with the other ones I don't think the bass is that heavy. But other than that they have a great sound.
It has 3. They broke after 2 months owning and less then 3 weeks of use
No
Somewhat. You can see the apple
The whole thing is covered. Logo and all
No difference!
I would just be real careful when taking them out of the box or even be carful when using them cause there delicate.
hi Elsa,I bought this stuff for my friend, I didn't open when it on my hand,just gave to him directly,and he tell me it sounds good...may not help u on this question
they came in some beats headphone box but were opened when I open the package from the postal service
The mic does work, the volume controls do not
IdolPad Plus can work as e reader. Actually most budget tablets can be used as e readers but dual camera function is not likely to be available on these low priced tablets since customers who buys these tablets don't really care much about Cameras. If you need to get dual camera, you can check Samsung Galaxtab 2 or some other bigger brands at around $200 - $250.
To be honest, I didn't try it in the car, but I tried it just about everywhere else. It's a novelty item and the sound is way subpar, so I imagine if your car is anything like my Toyota Corolla, basic road noise would drown out anything the speaker produced. It's just my opinion, but I really wouldn't buy it for anything more than a party novelty.
Yes we love it especially for the price
It's 60Hz. Doubtful you'll find a higher rate in a small TV/Monitor
Yes and yes.
I am unclear as to the term "IOS" in regard to Cisco RV082 Router, but I can say it's "firmware" is ver 4.2.9. I recommend the questioned contact Cisco directly for further inquiries about this device.
I also have the 5-color keyboard and had only one key (the del key) that had the sticking problem. I was able to fix it simply. I think the 3-color keyboards are a bit more prone to the problem but only based on the other reviewers. I think (just an option) the 5-color keyboards, costing more are an upgrade to the 3-color and so receive a little more care during prep and assembly.
I haven't found anything yet.
Yes. I use the iPhone app. Very simple and has pretty powerful control
From reading other reviews, the 900 has greater range and is much smaller hence the ATOM name claiming to be one of their smallest detectors.
Nope. This is not.
Yes it has a front facing camera only
It comes with a micro-USB connector that allows you to hook a regular sized USB cable into it. However, I haven't tried, it is used as an e-reader mostly in my home.
The case is approximately 7 inches wide, by 16 inches high by 17 inches deep.
personally i think its pretty much the same feeling, imagine the same keys without the keyboard frame and unreachable dirt
It will be compatible with any version of iOS, though obviously won't be compatible with the iPhone 5 (and future models) due to the different connection used.
After update soft ware from iPad, very hard to connect to the HDTV. I got a check it out over again.
I bought it and got no help from Honeywell on how to get service. Finally got DIY security to give me service and I recommend then. I not sure Honeywell understands how to do business.
Yes
Yes, there is an opening for the lens. I use it all the time while in its case to take pictures. I've had the case for a year and a half and it's not showing any signs of wear and is very sturdy.
Yes... you won't be able to swipe well and you will accidentally double click when you scroll...
Don't know. Mine case fell apart after 6 months, so I scraped it.
No. If you look closely at the photo, you'll see that the phone displayed is the s3 (regular size)
I believe this is just for the regular Galaxy SIII...model SPH-L710.
It does not have a screen cover, but the corners are contoured on the front so when on flat surfaces the screen does not touch.
no the hoes for the camera are different . But i'm sure they will have it for the 4, and i'm telling ya, you wont regret it!
There is a feature you can disable if you want that lets you communicate with the panel. Mine is currently disabled.
Hello Kelly, From my experience it saves your settings. I think you can think of the memory in this more like a flash drive. when not powered it still keeps the info. it does not have a battery inside, but i dont think it needs one. it is also part of your alarm system and would be using the juice from its battery in case of a power outage. hope this helps
No, it can tilt up an down
Well you should have a power supply on your system to constantly charge the battery. The battery is only for backup when the power goes out. Your panel should have a power supply with it
1 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0 on the front panel 5 USB 2.0 in the back
Yes, 2 cords (cables). One flat USB cable and one square USB cable. I use the square one. Pat
To be annoying. As long as there is power it's lit. I'm lucky mines in a closet. Put a peice of electrical tape over the light
Don't know but the Nikon D3000 fits perfectly and was great for traveling
Don't know. My daughter has a 3200 thatshe uses it for.
I use them with my iPad and iPhone. I would assume they work with Droid phones, but I haven't actually tried it as I don't have that kind of phone
I doubt it... A while ago I bought one, and got one. By the way, it works great.
Audio travels with the HDMI signal
Yes you do
why would it not work? its just a router.
I have an 8gb nook tablet and installed the afn sd card (android for nook) and find that i have plenty of room for all that i use. I am very happy with the afn product. works perfect every time.
I don't know yet. I had this shield for 2 years now and never had to replace it. It is very strong and durable. There are still no obvious scratches on it. I'm using this type of shield on 2 cell phones and 2 tablets. It is very good.
Nope. I had to install Windows 7 HP with a flash drive.
This android for nook will only work on the Barnes and Noble Nook tablet. Besides the nook hd plus has google play store now. So, it would be basically pointless to root a Nook HD +.
It will charge 5 devices at a time. It will not charge an IPhone 5 or Ipad 4 as they are too new and do not use the 30-pin charger.
I found that I Pads and I Phones have to be taken out of there cases to fit in the charger.
Yes. But your frame rate will be affected by the size. Full 30fps is only available at 640x480, 1920x1280 delivers passable frame rates at 20 fps but above that it starts to get choppy.
Yes
While it has an SD slot. The operating system does not allow for storage of games or applications on the SD card.
As an everyday user I can confirm to you that both run just through the hdmi cable.
as long as it is pluged in to hdmi on the home theater receiver, and not the tv it should work.
Yes
In theory, probably so........ But I was never able to find out. The unit I received was "Dead On Arrival" and I returned it immediately. Amazon was very prompt with the refund. ....They're good people to deal with. KLC
I believe so. Sorry - don't have it handy to look at and know for sure.
You should be able too. My camera is similar and it fits perfectly!!
Call1-800-777-7899 or go online to http://www.izzo.com/static/SwamiWatch_InstructionManual.pdf and download the user manual.
Yes it is perfect for the SL-D2
I dont have the original hinges, so, none to sell. If you don't have hinges you'll have to buy a pair. The cover itself will fit your SL1210.
no this is for technics only
I do not believe they can be.
Yes. It is a very handy thing to have!
Yes, it should work.
I have not located a charger, however one is not needed. This battery serves to store the energy generated by the dynamo hand crank. Put this in your radio and charge with an AC to DC transformer for the radio.
I can't help. I have the FR600. Sorry
I don't remember the box much. Sound quality was so poor that I returned them asap.
The ones I received were 100% the real deal
It's been displayed in my store for while. Factory discontinued doesn't mean it was sold out anywhere. Thank you for your inquiry.
These are definitely an upgrade in sound from the stock apple earbuds. However, I still have to play around with equalizer settings on my ipod to get the sound I want.
I do not have this device, but I use the cable(s) for a wide variety of devices, a couple older Samsung phones ... Nexus 5,7,10 ... Kindles ... Bluetooth headphones ... etc. The cables just plain work for me. They charge as fast as the cables that came with the devices in my experience.
Most speakers use a different connection for audio so I don't think this cable would be best for that application, based on the speakers that I use.
It seems to run around ~5-10 or so frames faster. Source: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/geforce-gtx-660-ti-benchmark-review,3279-4.html

The supplied wall power plug-in adaptor is a universal one. It will sense the voltage from 100 to 240vAC.
Yes it does...call D-Link and they'll help you set up. I have a Dell computer and it works
It's on the description in amazon
yes
Do you have a Xbox talkback cable connecting the Xbox controller to the z22 in line amp? Also I think you need an adapter to plug z22 amp to the Xbox properly.
With the hight fully extended, 6 inches to the base of the screen, and a little over 6.6 to the edge of the screen. When fully pushed down, 2.5 to base of the screen and 3.1 to screen edge. All of these measurements include the base, which is about .5 inches high. the screen itself is 14.5 high from top to bottom of the outer bezel.
The mic is built into the monitor. You just have to connect the webcam to a computer by way of USB and configure it. A software program comes with the monitor that runs the webcam and mic.
Not necessarily a case but a nice cloth bag.
Idk I had huge problems with them and had to send them back twice! The pause button did not function at all and they "both" sounded horrid. Witch sucks cause I was expecting something just as good had headphones especially for the price. But to my shock they sounded Evan a lot cheaper than the Apple EarPods you can get for $20 idk if it was this weird batch I just happened to get or what but I certainly wouldn't go trying to get them again :/ hope this helps
Totally. My dog ate my last pair and I bought another without even thinking.
Yes, perfectly. Thanks
It is just like any other cctv camera it uses the Rj45 and 12v female power connection. These are by far my favorite Cameras because they do not draw attention from employees or customers. Very clear video and audio. A must have!
Yes it's a Real Smoke Detector.
It is not a stand alone device, it connects with included wires to a dvr so you can record, watch, and playback. I have a Swann system
Usually the DVR is the one that records with motion but the camera is always on
Mine didnt voice dial initially. However, if you have an iphone and do the most recent software upgrade, you get a SIRI dial screen and you can use SIRI to do whatever SIRI does Also Im not sure who told you the 940 does it all, it was the low end model of the NAV series. Its does a ton of things, esp in regards to sound shaping and listening options, but the 7" and 8" Alpines NAV decks have more features (free traffic, ), but no voice dial, until the 2014 SIRI upgrade
It will if you get an appropriate steering wheel control adapter.
I can speak through it just fine, and its very loud. Remember, connect your loudspeaker up to the two brown wires off the wire harness, polarity doesn't mater. And mount your siren module in-doors, not under the hood, I think thats what damaged my siren module. But mine is working beautifully now. Any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I'm very familiar with this unit now.
Yes
Yes, a phone line is required in order for the system to dial out. My recommendations is simple talk, vonage or Verizon's home phone connect.
Yes you can. for more assistance i recomend you call there tech support. they are very friendly
That will wholly depend on the quality of your paint and drywall. It is the pull style tab. BUt immediately after installing it I attempted to remove mine. There was enough resistance that I thought dammage would occur. I have walls tha thave been professionally painted in 2013. But I did nto wnat to risk it. Also I used Sherwin williams harmony paint. One of their highest quality paints.
That depends on your software not the tablet
It should if your Macbook has USB ports.
I'm not sure.
Yes it will.
The only problem I saw was the bag that came with it was too small. All items worked fine, but there was no place to store them all.
I own this foot pedal and use Express Scribe daily.
Yes, I put it in an early 2011 13' MacBook Pro and it runs great. Will not work with newer Retina models, since they have flash storage that is not replaceable.
Here is the link to the charger tips: http://www2.lenmar.com/adaptertips/ChargerTips.pdf and here is the link to the manual: http://www.lenmar.com/Uploads/File/Manuals/PPU916RS.pdf I hope that helps.
This product requires extension and tip...not practical long term. I recommend to either a) buy a new battery or b)spent 300 more and buy yourself a new laptop when it goes on sale. Im returning mine.
Not unless you are planning to replace the heatsink as well. It has a little 40mm sunflower fan set into the heatsink that has already failed once for me.
No only directly to your phone
Hi, thanks for contacting us. This card is not dell specific. It will work in any system that has the appropriate expansion slot. If there is anything else I can do for you or if you have any other questions please let me know. Sincerely, Chris nickels Red Planet Trading
Check your phone's wi-fi settings to ensure connectivity to the modem and also make sure your messaging settings are set for wi-fi default when linked to your home modem. Hope this helps.
They do not provide this info and I seriously doubt it.
yes it can with ease
Hello Anonymous, ArmorSuit screen protectors can hide some scratches. It has hid scratches on certain devices depending on the scratches deepness and length. Thank you for your inquiry.
Mine came with a hard drive
yes.
No you have to apply the screen. It is one of those stick on ones.
Yep, you can charge it without having to take off the cover!
I have been using on-and -off all usb ports. You can use it for anything you like..like flash drive, uploading from your camera etc.
Seperate
Yes. I have an iPhone 4s. I get so many complements on my beats and even crazy looks because many people don't know about the wireless feature. Enjoy.
It's in between the two. Slightly larger than the solo and slightly smaller than the studio. The studio sounds better, especially the new redesign.
It's not just the headband... The stitching on the muffs came undone and the warranty wouldn't cover it. Battery life was just like new for the 6 months I had it for.
Yes this headphone has a built in mic.
I have 2 sets of rechargeable batteries and I don't think if you plug it to the ac will recharge them
Yes
They fit good no problem there.
Windows 8 does not have media center software by default you will have to upgrade through microsoft, i think it was $10.00 then there was no problem with it
The ones that i bought were in its original packaging, and sealed on the outside with a plastic wrap that was sealed from the manufacturer. The beats came in a box type package, and in the box was the Beats Headphones, Beats Carrying Case, cords for the Beats and some papers and instructions. Very nicely sealed and packaged. I was more than pleased.
No they are wired
Yes I believe it's the first model. It's discounted because of the dock (which you can buy a rather inexpensive adapter for), it's not portable (no battery) and if you want blue tooth you need to buy a separate adapter as well. Plus monster manufactured this one and all the new ones are either made by HTC or in house by Beats themselves. I personally prefer this one.
Just buy the 30 pin Bluetooth adapter and pulg it on top and use it with any blue tooth phone or apple device
The red black and remote wires must be integrated into your key ignition and main power connection
hi dorian, your i phone will not be damaged at all when put in the lifeproof case. lifeproof is the perfect name for the case. as long as your i phone is kept in the case, it will be protected. i can assure you of that. the case is amazing:)) hope i answered to your satisfaction. happy new year
If the one I purchased is fake, then Amazon.com better have some explaining to do! I sent a request into LifeProof 2 days ago and they still have not gotten back to me. Maybe the whole thing's a scam. If they tell me that mine is fake, I will be VERY upset, as I bought is from Amazon.com direct, not a re-seller on Amazon. I saw that they sell these at Walmart too.
Yes, you have to open the power cord cover when you talk on the phone otherwise it sounds really muffled.
The case snaps together. The serial numbers are printed on a tiny sticker on the inside of the back plate. Hope this helps!
It' about 16" high, 12" wide and will expand to about 4" thick. It's perfect for a smaller framed person. I'm short and small framed. It holds my 13" laptop. 2 notebooks and 2 pretty big texts. The mesh water bottle pockets on the side are great.
It won't work unless your phone supports it. The cable ends are different. I would imagine it's not 3.0 so it won't plug in at all.
The only thing included is the waterproof adapter for headphones and a cleaning cloth.
I've not noticed any significant inability to hear my daughter, who uses this case.
Hi Aaron, Thanks for your email, and your interest in RHA. Unfortunately we are unable to guarantee compatibility with any third party products, including Apple cases. Please accept my sincere apologies I'm unable to be of further assistance regarding on this occasion. Kind regards, Jenny RHA
In my area no. They only support VDSL not ADSL. Just chat with their tech support and they will be able to give you a list of compatible modems or check out the website.
Yes, as long as you have the length of the wiring to the TV covered.
Two factors are in play. 1. The TV cannot weigh over 40lbs. 2. Bose recommends a TV size they think will be stable on the Solo. I placed mine under the TV stand on the floor.
Yes, but only works when your player is docked, not with Bluetooth.
No, mah is only capacity, nothing about power output. I use mine all the time, no damage.
No, this is solid copper wire.
Yes and it works great only problem I've had with this is that the tools they give you isn't that great.
3#tall... top is round corners but approximately 3" x3"...
we believe this double din for all GM Chrysler cars , but better to make sure with you local professional installer with showing your car to install.
Hi Parth, It will stand in different angles as show in the pictures. Sincerely, rooCASE Customer Care
Yes
BN59-00599A is the original remote for your model. It has been discontinued and is no longer available. You can use AA83-00653A as a replacement.
Hello, the answer is definitely yes, this battery will work perfect, i got one for over a year and is working just great.
SDHC does not equal SDXC. It wouldn't work in my Samsung phone. YMMV.
Yes just use the monitor turn of the sound................
YES thank you from don I used it for my dish box and pc all in HD works grat
Hello, yes it does, although sadly most of my music files are in the mp3 format, the ones I have in FLAC worked like a charm syncing with winamp...
yes it does
No. It is android
The 64 gig tablet has 64 gig built in. The SD slot is for an add-on micro sd card.
I'm wondering the same exact thing. I saw another one by AJ Wholesale, but they're charging $599 for the 32GB one...so I'm just waiting when to hear from these guys. I hope it's not too long...I've Googled it and still can't find an answer.
Here is info from TRENDnet: http://www.trendnet.com/products/proddetail.asp?prod=130_TPL-406E2K&cat=65 It looks like it can do 240V, but it has the US outlet type.
The cable is part of the noise canceling headphones and does not perform a separate reduction function.
The bigger end slides into the headphones and other end will fit the aux/headphone jack on an iPod
Yes, you are able to listen to music on your iPhone 5. But you will not be able to talk over the phone since the cord lacks a microphone
Because the plate is a reduced size. It is possible that some records become warped. Also any record with a warp is exaggerated during play.
First; I have a 7D and I got Canon 2 option, works great. Second; select option Canon 1 and read the title, you'll see that 7D is not in that list, but it is in the Canon 2 option.
Actually David if your shooting with a SLR you should have a bulb setting on your camera. In this mode you control the length of your exposure. The remote has a lock feature that will allow you to take long exposures.
I have a Nikon D5300 and its works very good ........ they also have it for T5 see: http://www.amazon.com/Polaroid-Shutter-Release-Control-Repalces/dp/B008FBMQQC/ref=sr_1_fkmr1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1422981804&sr=8-1-fkmr1&keywords=cannon+T5+polaroid+shutter
It does have a bulb mode with lock to expose for as long as you want. I've got the one for a Canon camera. If you've got the blub switch on your Nikon and a polaroid shutter release made for the Nikon camera model you have then it should work.
Yes, it does have instant release. No settings, just press the thumb button.
Check the file size of the image. Larger size images will need to be formatted to be under 1MB. Once that is done, I have found they all display.
not positive but I believe diagonally just like a TV screen
That happens when the images that were uploaded are to large. Go into each picture and resize it based on the specifications listed in the ViewSonic instructions. Re save the new images on the memory then re-upload them.
No, this ViewSonic must be plugged in.
Hi, May. I looked on the AC adapter and it says that it's for 120-240v, so you would be safe using it. It's a wonderful frame. I use it to display our boys' artwork and pictures of them holding it. It has a wonderful timer feature to schedule on/of times.
No
I use it with CS5.5 and it works fine. At first there wasn't any audio on the clips I imported. I fixed it by changing the audio format on the camera to Dolby Digital instead of Linear PCM.
The NX30U is the United States version and the NX30 is the European version.
No, you do not need an adapter. The tablet sit inside and you connect the USB, and the keyboard works. I was pleased with the purchase. Hope this helps you...
My Mother has a nextbook 8 from walmart and I bought the 8-inch Tablet Stand with USB Keyboard - Black PU Leather Carrying Case by Generic... hope this will help you
Don't buy this, it only last for about 2 months and then the screen went out!
I just went back to where i ordered it and it asked if I wanted to contact manufacture.
mine is, but I believe it would depend on what your current contract is at the moment.(I have an very old contract when they offered unlimited) Verizon doesn't currently offer this MIFI as an option because it is 3G. The only one you can get thru a plan is 4G and is not unlimited. Hope this helps
referb has 90 days
The specs say it is compatible with the TF201 and TF700 tablet.
Don't buy something like that online. Its too big a risk as far as size. Hit a Best Buy, or Office Max so you can see and feel it. If your lucky, if they don't have it, they can tell you where to get it. At the very lease, go directly to Asus and try it there. Maybe even email them and ask. Hope that helps.
Yes, I have a TF 300 and my wife has the TF 700 and they are interchangeable
Yes
Well in a hot environment a fully charge battery gives me a hour top it seems to over heat 50 to 60 day temperature about two hours I was told it would not overheat but I think it does. I work with 4 batteries to keep them cool and take brakes after 30 minutes to avoid complete shooting while shooting. Please advice if I maybe using this wrong thanks.
I'm just guessing it should since it fits the D800 fine and both the D800 and D810 use the same Nikon MB-D12 battery grip.
Depending on the size of the gym you would probably need two. I would try one first.
I don't see where it says that. From what I do see, it is available for 2 day shipping if you want to pay the extra shipping costs. I'm guessing nine days max if you use the free shipping option and go over the amount to trigger that. (Currently $35 total order.) 1 or 2 months is what I see for when "something else" is shipped directly from HongKong or China.
I believe it came with a bracket which will allow it to be wall mounted.
We don't think so. It didn't come with brackets.
It is not designed for that, and is not moisture resistant, so I would not do so. Units designed for outdoor use are designated as such by UL.
yes it can . but set your out put to 12.5 so that you don`t damage the unit .
I live in Venezuela and NTSC system used here, my daughter brought a nintendo wii in europe is PAL system and therefore the TV did not work in my country. This device worked correctly for me to convert PAL to NTSC, also serves to convert NTSC to PAL, bone is bidirectional. I hope my comment will be helpful.
Power is not needed for MOST devices, but some need external power. Most satellite receivers or BluRay players will power the unit by themselves, but there's no way a small tablet can. The USB port is for use with those devices, so you can provide extra power to make up for what the HDMI source lacks.
We actually have three different ac adapters available, with outputs of 6 volts, 9 volts, or 12 volts. (All are 120 volt input). Unfortunately Amazon will not stop recommending our 9 volt adapter, model AC-02, as "Frequently Bought Together" with all products that actually require one of the other models, the AC-04E or AC-05. Please make sure you check the description of the item you want to use the adapter with before selecting which adapter you need.
I measured mine (amid the clutter on my desk ;) ) and it is about 5 1/2 feet. Hope that helps.
Yes
I would believe you can although I do not use this for gaming. It's a pretty good laptop so I'm sure you can game on it as well :)
The stylus is actually the end that is not the ink pen. It looks like a soft eraser but that is what you use on the screen. The ink pen is a bonus!
I believe just the 300 and 700
Through Skinomi's web site. They will ask for your order number to associate it with the purchase.
No this kit will not fit your camera. You may require step up or down rings. It may not fit even with the various rings.
it fits my sx 40. as long as they threads are 58mm , it should fit
No
it should work. it works with my iPhone 6.
yep
Hey Huy I'm not exactly sure why but it could be that this is an older model of the same speaker. Usually if the same model is on sale it is from last or previous years. I hope that this helps and let us know if you have any more questions. Thanks Jane H. Dogfunk Gearhead
Watts I don't know. But the loudness is perfect. It sounds pretty loud
Power plug, stickers & speakers
This doesn't have a Docking station.. It's a choice of Bluetooth, USB or Aux Cable..
Thank you for contacting us. Yes, this lens will work with your D3100.
Unfortunately we do not offer shipping to India at this time and the warranty for the lens is only valid here in the US.
We are sorry but this lens will not work on your Sony Nex-7 camera. We do not carry an adapter to use a Nikon lens on a Sony camera at this time.
I contacted B & H Photo for compatibility. 800.606.6969
Thank you for your interest in our bundle! This lens is compatible with the Nikon D40x.
If you lens has a thread size (for filters) that is 67mm then these filters should work.
It worked for my Sansu MP3 player to a Sony Bluetooth speaker. I am not sure of the Ipod accesories port.
First, I'd contact Amazon to see if you're inside the return window since they'll probably be faster in replacing it. Then, if you're outside that window, you can contact ASUS and submit an RMA request. Hope this helps!
not very well, especially if there is water drops on the plastic
The new Nexus 7 is a bit thinner and narrower (and 3mm longer) than the old one. It will fit without doubt but depending on your use-case you'll maybe find it too big (I felt it's too big for the old one).
I have the Samsung Chromebook with the I-pearl hard case and yes this does fit with no problem.
This case fits my MBA 11" well. I use it all the time and it has protected my MBA well.
Yes! I have the TF700T and the cable works perfectly with it. It will fall out easily if you bump it, but the original cable did that with this tablet too.
Yes. A battery that works. There are no replacements batteries available by battery stores or Astek. No support available.
Set up this receiver at my Ants house and it's set to pick up Intelesat 805C, has been working just fine, don't see any reason that it wouldn't work fine in Jamaica, just needs to be programmed to specific FTA Sat.
This is the cord I purchased for my Elmo and it worked great.
yes,fantastic...
It is original music angel box.
Yes it holds place or bookmarks. I have used Overdrive in the pass. Bookmarks is the primary reason I purchased the Mozaic
What is the scope of work? What are trying to do?
If the time the siren needs to be on is different then the time the light beam is broken, you would need a timer relay.
Yes it still works on win 8
After you format the memory card in the camera, you will notice a small file that gets placed in the root directory. That is the application that allows you to view and save the video files to your PC. Simply put the memory card in your PC's card reader, open the corresponding directory and double-click the file. The actual video files are hidden in a special way (too technical to explain here) so that they don't appear on your PC. Just run the little app on the memory card, everything else should be intuitively obvious.
Apparently once the micro SD card fills up, it automatically erases the oldest files to make room for new recordings.
The U.S
The Netgear signal worked to extend the signal on my TV when I had Roku and also works with all the computers in the house. I really can't answer your questions because this is all that I use my Netgear for, sorry.
I tried this unit and it is very bad for streaming video, only workable for email type of traffic.
A bit less than 6 pounds, I think.
When I received my system it was exactly what was displayed and listed.I am very satisfied with the product
Pretty sure it does. It has the wide connector or original apple port. Nice little music box. It keeps your pod charged and turns it on when you select ipod for source. It is a little hard to get in the port because it moves (probly to keep it from snapping off if your to rough) and you can't fit your hand behind your player. Once your pod is connected you just leave it connected so you don't have to keep wiggling it into place. Hope it helps.
Its a small micro display. It will show the station, aux, or track number from usb card. Volume and other information shows up as well. The only thing it doesn't come with is the power cord.
The volume nob turns it on and off. Also the remote dose as well.
You cannot use any cover as the back of the Nexus fits snugly against the back vertical wall of the stand.
Yes you can but you will need to get a local sim card first to be used with the device.
Has no effect on Wi-Fi.
Yes- you will need to purchase batteries and a memory card- my 3 year old was able to burn through one set of batteries in the first day he received the camera- so it will go through a lot of batteries.
there is a setup disk included with this camera package that allows you to download your pictures into the program on your computer....you can print the pictures, make calendars with the pictures, etc. Quite nice.
Yes it is, I bought the system that came with monitor and two cameras, added two more using GC45 from amazon.
comes with USB power cord for the computer also comes with a power cord for the vehicle and the mounting plate and uh the unit itself
no specific order plug the single one going to your router to your TV into the HDMI splitter in and two outputs 12 each TV or device and you should be good and then plug the power and I have found howeverthat it is important to have a good HDMI cable.
Product Information is, aparently, wrong. I bought this model and has 256GB!
It has 2 3.0 usb ports and 1 thunderbolt port.
clicked, but soft enough that you can stop it just about any point between the 4 available clicks.
Yes you can if you have the right tools.
Yes the usb cord is only for power but you can leave pluged in all the time
Yes, you need to buy the adapter for the wall ~ but you do not need the adapter to plug into your computer if that is how you want to transfer information and charge devices.
Personally I luv my sms by 50 headphones....best bang for ur buck ...forget the sol republic
No, quality still comes through as 1080p. I use it for my Xbox and PS3 and it works great.
The ones I have, the wired ones do unfortunately. As for the new wireless ones I can't answer that from experience.
Not very big, about 3"x 2"
Wider than a normal one, rest similar
You have the option to delete and/or print. It's not like the old fashion polaroid that automatically prints every time you click so it saves you photo paper. You have to actually choose which ones to print. You can also edit/crop/add borders too before printing.
You just have to buy the paper. The zinc paper has all the ink it needs inside of it. Be sure to brighten up the photo before you print. =)
no, I'm sorry
No, there are no ink cartridges, the pictures are created with lasers. Super cool, huh?!
Please provide the actual model information in regards to your MacBook. Here is a link to technical specifications of different MacBooks: http://www.everymac.com/systems/apple/macbook/index-macbook.html
With the counter you can tell if cars came into your driveway while you were away.
Yes, you can call Rodann directly for technical assistance and/or warranty replacement at 800-366-7010. They have a 1 yr warranty with Proof Of Purchase.
They're standard US plugs / volts (110?). The wattage depends on the lights you use in them. The default lights are CFL's that emit a pretty high color temperature (about 7500k) and they tended to make skin tone look a little green. The two bigger soft boxes come with 4X45 watt bulbs (which are brighter than tungsten of the same wattage.) So one of those soft boxes with the default lights take about 200 watts.
Check on the manufacturer's website: http://usaspec.com/product.php?ProductID=78&forceShowProduct=1
No
During the day, yes. Not at night.
yes, it's very easy to manage the password
Yes, you can charge it with the cover closed.
this fits the samsung galaxy tab 10.1 with no problems. It works well for me. A sturdy cover.
if you turn the tablet so that the port is on top then you can charge it while it's in the stand. the tablet can rotate in the stand.
In my experience with my T3i yes it does.
Yes I've had no problem with it at all
It is a website. But people ask stuff all the time. I'd try geek.com maybe not sure.
I used M6x16 screws.
Available on line
413 grams.
Mine was, yes. Just be sure to order one that specifies "4th generation", like this product.
The otterbox defender for Ipod is great it protects it from drops and has held up great
Nop! you won't be able to charge them via USB, because the charger it self does not have USB port.
No it won't work because of the HP BIOS lock. This card is NOT whitelisted in HP BIOS.
I'm not sure if this will work with your specific rig, but I haven't ha an easy time with this wifi card. I was having problems with the previous one and I figured this would solve the problem and it hasn't. I'd strongly consider the intel equivalent, although it's more money I think it's more compatible with routers and computers hardware and software. I could be completely wrong and your computer is different from mine. I have an Asus laptop with high end graphics and an i7. If post on a forum if someone hasn't already answered your question.
No...the charger came with the gps.
It's without USB port but comes with the speaker system
Yes
you need 18.5 V dc @ 3.5A - 65 W or 19.5V dc @ 3.33 A - 65 W to power your Ultrabook.
When I bought my computer I didn't realize the adapter came with it. The one I ordered has never been tried with my HP Envy.
Honestly I have no idea. I've never used the old model, so I have no basis for comparison. But, if you can find timing differences, then, go with the faster sticks at that point.
It should, but you should double check the manufacturer's website just to be sure
The L stands for low-voltage. This model runs at 1.5V, but there is another model that runs at 1.35V - KHX16LS9P1K2/16. While most memory can be backwards compatible, that is you could probably use this memory at a lower voltage, you won't get the full performance of this memory running it at a lower voltage. I'd recommend getting the 1.35V model (KHX16LS9P1K2/16) You can simply search the model number on amazon to find it.
For my unit Model UV09-1: Input 100-240V AC, 50/60 Hz, 0.5A max., Output 9V - 10V 1A - 2A
No, it is the same size as original.
no same length
No, not without taking the base apart. The base end is too wide for the base.
I bought the extra adapter for the roku 2 and it works fine.. I also now have a roku 3 and the power plug on it is a different size so this adappter will not work
It works, but as I mentioned in my review, this charger dies within a month when used with roku 1. Roku sells the charger from their website; I would try that.
Yes and it works
I bought this for a Tascam DP 008 EX and it works perfect. Output voltage is 4-6 volt. The plug is 11 mm. long; it's longer than needed but still works. Is center + (positive). Check the plug in the insert picture to see if that is what you need.
Without a doubt it its for the G560. You're talking 3/10th of a volt. Lots of G560 batteries went bad, I thing Lenovo should've gone with the 11.1 volt one to start with. You should still contact Anker but I do have a couple degrees and I am using the battery myself. You might want to let the new one not charge to 100% 90% will make the service life much longer. The settings are in the advanced power settings.
If you are encountering a hardware problem, then it would be important to work with Wacom's support team to resolve it. We can be reached at 1-855-MY-WACOM (699-2266) or online at http://us.wacom.com/support/.
Yes you just have to remove the top quiet pads and it can fit an h100i
Yes it will
Integrated. And very annoying.
No
More important question is what processor does this laptop have. Description is not accurate.
I don't know as I don't have that camera. Look at the dimensions and judge.
I have used it with my Kindle Fire in my truck, which is a rough riding, noisy, F350. I don't know if it was charging in that configuration but, the charge lasts for hours. I am still happy with mine.
I still have the packaging and I don't see anything about Phison. It states it was made in Taiwan and mentions corsair.com...I hope this answers your question.
Yes but be shure you have enough fans to prevent over heating
I've carried them on board in my laptop bag
Those measurements are incorrect. It's 3.25" long and .75" in diameter at its widest.
Your supposed to enter your code so the door unlocks
Yes, you'll need to use it in conjunction with VCDS-lite. There is a freeware version and a paid version.
Since it has a USB 3.0 port I have been able to connect a USB 3.0 HD but had problems with USB 2.0 HDs.
Yes, this TV has build-in tuner.
I haven't tried this tv with cable but this TV's picture is great.good for the price
No this is for WiFi connections not Bluetooth.
Well mine has red, black and yellow leads. They connect as follows: red - +5, black - ground and yellow - #3 and with 4.7k resistor to ground.
In my experience if the 5Vdc you don't need put a resistance, the 5V it's to do the work window is to polarisade it like you do whit other chips (integers)
no
Probably because at the time it came onto the market it was priced competitively as other Manufacturers were also putting out updated systems of their cameras. I am happy about it's price as I consider having gotten 'a pearl for the price of silver'.
yes. you can download a free app at the android store.
This camera software has no confict with Windows 8.
Matte. It's a good screen.
No speakers, no USB; just power, DVI, and VGA connections. Speakers would be setup through your computer.
yes
Make sure the remote and modem are on he same frequency, plug in turn on and snap a picture.
On the left side of camera, I opened the rubber protector thing, sorry not savy, and it plugged into there like a USB port, that's it...
It works with just the camera only.
Yes!!! In fact, it has a VERY good electronic viewfinder complete with image stabilization, object tracking, and smile and blink detection. For the money, a very good little camera. A little complicated figuring out all of the features at first. Just READ the manual.
No i've only tried it with an Uno, but you should be able to make it work with a Due, sample code can be downloaded near the bottom of this page: "http://www.sainsmart.com/sainsmart-1-8-spi-lcd-module-with-microsd-led-backlight-for-arduino-mega-atmel-atmega.html" and an incredibly helpful tutorial shows the pinout and libraries you need to download here: "http://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/arduino/sainsmart-arduino-color-display/" This tutorial uses the sample code provided by Sainsmart.
Yes of course:)
32
It will play all media file types.... As far as the gb capacity, I have mine hooked up to a 1.5TB external hard drive full of audio/video/photo files and it's never had any trouble streaming any of it.
For one, the cooler is different. The physical size of the card is significantly larger than the FTW. That is to account for the larger cooler in the Classified card. Therefore, this card can be overclocked more than the FTW card.
This version works in Windows. Since I don't have Mac, I cannot sure whether it works in Mac either.
Yes. As long as u have a motherboard with Sli support, extra PCI express slots, and the motherboard vendor Sli connector.
Yes, the Manfrotto quick release mount works on the manfrotto ball head.
Yep; that's the head I'm using them on. See: http://i.imgur.com/RK97bbU.jpg
The Wifi BacPac just sets up it's own access point...any device should be able to connect to the AP. What you'll also need is the GoPro app. I think the HP Slate 7 is an Android tablet that uses the Play Store...if that's the case, yes, it should work. I've used the app on my iPad mini and Samsung Galaxy Note 2 without issue.
Per GoPro's web site ...."For Original HD HERO cameras, the Wi-Fi Combo Kit will enable remote control, but will not connect with the GoPro App." So sounds like you HAVE to get their remote control if you want to use it with the original Hero. Hope that helps.
Yes for repairs. For loss due to non-repairable, purchase price is refunded and contract has been fulfilled then closed.
Not sure, but doubt it would cover both.
It did for my phone, you should ask square trade
If it has it some election's do not come with that protection plan
No
Yes, that is the full charge of your coverage.
Squaretrade plans are priced based on how much you paid for the device. So, not very many phones cost less than $99... The Galaxy S3 I bought was on special for $0.96, but the Value was about $700. When I ran over that phone, Squaretrade sent me a check to purchase a new phone... for $700. This was of course after they checked to see what the market value was, and the average cash buy-out price.
I had to file once on a warranty and had absolutely no problems or any hassles dealing with them.
I have so far and.it s like the one it came with.very good battery
As long as it outputs to RCA jacks.
You can use it for any phone you want. But, you will get whichever is LESS...the price you paid for your phone, or the amount payable under the policy, minus the $99 deductible.
Yes, that is one main reason I bought this one. I only operate it as a plug-in.
I'm pretty sure it's only 110
All I see on the user guide is a "Made Green" logo. Go to www.gpx.com for the "most up to date" user's guide, or e-mail prodinfo@dpiinc.com Maybe they can tell you.
You CANNOT connect an external graphics card (eGPU) through an HDMI connector on your laptop. HDMI is for connecting monitors. If you want to connect eGPU to your laptop, you need to connect it to PE4H and then to your laptop through Expresscard IF you have an Expresscard slot (few laptops do these days). If your laptop does not have Expresscard slot, it may have an mPCI-E slot instead and you will need a different connector (PM3N) instead of Expresscard (see: http://www.hwtools.net/Adapter/PE4H.html).
there is a chance it will work, but it is very slim. i attempted to connect a graphics card, but my Lenovo T430 did not recognize the graphics card as a video out. it recognized the card and all the software, but it would not push video through the card. ideally, since i was able to recognize the card, you should be able to recognize your tape drive
Yes.
Nope, it will not extend that far away from the corner, I only had 2 inches on both sides on a 55"samsung led and theres almost no frame to the screen
Yes it certainly will. It will work with pretty well most touchscreens, likely including your smartphone.
I used the regular one end cable and it works fine, never have to try the y cable ...
Yes. Wifi is just the "middle-man" from the device your printing from and your printer. Your wifi router (this TP-LINK wireless router) doesn't have specific drivers, etc for each thing that can connect to it, it just works. What you need to make sure of is if the computer, tablet, or whatever you're printing from is compatible with your printer (and since it's Epson I'm sure it does).
yes it should work with any cable system or satellite because my relative uses it and he has comcast i hope this helps you
I would doubt it. The 6 and 7 have different bodies and this item is very snug on the 7.
Yes. It has an anti twist lip that sits at the base of the camera, and having the L attached (it's detachable) makes it that much more secure. It's one of the reasons I bought it and I cannot imagine how spending more would get me a better L bracket.
No it doesn't.
It is " Barbie" pink leather all over exterior and solid medium gray suede on interior.
it will work if you are willing to put provided metal disk to back of case for the magnet to attach
I have my kindle fire hd 7" in it. It's a little bit hard to slide all the way in. It is kind of tight. But once it is in, you don't have to worry about it falling out lol.
I used regular heavy duty speaker Wire.
No
The short answer is no. This radio only receives VHF & UHF. Shortwave is HF & requires a different receiver & antenna combo.
My radio was delivered 9/9/13. Checked unit & says BF297. Only way to check if for firmware versions newer than 297 is with chirp software. Checked with chirp and is actually BF307
These radios are pre-programmed to the 16 law enforcement frequencies which are illegal to transmit on. A list of these can be found on google.
I use skype on a nearly daily basis and I have no problems with this machine
Yes you can pick up unsecured signals and the Mini 150 seems to help my wireless. It catches the signal just a tad better and probably gives me an extra icon on the "network and sharing" staircase icon at the right hand bottom. It's an extra little set of rabbit ears to help you tune in better. Then, of course there are ethics questions.
depends, if used on a windows system, yes. if you use a linux distro, you could turn the system into an access point with this device and receive wifi clients (and if that box has Internet on another network device, pass it through this device).
17(W) x 12.5(L) x 5.5(H)
I'm using same SSD and another 2.5 HDD without adapter and used the cables provided with the motherboard. The cables reach but barely and stay in place.
mATX and yes to the full height cards. I have a GTX 660 in mine no issues.
Go to the JLab site. To find the specs. If I remember right it is about 18" fully extended. When you mount it for a corner. Don't mount it in the corner, but to the first stud on a wall. when you push the tv into the corner the wall mount is hidden but gives you easy access to cables and mounting the tv.
This is not a question. Please be more specific.
I bought one earlier this year. I don't know that answer. It chargers my Nextbook Premium 9. Don't know anything about using it without a battery.
When the e17 is docked in the e09k the only input that is selectable is "dock-in". To select any other input it can't be in the dock. I ended up using an optical cable for input into the e17 and my headphones plugged into the front of e09k. The instructions that came with the e09k were a little difficult to follow. Hopefully my answer helped.
No, the switch controls the input to the device, not the output.
Yeah it is not normal for that to happen, i have used it daily for around 8-10 hours and i never had any audio cut off
Definitely new. I was very surprised to see that it is the exact same as the original that comes with the MacBook Air.
yes it will.It seem to be the only thing that will work. The original charger only worked for a little while.I can only use a car charger.
As far as I know it should work,, Did you check the specs on the web site to see what they say?
No,it did not work for me did not fit in car cigarette lighter socket,too short.
The laptop will not fit in the tablet sleeve, but there is plenty of room in the back section for the laptop to fit.
I fly with mine on various airlines all the time
Yes if the description says it comes with a mat it does. The mat is a 16x20 mat for a 11x14 photo. The frame itself can fit a 16x20 picture also. Thank You
Hello this is wind 7. Thank you
I have a Samsung one on mine with no problem
D1 CCTV resolution is 704 x 480 pixels and is the highest resolution the CCTV system can record at. High end digital video recorders offer this resolution and only the highest end recorders can offer D1 resolution at 30 frames per second recording.
I'm sure they make one for the nexus but you will have to check. Mine is specifically designed to fit a Kindle HD.
I use it exclusively in my truck. Works with the entertainment system using the Aux input no problem.
No. You will need to purchase a HDD separately.
Probably not. It is a tight perfect fit for an IPad. So the Samsun would have to be like the iPads.
It has neither WiFi or Bluetooth built in although I believe there is a WiFi adapter available for it.
Yes this product works; however it is glitchy on pc's and laptops. Works just fine for game counsels and Internet TV. Keep in mind there are better versions online so do your research.
Yes
Sorry, I`m not sure. I`m not the person who works with the system.
Yes, it is very easy to remove the trackball for cleaning.
Should work OK with any standard definition coax input. Contrary to some advertisements, this does not have HDMI inputs and is not a true HDTV.
I believe so
I have the manual but could not find an answer to your question
YES
I did, it worked well. they have two different types of electric sockets.
If the dryer is 110-220V, it will.
It's 19 1/2 inches without the ball head, and about 23 inches with the ball head and the quick-release base cocked to the side.
No. Not unless its windy i just add weight on the hook.
Yes, it fit my PXC300 but it was a tight fit. You really have to stretch it well and be firm with it. Once on it works great.
Yes you can put it on the Mac. The file format for video are AVI and photos are JPEG. You might need to use another program free at the MacApp store to convert files for iMovie, but you definatly can put files on Mac to share.
My gear pro never worked, and why I tried to return it after 30 days I was denied authorization do now it sits in its box, because I feel bad throwing it into the landfill
absolutely
Yes. I'm currently playing music via Bluetooth while both the device and Oontz speaker are charging
No. In fact the Samsaug repairman is due Monday at 10:30 AM how is that for irony?
it's 5 inches wide, about the size of a Samsung Galaxy S5, so you'll have to make up your own mind on that question. I have carpal tunnel and I like it
I do not know if it works with the "urbanite" product. I just know that it did work for the particular product need that I had.
A detachable cable. Completely detaches from earphones and device. I did not understand locking cable. Hope this helps.
Totally..just stick that little usb thingy in and it will find it. This is used on a mac ..but I have one for my windows 7 machine as well.
I haven't used it with Windows 8.x but as an IT professional I can tell you these things are plug and play for a reason. Logitech wouldn't abandon making drivers for this mouse in a newer operating system.
These will work in any computer that takes 3.5" SATA hard drives.
It is displayed on amazons website as such. They cannot sell something else in it's place. What you see... is what you get. Rest assured.
If this help, i did use two of them in a server that has so far 16 months working, never off. No issues so far.
Belt buckle
I dont know. It never really worked well for me. I cant recall if it worked at all. What I remember is that it broke up in 2 days... Useless junk.
The red button needs to be at the top for the picture to be at the top. There are free programs out there, such as Freemake.Com that will allow you to rotate and then copy your videos if they are not at the proper angle.
I got it for my son to use while skateboarding
You can use an app such as blue iris or live cams pro on the iPad. However expect the unit to fail due to firmware bug. Support is non existent.
They are not 30x60 they are not night vision, I am not sure of the power As a pure estimate 10x50 perhaps, They offer good magnification, when I bought them I was aware of the wishful Numbers claimed by evading the feedback, one buyer had worked out the magnification specs He commented the numbers claimed were rubbish, however they do have good power in my view Well worth the price.
I bought the micro sd card for Europe and also this update. I tried to load the update the night before the trip and I failed to get it to work. Allow time to get tech support before you go. I kept it to try again. Sd card was great. I drove from Paris to Biarritz in France with many stops in between. Then Santiago Spain through Portugal to Gibraltar again with many stops. Always had the streets big and small.
Yes
You can use the display port and the DVI ports at the same time. You will just need to change your display setting in order to get the second monitor to display on your desktop.
I'm not sure what the range is, but mine is on a different floor and about 30 feet from the router and it works fine
Just plug in the USB. And as long as you have a wireless network. You're good to go. N, G, B are wireless network types. They are the most common right now.
Lens caps yes. 60D is an unknown I have a 7d. The only issues I have had is it isn't suitable for low light.
It is designed to work with all Canon DSLR cameras using the APS-C format chip, which the 60D has. I bought it for my daughter who has a Rebel T3 and I've used it on my 50D I've borrowed it multiple times for travel. It is lighter and more compact than my 70-300 Tamron. It shoots great snapshots and travel photos.
Yes.
Very light, I've used it in my basement with a 50mm lense only. It will stay in my basement, not to be used for any serious photography.
Yes it fits under right side seat perfectly I love mine.
Unfortunately this box takes up the whole area and there is no room for an amp there.
Yes that's what I had till the dog chewed it up but yes it does work
No it will not stand up on its own.
That depends on the connector type on your strobes. The device comes with a 1/4 inch connection sync cord and an 1/8 inch adapter.
Hi, this camera has a timer with three settings: first - 10 seconds after the shutter is pressed; second - 2 seconds after the shutter is pressed, and third - photos are taken 10 seconds after the shutter is pressed and again 2 seconds later. I hope this answer your question.
GO TO JADOO.COM CHECK ALL CHANNELS, I AM NOT SURE.
They never give any warranty. I had issue with my box. They replaced it with $ 50 charge.
Yes
no. it has not.
Yes, it is. It is compatible with most printers. It is a fantastic product!
I think so but i i have not tested yet
Its 32 GB. Please track the item and deliver it ASAP.
yes. just know your number ;)
Yes it does.
Well it will work with Wii with the purchase of component cables, with the Nintendo 64m, and SNES with the purchase o S-Video cables, as for the NES I'm afraid it's incompatible.
I liked this when I first got it but it DIED in 2 Months ... but it does have mounting holes... get this http://amzn.com/B006DKEQL0 and then get a 3.5 adapter to 5 1/4 you will be much happier and all ports are 3.0 unlike the NZXT just the USB ports are 3.0
Yes
The Sharp remote: GB004WJSA/RRMCGB004WJSA does work for your TV, however, I usually pay half of what they are currently charging. So both model numbers will work, so take a look around. Good luck...PS, I have 3 since the TV is of the size to be seen all the way in my kitchen (split-level), and my office alcove. :D
58mm lens cap
Remote work perfect to may LG, but before you get one be sure specific remote of your dvd. Is good if get the mark and model of you dvd and see the original o relative close to work on it. Is more sure for what you lookin.
It should
It connects to both..
There is a flap with two snaps that connect the two parts, so they separate easily.
Yes
Yes.
Yes, you can cut the product. I cut it with a hacksaw. I honestly think you could cut it with a steak knife if you had to.
Yes certainly
No, not EASILY. You have to move either your head or the mirror so that the bright scene through the rear window is not reflecting in the mirror. It's only a small inconvenience, though.
Yes they do. The mirror reproduces the scale accurately as transmitted from the camera.
yes it does. it just clips on to ur existing mirror and wires are ready to connect. it is kinda hard to see on a sunny day
You want it to melt a little so it bonds. I do not recommend this product if you are going to put it on your roof. I put it on my firewall and it has since peeled off. I used the kit in the prescribed manner, grease remover and all. Hope this helps
110 V.
Nope, no sound. Problem was not with the sound bar however. The TV had digital output, the sound bar only had analog outputs. I did not know this when I ordered this. I should have looked at my Father's TV before I ordered a sound bar.
no, it doesn't. it's working quite well. sounds like yours is defective. we got the coby because our older one was doing what you describe. get a new one so you can listen to your christmas cds. happy holidays!
Yes it does work with Xfinity comcast. That was the reason I purchased it, and it works better than the modem that I was renting from Comcast. I don't get the interference or "Clicking" on my phone line like I did with the modem provided by comcast. I run everything through this Arris modem, like my Netflix, Roku, Apple TV, Computers, Lap tops and Tablets. I hope this answers your questions.
Yes, I download songs from Rhapsody all the time.
they are built better, made of metal instead of plastic with a video screen and better battery.
Yes if you use the attachment it comes with. I did not bother because I felt the amount of paint that might get wasted in the long tube was not worth the little hassle of refilling the attached container every few minutes. Plus it helped to remind me to make sure everything was tight and the nozzle buildup was clean each refill or two. It sounds like a pain but once you get in a rhythm it's actually pretty fast.
nI do not use this to paint your ceiling too much over spray.I would use a roller tried to use a power painter on the ceiling once took me two days to clean the woodwork.
yes it comes with micro sd
No, this is not a digital device. It is an antenna and has to be connected to the antenna/cable connection. Then you'll probably have to go into the TV's menu and set the TV to receive antenna and do a channel search for it to find and register your local over the air HD channels. Mine works great and I live in a hilly area.
2 SATA cables.
I would say yes. Mine is the same. It just screws in there. I use it every time in travel and get great family pics with the pole!
That really is up to the buyer. For example I can read books much easier on the screen of my 5.3" Galaxy Note than on my 10" iPad. Which would I rather watch movies on? IPad of course, but if I don't want to carry both, then the Note will do. This is why I've bought the Tab and will most likely sell the Note and the iPad. Personally a 7" screen seems ideal for me. But everyone will have to decide what works for them based on what they use it for.
Don't worry my friend, these HDD work. I used similar HDD but is a seagate 1tb....
Yes it is dark.
Oh yes my friend according to the user manual there is an option to play random in the current folder and also to play that way in all files.
I believe that you would need a mounting kit and harness connector and possibly a antenna adapter
Should work with Micro USB 2.0 and Mini-HDMI ports on Nvidia Shield.
I don't know much about the Samsung tablet but if it uses a micro as port then that kit has everything you should need.
Bigger is always better but the amp's terminals are made for 8 gauge, i run 4 gauge to a distribution block the from the distribution block to the amp i have 8 gauge, really its all in preference
Yes as long as the sub is wired at a 4 ohm load.
I have the Galaxy SIII and they fit perfectly. Go to the Galaxy site and get the dimensions of the S4. If they are the same as the SIII, then they will fit.
Yes, I have been very happy. Many colors depending on your mood!
The GLO provides gps services that any app (using location services) can use. I have used it with Navigon, Gaia gps, google maps, pocket earth, and Geosphere.
There is no port for an external antenna, but car, pocket, or plane, I've never had trouble picking up a signal.
Yes it does.
I do not know. I got my case from www.cellphoneshop.net and love it at one third the price. Check it out
The tablet goes into sleep mode.
IT WORKED FOR ME. My mouse stopped working and I didn't want to get one to tie up a USB port. So I bought the same model as the one that stopped working and it works with the built in receiver.
The i-Biason Folio Stand fit my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1. You can look up the dimensions online and compare with your Visual Land. At first, it fit snug, but I later realized I had left a lot of the protective film on the edges. Removing this eased up the fit and it works great!
5mm
Yes. I just put in " Lester Young in Europe "-{a burnt cd.}It plays fine. sincerely, Frank
If you referring to an alarm clock, then no.
It has a place in the bottom that allows you to attach it to a tripod. Your tripod should have a piece on it that you use to attach cameras. You use that same piece on the bottom of the ipad holder.
Hello there... not sure if someone has already answered your question, but here it goes... can't really tell you much about this unit's writing methods (just bought it for playback), but yes, it does come with software that checks for firmware updates on a regular basis.
yes.. i downloaded the amazon app store and was able to download the kindle app.. all my books came over and i can read them all with no problems
It is not retractable nor coiled in the middle.
Nope not for any practical amount of money , nor is there replacement screens available.. These things are junk and you'll be cursing at it more than using it .
Ray, it is wireless but I found it downloads faster when directly connected to router. I have Verizon Fios here and is super fast when connected.
This pen works with all active touch-screens, but not with capacitive touch screens like the Apple ones. If one of those typical $1 stylus types that can be used on iPhones/iPads won't work on your Hp stream 7, then this will probably work on it.
Yes, this camera will override oldest segment of regular recordings. Any segment protected by g-sensor event will be saved in separate folder and has to be removed manually.
According to their website this should not occur: http://www.cowonglobal.com/product_wide/COWONAC1/product_page_1.php (See "32GB MicroSD Card Support" near the bottom of the webpage). I only use the included 8GB micro SD and have yet to fill it entirely (However, the device power supply burned out which is why I was never able to fill it with data).
We used this: LED strip light connector one end 4pin male connector,another end new type 10mm connector,+BRG 3 of LED strip light connector one end 4pin male connector,another end new type 10mm connector,+BRG Sold by LEDwholesalers
I think it's 22.
As long as you have the SD card slot in the laptop. Not familiar with your model. If not, there may be an adapter option.
It has been a couple of years since I did these but I think I needed a longer space between the light strips to put one in one cabinet and the next in another and the only extenders that I found had two female ends and like you said in order to connect the two I needed these adapters.
The male pins have pins on both sides. I solder one end to the RGB LED strip. The female pins have a pin on one side and a receptor (female) on the other side. The LED strips come with a male end connected. So I make my LED strips with male ends.
To connect multiple strands of rgb led strips (color changing lights)
I, as a buyer like you, have been asked to answer your question. Well, I don't know as I have never tried to take it off. From memory I can't recall there being any adhesive involved so without checking (no access to the camera right now) I would say it needs to be levered off with a plastic knife edge. Good luck.
No, you need a microSD card for your tf100.
Yes. I just installed it and it works fine.
Yes. I have. Mac Mini (2012) as well and I installed this Crucial 16GB kit. It works great.
Personally speaking, I haven't had any problems after installing OSX Mavericks and upgrading the RAM with crucial memory from 8 to 16 GB on my wife's 13" MACBOOK PRO.
Yes it will. I installed this into my late 2011 macbook pro and it works great. No problems.
Can you confirm the following as specs to your MacBook Pro late 2011? "204-pin PC-10600 (1333 MHz) DDR3" If your answer is yes than you can go to 16 by using the 2X8GB. Make sure to verify the RAM compatibility, then order the right RAM, you should be fine.
1.) Motherboard 2.) Guide books 3.) Nvidia SLI Thing 4.) A couple SATA cables Thats it. It didnt come with a wifi card, i had to buy one, (Gigabyte makes one) but other than that it is a great motherboard!
yes. any adapter that complies with the homeplug standard (http://www.homeplug.org/) can work with any other.
You only have 1 RJ45 network port, so to connect more than 1 computer to the Powerline adapter, you would have to use a multi port network switch connected to Netgear Powerline adapter, and your computers connect to the switch.
yes
It fits but the item itself isn't noticed by any apple device. Have tried all of our apple products we have and still unable to get it to work.
No I will not recommend it
Yes, it uses your car FM radio to receive the audio signal from this thing. It plays through your car speakers. All you need is a USB memory stick to store your songs. I hope I understand your question correctly. I prefer the Satechi unit b/c it has a stronger/clearer signal.
Depending on the variant of the item you have, USB 8GB, SD card 8gb or 16gb.
No, unfortunately! See, I own 2 other MOGA MFi controllers (Ace power and Rebel) and I can confirm that none of them works with NOVA 3. Only Duo Gamer works with NOVA 3...which is natural cause this was one of the advertised title for the controller if I remember right
Try flipping the key around. The key basically has to twist 180 degrees in order to unlock it. It will only fit in the keyhole in one particular direction to allow turning 180 degrees. The other way, it will not reach 180degrees and will not unlock. I found that out the hard way, too, after panicking at a Starbucks.
I doubt it. This case fits very snugly with my iPad 2, and the iPad Air is noticeably thinner.
I think that's a typo. 2.1 lbs sounds right. I think the decimal is missing.
Sure will. If you should decide to get one of the new ones, they will not fit on your current setup.
It's 13 inches wide, 2 5/8 inches deep and 3 inches high.
Yes, the characters on the keyboard protectors are translucent and light is visible through them.
hi. I think that this case is compatible. because my laptop is a MacBook Pro 2011- 13" aluminum, unibody with Black Keyboard. With model number:A1278(is on back). the material of this case is plastic but is good. the proctect-keyboard is of silicone or whatever. and the protection case with the screenprotector are excellent for the price and safe.
Usually you don't need to back up your entire HDD, just the data and usually just the My Documents folder. And perhaps some other areas that you save data to. You can either use a backup program or just plug it in and copy/paste like you would any other location on your PC, you can also keep the flash drive plugged in and share it on your network as network storage.

It appears that it holds the focus for a set range--if you focus on an item at a particular distance, depress the Flash button, it will hold focus at that distance for the next frames!
Hi Angela, I'm honestly not sure! It didn't work very well with my canon rebel T1i. It was back in the mail after a week of many attempts to use. You might be better of just buying a more reliable flash if your not sure. Hope this helps you:)
No
My FZ200 says "Made In Japan" on the bottom. It continues to be an excellent camera. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
Yes. It makes good videos on live shows like rock and pop concerts. Very good sound quality. Check this out http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pr3HfJT66E
Yes. The lens is very fast, f 1.4 and with higher iso and manual control to set shutter speed and aperture it can perform like a digitalSLR camera. Low light, nonflash action always a challenge.
quite useless for my D 80 could hav put the money to better use
It will do both but I cant recommend this camera! After short periods of use the cameras' sensor developed "dark spots" that look like little black clouds on every picture. I thought it was a fluke or something I did. I bought an identical one and the same thing happened within 2 weeks. They can not be used for anything that needs a "clear" now picture and I will not buy another Panasonic of this type.
Yes I have a "Pluggable" brand USB 3.0 hub works fine on my iMac 2012 detects it immediately and burns flawlessly
Yes.
Negative Batman. The picture depicted with this is slightly deceptive as it is not an actual picture of the PSU. Actually a lot about this is deceptive, no 120/240 switch like it seems there might be in the picture, also the "cable management" part is also not really accurate, when I read that I think of this: http://tiny.tw/3eo3 but that's not what this PSU is. Otherwise it's pretty good. Been happy with it otherwise.
The AC adaptor input is rated 120/240V 2.0Amp 50-60Hz.
yes it comes with a power supply.
What I can say about this keyboard is that it is great and useful I really love it . Great quality !
It has a remote
Yes, two way crossfireX capable.
1st gen...... Didn't figure that out until I bought it....
You can try contacting the company directly
No you have to turn them on
John, I bought one for my D3200 and it fits perfectly. As for the D4 series I am not able to confidently say that it would or would not fit.
I don't have a D70, but the slip in piece is probably consistent with several types of cameras I do like it
If that is your intent, there is an external intervalometer that handles the shutter release. You can use the wall power without the grip. I have both. The set up and work the same way, just one plugs into the remote control plug on the side of the camera and the other mounts in the battery slot. http://www.amazon.com/Neewer%C2%AE-Shutter-Release-Control-Hasselblad/dp/B003Q9RERY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1397737835&sr=8-1&keywords=intervalometer
I think that is a different camera from the T3i, so it probably won't work.
No, it is really just a battery pack and is turned on when the camera is turned on so there is no need for an on/off switch on the unit.
Yes
I am not sure since I have a Droid, but it lists that it is compatible with HTC Tattoo and HTC Hero if that's at all similar to your HTC Inspire.
Not sure how to tell if it is actually an Apple product but it fit just fine and is working well. If you get this one don't forget the adhesive strips that you will need.
Great Question! No AC power adapter came with the Kaito. But there is an AC power port on the Kaito. The inner post is positive terminal. The outer shell is negative. 5 volts, 150 milliAmps, DC is required. The hole is on the smaller range, slightly bigger than a 3.5mm stereo plug that I compared to the hole.
It works with the Neewer TT560 flash -- not sure about the TT680 though. I don't see why it wouldn't. I am very pleased with the purchase...
it should as long as the radio is one of the following models: RER / REN / RHB / RBZ / RHR
Blue tooth connects to the uconnect module in the car. Has nothing to do with the lock pick device. Check to see if there are any software upgrades available for the radio.
I'm not a professional for 3D printers, I can not answer this. Sorry to disappoint. I'd recommend checking the TDP and power consumption of the printer.
It should! Kinda cheap set though. Worked on galaxy S3.
The computer I put the power supply in was an hp pavilion. The only difference is the addition of an on/off switch in the back of the power supply. The connects for data, power supply and hp's front on/off are all there.
Yes. This will definitely work on IDE drives. It had the standard 4 pin Molex cables as well as SATA.
The screen is eight inches corner to corner. The frame, naturally, is larger.
The front pocket can hold a small charger it depends on type of charger. If there is a cable for the charger it may have to be placed inside the bag with the camera. It all depend on your charger. The pockets are not very large but I am able to hold tteo extra batteries in one of the side pockets.
Yes it will.
yes this one is really easy to do. go to the GARMAN site. type in the model of your machine and all drivers are there for free no issues and even more updated than the cd. it is important that you choose the drivers that match your machine is all. have a very good day
Yes, well depends on your interior
It's on the very end you press it once it kills power press it again and it retracts up. This is the best extension cord I have ever used so good I have 3 of them!!!
It doesn't have solid frame but it have a good back support which may not allow you to fold it much, you can do a little but not like a shirt.
Yes it's perfect for daily use. Lots of pockets. If I was still in school, this would have been much better than the backpack I used.
The easiest way would be a simple DVI to VGA adapter if you want to make an extended desktop. You may also look up DisplayPort cables as a second option.
go into service and users it is there
I purchased it for a Motorola Xoom tablet. I was not the correct adapter for that tablet. Sorry I do not know if it will work for the iPad mini.
It comes with the dock and a power cable that plugs into the dock. When you put the tablet in the dock the tablet sits on the charging piece. My charger broke too (the part that plugs into the tablet) and I bought this to replace it--I like this much better than the charger it came with.
Yes
Shouldn't interfere.....
Yes, the entire range.
Yes its 3.5mm, not just for iPhone
I was hoping to use this in a Pico projector, but it didn't work. Honestly haven't tried it on anything else.
Yes, this camera comes with a usb cable.
Yes, it comes with a wrist strap. It doesn't look like the sturdiest thing in the world; I plan on adding a beefier one to mine.
This camera will shoot two modes of HD and in VGA as well.
MB did not work for me
I've no clue, & I know this doesn't have anything to do with it but 1. this isn't a normal Fuji camera made for the normal market; it's a walmart/kmart special, & honesly, my Kodak from about 8 years ago DESTROYS my Fuji in picture quality. There's NO setting on the Fuji that produces a decent quality photo. :( Mine just sits & collects dust...
It should
Mine has been in continuous operation, indoors, for two months and is not the least bit warm to the touch.
The SD adapter is there to transfer data from your computer to the memory card. Besides transferring data, the adapter is not used by the phone itself.
It appears to me to be a genuine Kingston part. The packaging and the part are both clearly marked KINGSTON. I am quite sure that this is a legitimate Kingston part.
A single male RCA subwoofer cable can be used and plugged into the L input. I have a receiver with a subwoofer out that uses a single RCA and this is not an issue. This is plug option listed with the included instructions, but is not very well documented elsewhere.
Purchased a couple months ago and yes it has auto on/off. Great sub! Awesome sound for music and movie!
They will sound fine with just about anything. I have a Yamaha 773 AVR and it drives everything fine from my ceriwn vega part monsters to my pioneers andrew Jones series speakers.
For 2.0 the towers are 3 way speakers so they will work best. For 2.1 you can get away with the bookshelf speakers because u have a sub. The bookshelf still do produce a good low
No, they are rubber pegs, but they work on soft ground!
My reiever gives me a maual option. I do the test and see which sound better on test. There is a slight variation in sound but only at lower volumn levels. As you increase volume its negligible.
Yeah but you'll have to get a dash adapter
Yes, it does have the iPod /iPhone connection to plug in. This model is a very simple player just radio and cd, bass and treble with very little power for sounds so you have to use controls from your iPhone to make things happen.
Yes, it comes with a harness for itself, but you will have to obviously cut the harness off of whatever car you're putting it into, and wire it to that, OR, get an adapter that will couple the two together without all the cutting and wiring etc. Most big electronics stores should have a database they can look at to see what adapter you'll need for whatever car you have.
as with any high end, late model camera of course it does
Yes, but you need an adapter in between. The Canon M has a slightly smaller mount. Canon sells their own for between $70-125 and the third party ones out there might be okay, not sure. I bought the Canon brand and it keeps the electrical signals, so AF works and AE works. It does have a small tripod foot on it, and this gets in the way if you want to use a quick release head, can't open the battery or memory card door.
Nope.. the camera mount of this lens only fits on the EOS M camera.
Sorry, No. This adapter is only for the Canon EOS M camera. Good luck..
Yes...it will connect but I'm not sure about the auto focus. I belief is that the auto focus will work.
Absolutely! It can be used as a remote. You can go to Canon's website and download the exclusive instructional manual for this speedlite. It is one of it's features.
No reason why not. It works on any standard hotshot.
They work perfectly with iPhone 4S. I haven't had the chance to test them with iPhone 5.

The short explanation is that it can only put out about 150 watts. Wattage is equal to voltage multiplied by amperage. With that equation you should be able to figure out the maximum amperage and as stated by James Peterson the current will vary based on the load. If your calculations show that you will not be able to provide enough current then i suggest multiple converters wired in parallel.
I never noticed any cropping. I think there would only be cropping if you got the wrong size for your camera i.e. magnifier is smaller than the lcd screen
Yes.
Yes, I believe it should work. As long as you have a screw hole at the bottom of the camera that you normally use for mounting on a tripod it should work.
The one I received for my 15 inch macbook did not have the dimples on top. It is all smooth.
I have a 15.4 inch Macbook pro and it fits and from what I gather MGXC2LL/A is a 15.4 pro, so it should fit
i believe the stinger is just over 77 inches , it don't matter once you put this KILLER antenna inline you'll learn how to drive to avoid trees , its worth going out of the way , if you've read my review you'll see how please I am with mine ,if you want to call me and we can talk about it 727-687-5749 my name is dave
No its not
Case fits well and looks great. Keyboard cover (free) is only ok. It does fit the key layout but sits fairly loosely on top. The edge doesn't sit all the way down in, so it comes loose often. Works as expected, just not secure fit. Example: after closing lid, cover sticks to screen on opening and gas to be settled back in place.
Yes, it will fit the new late 2013 15.4-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display
Yes
Yes.we have .
Not sure if it would Fit. I have a 2010 Rav 4, and fits perfect. I had to buy the adaptor for it to work with the JBL system. Definitely a great display, and accurate navi system.
These are pretty stable, I have a pair of two way bookshelf speakers on them. If a cat is rubbing up against them I don't think they would tip over. If a cat jumps on top of the speaker they could tip over. If you place them on carpet be certain to install the spikes, it makes them more stable.
You should be able to receive any programming that is not encrypted. Looked at lyngsat.com and Galaxy 16 does have few programs that show as free. Galaxy 19 has lot more.
I think if you use soap and warm water and some cloth it should go away and you can dry it with towel. Or you could try doing it with dry cloth and rub it and it might come off. I hope this helps. Thanks so much and good luck, a.
Any Quality Pre Amp should be transparent George. The Emotiva Pre is neutral as I can hear. So if Your going for more bass then get a sub woofer. Gerard Masters
I bought this camera for a friend who lives in Venezuela, and I had to weigh the kit for delivery. I remember all weighed approximately 4.62lbs
There are hdmi and rca connectors on the unit, so it should work.
Unfortunately not in the slightest. This memory woudln't physically fit into the sockets for the 755. You would need Non-ECC Unbuffered parts, we have 2x2GB as ASIN: B00D6Q2KNA
Hello, This is an 8GB Memory Kit containing four pieces of 2GB FB DIMMS. We recommend a listing such as ASIN: B008O52FG0 to meet 32GB.
Yes it is
I've owned several high end headsets and these are by far the most comfortable ever. Not to mention the sound quality off these are far beyond gaming company headsets. It's a whole different ballgame when dealing with actual audio companies versus gaming companies.
~2 meters for the headphone cable, and another ~1/2 meter for the USB module.
Angle of lens. The 06 gives a wider angle
That's where mine is. Its designed for outside & rain
Yes, the physical size of all the nexus 7's are exactly the same, so it will fit perfectly.
honestly man unless you have a pickup I wouldn't even buy this box,i bought for my impala and wanted to save space in the trunk and because its smaller I bought it, bad mistake the bass sounds boxie instead of deep as should I had a pair of octagon boxes and the bass was amazing I should have kept them instead of getting into this junk, aint even worth the money
Don't think so. The Hatchback 16 is actually too small for our needs and I will be sending it back.
Has fan, very noisy, drove 18hrs and no problem ( have it at 2 ohms)not a true 1500 but it is good power for the money
Don't get that amp bro..I had it on 2 12 sundowns and it got hot after about 10 mins and it's WAY over rated. save Ur money and get a name brand amp
I don't believe so, if I understand the question correctly. It only operates on a 2.4 GHz frequency. Following is a link to the product page on the Zyxel website so you can confirm. http://www.zyxel.com/us/en/products_services/pk5001z.shtml?t=p
It has an internal antenna
It does have a battery that at best is good for about 2-3 hours. You can hook it to an AC adapter with Mini USB plug for use in the house. When powered up in a car, it automatically starts recording based on car motion. There are a couple of other options for recording as well. When I turn the car off, it stops recording.
It works with mine.
Hi, thanks for asking 110V is ok, now , It depends with how many Amps works your AC, if is less than 10 Amps you are ok.
You have to contact amazon for that here is the link on how to contact them
I the sticky moldy liquid that you mention is from the air conditioning vent. That's what I think mine is coming from.
sure
Yes, it acts like a scroll button. It's a little temperamental, IMHO...doesn't always respond the way I'd like.
I generally have to change mine every three to six months, but I use this keyboard everyday for a solid 4-8 hours of typing. I wore the letters off the keys before I had to change the batteries for the first time. Hope that helps! I LOVE this keyboard!
Do you mean by the amount of keys being less like a laptops or the keys themselves? The keys are short and smooth like a laptop so it is quicker and easier to type, which is what I was looking for. The keyboard itself isn't that big and has 2 spacebars, 1 of which you can change to a backspace which I found to be pretty cool.
300 watt is the minimum requirement. It will run on this power supply but it would be better to have a bigger power supply
It is alot smaller it does not conform to the hand like the arc does. However the wedge does not require a dongle (the usb you plug into the computer) it uses Bluetooth so it is perfect for a tablet.
I have the same mouse and it is great. you should be able to copy and paste just like any other mouse that's how mine works. if that doesn't work take a look at your settings.
The device drivers are designed for the windows 8 operating system. Not for the windows 7 architecture. The difference is that windows 8 hot keys are designed to work flawless with its OS, functions like app switching, xbox apps, windows apps and so much more. Sorry that it's not working out!
As long as your connecting via Bluetooth, this keyboard will work on any device.
It runs on a USB I dont see why it wouldnt
It is medium, smaller than old Microsoft mouse
I have iPod Touch 5th generation 32 gb and it fits perfectly. My assumption is that all iPod Touch models from the same generation are the same size.
sorry only know that it fits the nexus 7
Its totally fine outdoors, definitely can see the screen. However if you are wearing sunglasses it is pretty difficult to see the screen. I still recommend buying it though.
Yes Thank you
im not 100% sure on this, but i dont think it will work, i ordered this for my fiance for her macbook, (mid 2009, stainless body) it worked with hers, but i think the older ones, are a bit different. like i said i am not 100% sure on this so i would try to do some research to find out more info to see if this keyboard will work with your laptop.
dear: you will received it at 6~12 days, please buy it at USA online, thanks
If you go off route either intentionally or unintentionally, it will recalculate your route and begin giving audible commands for the new route. If you mean can you give a voice command to ask the GPS to calculate a detour, the answer is no. It does have a detour button, but this model does not take voice commands.
I'm not certain - My Mom's tv is HD and is an LG - it worked with her Comcast cable box but my brother set it up so I am not certain of too many of the details, sorry.
The base is about 2 1/4" square. It is about 1 3/4" from the base to the Tablet Holder. I don't use the mounting Bracket. I have the Holder velcroed to the instrument panel of my Cessna Skycatcher. It works GREAT!!
The bottom of your cmera should have a screw s. I'm pretty sure it'll fit and mine goes on a tripod :)
I don't know that camera but if it supports wireless flash and so does your flash then no otherwise you will need a cord.
You need a standard USB port on your tablet to connect the hub. If you want internet, it has to be an Ethernet connection (hard wired land line; I doubt you will find that when you camp). The three USB connections work anywhere anytime.
I Don't believe it will work. Sorry but I am about 99% sure that the connections for the dock on the bottom are spaced differently.
It is advertised to work with the Transformer models (ASUS Transformer Pad TF201, TF300T, TF700T). So, in my humble opinion, I do not think so.
No. It's a specific connector and mounting configuration. It doesn't even work with all Asus transformers
Hi, the ethernet port works fine - have tried it in several locations without any problem. Same applies to the usb port - stick + harddisk no problem, but have not tried a keyboard. All in all a pretty good buy ! Good luck ! Hans
I'm not 100% sure but i don't think it is . Only because the keyboard for the 701 is not compatible with earlier Asus tablets because of the connector port and this dock has the same type of connector from the earlier keyboards
I don't have any of these items but what I know is that it was pretty easy to set each command which didn't set automatically just by facing the Philips universal remote and the original remote and pushing both buttons you wanted to pair. We're using this remote for few months now and we're pretty happy with the easy setup and the gain of space on the coffee table (1 remote instead of 4)! Instructions are pretty easy to follow.Hope this helps...
I am not sure but I haven't found anything it will not work yet due to the learning function. The learning function works pretty easily as well
You can get a replacement cable. My controler wont work when I use it in my galaxy s3 phone but it works when I use my ipod touch 4. It might just be your device.
Itis the same thing.
I've got a big head and their very light and comfortable!! If you like a lot of bass they may not be for you! I love the sound but I don't like a lot of bass!
Both should fit, i usually carry my canon 24-105 f4. which is a little over 5 inches tall, and 3.25 inches wide. it fits very comfortably, with a little room to spare even. a swap between the 24-105 and the canon 16-35 f2.8 is perfectly comfortable with both lenses in the case while its open. my 16-35 is 5.25 inches tall and 3.25 inches at the wide end. The internet tells me both your lenses are about the same size as mine, so it should work perfectly for you!
I may have one at home and could copy and send it to you digitally. I will be home by the weekend. PQ. Provide an email contact or mailing address!!
I'm not certain which cable you're referring to but, I haven't ordered a cable yet that didn't come with a disc. And if is doesn't you can generally find the drivers on the Internet. Check with some of the amateur radio sites such as QRZ.com or ARRL. It's been my experience that the minute the cable is plugged in, the operating system recognizes the cable and, occasionally, will install drivers from the Microsoft site. Really never had a problem getting one programmed.
While Baofeng radios can be programmed via the key pad, they do not program like the normal amateur radio HT would. They are difficult, at best, to program manually. The cable hooks from the radio to a PC. you program the radio with the PC. MUCH better! There is lots of freeware out there that works great. One that comes to mind is Chirp. Get the cable, it's worth it.
Yes
No, you do not need anything else. It plugs into the signal box via the included wire. Usually needs to be recharged, (overnight), after about 14 or 15 hours of use. No way of telling except you'll know by the slow fading of sound. Works well, fairly comfortable. The only drawback...if you walk out of range you'll get a loud rushing static noise in your ears. This device cannot be worn room to room. Otherwise sound is clear and sharp. It works for me.
YES! That's what I love about them. No volume on TV and you control the volume with your headphones.
No, I don't think so. All picture mode will have this fisheye effect.
MANUFACTURER ANSWER: Thanks for posting your question here! No, http://www.amazon.com/dp/B008OZF9SQ cannot be used to read sim cards. Sorry about that!

Vibration speakers use the surface you put the device into and make it part of the sound by vibrating it, I find that wood makes a nicer sound like study table, I put mine inside an office cabinet and you can really appreciate the base, hope this helps.
Both cross bars must be used. Total length of both cross bars, connected and not extended, is 62 inches.
It came with some mediocre games. I searched for some games and apps for this one but the result wasn't that promising. I returned it and ended up buying a used Kindle Fire for another 30$. It's (Sigo) simply not worth it for my 8 year old.
Hello, in answer to your questions...... no, you can't access the internet. I was also hoping that, when I ordered it...... also, no you cannot record live video or take pictures..... and no apps can be installed. really the only use I have really found with it is to listen to music. and even with that, it is hard to navigate. I hope this helps you..... Danny
The software suite works well, if you are willing to learn how to use it. It does provide all of these functions. It is professional recording software and is available free of charge. In fact, if you know how to set things up your turntable doesn't need the USB function. I've used the same software to convert my cassettes by connecting my TEAC cassette deck to my computer's line in. The software is called Audacity.
No. it does not.
The fieldview is NOT wide enough to view wall to wall. I install these cameras and you can get over half if position right. The farther the view the wider it gets. There are other cameras with wider view but cost more.
Yes
Yes you can control over the enternet, except enabling or disabling patrol mode which the camera can automatically move to a series of predetermine locations.
Yes it does. "It also provides a "Curve Warning" response whenever you are .2 of mile from a serious curve. I find this vary useful when driving new roads. Every time the speed limit changes if you are more than 5 mph over the new limit you will get a audio "Speed Warning" as well as anytime you drift to 5 mph above the posted limit.
Yes, it's settings will accommodate trailer trailers. Your tow vehicle will govern the settings for speed, directions, etc. and you can make adjustments for the height, width, overall length and weight of your rig in the specs for bridges and overpasses.
Yes, its an indoor/outdoor camera
What's in the box All installation accessories included * Pro-751 PTZ Dome * Wall Mount Arm * Ceiling Mount Arm/Bracket * PTZ Controller * Remote Controller (includes 2 x AAA batteries * 3-in-1 BNC/RS-485 Cable 60ft /18m * BNC to RCA Adapter * Mounting Screws * Accessories * Operating Instructions * Theft Deterrent Stickers x 4
I use it for a 17" laptop and I only use the center fan. With all 5 running I would expect it to work to keep a 25" cooler.
I have a 17" HP laptop and it helps cool it by at least 50%, as I play games alot. The 5 fans it has is a big plus! I highly recommend it!
Sure does ! And so much more. Extra lense and filters... a bag, filr transfer adapter . I love this. It will be a great investment. Promise you that.
This camera bundle was brand new. I love this camera.
I have a HP Pavilion DV7 and it recommended the same battery. Works well.
Im pretty sure it will, the 3 and 4 are almost identical on the outside but not 100% , I would take a chance if i were u but thats just me (these cases are amazing for the price) Good luck and let us know if u get one how it works out
It is a rubbery case. It does go over the edges, but I don't know how hard of a hit it could take with out damage.
No, it is passive.
The case has holes on the bottom where the coax cables pass through. A foam rubber gasket provides a weather tight seal. Inside the case is a regular block-like combiner. The gasket only covers the holes on the bottom. It is not continuous around the sides and top
Yes. Walmart has an amplifier made by RCA that has worked well for me. ($15)
Yes, I did that with mine. I use one as a router and one as an access point. It got rid of some dead spots in my wireless coverage. I also hard wired my blu-ray player to the access point. I get 100 mbs hard wired and up to 72 mbs wireless. I was quite satisfied.
It's pulling in vhf channels also. That's a pleasant surprise. I am receiving all of the channels I received via the uhf-vhf antenna.
I returned mine since it didn't get me more channels then the 2v but I use a winegard lna-200 with the 2v. Antennas direct has a vhf add on you can get from their website
Not sure, but don't think so as I've never tried.
17"w x 11"d x 3 3/8" h
Highly recommended! Check out my video with this recorder. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wOQtKBXE3Rk&feature=youtube_gdata_player
They are fairly low profile compared to other earphones. Can't say they won't break. Mine have been pulled pretty hard during ski season and still work ok.
Yes. Any canon lens will be compatible with any canon dslr.
Yes! The pictures shows 1.4, but when I click on the link it shows 1.8.
they should
Marmet you should have no problems with the Klipsch S4i on a IPhone 5. I have 4 different pairs of Klipsch Ear & Headphones and my family is all Iphones 4,4S, & 5. They all work flawlessly and are very accurate sound wise. Depending on which price point you draw the line at, each one are worth their price and you won't be sorry.
Yes, you are right, 8 cameras with cables and adapter, as well as one dvr (inlcuded HD)
you mean the 58mm DIAMETER of your 18-55mm lens? no it will not fit, beacuse this is a EF lens of 50mm wich the DIAMETER is 52mm. if you are looking for 58mm kits for ur lenses search on amazon those kits for 58mm wich is the DIAMETER of your lens. regards
Works on regular format dvd, not on my burned, and not on bluray
This device does not have an Optical port. It only has HDMI which transmits both the video and audio signal to your AV Receive.
Antennas are detachable - they are a screw on fitting
Yes, one would connect to your main router and the other one would need to connect to the other router
Haven't figured it out yet,google it. This is a great unit though, have backup camera and the mp3 player is awsome
Not really. You can set the tv to 3d while watching media shot in 2d and it will have a slight effect, but not anything great. It is more cumbersome to wear the glasses than the worth of the "3d" quality. This tv works best for media actually shot in 3d and even if it is 3d specific. I just watched the new Dr. Who ep shot in 3d ( downloaded 3d file -&gt; ps3) which was side by side and was probably the best quality 3d viewing I've gotten out of the tv.
I have two of these tablets and neither of the ports are big enough for the plug to fit into either.
Yes
You need a female USB cable. There are videos on you tube you can watch that show how connect e Keyboard to a tablet.
Ther is a slot for the memory card up to 32GB.
No, and I wish it did!
headphones, tablet to comp cable, charger, tablet manual, tablet, and one cable whose use is unknown to me. tablet is purple, has a few games, kindle app, docs to go, android appstore, and other goodies.
It comes with an AC charger/adapter but no case.
No, but it allows to use SIMS other than what the US provides
It's bad. I lost hundreds of pic and clips on it. I replaced it with another one
It is a wifi connection, so your internet provider will cover it for what your subscription is
It appears the unit does not save the last song played when unit is turned off
I use the bank to charge multiple devices at once too. I have found no real difference. I suggest you save the money and buy the older (bank) one. I still use mine daily and love it!!!
If the usb cable you plug in is in fact a samsung cable yes. This is mainly just a power source like a portable outlet. It works well with apple and usb mini which is built in. It doesn't have the new lighting connector but if i use the usb slot it charges.
I think once you turn off the 3D movie, they turn off automatically... There is a specific signal being sent out.
You would have to have an adaptor. The connections built in will not work.
I do not understand the question?
Yes, the unit can be plugged in while charging an iPhone (i.e., it works); however it's technically better for the charger to do one, or the other, at one time.
Depends on the TV. It worked on mine. Good luck.
In the other Garmin Glo Q&A (the model for vehicles, another good resource of Q&A and reviews on this product) someone said it won't. You have to look down to their answer for the specific HD-model response:
No, it is not wireless.
Yes,all keys have a blue back light. Caps lock comes up green when on.
Hello, I use this for 3 different Desk tops one is a Dell the other two are made by my son. I also use it for my Dell Laptop and 2 Kindle fire HDs. I love it we use to drop signal with my old router we have no issues with this and also have increased speeds.
This device works perfectly with the Apple lightening to 30pin adapter into the iPhone 5/5S or iPad Air/Mini Retina (although you must turn the BT off on your iPhone/iPad before pairing with whatever apt-x enabled device you want to pair it with). This assures apt-x to apt-x pairing. If you are not pairing with an apt-x device, you shouldn't get this model.
Yes it does as it works on the central portion of the phone which connects to the phone line. This central portion controls all of the cordless extensions.
it gets it from the phone line and it works just fine!
I bought two of them for my kids. They are ok for kids but I couldn't imagine trying to do any real work on them. Sorry if this disappoints you just being honest.
if it's the same phone that I have yes, My phones say Dect 6.0 on them.
*Package including: 3 packs battery *Type: Replacement Battery. Reachargeable: Yes. Chemistry: Ni-MH *Voltage: 2.4V. Capacity: 1800mAh. Color: Fruit Green *Unit Weight: 45.00g. Total Weight: 151.00g
Worked for me. Great service and deal.
Yes, both incoming and outgoing.
yes
no I did not receive only the US 120volt plug. I would assume any standard end converter would work
No
itried everythinfg with the bluetooth keyboard no use it's closed book on that decision was made by me carljackson 3 months ago i hope to stop coming a cross generic stuff because it's don't want work right and then i get burned didm't know better like usually do, i need a little bit more careful, the only thing that i could use just case that's came package.
yes
*Windows 8.1 compatible *2 finger support *You can use both touch and mouse at the same time.
Check for "Ultra Computers" store. They are the ones that sold mine.
Yes. Windows 8 does not require the touch screen to function but is designed to work with one. You can just as easily use your mouse and keyboard for typical functions.
It doesn't but "When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! I don't want your damn lemons, what the hell am I supposed to do with these? Demand to see life's manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons! Do you know who I am? I'm the man who's gonna burn your house down! With the lemons! I'm gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!"- Cave Johnson
this is custom sized to the new Sony Cybershot DSC-RX100. btw, not so happy with the purchase. because it is exact fit no room for spare cards and spare batteries as their would be in generic or even sony "pouch" type bag
No. This has only pci-e. However, the pci-e to PCI adaptor sold here on amazon works fine.
No
No remote, but does have English instructions. It is a rather nice system. We have enjoyed it and the ability to use a usb flash drive.
I purchased an original Kindle Fire probably about the same time and recently got a new Kindle Fire HDX. It works great on both of them. Hope this helps!
I don't know.. Sorry
They are canon lenses...the bag is zeikos, the filters are vivitar..... Definitely worth the money!
Khoi, you need to verify,call Sony @1-877-865-7669, here is a link also. http://store.sony.com/alpha-inter-changeable-lens-cameras/cat-27-catid-Alpha-Mirrorless-Cameras I believe it would, but check okay. Randy
Yes. The AC adapter is rated for 100-240V input.
Yes.
If you have the cable connected from your MacBook to the TV and both devices are on, the TV screen should display something like a background wallpaper or your desktop. If not, check two things. First check to see if you have display mirroring on (button on top right of your desktop next to wireless icon). Second you can check display preferences and make sure HDMI display is selected. Doing one or both of these should solve your problem.
I have MacBook Pro 2011 and it works with the Thunderbolt connection.
yes this is made by Lenovo and I use Lenovo Ultrabook.. and it works perfectly for my laptop.. I never used Thinkpad Yoga and so can't tell.. but if you have to HDMI port you should be fine..
AGPtek assembles this tablet. They check out ok. I don't know if it has a warranty beyond Amazon's. I got one and my friend got 3 and so far they all work great.
I like and I use so still good
no, its just one speaker
I have not tried with a MAC. The problem with this cable is that it is for older non supported technology. In order to use it you must have an older computer as well. Call Garmin directlyand they should be able to answer your specific question.
I had no problem with Win 7. I have a different version of the Garmin, but you'll probably be ok. You have to get the software from garmin.com anyway - contact Garmin customer service if it doesn't load.
No
I have used it to boot vista and windows 7 on a usb 2.0 slot. Not sure if Linux is diffrent but I would assume it would work.
Yeah, 3.0 will work on 2.0, just won't be as fast.
It has a hole bet is a little large for a key ring. It is fast though.
yes it can - no problem
Well for one that's not true. I watch movies on my ps3 and my flash drive is NTFS. I assume you could do Fat32 but have not tried.
This is a USB 3.0 device and your c720P Chromebook has a USB 3 port on it. Should work fine.
the camera slot is in the middle and your camera is to the side,so that is a problem .Other slots may not align,do check that.
The case is 8 inches by 4 1/2 inches by 3/4 inches.
No it's just the case.
I'm not sure. I have a nexus 7 and it fits mine perfectly
the camera slot is in the middle and your camera is to the side,so that is a problem .Other slots may not align,do check that.
It does work with my Mac mini but it is a slow drive, designed for backup purposes not really good for gaming
It fits our 1st gen
Yes, tested here, search page for "pixel." http://www.projectorreviews.com/viewsonic/viewsonic-pro9000-projector-performance-2-2/
I'm not sure but I think that it will work
Look at it real good to see if the camera can be used and your other plugs can be rea wn\ched without taking off the case..I love it..you might want to put in search cases for rca pro 10 tablet.. that;s what I o..when I'm looking on amazon...always find just what I need...
no voice recognition on this unit. That would be a great upgrade as the navigation is not easy to use.
Yess. All those accesories are included.
Yes it does , This is not a drum machine mind you, but a full professional band and i made a lot of recordings with this. .. Good luck and enjoy if you purchase this item it's worth every penny. .
My unit only came with a SD card (memory). If you're getting a package w/footswitch, headphones, & cables, that would be an even better deal. It can also take a Wah in addition to the regular footswitch. I don't want to "push" the product on anyone and I have no affiliation w/Roland or Boss but I tell you I was just using it 10 minutes ago!
Samsung UN46ES6150F

I'm not sure exactly, but as for the case it is for the smaller beats solo headsets the on-the-ear models not the over-the-ear models.
I do not know as this is for my grandmother. I believe you can show movies from the pad onto a television. It is a droid application and works much like a laptop.
I have a smaller Canon and it handles it easily. I think that as long as you do not have an extremely long and heavy lens, this will work for you.
I think 90 days, but it didn't matter because the thing crashed after 2 weeks. No customer service. A whole host of other problems preceded the crash. I returned it and bought a great one elsewhere for about $50 more. And it is everything I expected from the Google and more. Would not buy from tabletexpress again but Amazon was great throughout. No hesitation buying through them again, but would do more research on product first. Hope this helps.
The originals come off and these replace them.... and you only need one pair.
Outside measurements: 3 5/8 x 2 7/8 in. Inside diameter: 1 3/8 x 2.0 in Depth: 5/8 in Tight fit on my SONY MDR-V6
Sorry, I do not know, but I know they do fit on my Sony MDR-V150
Ear pads are ovals 11X9.5 outside, 6X3.5 inside.
Yes
It takes a regular SD card
Probably not - the cover - covers the ports to plug the keyboard in.
I do believe it should
Ordered from Bluesky, sent wrong one, returned. They refunded postage of return. Never received correct cable or refund. Seller moved and never checked box at Mail Box ETC
Yes it has as seen in pictures
I have the cosair 600w I believe the 750 Google the sizes it should fit
No. Mini itx form factor only.
Any 2.5 or 3.5" drive will fit.
If you are wanting the cradle for the Tablet, yes, it is. It is NOT the one for the phone. Be VERY aware, that your Xperia literally sits in this cradle, it DOES NOT lock in. It also comes with a small white adapter that you have to place in the back of your Xperia to work with this charger. DO NOT throw the box away until you take this out!
It is actually on the back middle of the device where the adjustable part of the stand is located. When the device is facing you, as in the picture above, it'll come in from the right hand side.
It is very good Amy but I have no exact measurements. I use a Nikon 7100 with a 500 mm lens for astronomical photography with no problems even at elevated angles. - Frank Komitsky Jr
Yes it has 2 8 pin power connectors for video cards.
No 32 only.. there is a model that can take 64 but not 128 yet that i know of... but OMG does it hold a charge... took it to europe charged it twice in a month seriously.. used it on every flight and all.. the worse was on the flight over 12 hours and watched movies most of the time on it tv shows never went dead but by the end it was close.. drawback is its like the size of an old iphone.
Try making sure its locked, go to settings and somewhere it lets you lock buttons and touch screen. make sure you are not pressing down the back/next buttons while holding it
How long have had it.i don't think you can
This antenna works with any tv that has a coaxial cable input....that's how the antenna connects to the tv and the cable comes with the antenna. Make sure you order the correct length cable.
No. I returned this for ViewSonic VA2446M-LED 24-Inch LED-Lit LCD Monitor, which is very satisfactory.
It will work with any operating system, but it isn't touchscreen.
Height: 11 1/2 inches, Width: 20 1/2 " Corner to corner: 23 1/2"
No, it's not a glossy display.
I feel like I have been using my current battery for at least 6 months. And I never turn the mouse off. I bought mine on 8/4/13 and can only remember changing the battery once. It lasts long enough that I don't notice it being a hassle, for sure. I love this mouse.
It is 3" long and 1 3/4" Wide. It is very small. Uses a AAA battery. Very responsive.
yes
The Mic sucks. I had to yell talking to my boyfriend:-(
As I only use mine for skype, and had no issue with using it just plugging it into the computer right out of the box, I can't help with this question.
Hi James, Yes, it works just like a usb drive so that you can copy the files onto your computer. That's how I use mine. I record files, then copy them onto my hard drive for editing. Not sure about the mini vs micro part. i think it is the mini. The cable it comes with has a regular size on one end, and the correct one for the device on the other end. Hope this helps! Doug
You might need to google the compatibility on these two when it comes to charging. Just look up and see if the two tablets have the same charger
It is acceptable. There are programs both in HD and standard definition. It does support HD. However, learning to use this device is a bit complicated, it is no as smooth as an Ipod or other Apple product.
I don't remember exactly. All I remember is that after 4 hours of charging it never operated. I charged for an additional 8 hours and still did not operate; would not turn on or play music at all! I returned it the next day and bought a Walkman waterproof wireless MP3 player. Quality pays for itself.
This is the number to call for help: Pyle service 718.535.1810 and somone will help you
Yes, they should if they fit tightly. Pyle supplies you with different sizes so be sure to use the largest one that fits to keep the water out. Happy swimming!
I believe that is when the green light stop blinking.
The MP3 player is in "PAUSE". Press the the flashing green button "Once", now the button should stay green and your music should start playing. Make sure that you have installed your music MP3 files correctly and that these files can be seen loaded in your MP3 player by your computer. Also make sure that your MP3 player has been charged. When the MP3 player is low on power, the power button will also start flashing. When unit is charged full, Button will stay green.
Yes. But I had one to begin with.
it has a sd card lot (expandable memory) that is it
It didn,t work at all.
Neither a camera or gps, this is used to detect cameras or hidden microphones...
Thanks for your question! Shipping rates, restrictions, and methods vary from seller to seller and aren't set by Amazon.com. However, this item is sold by a number of sellers and it should certainly be available for delivery to New Hampshire. If you are still having trouble I'd recommend contacting a member of our Customer Service team. Here is our Contact Us link:
Yes u can
Case 6.5 x 9.5 inches, 6 inches between the clips that hold the tablet in place
Yes
I currently use it with a Blackmagic ATEM me-1 switcher and it works fine as long as you have a HDMI output from your switcher.
Yes
Yes, I believe it is, although our team is having a hard time getting in touch with Spracht to confirm. Daniel SFTS Customer Service Representative --- Great products, great prices, great service. Straight from the source, the way it should be.
The knobs stick out 1/4" from the base panel. I'd imagine it would have no problem fitting into the Phantom Case. They probably wouldn't design a lighting system that would be incompatible with their own hardware. Good luck and enjoy! Great lighting system!
One of two things Ronald. If you can change the mode but only blue will show up in the other modes you either need to get a replacement from Amazon or make sure its plugged in correctly. The part that plugs into the LED strip make sure the arrow is lined with the plus sign.
Yes, it allows out if home streaming, but only if the content provider allows it. The major networks (ABC,CBS,NBC,and Fox), Viacom (Comedy Central, MTV), and Discovery (TLC, Science) all BLOCK streaming, so the TiVo stream does not stream or allow the transfer of shows to another device.

Yes it will!
I could not find a difference so I went with the cheaper lens and it has been very good. Since I don't have the II to compare I can't say for sure.. My only complaint on this lens is that the focus motor is noisy when shooting video On the canon 5i.. that could be a problem with all the lens.
yes
The cord at rest is approximately 18 inches. If stretched out it is approximately 48 inches.
Yes u can
You're right. That is not the correct measurements for this player. It is (10 1/4 x 2 x 8). The player itself is right at 2" in height (folded closed). The whole player is actually 10 1/4 by 8 inches. the screen is a 10" screen (which is plenty big for the back seat of a car). It's a very nice player though. Comes with the case to hang (mount) on the front car seat. Works great. Good picture (so far). Bought for our grandson. Been worth every penny. Any more questions...just ask. Hope this helped.
I'm not sure of the actual time, but its better than any other DVD player we've had. It ran 45 minutes straight, then 45-60 minutes, than about 90 minutes than again 45 minutes. All, without charging, just turning off between use. The player is great. Requires remote for volume chane (that's the only way we could do it). FYI: only negative, case is thin and useless for back of car chair head rest. We configured it with bungy cords and a sheet of plastic.
The unit turns on and off with the ignition if wired like this stock unit
This unit come complete with receiver, mounting sleeve, wire harness, owner's manual, radio removal keys, trim ring and wireless remote control.
No
5 feet 11 inch
Virtual drive software cannot boot into the CD/DVD ... and all those that can require operating system support of some kind.
It's an OEM product. It works great. Even comes in the Sony box still sealed.
All of our chips are always the latest version, which currently is v2015.0 (v16.50). Thank you for your inquiry.
We are terribly sorry, but we do not sell data cards. Our suggestion would be to look at auction sites.
Did you call and try return to manufacture? I wouldn't spent money to fix it, would return and get real tablet that kids can use and learn.
No. I wished that too, my daughter love Netflix
you will have to cross refrence the number of your old battery to the agptex 12 cells battery
Supposedly: http://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-radio-scanner-tutorial-decoding-digital-voice-p25-with-dsd/ but I have no personal knowledge. My RTL-SDRs are used for ADS-B decoding, at which they work quite well.
Yes. We use it with a samsung galaxy and an android tablet.
Yes, it's a good audio recording media.
You would have to buy a card or USB dongle to connect without wires. Very few motherboards have WIFI built in.
Yes the B75 has 1 PCI Express x16 slot the 970 will fit in.
DDR3 memory referes to the memory sticks you can install and is unrelated to your video card. Video cards are compatible with pretty much any motherboard.
no
No it is not.
Make sure you have adequate power supply. I did not receive one so I had to go to Radio Shack. Need cable from DSL/Broadboard green jack in modem to phone jack in wall. My "wall" is connection to AT&T DSL only (no telephone). Need ethernet cable from one of yellow jacks on modem to ethernet jack on computer (desktop for me). To effectively get it to work you'll have to call AT&T to get connected. They will talk you through it. It will take awhile. Maybe 30-45 minutes to do total set up.
This modem is nothing special but it does the job. It comes with power supply & cables.
It is a continuous light. And no you do not need a trigger control.
It's 32" from the floor to the light socket
1 USB cable coming from 1 speaker and the speakers are already connected to each. I've been using them for a couple of weeks and find the sound quality fine but I'm only using them because the built in laptop speakers are so poor.
Had my 2011 Ram R/T up to 80 + mph, and not a sound from the antenna. The Borla exhaust was rockin', but the Stubby was quiet
When I received my tablet, there were earbuds and adaptor, but no microphone.
Yes, it runs windows just like a desktop computer. But really slow, you will search for something on Google. Then you just have to wait til it loads. It's really not that bad, but try waiting 30-40 seconds for a webpage to load. I went back to my 1st generation iPad. The iPad is so much quicker and more responsive. The android tablet almost feels like a kids device, where the iPad is more for the adults.
Push and hold volume up And power button at the same time. It forces reboot.
I didnt find one... however i bought one custom made
I have mine under a boat slip roof protected from rain but open to most other weather no issues
No
What OS?
Yes it will. It works with any device that has a headphone jack. iPods, radios, iPhones, Kindles, etc.
Haven't install yet
Clear like glass window. I also bought one from Microcenter and it was as clear and was cheaper too. One from Amazon was better fit. Microcenter one I needed to force board into a bit. But both good
No it will not. this case doesn't have the cut-out for the extra USB ports on the B+
I never got it to work either
I posted this on the other question: 1. Go to Settings&gt;System settings&gt;Device&gt;Apps 2. Click the "All" tab at the top on the far right and scroll down to "Google Services Framework." Tap on that app to open the settings. 3. Now, tap "Force Stop" (and "ok" when the warning box pops up) and then "Clear Data." 4. Restart your tablet and enjoy the plethora of Google Play apps :)
Press in any area that is the body of a message
Mine won't even get that far now. Email is the only way I could contact the seller, and now that its been 45 days since I received it they won't help me. I looked up ZTO Technology online and emailed them for help before I submit a complaint for a faulty product and a short warranty on something like this.
The two holes are for the little camera eye on your kindle. One of them fits right over it.
No I just bought it for mine. It has holes on the long side instead of the top. The camera is in a diff spot
Shouldn't be a problem
there is no problem if it is not, you just can insert the sat that you need with the correct dishpointer coordenates...
Dear Sir, Yes you will be able to receive Galaxy 19 at 97w also this receiver is included IPTV Server and VOD Server for FREE
While it will receive FM radio broadcast stations and NOAA weather broadcasts, it's not its primary function. To be able to transmit on amateur frequencies, you need a license and having the capability to transmit on non authorized frequencies may get you in trouble. A much better choice would be a receive only portable radio...
No problem with mine. Fits like a glove.
All I've used it in others
Yes!!! For some reason it will not give me the option to highlight "tint" to change it up or down. It's not just yours lol
Very easy to install just drop it in the slot on the side of the Xbox 360 and Presto your all set and ready to game on.
Once installed your xbox will see it as an additional drive. You should be able to just select the drive.
Yes, I have the first iPad and it fits fine.
Yes
No ac adapter. Sucks because eats the batteries in no time. So rechargeable batteries is the way to go with this.
Don't buy this. It failed to keep my phone dry and the "guarantee" is only for the box.
my work fine--sounds like they didnt charge ??
No, it cannot turn 90 degrees. It tilts. You will also need speakers. All in All, I'm pleased with it.
It is 19 volt but 1.5 amp.
The way I found out is to go to Amazon and go under asus laptop. There you will be able to find the one you need.
It adapts power at 19V and 3.24A. Works perfectly.
It's impossible to say how long a DVR card like this will last. I've used several DVR cards for years and none has failed on me yet. This seems to be as durable as the others in spite of the low price. I would guess the life span to be many years. Just watch out for high voltage, heat, and vibration.
I own a Panasonic Viera 65" plasma which has a "Digital Audio Output" connection. I used a standard digital audio cable and connected it to my Compass Digital which in turn is connected to my older Bose CineMate speakers. The sound is great and there are no delay issues as reported by some other owners.
Sorry no help here but device works well from tv to stero receiver.
Hi Good Shopper! These cases will ONLY fit the Classic iPod. Apologies for that. Hi Joan! Unfortunately, all of our items are pre-packaged and stored in Amazon warehouses as you see them listed online, so we are unable to rearrange the colors in the sets. Apologies for that. Hope you're still able to find something that suits you well. If there's anything else, just let me know. I can be contacted directly via this link:
Hello Ophir! Maureen here from The Friendly Swede:-) The answer is YES:-) They will fit your 160GB no problem! If I can be of further assistance to you please email me at our storefront customer service link here:
Yes it has settings and the lowest dim is probably what you're looking for.
It is confusing/missleading on Amazon. The DS213+ priced at $399 does NOT include disk drives. Amazon have a seperate listing for a DS213+ 2200 with 2 * 2TB drive priced at $799 (showing out of stock on 12/15/12). I am still very pleased with my DS213+ which I fitted with 2 * 4TB drives. It certainly wasn't the cheapest NAS but so far has worked flawlessly.
They should definitely turn off. You can barely tell my system is on when in hibernation.
Yes, but any information on it would be removed during the install process. You need a blank drive so the disk station can format it.
Yes, I have it on my iPhone 5. Not the new 5s.
In the US wifi only Note devices of 16 gb and 32 gb were released on Aug 16th. The wifi + 3g (or 4g lte) devices will follow later once companies like AT7T and Verizon decide to carry them. However, quadband gsm/hspa+ 3g models were released in other countries. Currently both 16gb and 32gb unlocked 10.1" Notes are available worldwide. This is a Samsung device, however Samsung US will not honor the warranty.
Made in China but I love it. Worth the money
It will connect automatically , but it won't start playing . You have to hit play either on the screen or on your device. The player will put the song on pause when you turn off the car and unless it's playing when you connect it you have to unpause it.
Have you checked out your local Walmart? I just purchased this exact model online at Walmart and to have it shipped to my home was free.
patience it isn't easy but it will come off I put one hand at right where they come a part and grip the phone on the sides and pull a part they're tight they will get looser the more you take them off but I love mine I loved it so much that I bought one extra one so if something happens I would have a back up ! Wish they had more colors!
Yes, I bought a screen protector and it fits just fine!! :)
I do not see one. The only port is a 3.5mm stereo "Audio In" so you can run an auxiliary input if the CD or iPod dock do not fit your needs.
Hi there! The 3.5 mm port or the audio in jack is located at the back of the unit, just beside the power cord. You may be needing a longer audio cable for connecting an android device to this Sony CMTV10iP. -Ely
No. The Wacom use their proprietary technology, the Sensu Brush is capacitive and will work on iPads, Kindle Fire, Nexus, Surface, and smart phones like the iPhone.
HI I bought the brush for my wife and she has a screen protector on her iPad and she has had no issues - she uses the brush all the time.
I have not tried this, but I do not see why not.
It's pretty durable stuff, to their credit. As such, it did not cut well with an Exacto knife. I had better success using scissors after application
I don't know. I use for Callcenric.
Put battery(ies) in mouse, plug the transmitter (I believe it is in the battery compartment) into a USB port. Computer should install necessary drivers and it should work from there. I'm speculating here, based on other wireless mice. I had tried this one and it was broken right out of the box. My guess is that yours is broken as well.
Will not. This is made for iPad 1-4.
yes it does just push channel button, works very good. I have it attached to my dashboard, rain has no effect on it. I would highly recommend it
No.
Cannot answer this question unfortunately. I have MacBook Air 13"
If it weighs more than 2 pounds I wouldn't even attempt it.
yes... the tester requires a 9v
I don't know. I bought this camera as a birthday gift, and I can't even check now if it has this feature. The manual does not mention it.
Yes, it does! In the manual mode you can adjust the exposure time, ISO, aperture and the focus (not with the hands but turning the "menu wheel"). I use an old vivitar lens so then I have to use an adapter and in the manual mode (but then in this case, the lens doesn''t have communication with the camera so the focus should be adjusted with the hand). Hope it answer your doubt.
I think slightly sharper at the edges, shorter, more compact when collapsed, less zoom range, no VR. I favor the slight extra sharpness which is why I got it. If you're OK with your 10-30, I wouldn't bother.
Tell the truth I haven't tried as when I shoot video the battery runs down soooooooooooo fast it is worthless. I would buy this camera if you are going to shoot videos. Mine will not hold the charge long enough to shoot videos unless you keep changing batteries. I am disspointed in the camera and have returned it twice to fix and still has not been solved. When it does work the video is clear as well as th pictures though.
You need to power the card. I bought two 4 port cards and powered them off the SATA power in bay 4. They work flawlessly on my 5,1 under 10.8, 10.9 and Windows 7.
Yes, part of the package is automatic updates to the system. All virus software MUST update frequently, or the latest problems will not be addressed.
No,there is no volume control. For this reason, i was disappointed with that for te first time. However, the soud quality i think compensates this absence. I compared that with the 99dollars of monster ibeat and i think sennheiser cx275 has a little better sound quality. Worth for it
No, it's about 6-8 inches bellow one of the ear buds.
The pre-installed apps cannot. However, this is an android device. You can install other android apps for this.
Yes it does.
Yes you can stop it on the color you like and it will stay on that color
No
They are both AM3+, should work. At least it does fit FX8350, which is AM3+
I installed it in a 1990 Mazda Miata. I didn't need additional wires, however, you will need to know what your existing wires are so that you can connect the wires from the wiring harness provided with the stereo to your car's wiring properly. I did need to get some small wire nuts to make the splices. I suppose there's an outside chance that your current wiring harness will plug into the stereo. The chance is extremely small. Even though I was replacing a late-model Sony stereo with the CDXGT270MP, the old wiring harness was not compatible.
I bought the sony 474 after I had bought a coby and was not satisfied with it. The sony 474 is a great little mp3, its got a great sound easy to down load and the battery charge last a long time. I would certainly recommend it.
I am sorry but unfortunately no you cannot. But it will not damage the iPad in anyway without the case.
No, I do not think so. I think the dimensions are for size of the Ipad. I do not remember it being able to size down.
Yeah but the camera suck
they suck
Yes, it may work with Samsung Galaxy Pro 12.2.
I do not know what DVD-VR is. All I can say is that it works perfectly with German DVDs. I bought the recommended HDMI cable. Before I bought it I asked several "experts" in mmy circle of friends. They are retired engineers. I was cautioned that I would not get a god poicture with the HDMI cable and that I would get flicker. There is no flicker and the picture is as good as the HD picture I get from my Verizon FIOS connection. I plan on buying another one for my grand-daughter.
As long as the physical size is the same as ipad, it should work, however the holes for the cameras and speaker probably won't line up.
This keyboard is purely plug and play. You insert the USB node into your computer and then switch the keyboard on and you're good to go!
I may not know what you are asking...but the there is no hook. what you see in the picture is what you are purchasing.
I don't think you would want to shorten them any.
I emailed klilsch directly and they sent me a new pair
Real enough to stick in your ears and listen to music with.
Yes, my son is now 13 and still plays with it.
Ni idea, hace rato que ya se me dao.
Yes you can transfer VCR tape recordings onto DVD
No I got it for a regular ipad
Red Light means charging, and off means charged....that simple. Amber is only when it's on.
Its okay it works except that it is very short.
Yes you can. However be aware you will need a plug/adapter for your country. Are you in Ghana?
Yes, it most definitely does...this is built by Asus for Google!
As for the distortion %, I do not know. But I personally cannot detect any distortion during any of the movies, game or television.
No, this product is not an HD Radio receiver.
It can work with auxiliar cable, but definitely it works better sound better with Iphone or ipod
no
Those are shipping dimensions. The actual size is 4.92" x 2.5" x 3.94"
The one I received was version 2.0.
I have Cam 4PK-600, 4PK Hi-resolution 600 TVL security cameras with 100 ft. night vision. I am sure I ordered on Amozon. BUT, I had trouble with one of the cameras about 6 weeks ago and ask for help from NightOwl, even had a responce # of some kind, and NEVER HEARD ONE WORD FROM THEM. I am not impressed with the cameras at all. And the night vision sucks.
We do apologize, but because the item is located in our warehouse, we cannot confirm this inquiry. The best suited to give you accurate information would be the manufacturer. We are truly sorry for any inconvenience.
Yes, this item has a full internet capabilities and uses IE.
At least seven or more hrs
Not that I know of.
I use the device with an iPad but with the Marine Navigation software. The devise works seamlessly and flawlessly with that software. The Bad Elf website lists the compatible navigation programs for the device.
Hello Marilou I bought two batteries and the recharger kit and they work great!
Assuming you are using a MAC. You don't need an additional cable, just change the Output in System Preferences/Sound settings. I use the cable without any issues on a Macbook Air plugged into my home theater as well as directly into my Samsung flat screen. Of course the output depends on what you are connected to such as the TV or Apple TV etc
Banana plugs or what ever plugs in to tour receiver
the time displays as long as it's plugged in and it does not have to be on
No on both questions.
There are no headrest dvd players who are blu ray compatible. However the picture quality is excellent. Hope this helps you.
Yes, the headrest dvd players have the "resume" feature built in, it can be turned on and off through the main menu.
they should, you can also get the universal mounting brackets as well if you wish. That is what i got to guarantee they fit ok. They are http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D2I9XO6
Our laptop is a ASUS K53E. Yes the charger works with replacement battery BUT it would not fit or charge the original battery that came with our computer so we bought two replacement batteries. We purchased the charger in April. The led lights burned out but it still charges. It came with a one year warranty. It has solved our computer problems for now or at least until it dies (or I throw it out the window!!) ha.
Mine didn't work either..same thing..sent it back
They work with anything compatible with an AUX cable, the nook will work
Yes will work.
absolutely!
Yes. the YouTube app works perfectly. You can also watch via the browser.
As pictured, USB only, no adapter supplied, and there is no connector for external power.
I use a Monoprice 100722 Bluetooth transmitter adapter to beam out the sound to the best available speakers. Usually we have access to a Bose and the Big Jambox. They sound pretty good and they are both rechargeable also.
i didn't measure it but I have my controller about 5 feet from where the woofer is under a desk
Hi Jeff, these no support digital audio, but all HDTV support input these speakers with normal jack similar to hearphones.
Depends what the output of your mixer is. The sound quality will be lesser if using the 3.5mm instead of the red n white R/L, but if your mixer outputs to 3.5mm and you want it, there are 2 of those jacks as well. There is no 6.3mm input if that's why you're asking.
I do not have a I phone butut im sure it works much the same as any device, Push the button down on the speaker untill you hear a chirp, now go to your phone under scan for Bluetooth devices it will pair, and then yor next step is to connect , it should light up and show now connected . My Samsung tablet works like this as well as my samsung phone, hope this helps.
I wouldn't see why not. If you purchase the Canon mount it should work fine. I currently use it on my Canon 7D and love it!
This is a full frame lens. I've used it on my 7D, my Scarlet on 4K and 5K and on the Epic. It's a fantastic lens! You won't regret buying it.
Absolutely. I use mine nearly every time I shoot with the Blackmagic Cinema Camera. The only thing that you have to get used to is the manual aperture ring. All in all, it's a great little lens. I own the 24mm, the 35mm, and the 85mm, and I recommend all three.
If you look at the description this is a 2.4 volt 900 mAh battery. Voltage and mAh are units of electrical charge. I would just make sure those numbers match the battery you already have. You want them to have the same voltage as the battery already in your phone. I am sorry, I have no idea if they can replace BT1021.
All you need to do is focus on what ever you want to record and then press the auto focus button (AF) on the camera it should then stay focused, I haven't had any problems with my camcorder. I hope this helps, good luck.
The same battery that came with the camera is the type i bought. from amazon.
yes it does., also a much better camera than last model
Yes you can use it as a motion detector
I Don't Know, my tab is the older one and it fits perfectly.
No.. It won't fit, they're different.
I'm not sure if it will work with a TB display or not, try Google to search for the answer to that question.
The Sony V mount battery should work with the light.
It fits my dm4 1063cl. I believe the only differences between them are internal and should not affect the compatibility of the battery.
yes it works but after 2-3 months its function reduced dramaticly.
Amazon are very good with customer service, go online and chat with the customer service, they will exchange it for you or refund yourmoney. take care
Depends on angle of projection. I have projected movies on my vaulted ceil at 30 to 40 degree angles (using table top as zero degrees), noting to make sure you don't block the vents that supply air into and remove hot air from projector. An angle greater then 45 degrees requires you to make or buy a bracket that holds your projector firmly in place. Projector requires 5 inches in rear to exhaust hot air from projector properly.
That I really could not tell you. That is something you would have to ask their customer service guy Trevor about. You can reach him through the ariustek website or sometimes he answers questions on here. The picture is really good displaying movies and it looks great when hooked up through the computer so I think your presentations would look good too.
I don't think they would fit the SR850. The SR850 are pretty much the same as Superlux HD681 and these pads do not fit the Superlux.
Yes
I have not tried the "syncing" but I suspect that if you plug the USB end into a computer, you could sync it with a folder on your computer. Hopefully this helps, but I'm curious to see the other answers myself. I'm going to try it out when I get a chance.
Only know it is LCD/LED
I don't know. My husband contact Sony & they gave us the name of a local company that was able to repair the television, however it does not negate the fact that we will never by another Sony product ever again. My suggestion to you would be to contact Sony.
On the Sony XBR55HX950 Select: Home Settings Picture & Display 3D Settings 3D Display Simulated 3D (See 2D in 3D) We've found that the simulated 3D leaves a lot to be desired, but the actual 3D Blu-ray is very nice. Don't forget you need the active 3D glasses to view. Hope this helps.
No glasses. it's a separate purchase unless there's a deal going on.
I totally agree with you!
All of the connections are on the back. However, some go straight back and some on the back go to the side.
Hi Milton R., Thank you for your inquiry. Please know that our standard time for delivery is within 3-5 business days from the date of purchase. We hope this information has helped, please let us know if you have any other questions and we'll be happy to help you. Regards, Glaiza
No... CD/DVD drive. This is a Netbook. Get a larger Laptop if you need a CD/DVD drive. :-)
I never found it, event though there were indications that the OS supported it. I have a tiny USB dongle for my Bluetooth access.
Yes, it contain all the accessories.
Try clearing data from the google play app and the Google framework services app...worked for me
I am no camera expert by any means, but at times the flash is too powerful, and the low light pictures are better. I generally use Picasa to edit, and it will brighten the pictures and they look good. In extreme low light with the flash off, they are pretty grainy and Picasa cannot help them. I have only printed 4 x 6 images though, and they are fantastic the majority of times. Hope this helps!
Well it depend on the setting. If your on smart auto feature 3 second with picture preview off. But there are setting that allow you to take 30 pictures in 1-2 seconds.
My charger broke a week after I got it. But will charge through usb
No. At least I haven't found it
Yes it can. Its a bottom mounted and has two upper rear mounting arms to keep it from swaying. Easy to install and use.
No
If your motherboard supports the higher voltage it should be OK. I don't believe you can mix the voltage.
It should but I cannot answer from personal experience.
That depends what you mean by "monitor". Think of a tablet as a computer first and a screen second. Connecting a tablet to a digital camera via this device should allow you to access the files on the camera, and view or play them through a media app. I severely doubt you could substitute a tablet for a plain monitor or tv and have it work the same way.
It is fairly easy to install if you follow a tutorial online such as the one found on mymediaexperience.com/raspberry-pi-xbmc-with-rasbmc/ With the 8 GB micro SD card it should have plenty of room. I am not an expert by any means but there are many great resources online to help you every step of the way!
Not as is.
This is a really good choice. My IPOD 5 (in my eyes) was an investment. I will purchase what is needed to protect that investment. This case was the best for me.
It sounds crazy, but try popping the batteries out and back in, then slide the power button off and back on. If that doesn't work, check to make sure the batteries are good. Mine has worked like a charm, but the first pair of batteries were pretty weak and didn't last long. After I switched them out, I've been shooting for months on the same batteries.
No unlimited shots. Counting down...
fron 3 to 4 hours
yes it does
YES
There's one major problem I had. I couldn't get the pressure sensitivity to work with Gimp. I could get it to work with other programs though. There are some instructions on Google for fixing this, but I still couldn't get it to work. Also the drivers for this don't work very well, and I would have trouble with the tablet work and not work at random times. I recommend spending more and getting a wacom.
No idea, I bought the white one. Sorry
No
Yes
It should. My child carries a 12 1/2" laptop in it. The 12 1/2" is about the limit though with a large power cord.
If the motherboard has an open PCIe x16 slot this card should work fine. The card is specced to PCIe 3.0 but will run fine in a 2.0 motherboard. You may need to disable the onboard video in the BIOS however.
No it does not require any external power. No connector
Nope
That's a really good question. I would need to see your PC to be sure but I'm thinking one of two things, either you are not installing the proper driver or you are having a compatibility issue that I cannot diagnose without a more detailed description of your hardware.
It works with my Canon 60d
You need a personal computer with sufficient storage to install Blue Iris and store the amount of video that you care to store. You do not need any external storage device or additional equipment. Your PC's hard disk drive will store the video clips, and you can specify the folder where you wish to have them stored. I suggest installing a separate hard disk drive just for storing the video clips so that you are not putting so many disk write operations on your system disk, but it is not necessary to do so.
Yes it will!
If you mean the Amazon Prime videos for viewing, the answer is NO. That is the main reason why this did not suit my needs.
Kevin, I do not believe so. The system is powered through a small desk top device with a wireless sub. I fear you may "blow up" your speakers if you try adding an amplifier. This is an expensive but great 3-piece system. I like the fact it powers off automatically when TV or computer is shut down.
I have not had this problem so I may not be of much help. However, did the sreen suddenly stop working? Do you get any sound? I assume you tried both the remote and the button controls on the top of the box. Do your voltages match? (Assuming you are in S. America and not Columbia, Tennessee, USA!)
Speakers came with the receiver.
I has the same question when I bought it but to actually answer now that I own it, no you cannot. The two do come apart, but will only fit onto the 58mm lens with the macro lens attached. Hope this helps!
I know it can be used for things like certain commands, press combos etc. but From what I can tell they don't have any wait/repeat options.
I don't know exactly. I has a USB port connection and a adapter it is designed to be used with a standard PC.
Yes good grip nice mouse
I believe that PAL and NTSC are not compatible and would require a converter.
First, this turntable lasted less than 1 year. I took it apart and decided the power circuits in the board had died. Yes, you can play iPod through USB
It has an "Auxiliary Plug" & works for an Electronic Devise ( iPhone, iPad, Cell Phone, Kindle Fire HD...etc) Hope that I helped in answering your Question. XO Andrea1969
That is the weight of the device and the bracket. The unit by itself is less than 5 oz.
You will need to go to the following link, activation.spy-spot.com Once you submit the form it will take a few hours for the device to get activated and that's all.
Make sure the unit is charged and all 3 lights are blinking. If not blinking or only one light push and hold the power button. It is very tiny. Finally wait 20 or 30 minutes for server to recognize the device
None. Its an interesting question though. Considering you cannot playback movies on the device directly, unless you stored audio files there isn't a need for one.
Yes. I've been using it in the canon powershot sx50 for quite some time now.
The change is pretty much instant. It's like changing a channel on TV. Hope this helps.
AUDIO WHAT? TO BE AUDIO OR NOT TO BE AUDIO ...THAT IS THE QUESTION...wheather it is nobler to hook it up ot not hookit up?depends on if you like plugging in or plugging out a zillion times a day OR wow ...just hit the button and PRESTO CHANGE_O its done.No fuss no muss.M audio is hooked up to a fiber optic wire and every thing is cool.
Yes but be prepared to buy a power source
It should work. I bought this as a gift, but have a different convertor that will work with the CPAT machine.
Not very. I had to cut and rewire it for it to be long enough.
it works really good with my xbox one about the ps4 I'm not sure I just have the xbox one
Yes
I am sure there is some sort of waranty for at least one yr. not sure do would have to do your own research
No! It failed miserably!
It's wired
Yes, one year. It is a xeroxed piece of paper that states one year from time of purchase, for mostly internal issues.
No, just up, down,left, right
Yes
They attach to the inside of snowboard helmets made to accept them. They won't work for any helmet not designed for them.
This mount is rated to hold a maximum weight of 165 lbs.
I would say at least a foot if not a little more.
45 feet is most likely too far. I ran a video cable from the camera to the front of my trailer and connected to the Transmitter there and it works fine.
It did when I bought it, and a microfiber cloth. Been using and abusing the case for over a year now, and other then small pieces of the plastic paint pealing off, the thing has been great.
As long as its a Tab 2, 10.1 inch screen. There is a 7" Tab 2 i think as well. So make sure you get the right one.
No tone control.
Doesn't work well at all. Haven't tried anything but the HDMI, and it's almost impossible to maintain a connection!
Not sure what you mean. Will charge anything USB related.
Sorry dont know .
There is one aux input for a 1/8 " mini plug. (and one usb input port)
Yes, it's power adapter is 100-240v
The NETGEAR Push2TV does NOT come with an HDMI cable. The HDMI cable that you'll need has standard HDMI connectors on both ends. I had my laptop connected to my TV with an HDMI cable, so if you look at a computer HDMI connection and just get a cable with identical connectors at both ends, you'll have the right cable. That's easy, and it's the hardest part.
Yes, it comes with a USB 3.0 cable and you can use it to connect to a USB 2.0 port as well.
I don't recall seeing any warranty with the packaging I received. I dug out the boxes that I saved and didn't see anything, either. I can tell you, however, that I take a LOT of pictures and I've been using it for about 9 months now with no problems whatsoever. They last just as long as the Nikon battery that came with my camera.
I have only had to rely on this item, once, as a back up while my original battery was charging. So I'm afraid I can't provide you with an answer to your question.
It says it works with the 5300 and I know it does with the 5200 which is an earlier version of the same camera.
Yes. The charger is rated for 100-240 volt 50/60c AC, and comes with a European-style 2 pin 240 volt adapter that fits on the 120 volt blade plug built into the charger. You might have some trouble finding a 240 volt European-style receptacle, however.
No, it only has mini USB.
After about 6 months, I started getting the error message. I purchased a NEEWER Pro Battery Grip for Nikon D5100 EN-EL14 DSLR Camera from Amazon. Now, all I have to do is put the Nikon battery in first, and I don't get the error message. I have yet to completely run down both batteries in one session. Even with over 650 RAW images shot at an air show, there was plenty of battery left. As far as fitting the charger, it has to or it wouldn't fit the camera.
On my box it says 2ms, but man, this is more than enough in Titanfall battles @ 144Hz
The screen is matte
It is an android tablet that has the ability to be used as a monitor via and HDMI connection. It is not a windows based tablet.
Yes you can load Your photos in USB drive
800x600 pixels of resolution, which is 4:3. you can always crop photos or add a border to make 'em fit better... try a free photo editor like XnView. additionally: if you resize all of your photo-frame pictures to 800x600 and put them on a dedicated photo-frame card/USB stick (or the 128mb of internal memory), they will take up a LOT less room per photo than un-resized images right out of your multi-megapixel camera. they will be a little small for emailing and definitely too small for printing- but they will work perfectly on a low-resolution device like this.
I know it has a cord, but I'm wondering if it can operate on batteries...
No Alejandro it doesn't. I also have a Asus Maximus V board that does have wi-fi built in and it's a pain. You are, in my opinion, better off with the Z and just buying a separate WiFi board like I did. I think it's a mistake to build a wifi module into the board, it's just one more potential problem.
Thank you. Please see here for correct pictures for the P8H61-I R2.0: http://usa.asus.com/Motherboards/Intel_Socket_1155/P8H61I_R20/.
Yes and its not listed in the product description,but they are synced to tthemselves, so if one fires so will the other
110v only.
You have to buy a memory card.
I guess it would depend upon the wattage/heat output. I use mine with strobes that have a 100w modeling light with no problems. But, if you were using higher wattage tungsten (250-1000w) it may pose a fire hazard.
Yes
Depends upon your distance. It may work if enough light gets through the front face. Would not want to rely on it. I us the YN-603 wireless triggers. Very inexpensive and very reliable.
No, you can't. The knob locks the bar in place and you can't tilt it without loosing the knob.
It appears to be 30 inches. I am sure it would stick out.
Yes it have remote control
I'm not sure. It's being used in the Caribbean and works pretty okay video and audio quality is great via hdmi.
Yes it does
Both Leappad 1 and 2 are the exact same size. All accessories are interchangeable for both. I own both versions.
Yes it can. Look it up online, (even before you get it) and you can figure it out. Basically using a PC format the drive to FAT or exFAT file system. This can be read on Mac and PC. I did this. Had a Mac, it broke and I switched to a PC, used this to transfer my backed up files afer formatting it correctly. I also have since used it to transfer docs between other's Mac's and my PC. Works great.
Great product . . . easy to use.
Dear friend, Thanks for your inquiry. If you want order this item, you will just pay for the item price without shipping fee. Thanks a lot.
I don't know. I have been able to use it on anything with USB plug. If it has an app that you need to type or uses mouse I am sure it would work. Mine works also on DVD/Blue ray player with Netflix app. Good luck
To the 100ths (.12, 3.51, etc.).
I have had it take a little while, but this is really going to vary based on your location in relation to the satellite signal. I notice if I stand still with my arm up like I am looking at the time it works much faster. If you are tying your shoes and what not while it locks in, it's going to take longer.
As I bought this for my daughter I had to ask her. She said seven is the most she has ever used.
The lap function is hard set to 1 mile, so I assume you are refering to the Run/Walk interval option, which you can set either to any time up to 10 minutes. So you could set the Run time to 30 seconds followed by the Walk time to 30 seconds. At the end of each interval, there are 3 beeps followed by a 5 beep tune, which should be loud enough to hear. It does not vibrate.
It does track elevation, but you can only see it after uploading to Garmin Connect (it doesn't show on the display while you're exercising). Not sure if you can export to RunKeeper.
Is this a 2 way com ? or do i need another unit or a differant type unit to comunicate 2 directions?
Nope You connect a cable to the device, that same cable loops around your neck , the the ear piece goes in your ear. So no bluethooth only the pieace that goes in your ear is wireless
Yes it can, it works like a charm for skype.
My cam worked when I plugged it in , if the mike does not work need to upgrade the mike drivers.
No ! For my application it was not needed.
It is not a marine radio. I'm very doubtful it would serve well as one.
I doesnt have to be plugged in , you connect your phone via BT -
It works well for scuba diving. I prefer the video quality to the GoPro and Contour because of the video stabilization. You will need to purchase the ADA-RD1 with the flat port for underwater. Happy shooting
interval mode shoots continuously. every 5 sec., 10 sec. and so on... depending on what settings you choose. you can download a free app to your smart phone "play memories" so you can navigate your action cam and also has a view finder.
Yes it came with 4-pin molex connectors. I don't remember how many though.
If you buy this product in the US, il will only accept 110V input. hence an adaptor for using outside US/Camada is not enough. You need a transformer (or converter) that converts 220 down to 110V. This is not very expensive but it is bulky and heavy (few 100 grams). An adaptor just transmit the current but doesn't convert it (and then you would destriy the Bose if you input 220V)
Based on the seagate cheetah drive specs in its description I found that this product with an ocz vertex 4 had a read write speed of about 400mbs in my 2009 Mac Pro. So personally I would suggest using this. I did however try and dig a second ssd as it said it would or could double the read/write rate to 800mbs. However I never figured it out and just stayed with one. Hope this helps.
It has three pins, including a positive, negative and ground.
I believe there is a clock, but it does not display in standby, which is odd. In fact, you have to press a button to display the clock, so I rarely saw it or utilized it.
with sd card or usb will make work.
I have my Apple TV connected directly to the range extender and works well with it. Air play works fine (I.e. Watching an Amazon Prime video streamed from my IPad). The only time I had some issues was when I tried to use everything through wifi. The connection, was kinda slow, I guess Ethernet will always beat wifi when it comes to video streaming.
Nope
Clear pictures
Wish I could answer that, as I have a UV-5R.
I do not have those radios so I can not help you out. Sorry.
No
The first answer is correct.
Yes it does plg into a standard 110VAC outlet
According to the Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D3100), yes, that Nikon camera uses the EN-EL14 battery.
Probably not enough. Mine turned to toast all by itself. No way to repair. That was after around 16 or 18 months after purchase.
I am not sure what you mean by a metal one but I have used this soft box with 3xCanon 580ex speedlights with PocketWizard flextt5 attached with a tri flash mount. This soft box is as sturdy as any other name brand on the market for a fraction of the cost.
Yes is Stereo
you can send it by email with an attachment of the photo it has a mail app
I have no clue.
As a pro protograher myself, I bought this camera for casual shooting like on family vacations, aroudn the house, etc. I would rate the noise level similiar to what a Nikpon D200 was about 5 years ago... not as good as D300 but somewhere in between. Above ISO 800, moderate graininess. Hope this helps some.
yes - no difference is apparent. Ive charged the new battery with the new and old charger.
Worked great and is still working great
It's a moot point because Nikon updated the camera software about a year ago and these batteries are no longer "recognized" by the camera. Sorry.
Yes! It's a great fit!!!!
I just bought 4 of these and all 4 were made 20 sep. 2014. When I registered them with WD they gave 5 years warranty from the date of purchase which I listed as the day that I received them here. They were individually packaged very nicely in WD boxes with plastic shock protection supports on both ends of the drive.
I don't know why someone would say that. I have found them to be the most reliable drives I have ever owned. In fact, I can honestly say that I have never had to replace a Western Digital RE drive because of a failure. We have replaced some that were small enough to be obsolete, but in my recollection have never replaced one for any other reason in 9 years of business. Of course, your mileage may vary. We do make sure to keep them cool.
Greetings, this report is only for desktop pc, laptop using another model with other specifications, and are smaller memory modules.
Yes
GMRS is regulated by the FCC, and needs a 5 year license. FRS does not. http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/general-mobile-radio-service-gmrs
The MC-36A has a 10-point connection to the camera body. If the D300S has a corresponding 10-point connection the Mc-36A remote will work fine. Check your owner's manual or go to Nikon USA for additional information.
Yes I do have the MC-36A Nikon Remote. I still set camera to "Bulb" function and then use the MC-36A remote for delay, time of intvl. how many shots, and time between shots. Have you tried Nikon USA?
i am using the 800 so i dont know.you can always find on nikon's site directly.
I have both cards. Mobi moves everything on the card to the phone. The X2 will allow you to select the files you want to move to the phone by marking them protected with the camera. Since getting the X2 I have not used the Mobi.
Yes - my galaxy 4 reconnects automatically.
No.
I use the video very little so I can't really help. I have not had a problem with it the few times I used it, though.
Yes. It requires a double sided tape to keep on but can be removed and applied as needed.
No
this camera can be hooked up to a tv using a bnc to rca adaptor, and the camera comes with a bnc female connector, you will need a bnc extension cable as well maybe 50ft, camera only comes with 2 ft cable. you will need to get a camer power supply suited for this camera, 12volts at about 1 amp. this set up will allow you to view using tv, but to record you will need a dvr. cann be hooked up to a montior.
?? I don't understand what you are getting at.
Yes, with no problem
No memory card unless you get a bundle. Mine was a special offer with case, class 10 sony memory card for $182.. 4 AA Batteries, usb cable,strap and instructional dvd are included. Rechargeable batteries are recommended for extended use. Still a good buy for under $200.
Yes, you are right
sata
It depends on the VHS tape. A copy-protected tape will not record to any disk correctly.
Yes, they all look the same to me.
As long as it has a mini HDMI port.
I really don't know. It works with my Surface Pro 2.
Without doubt. The PSU has all current ATX connections and will also be able to support 2 video cards with your AMD quad core
It fits a standard ATX slot common on most desktops. If the OptiPlex has the standard ATX slot, then yes.
It is 1 pin.
you can use a cell phonw charger For a samsung phone or boost mobile
YES this pink Bluetooth cause fits my daughter iPad 2 just fine.
No, it does not include a map of Alaska. I had my husband check to make sure.
I don't know. But there is a selection for International
nope
Most new headphones are pretty sensitive, that in mind I would say yes.
This is a bluetooth keyboard which will work with any computer that has bluetooth capability. I tried it with every computer in the house and it worked; even with the one that I put an after market bluetooth reciever in.
I use mine with a Windows tablet and my Galaxy Note2. I have not personally tried with a S4, but did a short trial wit S3 and it worked fine as well. I'd assume it should work with S4, but doesn't have one to try.
I have no experience with the Samsung 7100, but it should work with any bluetooth device. I use it with a smartphone and really like it.
I think they would, I believe the 2 door has a slightly longer door, however they should still work, I love mine and was complemented at the dealer when I went for an oil change
Should be fine, but you'll have an extra set for the rear doors.
I am almost never close to the monitor or know that it has this feature. When I set this system up, and I have set up two systems in different places, I do not recall activating or that it has this feature. Otherwise, I love it and sometimes take the monitor out of the base to make observations. Being able to look in on both systems from my cell phone is a plus. Using my iPhone I can take pictures of my observations.
Mike; the only thing my info packet says is, RCA is in a global international market , and in house brands of electronics; so I'm not sure about this one. reason I bought RCA is our last RCA tv , we had almost 30 years, we don't need all the gizmos so this tv fits our life style. hope this is some help. Ron
Yes. It has the mounting screw holes.
I am not sure the exact wattage rating but my reciever puts 80w per channel and I wouldn't go much higher than that. The speakers are clear, but also keep in mind the subwoofer is not powered. I was unaware of this, when the description says "200w" I thought it had a 200w sub amp. I had to purchase a separate subwoofer. Average speakers for a low price.
The warranty is 2 years. I've had to replace mine twice in the last year, with no issues.
I have had a lot of problems with this headset since I 'upgraded' to Windows 8.1. I get intermittent 'USB device not recognised' messages and also the headset just stops working sometimes. Very embarrassing when I am on a call with clients. Have spent ages trying to figure out a solution - nothing yet.
this is universal lnb is working for any satellite receiver or satellite but you must program lnb frequency 10600
I do not know
It fits my T4i. So yes it does.
Yes with the ring attactment
matte
I'm sorry I have no idea about it
no
It works fine if you hold it in front of you about 6in. away. If you clip it to your shoulder and use it from there it's muffled and hard to understand.
The connections to the drive cages are plain SATA and a Molex power connector to power the cage, so you could put 12x2TB, 12x3TB, 12x4TB and so on. As long as the drives are standard SATA drives like (http://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Barracuda-3-5-Inch-Internal-ST3000DM001/dp/B005T3GRLY/) you will not have any issues. I currently have 12x3TB in mine with no issues.
You can remove the handles and the side brackets, which will remove the door as well. The handle secures the door. Are you wanting to remove more than that?
Sorry, I cannot answer this question. I only use the board for my tablet.
It should work for any 7" tablet. As long as you have a usb connector for it.
in nyc try radio shack
Perfectly so. You don't even need a technician to do it as it is placed but the same compartment of batteries with a socket like piece for plucking out and in during replacement.
Mine did, and I have to say it is a great radio. Perhaps not as powerful as the higher end C Crane's for reception but still very good. I am very happy overall.
You'll have to get an adapter to plug the keyboard usb into the android micro usb. It makes the case hard to close and is costly
Yes
No
The strap portion of the mount is simply a hose clamp with a rubber sleeve that will clamp to something up to 3.15" in diameter. Using a larger hose clamp from an auto parts store should give you the ability to clamp to a larger diameter if necessary. Stock TJ bars appear to be 1.725" and 2.25", aftermarket could be larger.
NO, I purchased a low profile bracket set elsewhere on Amazon and drilled a hole in it to use the fastener near the HDMI port. I used the full size bracket as a template. (overlay the connector positions and mark the hole, use a drill press and the proper drill bit...) It works in my low profile htpc mATX case. Reasonable improvement over the on chip graphics (i5-3570K)
No, unfortunately not.
Yes, since the cover has two areas where it bends, but there really is no slot on the back of the case to stabilize it either in portrait or landscape positions. If you use your ipad in an angled position frequently, this is probably not the best case for you.
A flip cover for the front.
Yes, this cable will allow you to attach a thumbdrive or external HD to your Nexus 7. If you are watching movies, I recommend Mobo Player. Be careful though, if you attach an external HD you will drain the battery significantly faster.
Yes, I have the GoPro Hero 3 and the mount/adapter fit perfectly. Although, I have to agree with the comments about the thumbscrew. I did switch-out the thumbscrew for one of my GoPro thumbscrews, because the one in the kit was to short. The good news - I've used this mount for a few months now and it has not become loose or shaken while I am riding my motorcycle.
You have to watch. Some fit 1" some will fit 1 1/4".
use a phillips head bolt and torque it down
If you compare the two products on Asus' website, it shows no spec difference. However, the pro has one less PCI slot for one more GPU/PCI-E expansion slot. Which on the grand scheme of differences is practically nothing. Oh, and the Pro has an internal eSATA port. eSATA isn't really in use for general users, so it probably doesn't make a difference except in price.
If you have the proper cord yes.
No. This is a basic headphone but it does perform well.
No you have to help it.
Looks like it will work for your sharp gx-m10 because it is running straight from the power source.
No different mounting clip on max
yes the must in order to view the cameras, this is not a wireless system
Hello, We offer extension cables in various lengths, which you can add to your order. Please see the links below: 100 foot cable: http://www.amazon.com/Q-See-QS100B-100-Foot-Female-Connectors/dp/B000N20668/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1367532350&sr=1-1&keywords=qs100b 500 foot spool of cable: http://www.amazon.com/Q-See-QS59500-Siamese-Copperwires-Colors/dp/B000GWTDL4/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1367532438&sr=1-1&keywords=qs59500
No, it does not have.
No idea, the size is pretty standard so I guess it should, I suggest you view the technical specs on amazon and compare the measurements
Yes. It can connect with any phone the has bluetooth. Including the iPhone 4.
I don't know the answer to that question. We bought this for a Ford Ranger pick-up, and a friend of my dad's installed it for me. He does this professionally. Sorry I can't be more helpful.
Yes
I am sorry, I do not know the anwers to your questions. I did not keep this tablet. I gave it to my 7 year old nephew, as a gift for making Honor Roll, and purchased the Ipad Mini, for myself.
You can add a Bluetooth dongle from Walmart and put it in the large USB slot marked host and it will work with it you can get the Bluetooth dongle for Leo like 15 bucks hope this helps
Hello Isiaka. G. With this model, the N8000, yes you can. It only accepts the "regular sized" SIM card like the one used in the SGS2, which is the phone I use as well.
I don't think so.. Too noise and not clear at all.
Absolutely it will work in that UHF band
It is called an MP4 player,but I never could get it to play MP4 files. In fact I had so many issues with this device that it went into the trash. I hope you have better luck.
An intel pentium 3317U runs at 1.7 Ghz, when there's too much load on the processor it will run up to 2.6 Ghz
The Nexus tablets are Google tablets and therefore they typically are among the first to get updates. Yes, it will get the update very soon!
If your set requires a "figure 8" power adapter, yes it will.
No, just the suction cup mount. You can order a permanent mount from Hummingbird.
Yes to both question.
I'm not sure I understand the question, but if you are asking will the transducer of the 143 work with the 15, I've never attempted to use any transducer other than the one that came with the original unit. If the 143 and 15 are the same size they should mount the same way. If you have a Bass Pro or Cabelas nearby ask the guys that work in the electronics dept and they should be a bit more able to decipher your inquiry. Best wishes.
Yes it does, and the brightness of the backlight can be adjusted from off to full.
Yes, Humminbird does sell a speed indicator that can be plugged into this unit.
Yes! Both Salt and Fresh Water
I live on a lake .... you can't really get lost , but use it for setting way points....
It is built in because it has gps
depending the distance between the dashboard and the placement of the transducer, you will need extra cable
Yes
It does not include us coastal charts. However, card slot there for charts, compatabible
Yes it can. All wires are bundled up to one socket that can be removed and two thumb screws on the side of the unit is all it takes.
yes it is a good match
I'm sorry to sound like a hypocrite but DON'T ANSWER IF YOU DON'T KNOW.
No it doesn't. the holster is good but I don't think the strap is long enough
Yes
Yes.... the note 10.1 is unlocked for any carrier
Yes
It is sync and charge and the website says it is Apple certified.
Yes, it worked for syncing and charging for about 3 months
It didn't even work at all. Don't get it! Honestly I wish I would've spent my money on something else. It's useless for my iphone 5. Maybe I got a defective one, but forsure it didnt work.
I think so... A couple of my students have used it and I know they have either the 5c or the s and haven't had problems
It does data.
Mine didn't work at all. It made my iphone 5s stop working.
It is sync and charge and the website says it is Apple certified.
No
It is sync and charge and the website says it is Apple certified.
no
Hi Sandra! Maureen here from The Friendly Swede:-) My sincere apologies for missing your question previously! Your question is unclear, but they will work beautifully with ANY touchscreen or capacitive device. Anything else, please let me know here at this link:
http://www.fujirumors.com/adapting-third-party-lenses/
No. However, there is a special link that provides for more manual fan control. Starting/stopping mechanical drives produces higher faults and lower MTBF times. SSD drives are not so affected.
It will work I have an enteral 3tb and the external USB 4tb seagate works fine...
No Amazon Instant Prime unfortunately.
Na, but I really would not buy this case. The zippers broke a few months after I got it and ended up buying this case after which has been amazing. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TZUS98/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1
No. It cannot fit additional lenses. camera with lense attached fits in middle. Little pockets on side for memory card or something very small
It's 720p hd that makes it about 1 mega pixel. The USB is attached to the camera and is about 3 feet long. I use mine all the time and all of my clients have said the picture is fine.
yes , i use on macbook
what is the warranty?
Amazon Instant Video through Amazon Prime is definitely available with Roku devices! That is the sole reason I have multiple Roku devices now. Love that Amazon Instant Video! Roku also has apps for many other channels including PBS stations. Check out the Roku website for details on available channels.
I am a customer of theres not the company ,but my son whom I bought this for uses it with an old monitor ,you may need an adapter,which they sent with it,but may need a different one,ask them or an electronics store like office depot or staples they should tell you
It does not. Just the standard 1/250th
Did not work connecting a computer monitor to a karaoke machine. I got nothing on the screen. Bought a very small led tv and used RCA to RCA jacks. That worked! Still Have this part in a box with other electronic devices that did not work for me.
That's a good question I will have to try it on one of the tables we have and post my findings
Any stereo headphone extension should work. Try these for options:
No. You have to add your own.
No. if you really need to make a run outside with no protection you want to use at least Non-Plenum cable with goo in it.
Each of the 8 wires is solid: copper clad aluminum in plastic insulation. The there are 4 pairs of wire, with each pair being twisted together (standard CAT5e cable)
I don't see why not - if it (Sony AZ1VR) has the 1/4" threaded hole in the bottom?
Rear
Yes it does. Just got confirmation with the cold weather
I use it with a GPSMAP 62st - seems pretty accurate, as long as it is out of direct sunlight
I use ther wall charger and the flashing charge light stops flashing when batteries charged Just as with the Nikon branded batteries They last the same amount of time too
They do work in the Coolpix 7100 as advertised but, not the D7100
From my (admittedly limited) understanding, the current GPU market, especially AMD cards, is being inflated by the "supply and demand" principal due to high demand for graphics cards in cryptocoin mining rigs. Many of these machines have 3 or more GPUs's set up. The coins mined can then be used to upgrade or purchase additional hardware. Meaning that the miners can seemingly afford the hikes since the money is basically "free.".
Yes, it will. Obviously you have a very small area to write, but the advantage is that you could write small drawings with the jot pro
Yes. You can use the standard apple cable
I am afraid I honestly don't know. Works great with the Nexus 7 but that's really all I have experience with.
No
12volt ciggerette lighter adapter
I believe it is. It is listed as compatible with HP DV6-2100 Series computers. Two other options to check: 1) Amazon sells another LB1 battery for the same price at http://www.amazon.com/LB1-High-Performance-Pavilion-DV4-2155DX/dp/B0077RYYZQ for the same price that looks like it is also compatible. 2) Search the manufacturer's website at http://www.laptopbattery1.com for other possibilities or call their tool-free number at 888.657.3888.
First, confirm that this this the correct replacement battery. Second, to be absolutely sure, take your laptop with the old battery down to a computer battery store or someone like Best Buy and have it checked. On my battery, due to the age of the battery, it wouldn't hold a charge any longer than 2-3 hours, so I replaced it. How old is your battery? Best of luck.
Processor is Intel 877 Memory is 4GB DDR3 Hard Drive is 320GB WebCam is HD Webcam
Inside dimension is 6x8."
Yes
I dont think it matters from a technological point. I have always purchased the CALS that I need and keep the proof of purchase. I have never done anything with the CALS. I have never had trouble connecting computers to a domain. It is very much on your honor as far as I know. If you find out otherwise I would love to hear.
I do not know how many mm's they are. That sounds about right when compared to a 3.5mm headphone style jack (IE they are larger than that). These have been working great for me and they fit into standard audio equipment that uses banana plugs.
It works in my 2011 Jetta
Dear Friend : the camera is not included.
As long as you have a mini USB port, i.e., as an Android phone has, or a Kindle Fire etc., it will work.
No
Most new cell phones, even basic models use a mini USB now. Although it's hard to be certain without seeing it, I would say it is probably mini USB that you have. Hope that helps.
I didn't have to install anything special for Windows but I don't have a touch screen
Amazon.com
Select-drag and double tap works just like a normal mouse+cursor would. you can also program functions in response to gesture types (e.g. number of fingers tapping to initiate function). it's pretty slick.
no i dont think so you will have to change the motherboard good luck
it has an SD card that you can remove and review.
I can't remember but this isn't what it's cracked up to be
Yes
The Intel Core-i5 3350P Quad-Core Processor 3.1 Ghz processor comes standard with a fan cooler. If you are building a custom desktop, assembly will require attaching the processor chip to the fan and larger metal piece that helps displace the heat from causing any destruction to your processor. Hope that answered your question.
3rd generation
I am not 100% sure it can but it sure looks like it should. I did Vista to Win8 so it just is a transfer cable that can handle the data flow. There is software that makes it work. Very basic. No reason to think it won't go Win7-7 or Win8-8.
Yes there are two antennas for the 2.4GHz radio and two antennas for the 5ghz radio because of the mimo operation of this unit both are N type connectors. If you need further assistance please don't hesitate to ask
That plays a significant part in it, yes. Less powerful mobile devices will have more difficulty keeping a solid signal over distance. However, the adjustable power output of the 700 helps mitigate some of those issues in smaller to mid-size environments. I can get adequate signal with a 700 on one corner of the block all the way to the other corner with low-end laptops, and every smart phone I've tried so far, still keeping the power output pretty low. All in all, it's a pretty good device.
I've only used this with Skype. I just plugged it in and then went into the video settings in Skype and selected the camera. Worked fine. When I've used this for meetings, my team requested that I use a headset for audio instead of the camera, as the sound is much clearer that using the camera mic.
Approximately 426 days, 11 hours, 21 minutes, and 5 seconds.
I'm not sure what you mean by "Vista Compatibility" I'm sure if will work with any operating system. If there are special codes for vista, the manufacturer could probably answer it.
Some random Googling of this question says it has MLC. http://ssd.userbenchmark.com/Compare/SanDisk-Ultra-Plus-256GB-vs-Samsung-840-250GB/1511vs1510
no it doesn't.
I don't know why it wouldn't. If that camera accepts CF cards, this should work.
The Nikon D3s may benefit from the 800X read/write speeds, but may need firmware update to take advantage of full benefits of the Professional 800x. You are correct in that the literature provided by Nikon is outdated, but reading over camera reviews indicate compatibility with Nikon D3S camera.
You may need a firm ware update to make this one work for the Nikon D200. I know that the 8GB works from there on up I think I would try them out at the Local camera shop the 16gb up are much newer than the camera. Check Nikon D200 Firmware updates on google then follow instructions to update your camera. Shutterbug camera shops will do it for free.
Yes.
Yes
Yes, very small ones only about 1/8 of an inch but they are there. The rubber is soft and very adequate to keep the unit from moving around on a flat surface.
No. It is only for full size 5.25" drive mechanisms.
It works with mine.
I mean it works somewhat not worth it try the logitech brand may be better
Yes, the pkay back of the recording is very good.
I don't really use the DAC part of mine. I use it to connect a better quality DAC that has no USB capability to a computer. It does this very well, and the $1000 plus DAC I'm using sounds light years better than the computer's internal DAC, of course. Given the low price, low weight, and small package of the Muse, I don't see how it could be a high quality DAC. It's the analog end of a DAC that determines its quality and sound, and analog quality is heavy, expensive, and bulky....power supplies, sizable capacitors, etc.
None, you buy your own HDD and install whatever OS you want.
The primary sound output for the Next Unit of Computing is via the HDMI port. This works well for most televisions but does not offer the ability to add a high quality sound card. However, if you are just using this unit to transfer your audio across a network then this product would work great!
no
Yes and no I recmed it to u if u want it on for A long time because it is hard to take off.
YES!!!! super good.. works like a charm
Yeah, but I took it off because it was too think of plastic to allow touch capabilities.
Yes, 110-240 (as stated on the charger). Comes with plug converter.
i purchased this case for a canon sx260 hs. if the nikon aw110 has the same dimension then it should be ok (Product Dimensions: 1.3 x 4.2 x 2.4 inches ; 8 ounces). any smaller and it maybe loose inside the case. any bigger by even an inch and it may not fit or fit too tight.
fit my Panasonic dmc zs15 it's very good
Im gonna say yes...the Title of the product is "1.8" Silm LCD Touch Screen MP3 MP4 Player 4Gb With FM Radio", so Id say yes, but if your still not sure, just google the Make/Model, you should be able to find a 100% answer. Thinking about buying one myself.
I believe it depends. I have used this to look at Jupiter and I could not see much if any cloud features. I have shelved this device and am trying an iphone adapter to take pictures of Jupiter and am only having slightly better success with that.
No
You can probally use photo booth or any type of live camera program I use movie maker on my windows pc and it works fine so I would assume any will work
Good question. I'm not familiar with the keyboard layout of the MBA 11", I'm using mine on MBP 17" (mid 2010). If the keyboard layouts are the same then it should work.
I still have not figured out how to use it. Sorry
It does all but charging the blackberry it worked with Samsung and otger phones
Yes, it comes with a wall charger. Battery life is great and it arrives fully charged. It also comes with a soft cover, but I do recommend getting a padded travel case if you plan on taking it with you so it is protected.
try hitting the reset button you will need a paper clip to press it in. Don't press to hard that most likely will fix this issue
NO, now it includes a disc with a users manual. It also has a separate wiring diagram, which is fairly user friendly. And it comes with directions for Mach3 debugging. Full of photos, and the English is only slightly broken. All in all, everything is clearly explained. EDIT: There is just one 5v+ wire per axis output. So, you probably need jumper wires on the driver itself. - Use the jumpers to connect EN+, Step+ and Direction+. (On this breakout-board, the Step, EN, and Direction terminals are negative.)
The ring that is permanently attached to the end of the lens housing has an inside diameter of 28mm and an outer diameter of 32mm. It's only about 0.5mm thick and the same black finish as the housing, so it is unnoticeable. It's been a wonderful addition to my Canon S95. Joel
The adapter ring sticks to the lens casing -then the filter attaches via magnetically to the adapter ring
There is simple software inside the .rar file linked at the end of the product description that provides a GUI to click on individual relays or even record a short sequence of steps that can be played back at various speeds.
Jose, the software is at www.sainsmart.com, at the "download link" at the bottom of the product page. For example, the last file on this link: http://www.sainsmart.com/zen/documents/20-018-910/4%20Channel%20USB%205V%20Relay%20Document/
If you look up the model number on the RCA website you will find the following under "Outputs": Digital Audio(Coaxial) 1 Rear Audio L/R Shared w/ Head Phone Jack Head Phone 1 Rear
Maybe you are sending a 720p feed to it. Mine works beautifully.
I don't know if there is a cap to fit this filter, but my filter has not had any scratches with nearly daily use for the past eighteen months. I keep the camera in its soft case when I take it out with me.
i used it in a dell 1545, it tripped a fuse on the video board, was only able to get the video to work again by soldering over the fuse, i used it in an acer laptop and worked fine.
It means two headsets. Each headset is listed as a pair.
yes, do you want to buy mine: http://bucasu.ecrater.com/p/20305436/graphic-card-upgrade-geforce-650ti
One
a pci-express 3 will work on a PCI Express 2 or PCI Express 1 slot it's backwards compatible
make sure the seller provides you with all the numbers on the reciever- then call your satellite provider and they will let you know if you can use it- If you dont have a card its a $20.00 charge
The 13.1" refers to the length of the semi rigid cable that plugs into the cigarette lighter. The cable then has the display mounted on it for your viewing. What I did was put the cable in an "s" curve to reduce the distance it juts out from the connection
I have had the battery in mine all year...still strong and no problems!
Yes, you can charge the battery with the USB cable that goes to computer and it also comes with an external wall charger. Also a second battery was included so you will always have a spare!
It comes with a 16gb which shoots 2 hours of 1080 HD video. I bought a 32gb which gives me 4 hours and 6 mins of 1080 HD record time
They are mp4 .avi files. You can copy straight from the card to computer and view them
Yes. This charger seems to charge my galaxy note 10.1 quicker than the original charger. And one of the best features is the cord length because I can now use the tablet while it is charging.
I do not know but do not think so. It worked for my Samsung Galaxy tablet, model GT-N8013. I would think a Lenovo think pad would have a different type of connector. Would suggest searching by the model number of your think pad to find a comparable charger.
I've got about 10 hours of footage on my first set of batteries. It uses A A's so carry an extra set to be safe.
Tight fit but it can be done. I just tried my honda key with the buttons on it and it fit fine. I didn't jog with it, I only tried it for the purposes of answering your question but I feel it would be secure for a work out.
There is a model that comes with a hard drive, but we chose to buy the model without one. We purchase a larger hard drive separately from Amazon. System works great!
It should, although you may need to download drivers to enable it on the Samsung. On a Mac it's plug and play. That being said, I wouldn't recommend this drive. I returned mine after a few days of use as it was really loud and clunky and would often reject discs that I tried to put in it. You'd be better off buying a name brand for a few bucks more.
Yes.
Hi.Yes it includes everything what it has.I had a few concerns though.I got a broken tripod and not the same carry case for camera.But I was happy that the seller had given me a $ 15 refund for the broken tripod and the camera case.Overall loved the bundle.The batteries and charger.. and you have even the car charger set in it.. the cleaning case and the memory card.. every thing is brand new..( except that tripod was broken).. The best part is the camera.. it has lots of features.. and it is very cool..for basic photography...
Yes
Yes work
Fully compatible the only option that will not work is using the volume button from the steering wheel but will work 100% have it installed on my 2005 Nissan Murano. 2007 murano uses the same system
Yes it has the fine focus knob which makes it very easy to focus in with ease and accuracy. A very well made microscope!
If you mean can you buy an eyepiece camera and hook that up to the microscope, then yes. Just buy a high quality camera. I bought a $50 camera and used my computer monitor to see the images, but they weren't of good resolution.
It depends on the model of the radio. If the radio has a connector that matches the plug to the earpiece then yes you can.
Well you do need a clean hard drive and computer that is put together to install it! :) I just purchased this, and installed it on my computer that I freshly built with a hard drive that was completely empty. You don't need anything additional except a computer. I would not suggest buying this system, though. Better off going with Windows 7. I've been trying to get rid of my version of this (it can be installed again on another computer) at: http://www.ebay.com/itm/Microsoft-Windows-8-OEM-64-bit-System-Builder-/171125918826?pt=US_Operating_Systems_Software&hash=item27d7e64c6a
Yes there is drm.
Yes...flip the ear hook around and it can be used in left ear
should work with any phone that is blue tooth ready and is easy to get started. mine i charge once aday
There is a button onthe back. Tap it and no more sound. Left side in middle. Also in manual. Great flash - enjoy!
Hello Mela. The box is about 8.5 in L x 4 in. w x 3.25 in. H. That's About 21.6cm L x 10.2 cm w x 8.25cm H. Please upvote my response if this was helpful to you.
Yes if they had reciever as well of any brand the can see as well
The Transmitter and receiver are both DC powered (12v) and each has a mini-jack port for a plug in transformer (two of which are supplied). The antennas are removable (SMA connectors). Input and output are through RCA jacks, L, R, and Video.
I think the only drivers for Win 7 you need are USB3. Hub chipset is Etron Technology, drivers are linked to Dropbox on their site.
Yeah mic and everything works well for my samsung phone and the play pause button works-ish?(95% of the time) but with the separate iphone/android standards don't expect anything else.
My understanding was that these headphones were built to work for iPhones and iPods. To the best of my knowledge, Apple decided to swap the contacts in their headphone jacks to work differently to defacto standard created by Nokia. If my memory is correct then the volume controls on these headsets should NOT work on anything but an Apple device
I don't see a problem with that at all. My problem with these is they don't fit in my ear canal, always popping out.
Great! It's really a great headphone. I use it everyday at the gym and they haven't bothered a bit
The battery is technically removable (for recycling and what not) but not designed to be user serviceable, so no, it's not replaceable and Logitech does not sell replacements.
Active noise cancelling happens whenever the switch is in the on position. So even if you're using the cable to connect to the phone via the 1/8" jack you can have active noise cancelling on by flipping the switch.
They work well with a Samsung Galaxy S4 Android.
I frequently use these at work, and will wear them for maybe 5-6 hours out of the day, with a few minutes for breaks every hour or so. I've not encountered any soreness or discomfort. The padding is soft, and the headband not too tight (and I'm 6'3" with a head size to match.)
it's not flat but they unravel quite easily since it's just on one side. just let gravity do the work.
Sorry, I don't have an exact figure for the length but I can tell you that it is long enough have the headphones on and have my ipod classic drop into my back pocket with cord to spare. Hope that helps.
I wear them over the head.
Yellow red white component plugs. It also has an or extender plug.
I do not know about Comcast - I have Time Warner Cable and the Cisco modem works but TWC does not list it on their compatibility list. Also TWC only allows me to use the Cisco modem internet port and will not support the modem telephone port. I use the TWC modem for the telephone port so I use two modems. TWC does not charge me for the their cable modem because I only use it for the telephone.
No. Bridge cameras are a single lens cameras. You can't interchange the lens, thus, there are no grooves to attach this lens hood.
Yes--you can also select how long the display runs before it turns off. The specs say it detects motion within 10 feet, however I have found it will turn on from about 15-20 feet.
It should. You will need the 3.5 connector. I have Magellan 9250 which has the a/v input. I ordered a cable 255-217 3ft 3.5mm to 3 RCA Camcorder Audio Video Cable from SF Cable for $6.66 including shipping. The red connector is what you will use.
Yes, it does cancel the noise around you.
7 inch Tablet.
You won't even need a mouse...This device works right out of the box and comes with it's own mouse but yes a monitor and the video cams and you are ready to go....
Not to my knowledge
Have not had a problem with that. There is a distinct transition when you extract the lens.
i don't see why it shouldn't. The 7750 doesn't require a power source other than from the PCI-e slot. The pics of the interior of the computer show an open PCI-e slot. The 7750 comes with both a half-height and a full-height back end. The only thing that I don't know, but I presume that you should be able to, is if you can disable the on-board video.
It works with a Vivatar 28mm (no 22800720). I think if it doesn't have the shield projecting from the rear of the lens (as described in the product description), it should work.
Hello Robert, and yes you can change the camera channel on the front of the unit. As a matter of fact, I rarely use the remote.
It doesn't come with a HDD and you can pop in any size, I don't think size matters. There's also an usb port, I haven't tried using an external HDD though.
We do ship internationally.
Yes. Nikon lens mount has not changed for a very long time. It is not providing lens and body "interaction" just physicality. Then there is math.
What seller did you receive your mouse from? The mouse listed in the add has 4 DPI settings, a knit cable and comes in a nice black box with Chinese writing all over it, if this isn't how you received it then you should see what seller sold it and report it to amazon.
It's incremental. You can feel slight clicks/bumps when you scroll the wheel.
No, it doesn't have any type of software to allow any rebinding of the DPI button on this mouse....Besides the button on the mouse the only other option is to change the sensitivity within the operating system.
Not that I have found. I have used it several times to call my wife and she was able to hear me perfectly well. But then, I did not buy them for the mic.
Although I'm not quite sure of the measurements of your tablet, this is pretty sturdy and I would think would hold it successfully. The actual (adjustable angle) panel that supports the back of the tablet is about 4 inches and should be sturdy enough to support it. It doesn't need to be from top to bottom of the tablet to support it successfully. Go back and look at the pictures on the Amazon page. The second picture shows it supporting a Mac Book (or is that a large iPad?). You shouldn't have any problems. I love this stand!!
Sounds like the quick release plate. Same thing happened to me. You have to loosen the part that the plate goes over, and I believe theres a small hole that the spring fits into. Just take a close look at the part that the camera goes directly over the top of, you should be able to find it. Pretty much the only way to avoid that problem is to not loosen the side of the slider too much, as there is nothing to keep that spring from flying out like that.
Hello Kim, I have the 800e. But it looks like it will fit from what Nikon says: http://bit.ly/1AzlPqc
yes, it should be no problem.
Yes you can!
I am using a 32gb card.
This will work :)
No. All the A/C functions work correctly and the temp and a/c information still displays in the top display above the radio.
Yes. Yes it can and if your a dayz player it will run it ok. Long as you cut the settings down youll be good and you can run the settings up alittle on more games. Its a good proceesor for the money
There is no cardboard in this case. The back casing is made of plastic. The surface material is PU leather (man made leather), the inside surface material is microfiber. The insert inside the surface material is PC board, which is light weight and very hard. You won't be able to cut it with regular knife. Thanks
We had the exact same problem, and yes, that is exactly how we solved it. Working great!!
It came with everything that it needed.
Although I have never done it, I believe you can hook up or plug in an antennae to it to get channels if you do not have cable or dish. Hope that helps.
Yes, 100-240 Volts. Should work anywhere.
No they don't. The antenna's are fully articulating and have a small wire feeding into them from the base. You cannot use this with any external antenna as it is now.
Check status-&gt;wireless-&gt;tx power. That can be adjusted and effects running temperature. So does the airflow through the enclosure, the Linux workload, and . . . There is some advice on the dd-wrt wiki:http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Wireless-N_Configuration
No, there isn't an ext port for one.
Yes. The latest build is 06-23-2014-r24461 and is available on dd-wrt's site under other downloads. Downloads others eko BrainSlayer-V24-preSP2 2014 06-23-2014-r24461 buffalo_wzr-300hp
After reading the documentation, I think it can be, but I was not able to do it successfully. That is the original intent that I had for this router, but after playing around for a while, I gave up and just used it as a normal wireless router.
This map is for use with the Garmin GPS system. I don't think it will work with yours. Thanks, John
Yes, you might need DVD Dual Layer discs, most movies and games are larger than what DVD+R discs can hold. This drive doesn't come with software so you would need to use your own but yes it does cd/dvd writing(burning)/re-writing and reading, just no Blu-ray discs.
No, there are no cables included with the drive.
Re: the low profile bracket, Syba saws the package does include one: http://www.sybausa.com/productInfo.php?iid=1291#tabs-2 Does the Amazon package NOT come with the low profile bracket?
No
According to Sony - this model can have it's firmware updated. HDMI 2.0 will probably be in the updates as it becomes more widespread.
If it has a USB port then yes
Yes, I think so. I can play Battlefield 3 and Skyrim on Maximum settings, at 1680x1050 with very very few lags in graphics. These are two of the most graphically intensive games I know. You should have no problem. Make sure you have at least a 500W PSU to run the card and the rest of your system. I have a 495W PSU and it runs the 2GB GTX 660, my Q6600 Quad Core Processor and 4 GM of RAM, no problems. This card also runs very cool under load, its worth the money. I highly recommend it!
"Supports four concurrent displays", "Two dual-link DVI connectors, HDMI and Displayport 1.2" -evga
Yes it will, for 10 bucks more you should get the evga gtx 750 sc 1gb
la tarjeta funciona excelente. la tarjeta no tiene salida de audio tienes q usar la de la pc
in my personal experience response time is just fine. I bought it because my software recording program sonar x3 Pro has a feature I can control the mixing board from the screen. as it turns out I don't really use that feature. But the monitor looks very good. I the touch screen may be similar to a standard transmission. It's fun for a couple days and then you wish for an automatic again. &lt;g&gt;
From memory a 400 Watt PSU is needed. I went 500 Watts just so I could have a little extra.
What motherboard do you have?
Not natively but any capacitive stylus would work as the screen is a normal 10-points capacitive display. There are a lot of available capacitive stylus on the market. Pick the one you like.
It comes with everything you need. USB, HDMI, DVI, and VGA. You do not need to have USB3 for it to work as it will work for USB2. It also comes with an installation disc but I did not need it.
Yes. I just bought it for exactly that purpose because Nuance's website has this rated as one of their best performing digital recorders with Dragon Naturally Speaking. Google "Nuance hardware compatibility list" and you can read their recommendations. I tested the DVT1000 last night with Dragon Naturally Speaking Premium 12 (Academic Version) and after doing the required setup, I was amazed at how well it performed. Super accurate. I recommend it.
As closely as I could calculate, about 8 seconds - which includes ~ 3 seconds to turn on.
My card runs Battlefield 4 quite/cool and I do not use any additional cooling. I think you need to evaluate the environment you have for your PC as well. The room I have my rig in is cool and well ventilated which I know is a contributing factor. If you plan to overclock too, that will be a determining factor. I recommend buying this card (or any) and run it the way you intend to, then determine if you need any additional cooling. I do run a Corsair H60 on my CPU.
Regular
The answer is yes. There are several models of the T100TA comprised of different features. This unit happens to be an older model in 32GB SSD. I have owned both the older version and the new version with 64 GB drive. The EVEcase fit on both.
If you only use one gfx card and not any other weird components in your computer then 600 is plenty
The answer is yes. There are several models of the T100TA comprised of different features. This unit happens to be an older model in 32GB SSD. I have owned both the older version and the new version with 64 GB drive. The EVEcase fit on both.
This case is horrible. I do not recommend it. It is cheap, the button broke off the case day 1, I ended up losing the money because it could not be returned. I purchased a much nicer case, FYY Fully Armed Leather Case for ASUS Transformer Book T100...This case actually fit the item. Sold by: fyycase
No
No
Yes, it fits my 17.3 Dell snuggly and beautifully. The power supply and plug also fits, but naturally leaves a bit of a bulge. I get so many comments of this bag! It is unlike any other ones I see in my area.
You will need to plug in a power connector to both the hard drive and the converter.
I bought two types of adapters. I did not use this one. I used the HDE SATA to PATA/IDE Hard Drive Interface Adapter shown for $6.50. I used it to connect a SATA Optical DVD player to the IDE cable. It worked fine. I would expect it to work with a SATA SSD Go to http://www.amazon.com/HDE-SATA-Drive-Interface-Adapter/dp/B002Y2NI4M/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1405960951&sr=1-2&keywords=HDE%C2%AE+SATA+to+IDE%2FIDE+Adapter&dpPl=1
No, it will not. The reason is that the HP dv5-2035dx has 14.5" screen and the LED screen I have bought is for a 15.6" screen. No match in the size ...! Does this help?
No
Yes very simple
High quality on both when taken with a high quality camera.
I am currently playing a digital copy of a video game stored on the card. Absolutely no issues. It should not be a knock off
32 mb, class 10 is what i use but you can use different class and size as well
I bought this model and the menu is in English.
It appears the 50LM is slightly thinner than the 2557, the model I own, it is a little tight but it should fit just fine so long as the cords are the same. While the description says it is a hard case, it is not hard like a plastic housing, it has more of a rubbery feel and is a little flexible, so it will stretch slightly if needed. If you do store the cords with the gps in the case I recommend placing it screen down so there is no chance of the wire connections scratching the screen.
Static. Like a screen protector for your phone.
This Package Includes: Panasonic FZ200 Digital Camera 16GB High Speed SD Memory Card High Speed Memory Card Reader Mini HDMI Cable (2) Extended Life Battery Rapid Home & Travel Charger Deluxe Case Starter Kit Starter Kit includes: Mini Tri-pod Lens cleaning cloth Lens cleaning Fluid Cotton swabs All together a very good deal...
I did not buy the Accident Protection Plan. I think it depends on what you are going to do... If you'll be in situations where you could drop or other wise damage the camera then buy the plan.
I don't know my truck didn't have that kind of system
Yes it coms with the battery and charger in the camera box with also a USB cable and HDTV one and also you will fined a cd for the camera
couple of hours
It uses the same cord as most non iPhone cell phones (USB micro I believe). Also great for using as a Bluetooth link to your car audio if you have a headphone jack/line in car since it's also compatible with car cell phone power adapters
if it has a HDMI plug in then you will need to buy that.
It's standard; one year. I have had mine for nine months now with no problem whatsoever. It's a great tv. No bells and whistles, but that's what we wanted. Picture is clear, no delay or pixelation in keeping up with sports movements, sound is good.
Evidently unplugging the TV reboots the software, and sets the TV back to its initial factory settings. I do the same thing with my Sony 3D player from time to time since it sometimes pauses briefly while watching a movie and it can be fixed by unplugging it.
Hi! Yes. On the back there's a port that is labeled "Optical Digital Audio Output". Hope this helps!
Yes, I think the LS is. If I looked at the right tv the CS 47" is a LCD tv. The LS4500 is a LED tv which is a thinner tv and the edges around it are smaller so you have more screen. I had a lcd Sony tv that I liked 32". The LED LG tv picture is clearer and brighter to me than any LCD screen I looked at. I would reccommend the LS. Hope this helped you... BC....
No
I have no idea-- I use it for my Garmin.
Currently, motion detection isnt functional on our NVRs. We are currently testing a firmware update for the NVR that will hopefully enable motion detection. So, I would check back in a few weeks to see if that is available. If you have any more questions, feel free to let me know. Best, Cameron Zmodo Technical Support unfortunately
It is all soft but firm enough to hold its shape. In your pocket the headphones feel kind of like a small ball of socks or a Hackey Sack. This thing is really great.
Yes
That is a very good question! I don't have a first hand experienced answer. It would be hard to pull the strap off your body, cutting it would be difficult, and unscrewing the attachment screw is difficult. I have found that when I have the strap on my body my left hand is usually on the camera, and I feel that it is safe. Like any pickpocket situation we must be allert of our surroundings. Donald.
Contact the manufacture of the mother board and the graphics card. It works great on my Gateway.
When I attach the strap, I line up the screw on the strap with the hole on the bottom of the camera and start threading it on by using (twisting/turning) the strap. Then once the thread has started I use the pop up "C" shaped crank (?) and then hand tighten by turning that. I never overtighten but always make sure it is snug then lay the "C" shaped crank flush against the camera. I hope this helps!
It is connect by cables
No Ivan dont waste your money
Yes
Yes m8 you can
it has 2 PCI 16x slots, 2 PCI 8x slots, 1PCIex slot, and 1 PCI slot
Here is the Comanies Product Page. Click the Tab which says CPU/Memory Support and Downloads. Download the PDF to see they mention at least a very similar model to the one you have? http://www.gigabyte.us/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4288#
I can't think of a reason why that wouldn't work. Your phone should detect that an external monitor has been attached once the cable is plugged into both and both are powered on, and then start streaming whatever you have on your phone's screen.
Yes!
No
I have a mini (not retina) and it is a snug fit. Also does not provide protection for the corners. I dropped my mini in this case and the screen shattered. Spend the extra $ and get something more protective.
It will only play mp3. I had to convert all my wma files to mp3. I was unaware of this at the time of purchase.
Did you follow the steps exactly? Step by step? Make sure the keyboard is fully charged. I found it very simple to pair. Try it again and let me know if you continue to have problems. I don't want you to get too frustrate because this is a fabulous keyboard case
I have the origami with the slim shell case it snaps on to the fire and looks like the back of the actual amazon fire case. It doesn't have the pocket the fire goes into so there is no material around the edge of the screen. The slim shell still has the origami cover which can hold your fire in different viewing positions.
obvious rip off!
2013
It appears that way came packaged new. My first Mac and the best computer I have ever had!
it is built in. you will be able to see the airports ssid
Apple operating systems have a built in feature called migration assistant that helps you move your info from your old computer to your new one.
No
you can always use step rings to normalize, but the native size is a 49mm.
Yes. Yes. Yes. And yes. The lens is fantastic and has relegated all my others to a dusty shelf. The pictures are crisp and the bokeh is amazing. Seriously, don't hesitate. You won't be sorry.
You don't want this lens for the a7. It will attach and take photos in crop mode. But you would be much better off with a full frame lens (either native E mount, or another full frame lens with a compatible converter). If you had higher quality non-full-frame e-mount lenses, those might be worth using in crop mode, I suppose. But this lens has too many optical compromises.
Yes, it does. Check out the specs and reviews.
Not sure - check with Sony
Yes.
Yes; it can be setup to simultaneously record stills and videos to two cards, or to split stills and videos between the two cards.
The a99 comes with a hotshoe adaptor to accept the older Sony flash units. I've used the older 56 and 20FM models with the a99 and they work just fine with the included adaptor.
No. Only pops up for use.
The angle of view is defined by the focal length. Since all lens manufacturer specify their lenses focal lenght for full frame the crop factor of APS-C sensors, which is about 1.5 is not considered. So if this lens is used at 10mm it shows the same angle of view as a 15mm lens on a full frame camera. Therefore the expected angle of view is narrower than expected. The higher the focal lenght value is the narrower the angle is. So the 10-18mm is a 15-27mm in the FF angle of view comparison.
yes and it is a great lens. very happy with it.
The kit zoom lens is f 3.5-5.6 depending on the focal length it is set at. It's a good snapshot lens. No kit lens is as good as prime lenses in my opinion.
I have this lens and use it with the Olympus OMD-EM5, it will work with any olympus or panasonic camera with the micro fourthirds lens mount, which includes the E-PL1 and what a lens it really very good at macro and a brilliant portrait lens
You can hold the shutter open for up to 30 minutes. Check out the live time function. It make long exposure shooting much easier.
It's an awesome set for gaming and its nice to have the 3D option because there a lot of games giving ability and it works great. I've tried GT5 in 3D.
CC, This model has 4 HDMI ports. You don't need a special 3D player; a normal DVD player works just fine. If you prefer, you might want to get a blue-ray player, instead. Hopes this helps you. I've had my set coming up on 2 years in February, and I love it. The only addition I've made to it is a Vizio soundbar. The factory speakers suck!!!
From their description the answer to your question is NO. You do not need a PC to be running as the camera has it's own IP address. However I am finding that the camera is flakey and loses it's address and fails to reconnect automatically.
I have a 2006 A4 with Audi symphony and after ordering was told it wouldn't work but a more expensive version would. I'd be cautious! Note: if I buy I'll purchase from Otto navi.
I have an 08 and it works with the stock steering wheel controls.
47" corner to corner or 23highx41wide I have a tape measure and my TV right here so ignore all the other answers
It's about 40lbs out of the box...not heavy at all.
Try and call Kocaso themselves. They'll be able to help more than nomorerack. It worked for me.
This is the # you need toll free number is 1-866-777-0079 But if you go on facebook and look them up ask your ? you get a fast answer .
Here is a review from CNET on that model tv http://reviews.cnet.com/flat-panel-tvs/vizio-e320i-a0/4505-6482_7-35471751.html
We set it up in 20 mins - took it out of the box (it stands up) and plugged my mom's cable line into it from her cable box. After it downloaded the channels - we were watching in just a few minutes. We also hit the button on the remote for internet, added the password to our wireless internet, and we were watching Netflix immediately.
Basically you can't stream any videos except, YouTube, Netflix Hulu, crackle and some news apps.
The cord is almost 4 feet long . I just have the twin. You can listen to samples on the Vox website. My actual headphones sound better than the samples I heard.
yes.They always require batteries
YES! that is the beauty of these I run an 8th inch jack from my computer to play along with tracks bands I work with load on drop box, my smart phone or my MP3 player. find I am practicing more. Love them. I wish I bought them sooner Mac
I would say so. With the right antenna, it is just as good in a pinch as my yaesu vx8r. It is also 1/3 the price
It's a base or mobile unit. It comes with standard 110 volt plug in and a 12 volt cigarette lighter plug in. It has a base unit extendable antenna and a mobile windshield mount antenna. Everything's included in the box. Hope this answers your question, it's a great little unit.
Would depend on the dimensions of your computer.
Under technical details, it says Speed: 5400 rpm Also, this is the 0G02428 model, which is a 5400 drive. For the 7200 drive, you want the 0G02874 model.
no it will glare back at camera
it did not work for me ,had to return it.,adhesive ring was not holding to the lens unfortunately !! I am not using any filter at all !!
I donot know, With 500 gigs and 4 cameras set to highest definition I get about 2 weeks recording before it records on top of the older recording. You can set to motion detect which will greatly increase record days.
Yes it is compatable with all Windows systems
The system comes with wires that has the video and power in them,, just run wire from box to camera and of course connect box to a tv or computer screen and you will see images, you can connect up to 8 cameras to the box, each came am will have its own wire,, good luck
I'm sorry, I have actually not worked with it yet, and won't have a chance until summer. It is pretty heavy.
We have 1600 songs with room for more
3000 to 4000 tunes... What I really love is the FM radio in it.
Yes it does...
sure you can, just take the music from the cd (rip, it won't do anything to harm the cd) and add it to your itunes library and then synch it to the ipod.
You will need a PC or laptop with a USB port. You connect the shuffle to your PC, and it launches iTunes, where you can create a playlist to copy to the shuffle.
It's as simple as it looks and very easy to use.
No it does not!
yeah it comes with earphones
You would have to get separate clip.
You can use any kind. I use Sony earbuds and they work fine.
Hi, the shuffle comes with a usb cable with a headphone jack in the end that connects to de iPod, used to sync and charge. Haven't tried speakers but I think you can use any speakers that connect with a headphone jack.
No, I only have it in Black.
The only iPod that has a hard drive any more is the Classic. All others use flash memory. That's why they can make them so small.
Yes
They come with the. Non-speaker headphones just for listening music.
Because this item is sold from a variety of sellers, check the "Sold by" line, and contact the seller and ask if the item is new, and in a sealed package. when you register the item with apple your warranty SHOULD be valid but be sure to purchase from a reputable source.
If you have a wireless router, NO. Apps download quickly and iPod reminds you when there are updates. Tunes download COMPUTER FREE and the next time you open iTunes on your computer, it automatically downloads the tunes you downloaded on your iPod. The same happens if you purchased on the computer 1st: the iPod updates purchases. I hope this answers your question.
No its just for music and downloaded books.
specs say 30hrs...i get about that much, however i like to use blu tooth headphones which cuts that time in half to about 12-15 hrs
Yes!!!!!!
Yes.
I purchased two from this vendor, white and black and both were new in sealed factory boxes with warranty
Yes, it's Bluetooth capable. I use it with Amazon Cloud and Boise wireless Bluetooth Speaker.
Yes
Yes. Of course it has no phone so the usual Bluetooth feature doesn't exist. But it does use Bluetooth for cordless headphones and a sensor that works with the Nike+ workout features.
It will wire correctly it's all the same until the '12 model.
Sorry, it will not work for a 2003
OMG, NO! We had one fail without notice and it was a major problem. We thought the dual drive on ours would be a safe backup system, but the entire drive failed. A service company worked on it and we were fortunate to retrieve most of the data, but it was a very close call and expensive. Now we have TWO separate backup drives on all systems.
Two drives, each being half the total capacity quoted for the unit. There are two 2TB drives in the 4TB model. Depending on which RAID mode you choose to configure it as, you either have a 4TB striped array or a 2TB mirrored one.
Here's the link to the online manual: http://manuals.lacie.com/en/manuals/2big-quadra-usb3/start
It is approx 1-3/4" at the back when closed and 1-1/2" at the front when closed.
I wanted to get a new one and they no longer make that headphone. Ask your local Best Buy. Sorry
It was a gift that I forwarded to my uncle. The bad news is that neither he nor his technically proficient sons could get it to work. That is all the information I have.
Hello Rosalba, first of all the phone is really new, unlocked and operative. I had my doubts as well but I bought it for my mom and it works perfectly. To answer your question, yes. The iPhone has a 64GB space for that price. I live in Venezuela, she uses the iPhone here and she has no problem with it. Hope this can help you. Bye!
If it's no fatter than a typical non-slim 15" laptop, I don't see why not?
Yes it does have straps for carrying a tripod
yes it does
The adaptor was designed for the Sony compact flash with a different shoe contacts to an ISO standard hot shoe on NEX-6 and 7. I believe the NEX-5 will accept an external flash or optical LED finder with a different interface.
no
These will work on Passive 3D TVs. Here is an article explaining the difference. http://reviews.cnet.com/2735-7608_7-1278-3.html
Don't know about yours, but ours just bends open all the way backwards and tucks into the little flap on back and "mission accomplished".
I am not aware of a Kindle Fire 8" model. This one is for the Kindle Fire HD (not HDX) 8.9" tablet. I hope this helps. :-)
Batteries, case and USB cable came with mine.
Try using a cleaning brush or a cloth & soap & water. I wouldn't submerge it.
No this is designed for 8.9" kindle hd
I am not aware of a Kindle Fire 8" model. This one is for the Kindle Fire HD (not HDX) 8.9" tablet. I hope this helps. :-)
Yes it will. Once you mount you camera, you can adjust the Matte Box's height due to the camera or lens. It's a great rig to have. If you get it you will love it to. Have a fun production.
Yes, I'm using it with a Roku 3. I can't use the Roku at 1080 but I think that's a limitation of HDMI on my TV. The Xbox is using 1080 on the other half without an issue.
Yes....the TV remote will adjust the volume of the sound bad. My DVR remote will also adjust the sound.
I'm sure there is at sharpusa.com
Slightly less than 54 1/2" wide (when mounted across the top of my TV with speakers facing out into the room); slightly less than 3" high. Because it is mounted, I cannot easily measure the depth (behind the speakers) but I remember that in order to bring the front of the bar out to the same plane as the TV screen, I had to mount about a 3" thickness of wood blocks at the back of my entertainment center behind the mounting brackets.
It worked fine for about a month and then crashed. It no longer works. The drive slid right in the slot, but failed too quickly. After it crashed, I had to pull it out for the xbox to work.
If your son has a Xbox360 slim with this hard drive or HHD he can download lot games I bought one to play battlefield 4. It worth buying
Yes there are, on both sides. :)
You can connect several devices to this speak, but not at the same time. You can only connect one device to it at one time.
The only thing I can tell you is it works great with the galaxy note 3.
It's a 30 pin connector. You have to use the lightning/30 pin adapter cable from Apple to use it with an iPhone 5/5c/5s. I do that, and it works just fine.
Yes, you will have much better quality of picture.
Standard (large)HDMI like most TVs have.
I'm not sure what console you're talking about as most retro systems output stereo audio via SCART. Some consoles will need to be modified to get an RGB signal but that's only for video. RGB uses the composite video as the sync. SCART can also accept s-video. All you need is the right adapter... http://www.ebay.com/itm/RGB-Scart-to-Composite-RCA-SVHS-S-Video-AV-TV-Audio-Cable-Adapter-/200843908116?pt=US_Video_Cables_Adapters&hash=item2ec33ad414 For more info on SCART check these links out... http://members.optusnet.com.au/eviltim/gamescart/gamescart.htm http://retrorgb.com/systems.html If you need cables for a console... http://stores.ebay.com/retroaccessories/ And if you have more than 1 console you want to connect, it also has stereo audio RCA output jacks on the back. http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bandridge-Premium-Performance-Selector-Switching/dp/B0015YYN1W/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1399313127&sr=8-6&keywords=scart+switch
Yes. It certainly should. I've done it myself. Get this unit as well as a SNES to SCART cable and you're set!
For know it hasn't done that to me, and I had it for quite while now. Over eight months at least. So it should be fine for a long time period. I will update my answer if it turns yellowish.
The screw on my L Plate accepts a 5/32 Allen wrench, or a large flat blade screwdriver or even a coin. Try a dime but it will be hard to tighten the screw with it. I have a red-painted Allen wrench in my camera bag.
I believe they make separate stands for those. The silicone holders appear to only be made for the Pro.
I found that most of the items show where the ports (openings) should be. My kindle fire hd is the 2nd generation (2012 version) which has a camera. Hope this helps.
The Velcro has kept my daughter's kindle in it for a year, it has never slipped out. In fact it's been in there so long I forgot it was held in by Velcro until I read this question.
Adapters are usually more expensive then a USB cable. I would just get a lightning USB cable. I'm surprised you're having troubles charging. I have three different cables and one is larger than normal and have had no problems.
Fits perfect
No you cannot unfortunately. The bottom of the case causes the adaptor not to fit
It has a soft cover that goes over the phone and then there is a hard case that goes over the soft case.
It comes with a screen protector, helps your screen from any scratches.
The back of the DVR has a video output (v-out.) Using the same type of cabling that came with the unit, you can connect to a video input on your TV. You may need some adapters for the plugs, depending on your setup.
yes, you can cross fire any 2 7970's, but the faster card will be throttled down to match the slower one and will only use the amount of ram on the smaller card.
great
No - just two pair, and they are the ones that need to be charged before using - like a cell phone.
Yes
I bought this for an early 2008 Mac Pro (3,1?) and it works perfectly.. It doesn't show boot screen, but that isn't an issue for me.
Mine didn't, but I'm sure it will depend on who sells it to you.
Yes. According to Sapphires website it will also support DX12 http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/product_index.aspx?cid=1&gid=3&sgid=1157&pid=1841&lid=1#
I do not subscribe to this BUT it really is better to have the recordings saved to a home computer using their DVR package that comes with it. You can have it overwrite the files after 24 hours so that space does not run out.
Alvin ~ I don't know why it wouldn't, but to be honest I own a t3i and I don't use it with a battery grip. Cheers, John
Wall mounting this computer will be very difficult and require a special bracket fabricated for the purpose. Its designed to sit on a desk.
Yes, you can add another external monitor or tv of your choice and connect them via HDMI. If you buy ours (TecMonkee) I'll give you a 50$ off, simply message us and we will do that for you.
Can you see through screen now? It doesn't have x-Ray powers.
Yes you can.
Battery is comparable to iPad, if a bit less, 7-8 hours. I am able to use an external portable USB hard drive plugged in for 2 hours a day for 3 days before I need to recharge. There are just over 33GB left after operating system, etc.
yes it does
When you first turn the tab on, there should be right at 108gb free on this 128gb model. Roughly 20gb is used by the stock apps/OS. That's based on the model I've seen in person- don't know if the US specific device will differ any.
Yes, it is Dahua brand. We provide tech support and you can just feel free to contact us for any further assistance. We also provide 2-years warranty. Thanks, Best Regards,
Sorry, the use of universal set-top boxes or DVD connection TV
Let me get back to this afternoon, I haven't tried it yet.
Yes it dose
Helpful Hint: the window mount suction cups that come with the unit are terrible and keep falling off the glass. Instead use genuine Escort detector suction cups instead--they fit in the Cobra window bracket perfectly and are the best long-lasting suction cups made. Amazon or eBay has them, but make sure they are the genuine article (crystal clear transparent plastic, not the semi-transparent plastic). My Cobra detector window mount now stays put in all weather.
Yes
No ...better for easy cleaning ...not at all a replacement for elbow grease
yes it fits fine
There is no magnet on it , but just when i close the lid so the pc goes to sleep mode
Hello Vicki. I assumed it was water guard I haven't tested it as far as submersion. I have gotten the case pretty wet and my kindle was dry. Hope that helps
Kindle paperwhite is what I have and it fits great. I have mine in a small leather case and I don't have to take it out of that to put in in the upcase. It's snug that way, but works!
i use my on my kindle fire. reading problems i experienced were regarding limited visibility. it is simply not 100% clear. you have to remember that you are using this outside with lots of sunshine and yes it is natural for visibility to be little off. for me it was not a problem. hope this helps. regards
yes, with room to spare.
If you're asking whether the high voltage could possibly destroy/damage your camera, why take the risk using a non-oem $9 battery in a $900+ camera, just to save $40? Is it really much of an issue? No, 0.2/0.4VDC is going to be negligible.
Did some searching for you and found this one is not compatible for the M800 - while looking around I found almost all the M800 keyboards on Amazon are out of stock or unavailable. However you can still find them using Google or Ebay for about the $20 to $50 range. Don't buy a keyboard unless it exactly states for the M800. Even if it physically fits - the cable length, size, and direction makes a huge difference on whether it will work or not. Good Luck.
Yes! It should be available by the first week in November, if not the end of October.
Not sure. But probably not. Still a great case though.
I don't have the 2nd gen Nexus so I can't say for 100% certainty but the case I have probably will not work if no other reason as I understand 2nd gen nexus has rear camera and the gumdrop case I have has no rear port for that. If check the gumdrop website to see if they have updated case for new nexus
It has a raised section around camera but it is open and can get dirty or scratched. But I haven't had any issues yet
There is plenty of room when you pull the flap out of the way.
Don't believe so.....not positive though!
Coax.
It didn't work with my system configuration so I had to return it. Sorry
800mA
It has a power cable, DVI cable & VGA cable
No it doesn't
Yes
Not really. Especially if you have more than one tab open.
I see a $50 deductible on the 1 year plan
Yes mine only gives me stereo. You might want to try another brand
Same content to two different devices.
I dont have it, but I would "assume" that it "might" work. Worth a shot.
I don't know if it fits the Fire because I have a paperwhite. But the dimensions are 8.75 by 10.25...the clear window measures 9 x 6.5 so my guess is that it would the Fire. It is bigger than I need for the paperwhite and I stow my galaxy 3 phone in it too....still lots of room.
I ordered a black key board for my Dell N4110. It was supplied by Amazon with the Primary supplier iMKeyboard and fit very good. The link is below. Hope the link works.
Clamp is 2 1/2 x 2 3/4 inches. Am happy with mine.
Yes it did.
Sure if it has a Half Size Mini PCI-E port like the description says and it's wired in and you're running an OS which has an appropriate driver.
No. wimax and wifi only
I don't know if because it is from the U.K. makes a difference but once its coming from amazon it will be an amazing card. I had my card two years now its really good.
Yes it does. However, if you should happen to receive one that does not, return it immediately for a refund. In my experience, Amazon will stand behind you.
Yes, that's what I have it on right now and it fits great. I don't know why it doesn't say that it the description.
It is for video. It is tricky to use. The quality is low.
Hi.Off course! This lens will fit any K-mount Pentax cameras.Thank you.
According to Wikipedia the first generation in 120x198.5x10.56 and 2nd generation is 114x200x8.65. 6mm width difference is like 1/4 inch. So depending on the mounting system someone will have to actually try it.
You need to disable predictive text on your tablet. If you go to Language & Input from the Settings menu and find Android Keyboard, click on settings for that and you should be able to enable/disable predictive text.
You need the software to process the photos and export them to a jpg format. At that point they could be printed, but they are admittedly very low resolution (aprox. 1MP square.)
No, when the format is changed and the image is uploaded it can't be changed. Alteration is only possible using the raw data from the camera and requires the Lyrto software for the manipulation.
Yes, it has Forward, Rewind, and direction changing button
No
Actually both chargers are included in the box.
mine came with a charger.
http://blog.parrot.com/2013/12/17/introducing-siri-eyes-free-for-parrot-minikit-neo/
have not tried it in any of those cars but the unit is not worth the money. after a week I couldn't understand or hear the person calling, ended up returning it
I don't think you can. But it will go for over a month before it needs recharging. And there is a green light that slowly blinks when it is close to needing a charge. It will charge from an iMac or MacBook. The backlighting is what sold me.
any device that is bluetooth enabled
Yes. I have it working with Mac OS Leopard and Snow Leopard on MacMinis. There is a Mac version of the 810 coming soon. You can reassign the option and command keys of the PC 810 to Mac positions using keyboard system preference pane. Keyboard &gt; Keyboard &gt; Modifier Keys change option to command and command to option.
It hooks up to all devices that have bluetooth. It works great with both my smartphone (Droid Razr) and my Google Nexus. I think BlackBerry Playbook has bluetooth, so it should work. Hope this helps!
Hi jim, I bought this to connect two regular ( may be type A ) USB male ended wires the connection I made it was between external hard drive and tablet which did not work for me but there was no problem about the quality of particularly this blue piece of product. If both wires you are using are USB male ended on each side you can try and I hope the best for you. I never get advantage of it but I kept for the future in case if ever I need it again.
It has worked with all my SATA drives from 100GB to 750GB. You'll have to use an adapter for pin conversion.
No, designed for a Fire HD
Yes, it's universal.
the 1st generation 2012 has the on/off & volume buttons on the edge & has a camera. The 2013 2nd generation has both buttons on the back & doesn't have a camera. the 2013 Kindle HDX is another version altogether & has the mayday button & does have a camera.
Yes it does, It is an awesome bundle with everything you need to get started. I do however suggest buying a set of extra batteries. I have a car charger so Im always charging them.
Yes, it does.
Please go here: http://snapsort.com/compare/Canon-PowerShot-SX50-HS-vs-Canon-PowerShot-SX500-IS and http://digital-cameras.findthebest.com/compare/606-638/Canon-PowerShot-SX50-HS-vs-Canon-PowerShot-SX500-IS
This is a terrific little camera with great clarity to the pictures. Lots of nice features to this overall package. It is well rated. I don't know how new this model is but you can't go wrong.
I bought mine because a friend had one; he spoke highly of the case as much because of the customer service he got. He needed something replaced and the company jumped right on it. I say give them a call and see if they can help.
The screen itself is matte.
ASUS monitors carry a three year warranty from ASUS. Three year warranty on a monitor is probably one of the longest standard warranty periods.
No it can not. Only tilting
The part that looks like it suggests a focusing ring is really just for decoration, there are no controls on the lens.
Yes, for sure. I have bought all availiable Nikon 1 lenses. This is the best Nikon 1 lens to get large bokeh in the background.
It's not a wide angle lens , it's equivalent to 50 mm full frame lens , if you wan ya wide angle lens for your nikon 1 body , buy the nikon 1 10 mm f2,8 ( which is equivalent to 27 mm on full frame ) .
That lens is really only good for DX. It will work at longer focal lengths for FX - but not the entire zoom range.
Based on the fact that it is meant for a crop sensor (DX format), there would be vignetting at wide angles, then less noticeable at 50mm. The extent of vignetting would have to be viewed personally, but it should be significant at 17mm.
I use SanDisk Extreme Pro. You can also use the SanDisk Extreme and they will be fine.
Unfortunately, this adapter is not compatible with Nikon D810. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact our sales department at 800-991-3350 EST. We thank you for your time and consideration!
The D700 isn't listed on the Nikon website as a compatible camera. : http://www.nikonusa.com/en/Nikon-Products/Product/Wireless/WU-1b-Wireless-Mobile-Adapter.html Even if it were, you would probably be disappointed in this product, as I was. When It's connected to the camera, image review is disabled. Several other quirks...
I can use it on my A65 and my A77...so if they have the same configuration I would think so.
Hi Kathy, this Sony ADPAMA will not work on your Sony a6000. Your camera uses a multi-interface shoe, wherein this Sony ADPAMA works for auto-lock accessory shoe. -Ely
This doEs not have a screen protector.
yes it will. It is a very good value for $
Patience, you need to hold the button down a long time, it works great once you get it paired.
Unfortunately not.
Had my TV for about a year, had no problems with it.
Yes.
Yes, but only DVD
No it doesn't have Bluetooth.
Yes it does. That is why I opted for this one after much research.
It is fast and does not overheat (I rarely overclock it), but the display started to show non-pixel lines already within one year. After owning it for 18 months, I wouldn't buy ENVY or suggest it at this point. The customer service is not very satisfactory.
Yes.
I connected the device directly from the TV and cable box to the computer. I had to unplug everything and then re-plug everything afterwards. You play it live and it records in real time.
This device would not work for your situation. This unit is HDMI from your source (gaming console) to AV (TV with no HDMI). You would need AV2HDMI. Look here http://www.amazon.com/Mini-Composite-CVBS-Converter-1080P/dp/B009A6PJKQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1386603258&sr=8-1&keywords=av2hdmi . Hope this helps.
Yes, we've transferred all our photos and videos from our ipad to my husband's pc laptop. This flashdrive also transfers documents, so it's multi-functional. We've been very happy with it. My husband uses it primarily for sheet music. He plays in a band. He creates setlists and playbooks on his pc laptop, editing the sheet music to highlight key shifts and other notes, and then he saves it to his ipad, which he uses during his gig.
This is a memory drive that stores files but I do not think that it adds any memory to your iPad. You can by memory from iCloud then transfer things like your photos to that and perhaps free up some memory for your apps.
90 degree. No issues so far.
I've tried both. A sign of warning it is a weird style of ear bud, well both are. These feel more comfortable and for the price they can't be beat. There bass is better but the highs may be a little undefined but nothing to noticeable. Hope I helped.
I do not encounter distracting noise when I either walk or run with this earphone set.
Yes. I use an Android version phone. The headphones sound great . The cable that comes with the cans has a volume control and pause/play button which does not work with older Android. The pause/play button does work with my Android Note 2.
yes there is adapter for different kind of outlet not sure if its for airplane
Wireless Headphones, Charging Station/Transmitter, AC Adapter and RCA Cables
I would think the cables that come with it would work. However, why would you want to hook it to the directv receiver rather than the television? That way if you also have a DVD player (or something else) hooked to the tv, you can hear that through them as well.
Yeah they can and they would sound great, but there are no iphone controls on the headphones themselves like there are on the i series, but personally I dont really care
Yes you can answer calls with iPhone 4 and these headphones. I returned them because the volume of music was not loud enough for me.
No. Make sure to adjust down until you put them on in case someone played with them. They are great. Volume control has a great range.
Medium.
Not sure if it will. I installed them on a 04 Volvo xc90
Hello Frank. Yes it can be turned on or off at your own leisure. The switch is on the left earphone.
Yes it will work. My TV is also 120Hz capable and I had no issue.
Yes, it is compatible with windows OS. Download an app called "ES File Explorer" to access your shared folders/files.
This connects to the Google Play market. So it will run all Android apps.
Not too sure Beatleboy...I used it for my Videocamera. I'm sure u can find answers to it on a forum or something. cheers
Yes, it will work in the thin version, however you will need to replace the thin back with a thick back plate because the drive is too thick to fit.
No
Yes they will, however i have noticed that you should get a headphone amp for these as the amplifier in most smartphones never have enough gain.
Sadly I don't think so.
Christian is correct. I believe only a single core switches to a higher clock speed under heavy load. You don't need to do anything at all and all switching is done automatically. You shouldn't notice anything different except a little more battery drain when it ramps up to 2.8 GHz.
Yes it does have a webcam. The speakers are decent. They don't buzz or sound tinny but they are laptop speakers so they aren't terrific.
You really need to detail out what exactly the problems are your experiencing. I have no trouble with mine as long as the signal strength is low/medium to good. If you explain more I may be able to help. Are you not able to connect with your home router or are you having problems with other WiFi hotspots. Bob
64 bit
Yes, it comes with Windows 8.
You might, especially in low light conditions. As long as the light is good you should be alright. You can always look at the image you just took, and determine what adjustments need to be made. A bigger problem is stabilizing camera and lens to zero motion, since it's all manual there is no vibration reduction / stabilization.
Yes, but you will also need to upgrade the Power supply unit as well. Right now I'm running an ATI Radeon 7850 with a 620W power Supply with no issue.
Even though it said it was compatible with our model it would not work and our TV was less than a few months old. I was able to return it though.
Yes
Hey there, Unfortunately we don't ship to Canada yet - we are still hoping that Amazon.ca will stock our products in the future, but for now I'm afraid it's not available. My apologies, ~ Haje CEO, Triggertrap
For Nikon D5100 you need this model: "Triggertrap Mobile Dongle and cable kit (MD-DC2 for Nikon)"
The Triggertrap cables connects your DSLR camera to your phone/tablet to allow you to remote trigger your camera. Also allows for triggering your camera based on time, sound, distance. The software is available on both Android and iOS. The cable with the box converts the audio controls into signals your camera understands. The second cable is the adaptor to plug into your brand of camera. I have two adaptor for my different cameras while I just have one control cable.
According to the Triggertrap Web Site (www.triggertrap.com) you would need : Triggertrap Mobile Dongle and cable kit (MD-N3 for Canon)
Your camera uses the TC-DC2 connector. That connector will work with both the iPad and Samsung Tab as that end of the connector is a standard headphone connector. The other end will fit your camera.
You'll need to check with Lenovo about using the Aux port since I haven't tried; I suspect it would work but I don't know. Still really like the PC and find HDMI to VGA converter a perfect combination.
Spec sheet says USB 3.0, where are you seeing 2.0 ? http://www.lenovo.com/products/us/server/content/pdfs/datasheets/ThinkServer_TS130_Datasheet.pdf
It's pretty quiet, but when I play really intense games (like Crysis 3) it starts to get a bit loud.
No.
Works for Win8.1 8 7 XP Vista. Not sure whether works for Mac.
5400 RPM
No it does not come with much software. You would have to buy antivirus, Microsoft office etc. However it has windows 8 so it includes windows program like Windows fax and scan, and snipping tool. It also has adobe reader
yes it comes with a basic wired keyboard and mouse
Amazon description mistake
I bought this for my grandson who is in college. He has been very happy with it. I think he would have told me if there was any resolution problem but for graphic design I am not sure.
once something is launched, it's responsive enough. fast would be a little generous, slow isn't fair either. for consuming media ( music, YouTube, Netflix ) it is very good. the battery life was what I put the most weight on when making my decision, and it is very good. with the better (asus or HP) atom powered windows tablet prices dropping, I might consider one of those, but only if the price was very close to the same.
My C440 has Integrated Intel HD graphics.
500 GB is more than enough for me really
Hello J. Deutsch, Thanks for your interest! The computer has Windows 8 pre-installed on it. We only sell used items, and we do not have a way to uninstall operating systems. You may be able to take the customer somewhere to have this done, but we are not 100% sure. Sorry we couldn't be of more help.
i7
It is a legit Lenovo power supply, but I bought it for the Yoga2. I am not sure if it was the same power supply as supplied with the Flex15. I apologize that I don't know the answer.
Yes, Lenovo 45W Slim AC adapter is compatible adapter for Lenovo ADLX45NDC2A
Yes, it came with Lenovo's One Year Manufacturers Warranty.
Hi ,did you buy it from our store? If so please tell us your order ID and give us more details about your problems. We will try our best to help you.
washable.-only if you use the little spray and the soft towel to clean screens, reusable no the rubber in the frame its really strong, no does not pick up dust, only if you left it before apply. a word of advise for metro screen, games, pictures and movies works great, for windows software its not that clear if you use the surface for fun and entertainment its perfect.
Yes....go to your office supply and they will show you the adapter you need to make the connection
YES
The processor is an I7
Good Night, no sr. this laptop dont have touchscreen, however the Amd Radeon graphics are outstanding, i completely recommend this laptop to anyone who need awsome and powerfull graphics
Yes, it has bluetooth.
It is as durable as a standard laptop can be expected to be. Naturally, your biggest fear will be harddrive damage from shock and liquid spills on the keyboard.
1.7 GHz
What came in my box was paperwork, a decent pouch for the ux32vd, a similar small pouch, a power cord and laptop of course and then two connector cables. cable one has one end a usb connector other end the female end for what looks like a phone plug. cable two has one end with 15 holes appears to be for some type of TV interface. Hope this is helpful. I'll try to get a pic
I believe the maximum is 8gb. I couldn't find the information on Asus' website but Crucial says 8: http://www.crucial.com/upgrade/ASUS-memory/ASUS+Notebooks/ZENBOOK+UX32VD-upgrades.html 8 is what I have in mine but remember that there is 2gb on-board which brings the total to 10gb.
I have pasted the computer's specs below. I pulled them from another site online. Intel Core i5 3210M (2.50GHz) 4GB Memory 500GB HDD Intel HD Graphics 4000 1366 x 768 Windows 8 64-Bit DL DVD+-RW/CD-RW
No it doesn't come with a Spanish Keyboard. It comes with a English (U.S.) Keyboard. However you can replace it with a Spanish Keyboard really easily.
Yeah, it definitely hangs at times. Not a complete crash, but locks up for a bit. The touch pad is also a little unresponsive due to the texture.
Yes it will switch the 07 300 to beable to fit a double din radio in by using this bezel
Yes it will.
No, they are passive
Yes, you need to connect the device via a receiver. I connected it through my DirectTV dvr receiver to wireless headphones.
It's super easy! Almost like a magnet. There is no sticky substance and it's easy to remove and fix as many times as you'd like until you get it just right!
Just scratches and glare
Sorry, we don't have this module.
I checked mine and it is 802.11b/g/n
yes
Don't have the case with me as it's at home and I am at work.....but...... those specs are not right. The specs on the Nano 7th gen. are 3.01 inches in height/1.56 inches in width/ and .021 inches in depth and it's almost a perfect fit in the case. Hope that helps....
The charging pins aren't exposed through the case, however it is very easy to remove the case to get to them but that would likely be unhandy.
Yes it was
yes. this is a very good purchase. are very good cases
*give or take 10 hrs
Yes, it does
I don't know what you mean with trigger buttons, but the pad has two shoulder buttons (Left and Right). They're not pressure-sensitive if that's what you mean. They're just normal buttons like the front buttons. Hope that helps.
Manufacturer's Warranty: 12 Months Parts 12 Months Labor. Google search result from www.brandsmartusa.com
It's held on by a big plastic nut. Unscrew that and the base will slide off.
It will work in anything that takes a standard headphone jack, so assuming it has not been modified, yes.
Indeed it does! Works very well on mine.
This camera is compatable with most any wifi wireless network. It is not designed to work with proprietary security systems. This is incredibly easy to setup and use. You simply log on to the camera with your Iphone or Android device. Register it with the phone, add the Belkin app to you phone, and you are done. Their free cloud service is not the best but it is good and free. Adding cameras is simple. I have 6 of these and they are great.
Yes very well
Yes
No. Need a mini sata port.
I have 2 Zooka's and have not seen the problem. They micro usb port used is pretty common. I would try another micro usb charger for sure. Also, sometimes when you try to power it on. It can take a while. I hold the power button down for a few seconds and release. There is firmware on the Zooka that must boot up. You might also have to plug it in for a second into the micro usb charger and then try powering it on.
I'm not very sure. It might slide because made of silicon. I Sent back the two that we ordered. Not worth it. Sound was ok. I paid $99 each. Worth maybe $30. Idea was good but it didn't deliver.
Thick indeed.
No. There are a few keys that have a tiny light to indicate Wi-Fi on/off, mute on/off and caps lock on/off (there may be more, the above are the ones with which I'm familiar.
You can buy a memory 8GB (about 70$) or 16GB ($140) to install by your self.
The bottom of the case is cut out exposing the Lightning (charging and data) port, the headphone jack, and the speakers. No plugs necessary.
no it is not on this verion, the envy 4-1110us is one that does
Either thru the USB port or the AUX in port.
About what you want to speak?
It was design for a laptop. If you have a the right kind of mounting brackets and your motherboard supports SATA drives you can use it in your desktop PC, MAC, or Linux machine.
Yes
Yes the Toshiba Satellite C655 specs say that the hard drive has a Serial ATA Interface which in short is a SATA drive. This hard drive is a SATA drive so it should work fine in your Toshiba Satellite C655
Yes. It comes with a limited warranty covering the device for a year upon date of purchase.
All LCD screens suffer from bright sunlight reflection. However, the greater the pixels or clarity will improve your ability to see the screen with greater ease. Best solution? Purchase a SLR with thru-the-lens viewing.
The camera has the ability to shoot exceptional photos in low light conditions such as dusk in the evening. It has a built-in flash and a hot shoe to use to add light to the subject.
That is 6D.

1 year on the electronics and 5 years on the speakers themselves. Found it on the jbl website
You only need to direct the sound to the bar from the tv. An optical cable from the tv to the sound bar will do the tick.
With a compatible motherboard, yes, you should be able to.
One more slot to add 4 GB, makes a total of 16.
500watt
I'm fairly certain it's SATA 3.0.
Beneath the DVD-R drive there are two bays...
Please send a question that makes sense.
If by not communicating you mean touch response, I can't help you as I use a mouse and no touchscreen. If you mean the mouse sometimes locking up and refusing to move, also keyboard has no response. This happens every so often maybe once every three weeks. I just reboot by turning power strip off and on, and it's good for another 3 weeks.
Yes, this is a great machine. I highly recommend it.
It does not have buit-in WiFi. Ethernet only.
Yes
Yes.
It comes with Windows 8 Pro (Professional) 64 bit. It does have an HDMI port. I don't know about Media Center, I never cared for it so I have not looked into it.
this unit works on 130 volts a/c should work with this voltage.
The ones I received were clear plexiglass.
Nope
Yes it fits perfectly
I cant help you. I bought this item for someone and after several uses they werent happy with it and they threw aside and resorted back to their desktop. Battery life was too short and it had to plugged in all the time which didnt make it worth carrying around.
Yes it does
Matte...and, to echo Alexander S., it is the cat's arse.
You likely received the new PB278QR display that has dots on the frame vs the icons. If so, you get the bonus of picture in picture.
No, not from any convenient plugin anyways, you may have to hard wire bigger speakers by taking it apart.
I returned this product three days after we received it, the speed slowed down after every record where by the 5th one it was barely moving, one we received it it felt cheap.
I have no idea, but it is weak. I would not recommend buying this product!
This is just an LCD project I use for meetings. You really need a Multimedia projector. Pyle has one, PRJLE78 Home Theater Multimedia Digital LED. I read the specs and it has an rca audio out although not sure of the quality.
I have the same problem and cannot seem to fix it.
that's close to the limit of the camera operation temperature. This model has been sold to EU, Russia, North of America , at present , no any defective report caused by temperature .
when i first bought this item i didn't realice that it was a usb connection, but once i bought the usb female to micro adaptor and it worked good. but the pen did not work (witch i didn't care for), it holds my table, key board work, and i'm good with that. hope this helps.
The Asus pad requires a 40-pin connector. If your tablet has a regular usb port on it, then yes it will fit.
One. Ive been having some problems with the Phone Mic and have been thinking about upgrading to a better Radio. If you have any interest in buying this Radio and dont mind second hand, I have all the packaging that came with this Radio. Outside of the one set back the radio has performed well and would reccomend it. If your interested shoot me an email. chansen813@verizon.net
Hi Nick, Its the back as well too. The back is just a solid color (you can not see the apple symbol) and has lifeproof imprinted into it. It fits nicely.
No
Yes, it works fine with my daughter's KF7 HD. The mini HDMI was a little tight the first time, but I have not had an issues with it since then.
It will work ... mostly. If you use OOC jpegs instead of RAW, it will not correct for chromatic aberrations (color fringing along edges), unlike on a Panasonic body. If you shoot RAW, then it's not an issue.
The zoom occurs internally. The outside length does not change.
This is one of the best lenses I own. Of course it is brand new. I haven't any problem yet so I can't answer about warranty handling,
Yes, the waterproof housings from the previous Roam will fit the Roam2. I made a few phone calls prior to my purchase. My son successfully used the housing snorkling with no leaks.
Hi The battery Cannot be removed from the camera. Because of this you cannot change the battery. So you need to be smart how you use the camera. The camera is very good value with some limitations. Richie
si
No. You need one TX and one receiver or 2 transceivers. I recommend a TX and a transceiver. It's easier to make changes to the flash.
It fit in my excursion just fine so it should
I runs on 110/120 volts, 60 cycle, or on 220/240, based on switch setting at the back of the power supply.
Yes. I bought mine from Best Buy and returned within a week. Poor performance. It finally locked up and would not turn back on. Beware...
Yes
Yes
About and1hr but if stays in car keep it pluged in.
Yes
No, it is not.
No, it does not come with 3D glasses.
no
I did not use it continuously and did not play game. With off and on using the machine about 1 -2 hr at a time, I don't have to charge the computer for the next 3 days.
Ok
No, its they same cruddy and flimsy remote. You may have better luck though with a new one. I found programming the remote that came with our cable box from Cox a much better solution to using the original TV remote.
yes. I put my SD card into it, then put the Transcend Information USB into my printer's USB port. The printer then displays what is on the SD card and I can print from there. No computer needed.
Yes it comes with a remote control. You can also view this from the internet if you set it up to do so. It also has the ability to control PTZ cameras remotely.
That's what I have, and it's perfect. (Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 GT-N8013)

Didn't notice a UL sticker on back either, just as stated earlier only has a QC sticker. The material included states that it has six outlets rated to a cumulative total of 1875 watts and is equipped with a built in fuse T3.15A/250VAC - Also the USB circuits are equipped with an over-load protection and short-circuit protection
Yes, both the transmitter and receiver need to be plugged in to an electrical outlet.
Found this in an article: http://www.practical-home-theater-guide.com/wireless-hdmi.html#2 The NAVS501 is a follow-up to the slightly less expensive NAVS500 kit, with the only difference between the two being support for 3D and multiple transmitters on the 501. Otherwise, both units support the same wireless range and WHDI technology, and both have a USB port that can be used to connect the wireless receiver for a keyboard/mouse to control a desk top PC remotely. This means that in terms of overall performance, the 500 and 501 perform the same.
Yes, EN-EL15 is the Nikon battery you need for the D750. This is the Wasabi comparable. And I am using mine with no issues whatsoever.
I\The indicator light turns green. I had to charge a battery to find out. I couldn't remember.
I'd suggest looking at your decor. We have a kitchen with mostly stainless steel appliances and brownish tiles, so the combination of the silver front and the light-colored wood looks good there.
I'm not aware of that camera, but I saw the specs and it's micro 3/4 compatible so I should fit.
Factory, 1 year I believe.
I received one with my kit.
Sorry my car is a 2013
Any high speed or 1.4 series HDMI will work. This one is great for every application you can throw at it. Hope this helps! Good luck!
They worked great on my LX55's. Very easy to install. The worst part was cleaning the old surrounds from the cones and basket (messy). Just take your time and it will go well.
Yes, this repair kit should fit the 10" woofer used in the JBL L80T, which is similar in design to the one used in the LXE990. In fact, this repair kit should work with most JBL full-range speakers that have 10" woofers.
I have not connected to that device, but did link it to the headphones of a bluetooth headset that didn't have a keyboard or display Hooked up fine to that.
It worked before so I would try a different cord Radio shack or Walmart have them.
Glossy. The finish is similar to most other touchscreens, like an iPhone or tablet.
Short answer: Nope! Although it really doesn't bother even in the dark, it's not that bright..
Normally you can only watch Recorded DVD on the unit it recorded unless you finalize before watching on another player
Yes - I actually am using mine on the wireless Mac keyboard and it fits perfectly!
It says in the description it fits a 15" and a 13" I have the 13" and it fits fine, I wouldn't worry about it
very well&#65281;
Yes, you can go to the Logitech support website and download the new driver for it for free. Hope this helps.
I have had no issues with the Leica electronic viewfinder. My most intensive use of the camera was taking 1470 photos on a two week trip to China. My only problem was the shutter. It is easy to get multiple shots if one's finger lingers on the shutter switch. I am very pleased with the camera. Raymond Powell
This camera has such a fast Lena that you will not need to woody about the ISO. ISO is the sensitivity rating if the sensor. The higher the ISO, the darker you can shoot in. But high ISO can also lead to graininess. With the VLux 4 lens, a relitivly low ISO setting will accplish everything you need. I shot a theme park display after dark with mine and got excellent results... And never needed a flash
Yes
Yes
yes and the quality is impressive
They do not work with iPhone 5's
It depends on how well the buds fit in your ear. If you get a snug fit, then the bass will be awesome. But if the buds are too loose, the bass will be horrible. I hope this helps.
As far as I can tell from when I go the product, no. They are legit though.
The prime offers a 30 foot line of site in room wireless HDMI solution. If you are going from one room to another I would recommend using the Aries Pro (NPCS550). The transmitters connects to your source devices HDMI output and wirelessly broadcasts that signal to the receiver which is connected to the HDMI input on your display.
It has been my experience that these drives will last for several years. I should add that I run open source operating systems and they do considerably less virtual memory caching('thrashing') to the device than the commercially produced operating systems. In my opinion, Toshiba drives are solid, reliable products.
I believe its 3 years..
It's the same connection as a 2tb, it's SATA3, any windows 7 or 8 will compatible, the major spec you have to look is your motherboard, it has to be a uefi compatible board to go beyond the 2tb limit, if it's a recent motherboard it probably is, just check your manufacturer and model to be 100%. Search for: 3tb and uefi motherboards. Hope this helps
both. the smart data in the drive identifies it as: TOSHIBA DT01ACA3. the retail box it shipped in says P/N PH3300U - 1|72.
I have had no problem, although I am not sure how the mc30 would hit your lense. I would try it ,but may but it from a local store so you can try it in the store.
i bought one for a 2001 vw and a 2007 passat. thd biggest advantage is the quality of the sound over a mini plug conextion. the songs can be selected by the car unit but the folders have to be accessed by the ipod unit
Useless crap. Don't buy it. Unfortunately, I still have not been able to solve my similar desires to convert HDMI to RGB and certainly not at a reasonable price. I bought it. Exchanged it for the same and that didn't work, either.
This is pure copper wire and it works great. No aluminum at all. Just braided copper.
According to the shipping weight the 14 gauge is 5 lbs and the 12 gauge is 6 lbs.
It's plug and play for the double DIN , replaces the CD changer connection
I have a VW stock radio, and how mine works is if the CD drive is empty then it will default to AUX. If there is a CD in the drive, it will play the CD.
I bought this case specifically for my HD-280 PROs, and with the headphones folded and the coiled cord arranged in a circle around the inner perimeter they fit snugly but well, i.e. not much space left over when I shut the case, but nothing inside is being crushed or compressed. I'm not sure how much bigger the XL is, so I'm not in a position to say whether it would make things a little easier, or be too large and allow the cans to rattle about. I'm happy with mine.
Yes it comes with a lens cap a very nice strap which you can connect the lens cap to so it doesn't get lost when you have it off to take pics.
Standard Canon warranty
I think that you should open the store products and check a kit that have the things that you need because I guess that they can't be removed. The filters are excellent to protect your lenses.
Mine is always on with no load as well but also pretty quiet. It will ramp up a lot under load. I don't find the no-load noise too much but under load it can be pretty loud.
I would tie the aluminum case housing to ground and make sure that the aluminum case housing has an exhaust hole next to where the fan is located on the power supply at equal or larger diameter.
Nope, you will need the BG-E5
No, You are not able to. Only the DX1211/DX1215 may be attached to the DS2413. The DS1813 and DS2413 are treated as independent NAS units.
If your system program was not factory loaded, you can go to zmodo.com and download your version to a flash drive. Run the flash on your zmodo and install it.
Yes, the JLE55SP4000 has both digital and analog closed captions.
Yes it can...............Video Gear Direct
I don't know about that but mine are great
These cameras work just as well inside as outside, I have put up 4 systems now and always use them both in and outside.
Any BNC Camera you want to use.
I have a E3D470VX. So, I wouldn't know. Sorry!
Yes, tbh only the tvs that are 30-50 years old wouldn't have that sort of connectivity,
Yes, the remote works on both of my Vizio tv just like the original remote.
You charge it with the USB cable that's in the box and connect it using your tablets bluetooth, power on the bluetooth then the keyboard and press the sync button on the keyboard and you are ready to use it. Regards!
Look it up on Amazon and order. I just ordered two that work perfectly.
I Assume you selected ART at the top function Dial and then press set once to get the functions on your left. now scroll ALL the way down where it just says ART and press set again, you should get the selections you are looking for
the manual was online
Width x Throw Ratio = Throw Distance. Throw Ratio is 1.32 - 2.15. Width of a 100" 16:9 screen is 87". So anywhere between 114.84" - 187.05" or 9.57' - 15.59'.
I love mine. I am not sure how one would hear fan noise over any theater system. The benefit of led is no heat, so minimal fan. Whoever commented can't have a projector with led light source.
When you say switching channels do you mean switching sources on the projector? Do you have your video source running through a AV reciever?
I'm glad you asked that. As I use the device the lack of buttons is pretty much the only negative. There is only a call button which allows you to hang up phone calls and an on/off switch. Just used this device on vacation as a music player and came back home and used it as a conference call device. It's still an amazing device that would be perfect if it had a volume and skip controls.
Yes
Hello David, Thank you for your support,we are apologzie for the inconvenience caused to you by this. After received your message,we had sent one replacement to you ,please notice this. If others issue,please contact us freely, we will work with you to solve any problems. Thank you very much. HUACAM
Yes, this is standard headphones 3.5 mm Jack. This model dont have mic.
Yes, I watch Amazon Prime on my Sony Blu-ray. It has Amazon Instant Video right there on the home screen, along with Netflix and others. When you enter the Amazon Instant Video app, it has a separate category for Amazon Prime videos, which is very handy. For non-prime videos, you can either rent them or buy them. It also has a play list that you can add videos to, to keep track of what you want to watch next. I like it!
Not firsthand but I read a lot of reviews on 3D capable TV's and the prevalent opinion of those who have purchased such 3D TVs is that the feature improves the picture and is not high in cost. I bought my TV just a few days ago and may be able to give you a better answer soon. Hopefulskeptic
Yes. It's reusable.
I ordered it months ago and I have used it a couple times a week sense . I love this stuff!
It is a USB charge only. We haven't had much luck getting ours to work properly.
The ones I received had no microphone.
No. My iPod does
Yes. As long as your laptop is not touch, it will fit.
Unfortunately, I cannot say. I bought it for the Acer Aspire D270-1824 and it worked great, no issues.
A regular SATA cable. Available here on Amazon for something like a dollar! :-)
Yup, used it myself on Windows 8, 8.1, and 8.1 update 1.
It depends if the tablet has a USB 3.0 port. I don't think it will work due to the lack of USB 3.0 or 2.0 ports. I'm also unsure whether the drive will respond to Android OS.
Yes just like a flash drive itll copy the the files from the computer to the ext. hdd
You will need to get into single user mode and reset it from there. For instructions, just google the following: reset root password ubuntu 13
All I tried running was Wine to emulate some PC games. I was unsuccessful at getting all but one working.
I built servers with the 2 boards i bought. They are rock stable with 8350's in them running vm's, with 32gb's ram in each. I am using on board video
I have had similiar issues with the base not responding. Typically, I just undock the screen and redock it to resolve the non-responsiveness.
No
I would def recommend. Holds four ram cards, I have 32 gigs in mine, and can crossfire.
my bar tenders use all various instruments to "designate" the product sale buttons with no problem one way or the other.
Neither. It is classified as optical multi-touch. Alleged to be more sensitive than either resistive or capacitive.
I did get a 7200 rpm hdd
Yes. Built-in Bluetooth V4.0 (Try googling it next time).
No it doesn't come with a stylus...it's a touch pad. You can, however, purchase one at any office supply place or even Wal-Mart, just be sure it is the "soft touch-squishy" stylus (that kind of mimics your finger tip). The hard tip stylus doesn't work on a touch pad screen.
On the product screen you have to choose between 32 gb or 64 gd, depending on your prefernces.
I have downloaded apps from google.
Ive had nothing but problems with mine, it turned into a brick after 2 weeks, im using Chromecast now with no issues so im not sure if the tv stick needs an update or not but the product is junk
Hi ta Connect your tv stick to hdmi port. Turn your tv on to hdmi input thenonce the andriod starts go to setting to network. Find wireless access point and put the code that you get from the wireless router. Now go back to the main page scan your device when you see your device select and enjoy. Good luck. Y
You can watch movies from your Nexus 7 Tablet, as well. Thanks for shopping Amazon.com. Cheers!
Yes
There are no USB ports on the tablet. You must have the optional keyboard to get USB.
I have a cover that was made for mine that I only remove if I want t use the tablet. I tried a screen protector on my first Asus 21, but I ruined my screen. It caused the screen to bubble, so because of the great 12 month warranty, I had to get my computer replaced. I would have had a very expensive mistake if it was not for the warranty. Be very careful if you use a screen protector-many are not safe and could damage your screen.
As I understand it, the version on the tablet is a preview. The full version is supposed to be provided by Microsoft (for free) when it is ready. This version doesn't include Outlook, however.
Blue Tooth range is up to 30 feet, WIFI around 300 feet under perfect conditions
No. But trust me, you don't want to buy this product anyway, I promise you, it's a waste of money. Keep searching but always avoid LimoStudio!
You have to subscribe to an iptv service in your area.
Yes, amazon will send you a separate email with the Arkham Origins code.
Yes EVGA will email you a steam code, at least that is what they did for metro last light
I don't see why not - my alienware x51 has only a 330 watt power adapter and it works just fine with this card.
Yes, of course. Download HFS4WIN.exe and run it. The Slim will then work under Windows. You can also reformat the drive to NTFS, and the Slim will then work directly with Windows, no driver needed.
I'm sorry, can't help you. I bought this for a technician who was upgrading the security system at our community clubhouse.
Hi Hassan, i don't know, but the part that slides in the plate has a widths of 38.85mm, which is 1.53 inch. Maybe that helps.
Built in, works much better with a custom Rom installed (ie finless bob)
I doubt if this has anything to do with compatibility since it is HDMI. Any device that could output to its HDMI out should be compatible with any TV that has HDMI input. This is to the best of my knowledge and experience poking around with electronics.
Yes!!! you can use any pci-e 3.0 graphics cards on this motherboard, it's backwards compatible! And also, you can use any AM3+/AM3 processors. However, i'm not sure about the ECC ram. I'd go with non-ecc just to be safe.
Yes it support Solid State Drives (SSD), the 120GB Kingston SSDNow V300 and Crucial M5 have the best prices right now (around $0.66 per GB)
I think so. If you search for ""battery Canon ELPH 130 IS" you'll see the battery number and lots of alternatives that specify they work in that camera.
I purchased this for a Cannon Power Shot A2400 and it worked fine. If the ELPH takes the same battery, it should work I would think.
No. 7200 RPM.
https://www.freedompop.com/coverage
Its 3 3/4" long x 2 1/4 wide X 3/4" high. This is just a little smaller than a 'standard' size mouse.
Yes it can. I used it on an Android tablet (Acer Iconia Tab A110-07g08u 7-Inch 8 GB Tablet) AND it works on my other tablet which runs Windows 8 (Lenovo IdeaPad K3 Lynx 11.6-Inch 64 GB Tablet). It seems to work better for an Android tablet I think. It's the best wireless bluetooth mouse, very high quality.
The Surface RT runs Windows 8.1. 8.1 is compatible with Bornd's C170 model, the model number of this device. I've heard people say the connection is spotty or difficult to set up but haven't experienced this. I use this with my Galaxy tab along side a BT keyboard. It is a bit small but fits nice in my palm. Also has a low profile, making it easy to tote around. If you want confirm click this link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductDetailsViewer?Name=Bornd%20C170%20Wireless%20Mice&vendor=Bornd&Locale=1033%2C2057%2C3081%2C4105%2C16393&BreadCrumbPath=bornd&LastSearchTerm=bornd&Type=Hardware&tempOsid=Windows%208.1
If it has bluetooth capabilities.
Yes
No limitation if you have Internet or another PC with an optical drive. In that last case you can use programs as Daemon Tools and a pendrive and you won't miss an optical drive
Two double AA's but as stated before, the real ones don't have a red LED so if you want them to look 100% real DO NOT USE BATTERIES
Yes they are great for outdoor use. Had mine up through all the seasons including harsh winter
1600x900 on the machine screen itself BUT if you connect it to a 1920x1080p monitor or tv through micro hdmi port on the right... it will adjust to 1080P on that monitor/tv !!! That was a surprise for me.
It depends on your personal Cover, mine is a Targus and stays on with cover open or closed!!! Hope this helps, by the way it works great!
an iPad doesn't have a hard drive... but the answer is NO. The device works as it says -- very effective (surprising!). It's a deal
I purchased two of these for iPads....2nd and 3rd generation and neither worked very well. My cupped hand around the speaker worked better than the sound bender. I was very disappointed in the product.
If you only have a single coax input on your tv, you will needed some kind of coax switch, not a coax splitter.
No
I don't think it has a headphone output I think it has an input like for an iPod howevet
Yes, it works while it's charging.
Hi Hubert yes it plugs into almost any device that has a round plug in outlet. I use it for conference calls as well when on my cell phone.
No
I don't see anything different here. The only issue I've had with the lens is to make sure it is properly locked and seated.
This is a good quality lens. Yes you can preserve the original f2.8. As regards image quality I don't have a laboratory to measure such things but there certainly isn't the obvious problem with distortion or focus out near the edges that you see with cheaper lenses. I'm sorry I can't be more specific.
Yes, but the UV filter screws between the adapter & the Lense. Hope this helps. Cheers
Yes. You just need to be careful of the keyboard so that the keys don't get damaged on a rough surface if they're exposed. You can easily shut the keyboard off and just use the ipad without the keyboard as well.
Yes, the Pink/Black Survivor All-Terrain Case for iPod touch 4th Generation is only designed to fit the iPod Touch 4th Generation.
Yes it does
it will work but you will have hdcp issues because google fiber's tv box only has hdmi
It should work anywhere you have an Internet connection. I have used it just fine in a hotel room in Sicily.
In general Slingbox is a peer to peer (point to point) connection such than only one connection is allowed. Sling does not stream to the internet, but streams only from point A to point B. So only one device at a time can use the Sling connection. That device may be in the next room or hundreds of miles away.
Just go with hdmi and component outs from your STB into the Slingbox then HDMI out of slingbox into your TV and you won't have a problem or know the difference.
Nice & soft
No
According to the tag sewn on them : 90% Polyester, 10% Polyamide.
No, they are made in China.
No, you have to program matching frequencies in each radio. The uv5r is both uhf and vhf. The tyt is uhf only, so you will havr to program matching uhf frequencies.
The lowest model has a NVIDIA GeForce GT 630M with 1GB GDDR5 VRAM any model above the lowest will house the NVIDIA GeForce GT 640M with 2GB GDDR5 VRAM The difference in cost goes a large part to justify this upgrade if you do any sort of video games, or computer graphics/illustration
Yes
Yes we have Dell Inspiron i15N-3910BK 15-Inch Laptop. 15.6 HD Display, Intel Core i5-3210M Processor (Dual-Core, 2.5GHz, 3MB Cache), 6GB Memory, 1TB Hard Drive, Integrated intel HD Graphics
Can't say exactly but, usually Dell laptops comes with a standard limited warranty for 1 year. My other laptop which I bought directly from Dell came with same 1 year warranty. While registering my second laptop which I bought through Amazon, Dell personal said it has 1 year limited warranty in USA and if I'm interested to buy additional 2 years warranty.
this lap top does not weigh 2.7 pounds or the ones i bought dont
Yes, Danirl... With same specification too (:
No it does not...
Yes there is. Optical drives are becoming rare as ultrabooks are becoming slimmer, but this one does have one so that you don't have to keep an external optical drive.
Yes depending on how much you chose to upgrade it should run just about anything you wish to play if you order and upgrade it would probably max out the graphics of any game mine had the GeForce 680gtx and ran any game I installed
Yes
Yes.
Yes, just connected the ribbon and worked without modification for XPS 15" L502X
It will charge it just fine! I use this exact charger on my MacBook, MacBook Pro 13", an MacBook Pro 15" Retina. Having more wattage is okay, it's having not enough where the problem lies. If I recall, 15" and 17" MBP require 85w whereas the MBP 13" require 60w. The MBP 13" will only take as much power as it needs, so it won't be the full 85w. This is similar to when your iPhone can charge using the iPads 2.1a charger AND the supplied iPhone .5a charger. The iPhone only draws as much power as needed.
If plane provides 12 volt through the same outlet as autos. I use mine every day in my car.
Yes, but it is bulky. This case looks great and is almost a steal at the price.
I have had problems with this for over a year, battery appears to be swollen and won't allow unit door to close. Time to lose at least the battery.
Yes, for sure.
Yes, I have wore both my prescription and sun glasses and it is not a problem once you get the hang of putting them on. They go over your ears and the 'ear' part of your glasses but they do hold snug to your 'face' so they dont pull on your glasses much at all. Never has been an issue for me anyways.
Yes they are. You may have to use the included extension/connector. Just remember there may be some phones that have compatibility issues. I have a Nexus 5 and it is crystal clear features. No issues!
It has a rechargeable battery. Plug it into a USB port and it charges.
Hi, 500mA will be enough for each camera. Irene
AC
I personally couldn't get it to work all the time and that's standing right next to it. It also gets so hot it may burn your skin if its next to your face. I had it on a cap very hot. I returned it and purchased a go-pro its been a great little product.
You have to set a region first (which I don't want to do) because the drive comes region-free (with firmware level RPC-2). As is, I have tried playing a Region 2 DVD from Japan using MPC HC, VLC and Power DVD 10 and only MPC was able to open the disk but the image was heavily pixelized and it eventually crashed.
they are a Xmass gift so I do not know at this time.
Yes, I used an SX70 instant print polaroid camera.
Yes, it will fit.
Yes, this LCD screen protector will fit in on your NEX5N (LCD panel: 7.5 cm, 3.0 type). This is the same for NEX5R. Ely
CD player loads 1 at a time. Not sure if it fits your vehicle. Sounds great!
I have an iPhone 5s and it does, hope this helps
Yes...Proly not with a case tho....The holder opens to 3" wide max.
It doesn't have a true "ball" head it does move a little though. If you want s ball head for more control I'm sure you could purchase one. I love my joby though. It works great
Yes. It will 100% compatible with the Aspire One 722-0465
The files are .mp4 so yes.
At a setting of 1080 you can record 139 minutes of video. At 720 you can go 269 minutes. Files are in .mp4 format.
I would go with Samsung's specs of 3m,as far as the warranty for water damage,I would check with Samsung. My personal opinion on anything such as camera's,etc. being able to be submerged is that unless you have a secure waterproof case designed for underwater use,I wouldn't use it for underwater pics. I bought this camera to take to the beach and if it got wet or fell into the water I felt it would take that kind of use(abuse) as compared to a regular digital camera.I hope this helps and sorry for long response.
Yes it will.
I bought this case and it fits my laptop perfectly. My MacBook Air model is MD712 which is the one that came out Summer 2013
I have not used my Mac outside with the covers, so I don't have an answer for this problem. The case has been wonderful.
Yes
Look on the back (underneath) of your macbook. In very small writing you will see "model #:" This product specifically lists the model that it fits. Good luck!
Nope! Just be careful when you put it on because it has to snap (or more like click on to) on to the computer.
The lightning bolt thumb button is a joystick. Try clicking it in different directions until you see the 1-2-3-4 lights changing. 1 is the slowest DPI and 4 is the fastest. Their is also software you can install to customize more.
yes,it works under windows 8.1 but before you install the software put it on compatibility for windows 7 the .exe file and works fine ;)
Nope. The mouse wheel is quite stiff, in a solid feeling way. it does not spin freely.
Speaker wires from the receiver is the input to the unit.
It's closer to 17". I'm measuring 16 15/16"
I fear it will not, nor will a Wacom or any other replacement pen. Unfortunately my understanding of the configuration of the Genius G-Pen system demands having a Genius pen.
Yes, There are jumpers inside that will let you choose the correct ohms.
I don't know, but his mp3 player is very good, and you can add one 32Gb sd card too !
Yes the disk speed will affect the transfer speed. But your SATA connection will also make a difference. From my understanding a usb 2 will not max out a 5400 HDD's potential transfer speed. You should see an increase using both usb3 and TB. However, you will not get the 10GB/s without having an SSD and SATA 6 connection in your computer.
Yes, I have it myself and even though it's rather large, it fits.
According to a site I use for HW compatibility, use http://pcpartpicker.com. I plugged in the Corsair 200r case and the make and model of this video card and it shows it to be compatible. You will need a power supply of 500W minimum - depending on how many HDD and type CPU in build.
Yes it should as long as the holding screws match up
Not sure what app you using but try ip camera lite it is pretty easy to set up if you have an android phone
I am not 100% sure but of what I hear it may not. I think from mid 2011 and on is ok. But I have no real world experience with it. It works in my machine but its a mid 2012. I'd google it to see if others have tried. Sorry I'm not much help.
Yes, matte screen surface.
Yes. Dell rates the monitor as "100 to 240VAC".
I just got a delivery estimate of November 13th
Hi F. Lee ~~ The key to good wi-fi connections seems to be to upgrade programs and drivers on any device. As for Windows 8, I LOVE it! It's intuitive, practical and fun. Take that naysayers. :) The Acer Iconia is fast, the screen is beautiful, and it's reliable.
Go to the Acer website. From their you can look up a driver download. I did and have not had an issue since
It's in the description: VGA and DVI-D.
No. RAM is soldered onto mobo
It does not include windows 8 pro but you can upgrade for $39.99 I believe
Pretty much out of the question. You could put a larger SSD in place of the original. The USB 3 port gives excellent performance with a compatible external drive.
Don't know what HDM1 is. Did you mean HDMI? There is a micro HDMI port.
Yes, it will come by default with english (USA) language, but you can download chinese lang package from Control panel &gt; Language &gt; download other languages. I did that with Spanish and worked perfectly, although fisical keyboard still remains in english, you will have to figure out where are the keys, in my case is not that dificult but i don't know about chinese.
I don't think so, unfortunately
69 GB is still loads, but put in a microSD card int the slot and move your photos and music if you have lots on....they access just fine from it...maybe video would too, but I don't store them, so can't say. 64GB card works great with the S-7.
Hi,pls check with ur carrier,whether ur carrier support 850mhz 1900mhz or 1700mhz thx
Yes it will and the speed is pretty fast beyond my expectations.
Yea
Try the manual setup process.
All the keys are labeled and just like a regular keyboard, except that the keys may not always be in the same place. It works very well with my Kindle Fire HD. Haven't tried it yet with my 8.9 Kindle Fire HDX.
Hi Garrett, its an ASUS M5A78L-M LX Plus motherboard.
Windows 8 (home edition) is installed and running on the GT70 Laptop. You have to burn onto a DVD your own recovery/re-install/backup. The app for doing so is also already on the hard drive. That is all I can tell you because I formated my hard drive, created new partitions so I could dual boot between Win8 and Linux-Mint 14, and Linux-Mint works perfect on this laptop, so good that I do not even boot into Win8.
under the battery
Nvidia GTX 670mx
I ran just Pandora for over 4 hours with Bluetooth and WiFi on. While playing Skyrim on ultra, it lasted about 45 minutes. But on both tests, I set the laptop to sleep if the battery gets below 10%. I think it would last around 2 hours, if not more, depending on what your normal use is (15 web pages, while listening to music, and 3 excel files will take more battery than just 1 web page and 1 MS Word doc).
No it's not.
Any IR repeater works.. I have http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BLTDZA/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and it works great.
Yes, you can do that using the Airplay functionality, for the Iphone some music players has the airplay functionality but not all of them, so you must ensure that you app. allow that part. You must connect the speakers as a front speakers and the sub woofer in the proper plug and that's it, enjoy it.
I only have one game loaded on mine - we are older - 67 yrs. So games are not our forte, but the one we do play runs just fine. Sorry I was not of any more help than that.
Yes it fits the TF100T as well as the TF300T. I use it for both models.
Yes they do, the only thing I would suggest is to extend the headband (it will sit a little loose). FYI it is a matter of time before they snap. The headband is made from very cheap plastic. The sound is truly incredible but I wonder why they would decide to go with a cheap headband that will eventually snap. After reading the reviews on here I tried to be very careful with mine but they snapped anyway, so it is not how but rather when they decide to snap.
The ones I bought were Royal Blue. Very nice.
Yes. The ones I purchased had everything included.
I am not really sure, I got mine for $49.99 on a lightening deal so I wasn't too worried about features of a new version. The box came with headphones, the audio cable, storage bag, and a microfiber cleaning cloth. If I had to pay full price for these, I would probably opt for a blue tooth capable version.
I have not had that problem, but perhaps you should keep the piece of foam if you are concerned
It works with 3 different 7" tablets that I have and 2 my daughter and grand daughter have 5 different ones.
ours did...........
According to the plug (power supply) it is rated for 100-240V and 50/60Hz, so yes, I believe it will work given the correct prong adapter.
Sorry, not sure. Haven't installed .
I don't honestly know as I am only running an A-4 processor on it for a media center, but I don't see why not. Cpu-upgrade.com lists it as compatible with all FM2 A-4, A-6, and A-8 cpus. Hope that helps.
Yes. It has a pci-e slot. So it supports pci-e devices. Low profile should only matter if you have limited space...it doesn't affect compatibility in any way.
Hello Inicarte, All Q-See systems have our exclusive Mult-DVR Management Software, which allows you to monitor and manage multiple DVRs from one single login. As long as the DVRs are within the same series (this DVR is a QS Series DVR. hint: the first two letters in the model number is the series). You can connect up to 100 DVRs, or up to 2,000 cameras. You can also view 64 cameras at one time.
To really be on the safe side, I think you need something bigger.
I have a d7100 with the 70 to 300 lens and it fits well, both mounted on the body and off. I believe the d7100 is relatively similar to the d5200 so assume it would be fine. I can also fit two other lenses and extra batteries, filters, etc...a lens beyond 300 might be a bit tight. Good luck...
The rain hood is inside a zipper behind the bag, where the bag rests on your back
You put one of the legs through the elastic band and there is a snap on the bottom end and it hangs there. Its worked perfectly for me
When you're on your desktop screen there should be a small toolbar on the lower left of the screen called "VAIO Gate". Click on that tab and you should see a Imagination Studio icon. The software isn't initially installed on the laptop. You have to install it yourself but it is free if you register your name, email and address. I just installed them all 2 nights ago and they work. I didn't have to purchase anything extra. Good luck.
2.2 GHz Intel Core i7-3632QM quad-core processor (3.2 GHz with Turbo Boost Technology; 6 MB L3 cache)
No, it does not. But, with that said, that's the ONLY thing I don't like about my computer.
I don't know what that is, so it probably doesn't. Sorry I could not help.
Yep
nope to both questions.
Select (left click) on the wireless icon in the task bar. You should see all they wireless Wi-Fi networks in range. You should also see the Mobile Broadband with the T-Mobile network. right click on the T-Mobile network and then select 'View connection properties'. That should bring up the T-Mobile Broadband Properties page with has the IMEI.
No, requires external DVD drive
I'm using mine with a Samsung 840 SSD. Works flawlessly...and fast.
Yes and no, there is a cable that is attached to the headphones but then it breaks away shortly after that to an extension.
It does have a jack. Original packaging comes with an external mic.
I believe so but I would try to get the extreme one that's is going to be fast. Also make sure you reformat the card in the contour before use so it works properly.
I don't have a Dell but a Lenovo 10". The neoprene covers are great for travel and I have a leather cover with elastic corner tabs designed for kindle that fits very well
It should fit I got this case and its about an inch bigger than the iPad
Hello Jean G, I Have the chromo 160 and the newer 160. The Chromo is slightly bigger than the newer. Both lights carry 160 lcds and come with 3 filters. Hope this helps. Randell
Hi, I hope this answer your question. http://products.bose.com/pdf/customer_service/owners/og_l1_compact.pdf
Their are two outputs (Master/Auxiliary) on the T1 ToneMatch audio engine that would require a 1/4 inch plug/cable. If that is what your 4 track 4 channel tape recorder requires, if might work. You would have to have some way of controlling the audio into your recorder. Hope this helps.
Yes it is!! BEst camera I've ever bought to date!!
it is an aftermarket battery but I think it is just as good as the Canon labeled one. Of course, Canon doesn't make batteries so the ones with a Canon label aren't made by Canon either.
No.
Yes
No
we have been very satisfied with evening shots, such as moon rises and the only 'sports action' would be our puppy running.
The barndoor wing should be attached. If you purchased,but recd w/o it,please e-mail us your order id w/message. So we can take care of that. regards, kimoutlet
Are you using a charger for this? All you need is the unit that comes in the package. Just plug it in to the wall and connect to the DC IN connection. Note there is a DC IN and a DC OUT connection.
No, it just works like a regular charger as far as I can remember.
About 5.5" x 8.5" by 0.75".
It will record only one channel at a time. It has just one tuner. Ity will record while you watch another program if you use a splitter and run the other leg directly to the TV.
Yes, as long as you're getting a good signal from the antenna now, you should get the same channels on the recorder.
yes, it is!
Sorry, but for some reason your question doesn't appear. So, i can't answer.
Any monitor will work
yes Anthony it does ,you may have to install new drivers to get it working right
Yes the ram can be changed. Th graphics can be changed but the card would take an expansion slot unless you purchase the pc without the integrated video card.
No, it's just a standard wired keyboard & mouse. Great computer, though.
I found this on HP website: Power Supply Internal 300W (100V-240V) Form factor: Internal ATX Total wattage: 300W Nominal input voltage range: 200-240V/3A (50-60Hz) Dimensions: 150mm x 140mm x 86mm (5.9 x 5.5 x 3.4 inches)
Yes, it would be great for gaming with an additional good graphics card. EVGA makes some really nice ones for not much money.
It has a 1.5TB hard drive. Very nice desktop. I am very happy with it.
Yes I did
Not sure what the requirements are but I run mine off of a 10 amp 12 volt deer feeder battery that runs my 32 qt ice chest radio powering 4, 6" 8 olm 120 watt speakers. A fully charged battery will last about 18 hrs ! Hope this helps!
Yes. I was able to put the amazon app on my just to test it out.
if you are talking about set-top box, yes. The device accepts an input from set-top box or any other A/v source through a HDMI cable.
Yes, 3.5mm
i have a keyboard that doubles as a cover and it fits perfectly. It also has a nice plush cushion on the inside but still room for both my ipad and the keyboard which is probably another 4cm thick
No there isn't !
No; this case was make for the iphone 5
I own only an iPhone5, so I am not able to answer that question. I can say it fits the iPhone5 as if it were a custom fit.
God
Yes if your TV has 3d capability then these will work.
Dear Friend, Thanks for your response. In our product info., we do not find out your TV model. Could you please kindly check the link of this item: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FU1YTEM This one might be compatible with your model. Please kindly have a try. If it is not compatible after you buy one, yuou can return it to us for a refund. Thanks a lot.
You have a one year warranty with proof of purchase.. From my recollection no fee is applied... Well except sending in the device... But as long as you take care of it (not storing it somewhere it can break).
No. It is designed to work with Nikon system 1 only.
It's only for aesthetic purposes. But the red metal cover does serve as an EMI shield.
Because you get two.
Yes, Zach! It will need an audio amplifier with, at least, 5 watts of audio output power into 4 to 8 ohms impedance. Good luck.
I think it would, but the mini that I have and my sister has is the original ipad, not the retina. So, I'm not 100% sure. I think they are the same size, though??? Good luck!
Not sure but as a warning mine fell apart after about three months.
I own this one and there's no PIR sensor. It relies on motion detection using the software built in to the camera itself. You log in to the admin account of the camera through the internal webserver and set it up from there. This little camera does a LOT for the money. But if you're not tech-savvy, I'd avoid it. D-link doesn't have the best documentation or customer service in the world. But if you're good at teaching yourself some networking skills, this is a great little IP camera.
As far as I know Its the same camera If you go to the D link web site there will be a tab at the top that says business solutions click that it will bring you to that camera.
Company out of Michigan makes them where they're are actually made I'm not sure. If it helps I have really enjoyed its features and for the price hard to beat. We started with the Google Chrome stick which I returned and purchased the favi. Hope this helps
I don't know what that is about.
No, we have not. Hopefully, someone will be able to make that comparison for you.
Please refer to this link:
No, it does not. You will have to buy that separately. I re-used an i7-3770K processor for an older machine I scrapped, but any LGA-1155/Socket 1155 processor should work fine.
HD monitors will work, as long as you plug them into the provided nvidia video card rather than the on-board video port. The video card supports full HD.
I bought the product for my eTrex 20 and it works fine. I don't know how it will work in the eTrex 30 but I think it will be OK.
Dear Tiffany, This was my leap of faith. I couldn't find a technical replacement for the cord from any specialty shop. It is a custom cord with a USB end on it. I looked at the back of my drive The port looked like a little house with a white square in the center of it. The cord was inexpensive here. I bought it and the whole thing was a success. Korky
Nope. They aren't as bulky as they look. My fiancee put one on his wallet and I put one on my phone and neither of us had any trouble putting in our pockets and etc.
1 inch by 2 inches
I have had mine for about 3 months and have not had to change the battery that came with the unit.
It makes a piercing sound and a light goes off --I think it would REALLY scare a cat. I wouldn't use it for that purpose. I'd try a pet supply site to see if they carry something a little more animal-friendly.
If the Kindle Fire has Bluetooth it will work.
Yes
It should fit most any car cuz it has 2 or 3 adapters
Go with the Pentax DA 50mm f1.8. On the cropped pentax sensor, its equivalent to a ~85mm. If you are looking for a "normal" lens get something between 30mm and 35mm.
not sure, mine i just use and existing radio and plug into the audio jacks and pput the radio on auxilary and should work just fine, so basically the existing radio is the amplifier, thanks jk
Didn't fit mine, the edges curled...maybe it would eventually stretch, but I thought it should fit correctly.
I bought the same phone case for my phone in the description it said it would fit. But when I got it totally different story did not fit at all I'd suggest not getting that case
The Defender is bigger and the commuter is slightly smaller. The Defender has a rougher outside and is built seemingly more rigid than the commuter I only have the commuter. I haven't ever tried a defender, it has a built in screen protector as part of the case, The commuter does not so you can do like I do and use adhesive ones or not use them at all because well the screens have come a long way since the beginning of smartphones they hold up better than before.
Dear Customer, All the other colors will be available for preorder in 1 week. Sincerely, INVELLOP
Yes
Even though I have purchased through
I believe you have the option to start fresh and not import your old numbers.

This card reader is only able to be used with either a Pay Anwhere account or a Phone Swipe account -- both of those are essentially the same product provided by North American Bancard. Because the card reader is encrypted to communicate only with their software, these readers cannot be used with other products. However, the account set up through NAB will deposit directly into your US based checking account, usually within one business day on new accounts. There are some good articles on this mobile payment option on this blog: http://merchantprocessingexposed.blogspot.com/
The stereo mini plug input is on the front of the "powered speaker" ( the one with volume control) under the headphone jack, on the right side.
Yes it does.
Possibly, but it does not come with the MP3 Player. I guess you'd have to buy it separately as is it an accessory.
Yes. I was able to get full 1080p output to my 23 inch display.
I do not have those specific batteries. .. But I do not see why not. Have charged batteries for the following: Sony rx100 Canon s 100 Canon 70 Panasonic gf1 Panasonic l x1 Samsung note 3 Sanyo xacti So. ..i really do not expect a challenge. I am on to buying my third unit. My friend was so impressed that he refused to return it Cheers
Thanks for the question. Interface of English is pre-installed. So, you only have you set. Any questions Do you have the other?
Yes, as well as DVDs or any other media besides Blu-Ray discs.
No, for this model (not sure about other models) the 4GB RAM is soldered to the motherboard; and so, cannot be upgraded. This is confirmed by other similar models on the Acer website, as well as this memory reseller webpage: http://www.crucial.com/upgrade/Acer-memory/Aspire+Notebooks/Aspire+S3-391-9499-upgrades.html
No it was perfect! Thank you!! :)
This keyboard should be recognized as a standard Bluetooth keyboard by your tablet. However since your tablet is a Windows tablet some of the function keys might not work as expected since they were designed with Android devices in mind.
Absolutely. FSX have a better render with nvidia chipsets, with Radeon it runs good too, but FSX recommends Nvidia, also I have a Radeon too but runs much better in nvidia. My brother play it everyday, and is a very good choice, he plays with 3 monitors. Smooth.
As per the Nividia website: "Maximum Graphics Card Power (W) 140 W Minimum System Power Requirement (W)5 450 W"
hello, no there is no Significant difference between those two. N660 TF will be only Slightly Cooler thats all.
So far it handled everything quite well for me. It is recommended to search and update drivers from time to time even if windows update doesn't show the update.
I am running three monitors with this card. that is the max. cross fire yes, with certin other models only
Hi, You can use with 3G card in China. Thanks.
It doesn't seem like it. I tried it with the camera plugged to the computer and using a wall outlet.
When I got mine it was in Chinese(I think). I had to reference my other android to switch to English. I believe the device supports localizations for several languages, possible including the ones your questioning. I know at least it supports English.
Yes it will!
Yes, it works on my Surface Pro 2.
It's on the left and its about 6 ft in length
Yes
yes
I don't know but do yourself a favor and buy a little better one this one not that good
Perfect fit
Yes it does.
that is exactly what it does...
It works with my tablet. And it's windows 8. I've seen where Bluetooth works for phones on YouTube. I would say yes. This keyboard is great. Good feel, good size. Try it out.
yes
Yes Emmanuel this hard drive has been efficient and fast, have no issues to report about it!
Its does. It will turn green. I think mine took like 6 hours to fully charge.
I'm not sure but I found this one
Yes
By my measurement: Outer Diameter: 4.375" Inner Diameter: 2.375" Thickness: 1"
Possibly no. Because it has a built-in battery.
U have to charge the battery.
The camera is officially rated as IP66, via Q-See webpage
110V
My experience is that the motion detection device is poorly engineered and takes EXCESSIVE motion (waving arms, walking 3 feet in front) to activate device. We use it for our cat waterer (he likes running water) and he is completely unable to activate it with his smaller body size.
My son has the 64 GB and it worked perfectly. I am not sure about the 32 GB.
It is better than the otterbox cases. much more sealed up and protected.
Yes there is a plastic cover over the numbers. As for the yellow...It is a yellow color. I bought it for my son thinking it was Steelers colors but it is a more florescent yellow color. Hope that helps!
1- 6pin power connector
No, it only has a DVI to VGA adapter. Although the card itself does have support for three concurrent displays: two dual-link DVI connectors and Mini_HDMI port.
Yes
yes
i am running 3 monitors and an lcd tv.
Yes, but you need to run it on the intake side directly off of your exhaust lift valve. Also make sure you upgrade your piston return springs
Never looked into it, but have had no problems with them! Nice product for summer time use, Bose too hot in summer.
It paired effortlessly with my MacBook Air.
Yes.
Probably but I don't like this product one bit. I would advise against it. It's heavy and doesn't stay on very well. Look good but isn't worth it.
The sound comes from both ears and the people's voice come as if they were sitting next to you!! This are amazing!
Unfortunately NO. That, as well as being able to record CDs, would be just wonderful. No way to contact the engineers at Funai, however.
Yes, mine does this too. I just paid attention to the start up noises. There are two "clicks" followed by one "click". They are the same noises as when the DVD tray is closed.
Yes
My third screen is a very old 19" LCD. It was never intended to be used for gaming. That being said, to help answer this question I fired up World of Warcraft and moved it to my third screen. It appeared to work fine. WoW may not be the best example.
It is just that a power button. It is for testing your build with out having to hook up the power header to the case power button. Hope this helps.
Yes it will.
13x11x3
No, it doesn't. HP Stream doesn't support any active pen.
It would not work with my HP ElitePad but I do not know if it will work with your model.
Yes! I put mine in a 2008 tacoma. Works great! There is a quick plug in on the back if the stereo. I proceeded to run the wire through the center console along the passenger side. I only needed the aux connection, so I pushed the wire through the net holding hook in the storage box. The lid doesn't seem to effect the wire and leaves about 2 feet of room outside the box. More than enough cord. The Hope this helps
C.rain the two prongs are for the mic and head set. Every PC tower I ve ever owned had thos two designated colored plug in ports. Not sure if you are trying to use the plug in port on the front or back. The head set works perfectly as advertised and have now owned them for many months. Would recommend them to any one as I great head set. cga
This isn't the right adapter for your car. Audio quality is pretty good (if it works) . But in some vehicles if you're charging a device from your 12v socket and playing music from the same device you'll get a steady whine. To fix that you'd need to install a ground loop isolator.
I think not, this item only work at honda 2001 to 2003.
yes it should. But be warned, these things die out after a month....even faster!
Yes
the stock cd player still functions when device is installed
They both reach the cup holder...
Ive had mines for over 3 months and its still going.
The light does turn off on ours, too, and so far, everything's been fine.
It has a built-in charger with a USB cable and power adapter.
No. Battery is recharged by a USB cord that plugs into a wall plug or can be charged through your computer. Seems to charge up much faster by wall outlet. Uses the same USB cord for charging that is used to upload photos to computer. Hope this helps.
Short answer: No. Will it work - yes. Is it a good idea - no. It's not rated for anything other than low voltage work, and it's NOT rated for direct burial.
Round
No mention of user-accessibility in the ASUS Manual (other than disassembly will void the product warranty) and no way for me to tell absent attempting to take my unit apart. There is an E-SATA + USB 2.0 Combo port to connect to an external Serial-ATA hard disk drive or other devices, including external HDDs. To be sure, I would recommend contacting ASUS Tech Support prior to purchasing.
I use Ultrasonic to shake up my tattoo grips and tubes. Works good.
No. I use this as a precursor to runing my auto clave. I run all of my stainless tubes through it prior to bagging and sterilization. Hope that helps.
From the quick search of your motherboard: Your board supports PCI-e The card is PCI-e 3.0 Generally devices are backwards comparable but you will experience slower bus speeds. I am not sure if you have 3.0 or not, but the card should work regardless. The only downfall I dislike about this specific card is it says it supports SLI, but does NOT actually have the ports. So it supports it, just cant use it? Thats silly to me.
Yes
Yes. My favorite case so far
There is no handle / strap too grab it in the hand. But, I don't think it is necessary
Yes, I believe so. I can plug two of these into one outlet, if that is what you mean. (one on top of the other). The switch to turn on or off is on the side so you can still access it.
2
Yes, the mobo and case are both M-ATX
I'm not sure since our model is different. Have you checked with Sharp or where you purchased your TV? Wish I could have helped.
Have no clue. Never looked. But worked great for my tv thou
Yes as long as the connection is correct
yes it is working with model UN55H6350
on the inside where it folds...it isn't a loop, it is a cut through where you hook it in
4 x DDR3 Dimm Sockets
If you mean external, only the power cord.
No, you connect the soundbar to your TV using the digital optical cord and then anything that is plugged into your TV through HDMI will come through the soundbar.
Hi, Clay! It is not possible.
I still have a minor problem with having to turn up the volume to here dialog and then turn it down when action scenes are playing.
What is the question
Accommodates ATX power supplies - I used this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00918N4A0/ref=oh_details_o09_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I didn't keep this unit. It worked so horribly that I sent it right back for a refund....
No it does not. The previous 2000 model did but is unavailable now.
Hi Antonio, Thank you for your question. We can confirm that the drive will work in a MacBook Air. Regards, Gaiacom
Hi, yes works nice, i have one on my macbook pro 15"
Blanco
It is. The listings are confusing many places. Sync!ed right up with my Android Motorola RAZR Max. Nice radio generally.
yes this unit is equipped with bluetooth for both phone calls and streaming music wirelessly
The front I think is for a direct input from a camera. The back is video out.you can also us a av. Splitter to hook up multiple screens.
This RAID Card , It Can Work on Linux ~
The slots aren't big enough for liner notes!
yes I can
I'm not really sure....but for as cheap as they are I usually buy 2 or 3 at a time and replace when they get fried by lightning. I usually don't bother with warranties.
3200? basically this mic will work with any device that uses the 1/8 inch male to female connection. This is a great mic for the money and it sounds fantastic.
This device is an upconverter, which will take radio signals in AM broadcast through upper HF bands, and output them shifted up by 125MHz. This is a useful thing for those using RTL based software defined receivers, since they don't cover the medium wave and shortwave HF bands.
No it does not
no
Yes, This laptop has a port VGA. It's a excelent computer!
I would not buy this again. It has broken 2 times on my in the past 5 months and dealing with Dell Customer Service is the WORST thing you can go through.
Yes it does have a power cord.
I just use normal headphones with a normal jack that you find in all stores. Its nothing special, just a 3.5 jack
Yes But only the middle one Allthough you can download an app than enables all three buttons.
It will work but only one at a time.
There is no straps in this case
Absolutely, great case.
It will work, just figure you will have to adjust the frequency of the RAM in BIOS if it doesn't show up as 1600.
yes. there is a multi function button. press once to pause, twice to go to next, three times for previous, and hold for different equalizer settings built into headphones. works fine with my samsung gs3
Just hold the button down until you're here equalizer disabled
I've never been in the rain wearing them. As far as sweat, well, they are for runners.
HDMI ports on laptops are OUT ONLY
I do not know I have an iphone 4
There are two slots only. Mine is filled with 2. 2gig chips. You have to order 2 4gig chips to max out ram
Yes it has a dvd burner
Mane was 6gbs under earlier bios but usb3 did not work bios update sorted usb3 but broke sata back to 3gb/s.
This is the processor info from My Computer: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-3110M CPU @ 2.40GHz 2.40 GHz
It depends on the type of grip you are using. It would not accommodate the "stick" type of grip, but could work with a leather strap grip which is flexible. The compartments can be adjusted for size so it may work for your needs. I love this camera bag!
It does fit under an airplane seat perfectly. I have done that several times.
I use my Windows Explorer while A110 is cabled to USB on laptop so I can use laptop keyboard and change what I want on MicroSD because the SD slot on my laptop no longer works...
Yes it is via a 3.5mm jack.. just like headphones .. however let me repeat if you lose the remote for this device you will be unable to turn it on..
Definitely CrossFireX which is APU (integrated video) working with GPUs like 6570 and 6670 only. No sense to make like dual 7850 here or anything else
The buyer should contact Amazon, or if Amazon suggests it, the company Amazon obtained it from. Knowing Amazon's reputation, I am sure they will replace it for you at no cost.
Yes, it was designed for that model. You can not use the automatic lens cover with the front of the case attached however.
Yes it fits nicely. However...I bought an auto lens cap for it and now the case is too small for the lens. But it will fit as is.
I don't think it will fit. I have an aspire one d255-2509 with a 10.1 inch screen and the aspire one 722-0432 has an 11.6 inch screen.
Sorry but i am don`t end user of this part.
I tried answering before so not sure this is being sent twice. The answer is YES. In order to watch them you have to download the video to your computer. There is no view screen on the camera itself. After downloading there is a prompt asking if you want to delete the video. You do want to do this so as to clear the camera and have space for the next video recording.
If you use FLAC files, gapless play is possible. There is definitely a gap when playing back MP3s and other compressed formats.
According to the datasheet, available on the product page, this laptop does not include a backlit keyboard.
Check Lenovo's support site for this model to see if they carry the Windows 7 drivers. If they don't, try googling "Lenovo H520s Windows 7 drivers" and see if anyone has advice/links to specific drivers.
This computer comes with Gigabyte B75M-D3H - Specs -&gt; http://www.gigabyte.com/products/product-page.aspx?pid=4150#ov . Comes with 2 PCI-E and 2 PCI Slots.
Must be a screw up by Amazon. I received my Lenovo Y580 a week ago and I can confirm it is 2.4Ghz.
Yep ours did that too. Ended up sending it back and getting a higher quality PC. No problems since
You need to purchase one separetely
This is for a pair.
You need to used smil box under 1 .1
I have an iPad mini w/ a smart COVER and the fit is perfect. I believe the fit would be fine with a smart (hard) case. There is a foam pad that can be removed if you need the room, but that shouldn't be necessary.
They will sound good with a aftermarket stereo. But an amp will give it more power and neater sound.
as I see it ; it should work I looked it up and your model number is listed under the remote..
No. I use the recorder to record from my DVR
Yes. Just checked and my Bluetooth says 4.0+HS. When the Bluetooth signal is strong, the SHARKK reception exceeds the 50 feet advertised by 30 additional feet and the audio is sharp and clear. When the signal is not so strong, you may get some distortion and even disconnects. The SHARPP will continue to try to reconnect. Sun flares seem to be behind the disconnects.
I have a 2, but it says in the description, that it works on a 3. I would assume it does.
Yes, the cord was for an original iPad. As far as I know, The cord is made by a third party. Works fine.

yes
yes I am able to use while plugged in
Yes, the cord was for an original iPad. As far as I know, The cord is made by a third party. Works fine.
How would I know?
Didn't work on my 3d Panasonic . Had to buy Panasonic glasses
If you are installing from Scratch, set it BEFORE.
I have a dvd vcr player combo and it only had the standard rca connections. I hooked it up and it worked great. Even with a hdmi coupler between hdmi cables. I switched between the 720 and 1080 settings but couldn't tell a big difference but they both worked. It's definitely worth a shot.
No this does opposite of what you need it for. This will connect old products such as a VCR to new TV sets with HDMI.
No I must hit the button before closing and wake my device on opening . The quality case is worth it for the price .
Horizontal.
Yes, of course. I think 512G SSD is enough for you. But if ur budget is generous, 1TB is better. BTW, Samsung 840EVO is TLC, and 840/850PRO is MLC. MLC has longer life (3000+ write circles) and TLC has only 1000+ write circles. MLC always has 128/256/512/1024G, TLC always has 120/240/500/1T because it has reserved space. If you choose MLC SSD, 512/1024G are OK. If you want to buy TLC SSD, choose a bigger one.
Well if you go RAID 0 you will have faster read/write speeds with regular hds or ssds. ssds are way faster, so theoretically a raid 0 ssd should be the fastest ever. Just be sure you motherboard or disc controller can do raid.
The software that comes with it will update it... mine was updated already when I installed it yesterday 01=08-2014
no, its very cheap you cannot tell if its on for one, the memory card does not stay in, do not waste your money on it
It lasts a very long time! I fully charged overnight before first using it, and it kept a charge for well over 1 month. Used it 5-10 times for about 35minutes total recording time, before I recharged it.
Don't really know what to tell you for sure. It is kind of a guessing game as what will work best for you. I am happy with my purchase, my battery was so weak that I had to stay hooked to electric (only had about 20 minutes on old battery) this one works just like a new one should. I don't think any of the batteries will do exactly what they say. (seems just like a guideline to me)
i3
No
Not sure about the Razer Kraken 7.1, but I tried my Logitech 930 5.1 wireless and they fit just fine. I bought the case for my new Audio Technica Pro Headphones to carry back and forth to work on my Harley and it works great I can't recommend them highly enough. Hope this helps...
Not as Bluetooth(that I know of) but will with usb connector.
If your Sony have the 2.5" HD it'lll work. But I can remember you that only win 7 and above support TRIM command.
It will fit in your AlienWare M17X, if you replace your existing 2.5" hard drive. If you use the Samsung migration software (http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/samsungssd/downloads.html), be aware of the following limitations: - On systems with three (3) drive letters or more (e.g. "C:", "D:", and "E:" drives) with the operating system installed on the "C:" drive, only the first two consecutive drives will be cloned ("C:" and "D:" drives). The "System" partition that is created during Windows installation is automatically replicated. - OEM recovery partitions, generated at the factory by computer manufacturers, cannot be replicated.
No it won't and cloning the drive is not a good idea. You'll want to install windows directly onto the ssd and use the hdd as a backup
Works fine but XP does not support TRIM (look it up) you must use supplied Magician software to keep up speed. Also check out partition alignment. I think these drives are best used as a System drive with traditional disk as Data drive. (Multi Drive System). Make sure you create Recovery Disks for re-installation. Samsung transfer software will not transfer Recovery Partition. Also buy drive kit (not bare drive) with transfer cable and mounting hardware. Hope this helps.
If you can turn off a Macbook with a universal tv remote, then yes. This device just runs through a bunch of universal remote codes to turn the item off.
Ya it should fit
5 feet this cable is perfect buy it, i always buy monster for the price also yo can see the black platinum series
Should be fine in people in the past have attached a directional antenna to it for automatic pointing. Hope that helps!
It did not come with a fan directly over the CPU on the side. The back fan does a good job. My case has a 580gtx in it and the original case fans do a fine job.
I use mainly the 5.1 mode, and switch to stereo 2 channel if I lis to music. of course they sound less complete than my big infinity boxes, but that's expected. The argument for the Yamaha is space and sound. We found it a serious improvement to the setup before with tv speakers only.
No
Yes it does.
Yes, and yes. It works with any newer car ( newer then the late 90'). You will need an app to run it, I use carista, it is free and works great.
Idk I try 98 toyota ' s and 97 nissan ' s , and newer models. ...since I work in a dealer. ...I never try on a Ford thou I should.....
Mine came with several adapters using the 4 pin pwm as the "standard connection
This fan has a 3 pin connector.
Inside the box the screen protective covers come in is a small piece of paper that has a link to a YOUTUBE video to see how to install the protector without air bubbles.
No, this is 7 1/2 inches. Maybe there's one for a regular iPad that's bigger. This is for a mini.
64 bit
The software gets loaded on the local workstation and then the device prints. It does not work with other software to my knowledge. I only used the software that came with the device. It is very much like a regular printer
Unfortunately no
I have owned one of these for about a year now, and it has speakers but your better off getting external ones, and no it can't be tilted!
I'd say it is Mac compatible but not I have all PCs.
Mine has held up so far through after almost four months of late summer T-storms and fall rains. For only $15 I wouldn't complain if it was dead in the morning having only lasted a few months, you get what you pay for. DO NOT buy the little chrome dome-shaped camera on Amazon, it will get condensation on the inside and be useless very quickly.
Yes it can
Yes!
Yes is does
Yes, I have it on mine, they are the same dimensions
Yes.
I don't know.
You'll probably need to take it out of it case to dock and charge on top but it has a USB slot on the back you can plug a charger in. We have two and that's how my daughter does it.
Yes, it requires a graphics card. Note the first image on the product page that says "Requires discrete GPU."
Sorry. I cannot answer that question. Try asking the seller of this cable, he should be able to help!
I know my acer laptop charger works for my netbook as well.
yes! I use this charger for my laptop so this is a good fit for that item.
Sorry I'm not sure because I don't have an iHome alarm. With this case on the iPod you can plug in a headphone and a charger cord. The space on the bottom of your iPod between the headphone and charger cord area is covered with by the case, if this helps.
Yes, it can, that's the one I have. Fits pretty sung, too.
No, this is a flexible case. Nail Polish will not stick.
"Yes" to both questions. It's AMD's big AM3+ chip so it will almost certainly fit the motherboard. Gaming performance is mostly dependent upon the video card and RAM, not the CPU, so this is as big of a CPU as you would need for any game. It's an excellent choice for a gaming rig.
Yes. CPU fan and sink come with it as one piece.
Yeah, but an after market heatsink is recommended. I bought the Cooler Master Seidon 120v for it.
Yes
Thank you for contacting us. This camera comes packaged with: *EN-EL14 Li-ion Battery *Quick Charger *Audio/Video Cable *USB Cable *Rubber Eyecup *Camera Strap *Eyepiece Cap *Body Cap *Accessory Shoe Cover *NikonView NX CD-ROM *Instruction Manual
No internal battery it needs to be constantly plugged in with the included power adapter or with any micro USB cord. I personally like this for my truck because I can use my car charger to keep it powered and playing on long rides.
yes
It is 110V
well, i have had several power outages and I have never had to reset anything. When the power came on, it was as it had been. I don't know how long it would have taken to wipe the settings
Yes
Yes I purchased this kit for my sx50 camera. It works fine
It is in the box and everything is there. My box was open. Please see all the answers to all the questions I have posted thus far. I will post more tomorrow.
yes it worked great..
I have a small icon at the right hand bottom of the page that shows how much the battery is charged. The icon looks like a plug and a battery. Hope this helps. Chip
Sorry do not know, you probably have to compare pictures of 8460w and 8560w, maybe check if the DVD bay drive sparepart at HP is the same for these two and if so this probably will fit aswell. BR /Kim
I just took my SX 50 to the top of Mount Evans and was able to get dramatic close-up pictures of a herd of mountain goats. I also got a phenomenal shot of a mother mountain goat and her kid on a steep outcropping of rocks. The picture is so clear that you can see the eyelashes on the goats! I've owned many, many cameras and have never loved a camera as much as I love this one.
Yes. It comes with a 2 years manufacturer warranty
110 Volt
Genuine FOSCAM cameras have an ID sticker on the inside flap of the box. I ordered 4 F18910Ws and 2 F18905Ws, and all had the proper sticker. All work as advertised, except I have been unable to get the audio/speaker systems working yet, due the lack of a "plugin" player for my MAC. Still working this issue. In addition, I needed assistance from FOSCAM to "forward" the ports on my router to allow internet access to the video feeds.
I use Blue Iris on my PC and Foscam Pro on my ipad and iphone.. I only have 4 cameras but I think they can handle much more.
for Nikon D3100, D5100, D3200, P7000, P7100, EN-EL14 Battery, MH-24
This adapter is rated for 90w, Your computer is 65w.. I am not sure if it would cause damage but I would probably say it is safe to not go with it. I would suggest doing a little research because as I remember there is not a 65w adapter and this may be your only option. I am sure you can find blogs discussing this topic. Sorry I can not give you a clear-cut answer.
Hello usersteve, No, there is a small microphone cutout on the back of the iPad Mini with Retina Display. Thank you for your concern.
No. I don't think so, and also it's not made for it, so it would look wierd.
no
Yes it does.
no
I don't see it on mine -- What I see: hdmi input, microphone input, ethernet cable input, and 3 USB ports (and a headset input too, of course). I hope this helps!
Yes I recently installed it in a 2001 suburban with third row seat still up, it will fit
It Sound Really Good! Perfect!
The box is sealed
Yes it does
Use YouTube and follow the directions for android system. On the screen u may have to count each file to change to English.
i am not sure..i would guess at least 3 years... As for how long the battery would hold a charge: Depnds on how you use it...I had the wifi on and was playing a 3D game for 2 hours with full display brightness and after 2 hours i had 40% battery left...i got tired of playing so I am not sure how much longer it would last.....you could set the display brightness to 50% if you are just browsing the internet and it may last 3 hours with wifi on.....
All Tech Rover batteries come with a 1-Year warranty.
No. Only camera
I use the QT5682, but any dvr that is analog will work. It comes with a ptz remote receiver but if your dvr has it built in you will not need it.
If you have a good router, and connect this to extend the range, the speed not as fast as you would have if connected to router itself, but the speed is not slow, I say it's a moderate speed. ... It's a workable speed of connection.
Yes it does use extender all the time with ipad when I'm outside home
I've used it on my Verizon FIOS network. Note that the Verizon Router does not enable WPS button. So you'll need to connect this extender to your network using the other method. Not a big deal. In short, it works with Verizon FIOS.
Yes
Hi, for this Sony Battery Charger, it is design to change Sony InfoLithium X, G, N, D, T, R and K Series battery packs. Other not mention above will not work on this charger. -Ely
No they do not!
I didn't have a good experience with my purchase. When I received it, the machine was not what I ordered (per specs the CPU should be Xeon but they shipped Pentium instead). Finally they accepted the return but I had to pay the shipping for nothing. So my advice is before placing your order, make sure the unit is up to the specifications.
No 3G version at all. Also, there is no SIM card, it takes a microSD card. I would spend my money on another tablet instead of this one because I own one and it likes to freeze constantly.
Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; System &gt; Device Manager &gt; Bluetooth Radios ...inside locate the Bluetooth controller...on mine it was the INTEL ...under Power Management uncheck ALLOW COMPUTER ability to put to sleep to save power.
Yes, it will.
It has several venting areas. It is designed for these units. So the open slots match the venting and the cameras. I bought 2 of these cases to use on the same model SLATE at work. They work great and it has been quite some time.
Yes, you can. It also has an USB port on the dock station and a micro USB on the tablet.
This is an external USB hard drive with software that lets you decide what and when to run a backup of your files (data only i.e., pictures, music, documents, etc.), that are currently store on your computer (desktop or laptop). If your computer crashes, this external hard drive may be able to let you get some or all of your data restored to you computer. Consider this as an insurance policy taking care of your valuable computer file. Suggest you google of BING "External USB backup drive" to learn more. Good luck.
Yes, the head did come with 1 quick release plate.
That would depend on the amount of memory found on the SD Memory Card (which must be purchased separately). I do not believe using flash has any effect on the space the picture takes on the card, though.
I do not recall any 'protected' claim for this rechargeable, so suspect it is NOT... also, I found this website with additional information: http://www.lighthound.com/Rechargeable-Lithium-Battery-Information--Protected-vs-Unprotected-Li-Ion-Batteries--Lithium-Ion-Battery_ep_36-1.html
There is none if you run it off the mp3 you can not use the controlled on the top you can't skip tracks,memory stick is better cost less and weighs less and more room to put things in it
Burns and plays, but you must have software to burn them.
Amazon won't answer, you'd have to ask the seller if you don't trust what the person who gave the review said. Beside the picture of the battery, where it says: "In Stock. Ships from and sold by- Certified Battery" click on their name (certified battery) and then at the bottom/right side of their page, you have to the option to "contact seller" through email or whatever.
I use the charger that came with the G5 camera
only works hd
Well, you need to put significant force to open it. I have that problem too. Now I just don't close it tight so it can be easily opened.
Keyboard keys are smooth but not shiny. In other words, they have a matte finish. You can use either the touch pad on this computer, or you can use a wireless mouse. Just plug in the little receiver on the side of the computer and you will be good to go.
No, it does not. Bought it and does not fit
I've never actually done the sync-up but according to the instructions, all you have to do is load software that comes with the part.
I assume it depends on what's between the dongle and the device/laptop. It's using 802.11/2.4GHz so the range should easily handle 80' open space. Maybe even go through some walls as long as there isn't a lot of metal or dense stuff between it.
We only use this device for the application of sending from any device capable of transmitting wirelessly, TO the projector being used. In short it allows more flexibility for the presenter to display content from multiple devices and/or be able to be actively move around the room, not standing behind a podium. I am not sure if you are asking if it works in reverse? but if you are wanting to send the projector files from your computer, tablet or smartphone... YOU CAN.
Yes there is.
I believe there is another listing on Amazon for the product's earlier version.
I'm afraid it's unlikely. I've never seen any PC software that can modify the brightness levels of the laptop past what the built in function keys can do.
I'm not sure. If so it'd be in the touchpad settings where you could do so I think
not sure.in china,i use it with 220V
I'm sure it's internals use a proprietary drive but is a sealed unit and there isn't a lot of info out there on swapping out drives. There are other brands & models that are designed with removable cages that may be better suited
Hi, Roger. It's crunchy loud...I mean, I'm an audio engineer and I would not have this in the studio when recording. That's how loud the crunching is. I use it as a backup drive though, so no worries there. It's stable but scratchy when reading/writing data.
no
Go to you tube. They have really cool videos on how to... I really recommend it
There are external dimensions and internal dimensions.. and they are given in inches and centimeters (parentheses).
I would check with Lenovo.
Yes it came with a pen
no does not work
I'm not familiar with a "mini" jambox, but it fits the jambox that is about 6 inches long, 2 inches wide and 3 inches tall...hope that helps!
no
I bet. I had this thing up at 5:59 clicked the second it popped and it was already out.
Yes, but it needs a wired connection or an external wireless device. No internal wireless. I suprr happey with mine. The wireless works for the laptops, and I just have an ethernet running from the modem to the Asus. It is hooked up to a monitor and a smart tv, and it works very well.
Best of luck with your search for a match.
Yes it will work, because of the 64 bits architecture, as well, it is the same kind of memory: DDR3 SDRAM. you can check the manual on page 46, here is the link, http://www.lenovo.com/shop/americas/content/user_guides/z380_z480_z580_z585_ug_en.pdf Hope this help. "DDR3 SDRAM" stands for Double-Data-Rate 3 Synchronous Dynamic Random Memory Acces
The Memory controller of the Mac Mini does not support 1866 ram, if you install this ram you will be stuck at speeds of 1600 mhz. You are better off opting for the cheaper 16 gb 1600 mhz kits.
I'm not sure you should probably ask the seller, but it probably won't being that the mac air is so thin in comparison to the regular mac books.
It could reach 115cm max
The height of this tripod extended is 44.875 in.
NO! It is NOT! Once turned on it records until the battery runs down. You have to listen throught hours od "dead air" to hear anything relevant. And since it is shipped from China, it is not worth returning for a refund! I was extremely disappointed...
Yes, it does record voice. There is no start or stop button. With the device on it is always recording (voice activated). To listen to the recording you must download it onto a computer.
Yes. I bought this to extend a wifi signal that has a login page to gain access.
I am not sure if this is the info you are looking for but here is how my router is setup. I have broadband connection that I have a normal wireless router hooked to. Across my house where my desktop is located I have the 843ND. It picks up the wireless signal and turns it into a hardwired system that my desktop and VOIP phone hook into. This has worked flawless for about 6 months now.
Yes
The Odin for Sony product I have uses the Minolta style flash shoe that was common on older Sony cameras. I believe your A6000 uses the newer Multi-Interface hotshot.You may want to contact Phottix customer service to confirm which product to use on your gear.
NO, USB 2 only. The only reason USB 3 is mentioned is that it will work in a USB 3 port, but it will be USB 2 speed.
it will be very snug with a keyboard attached to it...i have a smart cover and a shell case on back and thats all it really holds...
I don't have a case on my iPad mini. The sleeve is probably too narrow. It depends on how far your case sides extend beyond the mini. I think you could get up to .5 inches more into the sleeve however it might strain the zipper.
Yes it will
Nope but let me know if you do! :) It probably matches the dimensions of a smartphone but I'm not sure which one. The included neoprene pouch is only good against dust and scratches but it is pretty sturdy actually.
Yes, you can tear away any old fabric from the old pads. When I replaced them, my headphones just had the bare metal pieces covering the internal speaker.
They work great on my Sony 7506.
Ann, You'll notice in the product description that it reads: Compatible with Sony MDR-7506, MDR-V6, MDR-CD900ST. However, I did some research and found this thread: http://audio.manualsonline.com/support/sony/headphones/headphone-covers-234972. If you scroll down you'll find this post: "I found replacements that fit perfectly even though they aren't for the same model number. cost was only $4.74. http://www.suntekstore.com/replacement-ear-cup-pads-for-sony-mdr__v600-mdrv600-mdr__v900-earpads.html" Here I believe you'll find what you're looking for. Hope this was helpful.
Googled around and didn't find an answer. Ask Panda City and ask for a confirmation (they answer questions very quickly)
You may contact PandaCity, they have a reseller for international shipping, my msp19U came this way (I'm living in Europa)
I use this without any trouble on my Fuji X100s. Should work on an XT-1 as well.
I am not 100% But all this has is two small keychain rings, so if it has two loop holes on the body, then yes. it will.
Hi Sara, yes of course.
It is a plug in... Beautiful room filling sound though
It is a multi-voltage (100-240V) speaker, work with both 110 and 240 plug.
No, its not fit for retina display pro
It can and mine often is charged via a micro USB 120VAC adapter.
At least 8 hours for first charge. Great Product.
Not sure but mine sucks. I ended up with a jambox, it rocks
yes
This item its operating voltage is AC12.5V to AC24V
Until they change color to a dark brown or black. It will depend on how much time you are using them. Some of mine have lasted a year, with approximately 200 uses. Others, not so much.
first call UPS And give them the tracking number UPS Number is 1 (800) 742-5877 (Consumer)
USB Power Charger Sync Data Transfer Cable for iPod Shuffle 3rd 4th
I think so man!
Plastic
This is just the case for a computer. It does not come with any parts other than necessary fans. In order for an HDMI port you would need to install a graphics card into your motherboard.
I'm not sure if people in the library will hear you, however the batteries lasted ( for me) 6 months using them regularly at least 3 times per week, 2-4 hours. The batteries are not rechargeable. As far as the comparison to the QC15, it depends on what you are looking for. The noise cancelation in the Bose is a little better, but the sound quality in the M4U2 is superior. Lows, mids, & highs are clear, base is accurate.
don't get. it's a waste of money.
About 5 hours.
I'd love to help... I don't remember its warranty, if it had one. It was refurbished. I had no problems at all with it. It's just what I needed for home and small bussiness.
Not that I know of.
yes
They are very good, but they are also very sensitive. My bulbs are already out. You could buy replacement bulbs through ephotoinc.com though.
I think mean color - (b) black , and (L) mean with lens!!!
Which lense hood is it. There are two Sigma 18-250 lenses. The older one takes 72mm filters
You can get adapters for pretty much any kind of lens you want. The EA mount will give you A mount but you lose the automatic features. EA2 mount is more expensive but gives you full automatic features and auto focus.
Check your battery if it's a BL-5 is will work.
UV-5R plus, yes. but keep in mind if you have a lot of traffic it will get hot and melt. DO NOT LEAVE UNATTENDED
Yes, it will. It has a wireless device (802.11b/g/n) to connect to your wireless internet or other wireless devices like a printer.
cause its cheap it sucks...
I bought my Mac in November and it worked fine for my unit. It stays on really well and was a great purchase for me.
Yes, I do believe this power strip would work well for you.
No it does not, and does not shine through, material too dark
Never tried! =)
That I don't know. I used it on the kindle fire. It is a great product and would highly recommend it for anyone, if it fits your device.
Yes it fits gen 1 kindle fire
The bundle of wires coming off the camera includes a green wire with a disconnect plug. Disconnecting the green wire puts it in backup mode by reversing the image and adding a distance scale.
Yes, but you have to enable it. The bundle of wires coming off the camera includes a green wire with a disconnect plug. Disconnecting it puts it in backup mode by reversing the image and adding a distance scale.
The camera is adjustable with 2 set screws. The camera I have does not have led lights but the back up lights you have on your car/truck should provide enough light to see what you are doing
It is not wireless. Don't know which models are. However, they guys at Car Toys recommended wired models as there is a lesser chance of interference and thus bad picture quality
Yes. Display is 7.5 inch by 5.5 inch and .5 inch deep.
Your cigarette lighter needs to work to power the display. Or u need to run power from the battery or perhaps the stereo. Good luck
in your car or your truck!
it is a frosty white, but the corners crack on it quickly, with barely any use. Adult Use Only, and it still broke
No
yes it is easier to use.
I could never get mine to turn on, I had it charging for 2 days & even tried to add music I could not.. I dnt know if I did some thing different r what so I dnt know how to turn it on
Can you tell me how I can check that?
Yes, it lights up when the laptop is on.
Yes. This computer has backlit keyboard.
These cables are not stiff, in my opinion they can be used for that purpose
This case will caryy the Surface Pro 3, keyboard, power supply and seveal other items. However, it only has a sholder strap and a carry handle like on a laptop case would be convient.
I'm not sure i understand the question. It holds our SurfacePro with the power-keyboard cover along with an ipad, books, chargers... It holds a surprising amount of stuff. Not sure about the binder since i don't know the dimensions.
I checked the web and there are a lot of padfolios so just take a regular notebook and check if it is the same size. How u can ask questions? Don't know where can I ask some question to somebody
The one that I bought was the vertical model. It has pen storage for two pens. The padded divider is not removable in the vertical model
No, definitely not waterproof.
I have successfully blocked these kinds of calls manually.
You can block 80 numbers or area codes with the Digitone Call Blocker. When blocking an entire area code, it will also allow you to "Invite" up to 10 different phone numbers within the blocked area code to still be able to call you.
Well the only way these head phones connect is through auxiliary, If in that case Im sure a ps4 has so most definitely.
Nope!
oh yes. I have one I put in my golf cart and it is perfect. Not too loud but just perfect to hear when you are around the cart but not where everyone else can hear.
yes it can.
sorry, Nexus was a gift to my grandson
Yes, it folds back
Of course ! There are openings in the case that provide for this . I truly appreciate the convenience , and the price was right, go for it !
Works great on three HDTVs with mixed aspect ratios on Windows Server 2012 R2.
be sure you do not power off before closing the cover. the device will go into sleep mode and is awakened by opening the cover.
No you cannot.
Yes. That is the model that I am using with it. Works great.
I just wanted a simple case but picked the Red color because my couches are black. Lol. I recommended this one. Snaps in the kindle PAPERWHITE so easy. Looks awesome. Turns kindle in off mode when you close it... Similar to closing a book. There are different cases for different models of the kindle ... So make sure you pick the correct one. Good luck
Around 10 watts. Very good bass very nice unit. I have 4
No,it won't...I really didn't like this case, and it isn't real leather.
Try doing a full format of the card. I have used this card on both Canon and Nikon, several models and never had an issue. Might want to contact Nikon if a full format of the card does not work. There is no firmware on the card that should need to be updated.
Nope - this is CompactFlash (CF), your camera uses Secure Digital (SD) memory. Types of memory your camera supports is either SD, SDHC (high capacity), or SDXC (extended capacity).
1-1/2" to 1-3/4". My Computer table is 1" thick composite board and with two 27" LED Monitors it is very stable.
Mostly certainly they do, the headphones are not patrial to specific OS (operating system) like windows
Works great with pc. I dont know about mac, but definitely a great product.
Yes it should it is a universal stand.
I have it mounted horizontally, can't remember if it could be turned vertically.
junk do not buy!!!!!!
The Boxee Box probably did. The Boxee Tv/Cloud DVR does not have a VPN.
Yes, the keyboard folds up nicely in the cover.
this item needs to be connected to an amplifier
Yes it will work easily. That is one thing about power supplies they are always pretty interchangeable.
nope wrong picture but it was a 90watt, and works great.
Olympus bodies have built in image stabilization, and so does this lens. That is not a problem, and in my opinion, the lens is better than the Olympus 40-150, if only because it is significantly smaller and lighter. Conclusion: Not a bad idea at all.
Not familiar with that model
It's why they call it a DSLR or interchangeable lens camera. You should buy a fixed lens camera like the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ60 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 24x Optical Zoom instead.
works fine with my d800
I would see if I can contact Meike for a replacement. If that isn't an option, just use the 72mm ring with a 77-72mm step down ring. (~$5).
I have not used it with that particular equipment, but it did work for me using some PTZ cameras in a dvr system.
hola, la caja pesa 31 libras y mide 54cm por 37 cm por 27 cm espero que te sirva la informacion
I haven't had mine quite a year yet, it's been about 9 months or so that I've had mine but they're just as great as when I took them out of the box.
Yes.. but this us a terrible case
I was surprised how well it worked, through the plastic. You do have to careful at certain angles to avoid distortion. I take it with me when using my kayak or canoe. Worth buying for this protection of my tablet.
In Razer Synapse 2.0 you adjust the bass, volume and the volume level.
Go to tv setting go to picture put it on vivid and go to advanced tv setting turn off ambient light sensor and back light control
I don't know about this one, but a buddy of mine had a DIN 1 system in his 99 four runner and it was awesome. this one takes up a lot of room I put in in my 99 dodge and had to cut to get it to fit
If the station has hd then yes
Yes, the card works perfectly in my Galaxy notes 3.
It is expandable up to 64GB with microSD.
There is not; but in my experience this mSD card never fail to me and almost one year of use on an S3. I gave one similar to a friend who is using a S4 and same situation without any problem.
Yes it is. It's in my S4 right now. It works great. I use it for Pictures, Movies, etc... It handles data transfers very quickly. I highly recommend.
Yes, it'll work.
Yes.
No, this will not fit in it.
Yes. It folds all the way back.
It is kind of soft and stretchy, while most other protectors seem to be a stiff film. It takes a LOT to scratch one compared to the other types.
It's wet application. It is only scratch-proof but not shatter-proof. My mini iPad's screen cracked when I dropped it accidentally at waist level height.
Hello Cesa, Thank you for your question. All my Shields are 100% genuine Zagg products. As for pricing, I am able to set any price I feel fitting. Feel free to contact me for any further questions. Thank you.
I haven't noticed any problems and I type on my iPad using this keyboard every day.
If you mean Mp3 files that are loaded onto a usb flashdrive, yes.
Only 3.5 mm jack, but you can buy a 3.5 mm to RCA adapter cord. Looks like a V or Y shape.
It should! I found, however, that if you use this on a SATA drive to make it IDE compatible, this drive will be made the MASTER - there is no selection. The other IDE device on the same port must NOT be set to MASTER.
I received the one shown in picture.
Yes, it should work fine. It also has a pretty low power supply requirement, so most will work with it.
In my box was a converter plug that made my VGA monitor fit the Graphics Card. This card worked well for me.
The card should work just fune with just about any pc. Amazingly enough it does not require additional power from the power supply and installs into a standadrd 16X pcie slot.
The 7750 does not require an additional power source if that
It means not for use in a business, company, corporate setting, etc. If you're writing a book on your home computer, you can use this program.
No it doesn't. You need a 6-pin PCI-E power connector.
I don't know, but, I'm going to try and exchange 2013 for 2010 outlook. This program is slow to load about 2 minutes, and the format is totally differant from earlier versions.
It's full featured. I have powerpivot, powerview and powerquery.
The key card is an online code that you put in on www.microsoft.com to download the product.
yes works with windows 8.1
a. No. You don't even install software on your PC. It's all done on VueZone's servers via an Internet connection. b. The system operates on the unregulated 2.4 GHz ISM band, which is the same segment used by Wi-Fi (802.11 b, g, n). It incorporates frequency-hopping technology (FHSS) to minimize interference with other devices.
Yes
I bought expensive batteries. Plus my first set ran down really quick because I forgot to always shut off the camera and left it running. So make sure you shut the camera off after you view it it's tricky to figure out... Once I got that my batteries have lasted a while.
Currently the service is $39.99 for up to 5 cameras, at one location for one year. It's great I highly recommend it.
yes there is
According to their web site: UXGA (1600 x 1200 pixels) at 1 fps This is only available through the Admin account; not Friend accounts. VGA (640 x 480 pixels) at 4 fps QVGA (320 x 240 pixels) at 8 fps
yes....it's a dual core bga.
yes it can run 64 bit os
Not on the back I/O, but there is a parallel header right next to the 24 pin atx power connector. You would need the cable and a way to mount the port on the back I/O plate or on the case. I use a similar board that Amazon carries that has a parallel port built in and it costs a little less...marginally: Gigabyte Desktop AMD A45 Chipset Mini ITX DDR3 1600 NA Motherboard GA-E350N WIN8
It does, it's based off the e350 CPU. It's a 6310.
Size 4 on mine. Her shoe size is a 6.
The body is divided in two parts at the hip bone level and the left leg can be removed from the pelvis. Both arms can be removed as well as the head.
I do sell realistic fiberglass mannequins in that size but not that short, here are a few of larger size female mannequins i sell: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ZZO08Y http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009XEBFDU http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009ZZKECU
My base did not work either so they sent me a new one after I sent them a pict of the stripped one-I lean mine up against a long table instead of using the base-I ended up taping the hands on with clear packing tape...not the highest quality mannequin...
Steve, if the bolt hole patterns of the monitor match the mount, it will work. The mount can accommodate between VESA patterns 50 to 200. This is approximately a 2" square bolt pattern up to 8" bolt pattern.
Don't know about the T series, but the 60D screen flips out and turns
Yes it does.
Not 15 seconds for me. Not sure on sleep time yet. Haven't left it on for that long but can say it isn't 15 seconds. That would be annoying
The click sounds occurs when the camera switches its infra red (IR) lights on or off, depending on environmental lighting.
You can set it up to take a motion activated snapshot and send it to your email.
You cannot upgrade memory her due to it is soldered into motherboard. Also, this particular model has a 128 gb SSD (very fast one), not HDD. Forums says you can upgrade it, but it has specific interface, so it is hard to find a compatible one.
Full model ID UX31A Notebook PC Not familiar with DH51 and the differences between the two
I own several Asus products, none of which has required any contact with them for warranty issues, so I can't speak to international applicability. This ultrabook does have a backlit keyboard which performs as expected. Overall, my wife and I are very pleased with this item and would gladly recommend it.
No screen protector... Bought an Armor shield for that... Case is no frills and has provided protection from an 8 year old abusing it since last year.
cat5 like...almost like an ethernet connection
PNY listed the minimum power supply as 400W. I upgrade to a 650w to be safe.You may want to consider the same.
It is the host box for additional TVs, good luck how ever cuz direct tv is charging me a "service fee" to us it which is the same if you rent the box from them...been doing battle for over 6 mo.
i dont know never tried it i winded up returning it
The sub woofer is NOT wireless but it come with a thin wire to connect to the back of the main speaker. Wire is about 6 foot long
There is only one battery! if you turn it off every time you are not use it - about 3-5 month. I have not replaced it yet from Dec, 2014. (but only really good batteries, I mean for photo cameras and something like that)
You would need RCA Female Plug to BNC male Jack Adapter (check to see if you need male or female adapter) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005B4O4GG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Almost positive it will burn out! dont do it
I know this is an old question, but it is good for helping others,so if you are in windows, and have a computer with the pink/green/blue plugs on the back, you do not need extra equipment. as there are options to configre your speakers to your speaker set-up.
The wire is short about 6' on the front speakers, and about 12' on the rear speakers, I have RC jack cables and female to female RC adapters connecting the cables together. That way I can make the wire as long as I want.
there are no holes in the casings for wall mounting, but like the old saying goes if theres a will theres a way!
Directly connected
of cause yes !
It's a camera. Nothing inappropriate about a camera.
No it does not.
no it will not ....sorry
I did receive all those items except for the mini optical mouse. Unless I have it and do not know what it is..that is also possible. Great condition though.
Yes, It comes with WiFI
It's the same one.
Put the batteries in first then it will work. :) Providing it is the correct replacement for your TV.
You take the SD card out of the cam and read it with a card reader on your computer.
Video is 720x480. Not quite 720p which is 1280x720. Here's the output of MediaInfo on one of my video files. Format : JPEG Codec ID : MJPG Width : 720 pixels Height : 480 pixels Display aspect ratio : 3:2 Frame rate : 30.000 fps Standard : NTSC Color space : YUV Compression mode : Lossy

According to the manufacturer data, it has an input of 12 amps max with a 15 amp circuit breaker
Typically UPS systems need to be connected to utility power to charge the batteries, and run on Tripp Lite external batteries when the power goes out and additional runtime is needed. We will need additional information in order to determine if the solar panel will work, please reach out to our Presales Applications Team at 773-869-1773 or presaleshelp@tripplite.com .
Yes.
you can receive SSB with the appropiate software, but the device starts working at around 28Mhz ( more or less ) up to 1.7Ghz. If you refer to HF SSB then you will also have to buy an upper converter ( I belive nooelec sells those as well ). The kit comes with an antenna that works mostly on 400-800Mhz.
Yes
I am sorry, I don't know.
This cord works with my laptop and laptop speakers. If your X1 cable box IR Receiver has that type of plug/jack, it will work for you. It is very high quality.
No, it does not. You would need to add an Express PCI WiFi card or use a USB WiFi adapter.
It is NVidia NVS 5200M.
16 gb
Win7 is what I got.
Mine doesn't, but that doesn't mean that you can't get it for yours.
64 bit
It has USB port, Ethernet connector, VGA monitor connector, USB 2.0 port 3 & 4, DisplayPort connector, ad power adapter connector, integrated cable lock slot, Optional port, ac power adapter cable loop, and WiFi card module antenna slot.
Yes, you can upgrade this unit to 32GB RAM
It comes with 500GB HDD 7200RPM
Yes, get it with Windows 7 installed. This is a standard computer, not a touch screen tablet. There seems to be little or more likely NO advantage to running Windows 8 on such a computer. But getting the Window2s 8 in stall disk gives you the capability to change in the future if you want to. I am sticking With Windows 7. Works well on this Lenovo model.
One year parts and labor (system battery: one year)
You need to download the (free) software from http://arduino.cc/en/main/software.
Yes
I'm not sure why they have it depicted in that sense. All you need to play music is to have the unit in a cigarette lighter and one cable which goes from the unit to your music playing device.
I have the same iPod, it does fit. However, the transmitter I got didn't work. Bought a similar one at Dollar General for $10 and it works perfectly.
They both have same adapters, you can use it
there's a small port on 1 end of the unit. There is also a charge indicator light inside the unit which can be seen through the smoke colored lit. On the and next to the charge in port, there is a button to enable charge into the headset. This way you can charge the headset or just use the case for storage. It's a fantastic device! I hope this helps.
I am not sure. I also wanted to try this, but I was not able to find any extra headsets for this base other than the combo found here on amazon
Both, it has recharable batteries and it sits on a charger when not in use.
yes there is a head phone jack in back, along with a couple hdmi's and a usb.
it comes with a soft tip stylus. the screen is glass and quite responsive, and works well with any stylus. I prefer operating without, as some apps do not function well with them. And yes, it supports a keyboard as well as other usb devices like a mouse, ethernet(LAN) card. etc.
Yes if you download the Facebook app.
Yes
Yes you can tilt the screen.. This is best protection.. Please go ahead and buy
Hi, for this Sony LCD protector PCK-LM15, it is compatible with Sony Cybershot RX100, RX1, HX50V, and RX10, RX100M2 and M3. As for PCK-LM14 is compatible with A99V and A77II. -Ely
Yes, this camera can detect motion and transfer images to WERMS at werms.com. Some find the camera setup screens challenging, so WERMS developed a simplified setup screen to insert the proper values into the camera. This camera's motion and image transfer (recording) work in this way. When motion is detected, the camera will send the defined number of images per second until motion is not detected anymore. If motion persists, image transfers will continue. Please visit werms.com to learn more about this and other cameras, as well as details about the WERMS service.
The interior is a lighter shade due to the difference of the material.
light purple
Yes,the hanwell is louder and has a better sound to it
I am not sure I have it on a I pad mini
Yes, the new speck I got has two holes.
Yes, you just slip in your SATA drive and plug the drive adaptor into your DVD rom bay of your laptop. Please make sure it fits your model of laptop, as I found out the hard way that the sellers do not have all the models aligned well and while this model fit in one of my larger 8530W mobile workstations with no issue, it did not fit in my ultralight laptops with a more curved or rounded edge where the DVD rom is located. It looks like it would fit, but did not.
Look no further than the ASUS Dock. Purchased it for my daughter and it works great.
It's called getting ripped off
Connect your 3.5 jack lead from the dock to your speaker system. You then have to go into the settings of the N7.. I.e settings / Device, Sound / Dock Audio check box (For music and media) and voila music will come from your speaker system. NB this tutorial is for N7 running 4.4 kitkat. It also works below 4.4 but the settings may be slightly different. Hope this helps ;)
Yes - 8x Tray Load (Dual Layer DVD+R)
2010 starter edition
Have you tried powering it up while connected to AC power supply? Did any lights blink at all? Also, sometimes the power button needs to be pressed in a specific way to really make it work.
There's no dvd tray, but you can use an external drive. There are two USB ports: a standard port on the keyboard dock and a mini port on the tablet itself. Bluetooth: I don't think so. I don't use it , but I haven't seen anything about it.
Both ports are on the dock. This item uses docking station to charge (recharging) both tablet & dock. Together they (batteries) produce up to hours batteries life!!!
Full HD resolution, excellent. I've watched a few TV series at home. In fact, I had planned buying a desktop screen for my office, and I haven't had to for work. Sound is good, too.
its visible in day light
It only fit from 1999 to 2003
I do not have this device
I'm not sure what the mm lens is, but the angle covers a lot of real estate. We have four corners on our house and we put two cameras facing opposite directions on each corner and it covers our entire property and some of our neighbors. We have about 300 feet of coverage all around and the resolution is excellent.
You would definitely have to step it down. I simply wouldn't buy it because of the poor quality
no for the full size ipad 3
I have it hooked up to my Sony audio/video/component tuner. It plays CDs beautifully.
Unfortunately no.
Yes, you can enjoy listening to all the functions without headphones. After purchasing our unit on amazon.com we found the same unit for much less at Walmart. Enjoy!
I would contact their technical support directly to know for sure.
I have not experienced an problems with the magnetic catch or case. In fact, If I am not mistaken, thet magnetic part of the catch is located on the bottom of the case - beneath and away from the keyboard. Thus, I could not see how the magnet would impact the screen area. WIth that said, the catch does require attention to properly secure the case. Othewwise, I have not experienced any problems thus far.
I would say not for long-term use. If you wanted to plug it in outside while you were there then yes but not for the direct sun or weather /rain
Yes
You should be fine putting it over its just a hard piece of plastic that goes over it
Yes it come with Optical mouse and USB keyboard in the package
I am using it with Samsung ATIV Book 9 Plus NP940X3G, and it works great.
I do not know, something better to ask both manufacturers.
Shipped via Amazon if purchased from Green Choice Computers
Yes Apple logo isnt on the case but laptop logo will appear through the case
If you were to eat French fries, sure.. But no, it doesn't look like it's covered with smudges or anything, and you can just wipe it off with some dish soap.
I have a 2015 13" MacBook Pro, and with the Kuzy case attached it fits comfortably into the 13" bag/sleeve I bought for it. Assuming you are buying a sleeve for the purpose of protecting your computer from falls, damage, etc., you would want a snug fit rather than a loose fit, as the whole point is to provide secure (snug) padding for your computer.
The first picture is what my case looks like with the little tabs covering the back corners. Not sure why they're missing in the other photos
I have the same issue. I don't think you can get them.
that is a personal choice. I bought the black cover and am very happy with it.
I don't use camera cases so I don't know. But I can tell you the grip. Is a wonderful help
The OM-DE M10 has a slightly different shape and the grip would not fit or benefit the M10 model. The M10 has a slightly larger grip and may not need the grip.
I wouldn't know or be the person to ask...mabye contact JB Design
If you receive the illegit item, you can request a full refund from Amazon.
Make sure you got the right attachment piece. It shouldn't leak. The unit comes with 4 different connectors. Make sure it is tightly screwed on before snapping on the Pur.
The clip itself is sturdy, but easily pulls out of the rubber part of the case that surrounds the body of the iPod.
No slow motion. Only frame by frame 2x 4x 8x and 16 x
Yes, I'm currently using it on an Asus Maximus VI Impact motherboard that's 1150.
Yes it can be used outdoors but it must be protected from rain and snow such as on a covered porch. I have one high up on a covered porch so not water hits it through this cold winter in PA and so far no problems. If not protected from water it cannot be used outdoors.
No the iPad is too enclosed for a keypad. I would recommended a keyboard folio.
very nice came quite early love it alot
What number?
It should work based upon you have wifi router and video monte ring service. Alarm.com equipment is made to be used as a universal add on for all newer systems. Follow the instructions you should be fine.
No it does not!
No. It did not fit mine.
Nope. No case.
Just purchased one a few months back. It comes with the remote, a battery, the charging stand, the user manual, an RF Blaster and 2 wired blasters.
I haven't tried, but it seems unlikely -- I've had mine for almost 6 months, and the original stylus is still very snug and secure after a lot of bumping around in my bag. Also, the loop is reinforced with a row of zigzag stitching around the middle, so that stretching might cause the thread to tear the leather a bit.
This has an AUX plug in the front of the Jukebox, so you can plug an mp3 player into it with Auxiliary plug, no USB connection that I can recall tho. (At least mine does, anyway...I would think they are the same) Hope this helps!
The drive may not be formatted or formatted with the right file system, you can check that in disk management or the drive could be bad but most likely needs correct format. I just tested mine with my Windows 8 laptop and it works fine.
Hey. In my case, it was a bit cheaper to buy the key card. Whatever you decide, you're gonna be good.
You can use this on mac but it's the online client only
I ordered one with a cable from Amazon. Cost about $8 and the cable a few more. Works great.
No but this screen protector is good i recommend for the price.
I am sure it must be. Actually I use Firewire so the question does not arise.
I do not have the kindle but my iPad mini is 5 1/4 inches by 7 3/4 inches. I also have the ipad in a case that folds for usage. It all fits in the case with room to spare. Hope that helps.
Great shape shipped it to Denmark for my grandson to play video games on he is thrilled with it!
Yes it has been fixed at least in the one I bought. No whine or any noise for that matter, sometimes I wonder if the fan even works. This is truly the best power supply I have ever owned and it is extremely efficient. I noticed a 32Watt drop in power usage after in installing it. Migrated from a PC-Power & Cooling PS measured by Kill-A-Watt.
Yes it will. Actually the 2011 sockets have back plates built into the board so they even work better on these boards vs the 1155/1150 sockets.
Hi there,I am sorry to say that,but this gadget is buzzing on everything you pointed at. I bought it and I regret that because this is a piece of junk. If you like it good luck with it,otherwise wasted money.
I am typing this while it sits on my lap. Do it all the time! You can turn the IPAD to sit in the channel the other way, but it was not really meant to do this. It stays up as long as I'm careful. The horizontal way is the best, no problem ever this way. In answer to your "c" question, I don't know. Sorry. Hope this helps!
Junk! Didn't work for me. I was going to use it on my Bly-Ray player, but it just didn't work. Shop around for a better one.
Yes, it has a flap you pull back and twist out of the way. Every once in awhile I haven't gotten it all the way out of the way so it has blocked the camera a tiny bit. All in all I have been happy with it. There is some slight bubbles on the screen when u put on the front shield. It's hard to avoid. I researched a lot and this was one of only two that fully covered the devices.
I personally have not tried, but I do not see why not. Bluetooth is a wireless signal, this case or any case should not have an affect bluetooth capabilities.
Yes. It's way thick enough to be extremely protective but not to bulky that it feels awkward in the hand. I've been using it for months and it's a great product
It's 4 pin, and it will work with 3 pin. You just won't have PWM speed control. You'll have to adjust speed in the BIOS or with another application. Consider buying a board with 4 pins if that is an option, as 3 pin boards are usually of cheaper quality.
The A6-5200 specifications indicate that 25 watts is the maximum amount of heat it will generate running a word processor or spreadsheet program. I have a NH-L9A cooling an A6-5400K (65 watt CPU) without a problem. It is important to note that I also have intake and exhaust fans running in my case and I am not overclocking the CPU.
Yes and it is plastic.
The only difference is the price, just go with the cheapest, since it's the same RAM.
Check your correct part number at the kingston website by choosing your brand, model laptop
As soon as you plug the router in it will start sending out a signal that you can connect to you on your computer. But unless you configure the router to repeat an Internet wifi signal already there or plug a network cable into it from your modem it won't have any Internet to connect to. I would suggest watching the YouTube video by searching crystal view router on youtube. I found it very helpful in setting up my crystal view router as a wifi repeater. Good luck!
If you have microUSB it will. But not durable. After 6-8 months not working anymore.
Hi MW, The cable is 24AWG. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@mediabridgeproducts.com
Yes it is charge only.
Yes
Yes, it works in other countries, I'm from Venezuela
It will skype, but the picture quality is very very poor.
Use the phone on the same ear where you have the earbud. The microphone picks up your voice as well as the voice on the phone. I write for a newspaper and often record phone interviews while taking notes, either longhand or with a keyboard. Note: Many states require that you notify the person on the other end that you're recording the conversation. One more thing: Be sure to insert the plug into the "Mic" port of your recorder. If you put it in the "ear" port, only your side of the conversation will record.
I purchased this item and am very happy with it. The glare is not an issue for me. I do not have or need non-glare film, but its touch is sensitive, and I believe the film would work fine. It has best clarity of any of my 7-8 monitors.
19.2 x 28.7 x 7.5 inches
I would say yes. But, if you are doing intense outdoor backpacking, probably not. When you first see it, it wont look that big but it expands and flattens nicely. I've gotten caught in the rain a couple of times and my electronical devices were fine. Hope this helps.
Yes, you can repeat and also shuffle the tracks. This is a great CD Player with great speaker quality. Diane
Yes, I received camera with water resistant lens.
I think so!
Yes it will but you won't have any sound so u should get one of those PlayStation wireless headsets but it works just no sound
It wouldn't do anything to connect the two.
No, because the cable made for the computer do not fit the typical computer. If it fit your computer you will. I wasn't able to use this cord because it didn't fit my computer. My intentions was to connect the avi to projector and then connect hdmi cord to ps3.
We can only ship within the US
It works just the same as an iPod. If you have bluetooth access to your stereo system or have an auxilury input, you are set. I use my iPad to play audiobooks since the iPad is so much bigger and I can get to the pause button without too much distraction.
They actually run on the same operating system, just the mini is smaller. I would reccomend the larger one. It's easier to read!
One front camera and one rear camera !
Yes. I use a Bellingham with mine.
I'm sorry. I have no idea.
Yes
No it is only on touch screen
I have this ipad without any carrier. I just have wifi. It depends if you purchased the ipad with a carrier. did you buy this ipad with only wifi, or is it wifi and Data? You can use the ipad with no carrier if it's just wifi. If it's with data you have to pick the carrier with whom you have a contract
not sure we dont use this software. Not sure how large the file is.
AT&T, Verizon BOTH OK,I AM AT&T
Well mine still says 'welcome back __(person's ID)____' and it's totally not me. I'm guessing void, not not certain. Go to a dealer if you want certainty.
IT has to do with the picture quality, the colors are brilliant and sharp, the depth of the photo is almost 3d.Being able to enlarge any photo and still have a perfect clear picture is amazing.Apple got this right again..
I don't know
The model comes with the iPad locator built in (i.e. You can track/find your iPad with another device, such as an iPhone.) Google Maps is a good free app that basically acts like a GPS. In order to use it in your car with your iPad, you will need to make sure to either get an iPad with ATT/Verizon activation (can use data) or turn your own smartphone into a wifi hotspot for the iPad if it is wifi only to use Google Maps.
You have to swipe the screen to get to your home screen. For security purposes you should add a password as well.
yes. the at and t version is compatible with most international mobile and Internet providers. I bought mine to use out of the country. and my husband has one that he has used for years with an international mobile network. the service is not locked in. there is no unlocking to do. just change the sim and it will recalibrate on its own. good luck.
Newest resolution screen
Yes it does
Yes
Dear Customer, Thank you for your question regarding our DVI to DVI cable. Yes, The cable is HDCP compliant. Please contact us at service@bluerigger.com if you have any additional questions. Thanks, BlueRigger LLC service@bluerigger.com
Yes
From the specs: "Supports hot plugging of DVI devices and resolutions up to 1080p.Allows high speed digital transmission up to 4.95 Gbps"
Apple products all seem to be universal. The only thing you need is a plug adapter for the various types of outlets. When I've traveled Europe all I needed for my American MacBook, iPhone, and iPad was the plug adapters.
Yes there is a app for farmville on the iPad
No, best I can do is ship it to a freight forward or cargo company and from there they ship it to you.
No. It has an input for a coaxe cable, and an out put for an ethernet cable.
When I tried it, the device did not want to connect with my Comcast connection. I was told you need to call and have someone come and allow your modem to connect with Comcast. Sounds like a hassle so I never got around to it yet.
Yes, you can use it with any camer, because this strobe use a external optic fiber to your housing.
yes it is
ok 2 points .... first i cant answer your question as i bought teh machine for my son at school. but I can tell you that one of the selling points wa that this laptop had an SSD and traditional HD. so not sure why you feel the need to replace onboard HD with another SSD. but i would imagine its pretty simple to do so
No problems with the smart cover at all. The magnets work fine with this carbon covering.
It does for me
The adapter will not charge through the HDMI connection alone. However, it has an additional lighting port (next to the HDMI port) where you can connect your standard lightning-to-USB charging cable, and then the device will charge while displaying video through the HDMI port.
Hero 3 Black Edition with WiFi is only used to control the Hero 3 with their app or the remote it comes with. The WiFi on the Hero 3 Black is not used to export files to your WiFi network. The only way to transfer data is via USB hub.
How do I sign up to be notified when the GoPro Hero3 black will be available?
It has a fairly good resistance. It is very smooth movement, meaning that yes, with a solid bump you could slightly boost the volume. However, considering the compact nature of it, this should not be a real problem.
15-20 in house; perhaps 25 outside.
If your Galaxy has Bluetooth, it should work. The only part that has to fit is the plug on the device that it is the speaker. That has to be the original iPod/iPhone connector.
If it is disconnecting on its own in the middle of use, I think there is a problem with the device but if you are turning it off and then reconnecting later, yes, I need to reconnect using my iPhone bluetooth settings.
You may need to plug and unplug the device to your Bose speaker everytime you use it, hope it helps
Yes! Either on an iPad or iPhone, works perfectly well for displaying videos, photos, websites, etc!
Over 1000
yes. you can take a 6 hour "potty break" and pick up where you left off.
It is made in Japan
NOOOOO! You would be lucky to have it focus in time to capture the action. I originally bought this camera to take action photos of my sons's high school football games. I could not have been more disappointed. I returned this camera.
I don't have the 2014, but the keyboard didn't work well with my earlier version...a year or more ago. I returned it, and also got rid of the Galaxy Note. Sorry that I can't be more helpful. Keith
How about just using a permanent ink marker to write those letters?
I think the tsi is newer but when I called they said the sound difference is negligible and my stereo is legit and sounds aweaone. Call polk audio they will give you ab honest answer
It should.
I don't know if it is an OEM part, but I do know it is working just fine in my application.
I bought one of each. to go from standard to micro is on size then standard or micro to nano. they give you a holder so you can cut down a micro to nano. I hope that helps.
I believe that's correct.
It's a "sheet of plastic". It does not stick to the screen. Honestly, it's far from the best screen protector out there. However, with a little bit of skill you can remove it from the case and put your own screen protector (the kind that sticks to the screen) on there to use instead.
You can attach the top to the back of the iPad so it does not just go all over the place in the car and gets lost or broken
No it does not interfere. So far it has functioned flawlessly even after 3 drops and 2 children. This is really a good case, well worth every penny!
Yes, the power buttons are easy to push but the volume buttons I find difficult to use.
Sorry, these speakers only have screwed hold down studs. But outstanding speakers for the price. I highly recommend them.
yes the screen protector worked well on it as long as you have it centered correctly...its a perfect fit in between the case and screen leaving near nothing of the screen exposed, so when putting on the screen protector make sure its centered as best you can
The 75T is a much bigger louder speaker overall. The TSi-300 can handle 150watt RMS where the 75T can handle 275watt RMS, and can be bi-amped. I would say if you have a smaller receiver/amp and room go with the TSi-300's. If you have a big room and high-wattage receiver then go big and get the 75T's. In all honesty you cannot go wrong with either of these Polk speakers.
I connected my Polks in to Onkyo 80watts per channel ( RMS) high current amplifier .works great ..I have JBL Floor standing speakers as well .but really like my Polks
the scan button is on the left of the mouse, where the person's thumb is.
The best way to determine the proper battery is to compare to the existing battery in the pc.
As far as I know, yes. My fathers computer is 8.1 and it worked fine. No issues at all.
There is only 2. It's just another view of the 90 degree end.
It has a mini usb port for charging and you can connect that cord to a computer for transferring items onto the tablet, but it doesnt have a full size usb port.
Not sure about the G7's, but these are essentially PCIe WiFi half-cards made by companies like Realtek for HP, Dell, etc. As long as you have the correct driver, it should be compatible with any current (within 3-4 years) laptop with that specific type slot inside. The generic drivers usually load from Win's Update, but the specific for each part # is on HP's support site as well.
Check the plug in back. If it is the same mating end it will work.
Yes it's working
I love this case! very protective and functional. Maybe it's hard to see from the pictures but the iPad is sitting in a cosy plastic frame that covers corners and side except for where the ports are, then you have the leather folio layer. Beautiful
The image is only magnified; there is no distortion.
120cm
The sooner the better =)
Not as it stands, you would need to add a decent graphics card for gaming and a more powerful PSU but it has upgradability for this with a PCI express 2.0 port on the motherboard
You know a better way for an artist to run graphics-intensive programs with high-end processors, dedicated graphics memory, boatloads of RAM, all at an affordable price?
Yes it does, all wiring as well. Just no monitor.
Great product...Even Dropped my IPOD a few times no damage...
yes it does &#128521;
This machine is garbage. If I was smarter I should have known the 32g was not even close enough to run simple applications. Get as much g as you can
11 inches by 7 inches (tablet size) keyboard same size
Yes
Mine arrived black, darker than shown in picture
I don't know I would suggest clicking on item and seeing what options come up or contact seller
I am not sure. You can check the apple site to see if the dimensions for the Ipad mini with Retina have the same dimensions as the Ipad mini, if they do then yes it will fit it.
It will. I recently built my friends new computer with this case and it even has room for a decent sized cpu cooler and it allows for plenty of wiring management.
I called Griffin. They sent one to me in the mail for free
No it will not.best bet is to do like it did and get Chromecast from walmart or best buy for $35 it's wireless and easy the install. Cable matters is junk but you can do what you want. Good luck.
I'm sorry I can't answer that. I don't have a note 3 to test it with.
I am not sure but advise you if you choose to buy this product to make sure they sent you the right one. I ordered 2 of these, neither of these worked with my galaxy s4, as it clearly advertised it did. when I did go back and look at the packaging, I saw that they sent me cables that were only compatible with a S 3. good luck.
Yea looks like it just different company also its from china so it might take awhile to get to you.
Yes it was
This picture is misleading. I found out through research that you have to buy the Skeleton Case (open on each side) in order to connect it to the microphone port.
http://goo.gl/ZI1qZ
Yes
As far as I know,yes it's for the Surface. The connection for the keyboard is magnetic and it will only attach to the opening of a surface tablet, not an ipad.
3rd Party; but well made & very functional
Yes Sydney it gets as dirty as any white thing. The good news is, it's so easy to clean and no danger of spilling anything inside the keys. No gaps. I hope this helps with your decision.
I have a Macbook too is 2012. I would recommend that u get the external drive from the apple store because one month ago I bought an external usb in Amazon and sometimes I have a problem with some movies.
Windows server 2012 essentials does not use CALs. It has a 25 user limit, meaning you can have 25 user accounts in active directory. Keep in mind this version of server hits the ground running as primary domain controller and must be the primary dc for the domain. Also does NOT support hyper-v like server standard does.
I'm not familiar with the Verizon product you referenced. I use mine on a tablet that only has micro USB ports, but no Ethernet port. That table recognizes that I have plugged in Ethernet into the USB port and responds accordingly.
Yes
According to the manual there is a random play mode with mp3. I have never used it myself.
Yes
An OWN.
Yes.
The threaded metal part mounted to the case MUST rotate to secure it to the camera. If it doesn't , the case is defective. Force it. You have nothing to lose. Good luck.
Yes, you will be able to access all information stored on your iPod hard drive. I have purchased this item to use for accessing the hard drive after my iPod broke, installation was simple and it has been working fine since.
I do not know, but the best buy guys will
The 510 appears to be a bit smaller in all dimensions so it seems quite feasible that it will fit. What I don't know about is if the tripod hole would match up since it attaches to the case there and since the 510 is smaller I doubt it would fit in the base. So my answer, after debating with myself is "no". The camera housings are different dimensions.
No you must purchase the entire case. It is a great case.
My came with a usb cable only
Sata power connectors? Yes.
Yes. NEMA-15
Yes it is
I did not do a lot of tests but the best I got was 175 mbps over AC and in the 225 mbps range for the N. To be fair, the router (also Asus) is about 30 feet from where the adaptor was located and the signal had to pass through 4 drywalls in a single family home. Overall, I decided that it was easier to convert my existing phone lines (ran over cat 5e cables) to network and lose the phone vs. having to deal with the wireless.
The base is magnetic. This product is cheaper at newegg.com $98.99 w/free shipping.
That is what happened to mine. I tried reconnecting, removing the connection, renewing it and nothing works. Bottom line is that the product does not work as advertised. I recommend that you return it.
It fits my wrist perfectly and I am a smaller female. I would say that it would fit a kid that is 10 or older.
Even with a Nikon coolpix it does not completely keep it afloat, it does slow it way down.
This will not fit on a Rebel.
No, not really, be easier to carry in your pocket.
It will still provide good protection for the camera. You could use the empty space to carry your lens cloth. The front piece can be removed while shooting. The case has to be removed for downloading pics and battery changes but it's just the twist of a dial.
I am not familiar with microserver. Sorry I do not know the answer to this question.
I don't have a case on my nano, so I'm not sure. I do have this same arm band for my iPhone 5c and I have a slim plastic case on it and it fits.
Why are these 5 people even answering the question when they haven't used a Mefoto? Useless!! Doh!
No, this comes with a ball head which, in my opinion, is not very good for video, but you can change the head if you like to a pan/tilt for video.
I think crying is the best solution ;_;
Have different issue now..... My back space now goes forward and deletes the character to the right
Sorry no, Lakemaster (which was purchased by Hummingbird a year or so ago) only makes map chips for Hummingbird GPS / fishfinders now.
I am not familiar with the deerbrook tablet, I have the Nexus 10 and it fits fine. Very sorry that I can not be of any help with your question. Perhaps if I had a photo of your tablet I could help more.
Yeah, I believe that's part of the design. The mac mini can slide in face up or down so the mac mini itself would be installed right-side up. I currently have mine installed on a wall with the mac mini pointing down and it seems fine. The lock sits off to the side so if you had the mac installed either way the lock shouldn't get in the way of anything and yet still keep it from coming out.
You hit the button on top that had a phone symbol .I hope that helps
No. You should behave an xperienced technician perform the work.
You can use the old one
Yes, you have the option on your TV to "turn off " the speakers....you can also mute the tv...or you can mute the sound bar....I do both in "fiddling" with them to see what the best sound is for what I am watching...I watched Burlesque last night with some great music and singing....I can't imagine a better sound....I am tending to use both tv speakers and soundbar... 4 is better than 2 kind of thinking...
Yes, Google is your friend...... http://www.amazon.com/SB4021M-A1-SB4021M-B1-Soundbar-Remote-Control/dp/B00GK7NLJO
No it does not have blue tooth
Hi Dale, Hummm.... I don't know what to say. Ours does go up to 10. That's where we usually run it too. I really sounds great. The sub woofer does need it's own power outlet however but is wireless from the bar. Can I suggest unplugging everything and reconnecting it. Be sure the battery in the remote is strong. We did have to replace it nearly right away because it had become too weak. The new one took care of the problem right away. I hope this helps Dale. It is a good machine here.
It is not a speaker and therefore, it will not work as a speaker alone. Its a radio and it also plays micro sd cards.
My projector only shows 1080i or 720p. I don't see any artifacts in my picture, which looks wonderful.
No.. Won't work.
No this cable is not meant for that function. It's meant for phones with OTG capability. The male micro plugs into your phone for data transfer; the larger female USB interfaces to devices that a normal PC interfaces to like keyboards, drives etc; the female micro accepts POWER for those devices IF required. No data transfer via that path. But look - for $10 or so you could always buy one and see what happens I guess. But I'd bet my hat it won't work. Regards, Steve
I have this case from my old iPad mini, and just tried snapping it on to my new Retina model. It fits...sort of. The top corner nearest to the headphone jack just barely fits, and comes off to the slightest amount of pressure applied. So, in short, it will do in a pinch, but I think Amazon will need to make a new one for the ever-so-slightly thicker iPad mini with Retina Display.
It's a hard material like plastic
Yes, it fits perfectly.
I don't know I have and iPad mini 1. Try chewing the dimensions of your pad to the dimensions listed in the explain atom.
I could not get either to work but I do have a Bluetooth with USB bluetooth dongle and it worked well. My standard USB controller worked much better. As well as my USB keyboard vs the Blue tooth one. But my dongle is version 2.1v
Yes the tablet has a memory card reader (you can confirm this on the description of the tablet). You can put the memory card from your dslr into the tablet.
Yes
I purchased the Kensington KeyFolio Pro 2 Universal Removable Keyboard, Case and Stand for 10-Inch Tablets, Black (K39519US) for $54.67 from Amazon when I bought my tablet in June 2013 Sold by Amazon.com LLC
yes it does
Yes. It has both a built-in Web Cam, built in speakers and a built in microphone.
This unit only has HDMI out - not even SPDIF or optical. Regardless of what cable accessories are available at Radio Shack or anywhere else, you absolutely cannot connect it to anything but an HDMI TV or A/V receiver. Even a DVI/HDMI cable would be useless because you would have no audio. Sorry to say but as time goes on, you will find it very difficult to purchase components for older TVs anywhere except from second hand shops or garage sales.
No it freezes when you watch Netflix. Samsung is aware of the issue but cannot fix it.
Well I ordered the Blu-Ray from here but it didn't come with a remote..... I'm looking for one as well.
Yews there is. You must be patient when applying the screen protector so you can place the opening of the film over the opening of the Microphone and web front camera.
No stylus holder. But this case is real nice.
Had the same problem with one. Send it back and get a replacement.
Wish it were that I knew. It is just the numberd keys. Would not be so bad but, that is where the "@" key is. It literally broke 32 days after purchase. The product is a great idea. Unfortunately it is junk!
Just the sides. Once I got this, I discovered that it is a very simple, cheap piece of plastic, and not worth the money I paid for it.
The photo on this listing is correct. Monoprice Micro USB OTG Adapter (109724). Should only be a photo of the short cable and possibly both ends.
no
We provide free technical support (phone number is provided when you receive your order, we cannot disclose it here because it's against Amazon policy); please contact our technical support for personal assistance.
I don't think that it has the port for external mic.
You have to have a yearly subscription
No This does not have a Wireless access point attached to this device Hard wire only
6 hours active 8-10 intermittent. and parked it lasts a couple days of course it works longer when new than an aged one.. but it solved our problem well..
There's actually an unreleased beta firmware that will let the Nexus 4 work with it. You will have to email them to get it though.
Refresh rate is 60. Max. Resolution 1920 1080 @ 60 Hz
Picture screen size and the presence or absence of a TV tuner are probably the big differences. I have a DM2752D-PN which has a 27-inch screen and is a TV/monitor. My DM2343P-BN has a 23-inch screen and is only a monitor. I am not familiar with a D2443P-BN (assuming you listed the correct model number), but it probably has a 24-inch screen. I like both of my monitors for 3D uses.
No, it is a thin plastic film.
Yes they can. There is a small plug that you have to uncover but they still easily fit with the case on.
Yes it will.
There is some "blurriness" around the edges. I do not find it objectionable.
It should be 67mm. but I am not 100% sure.
Don't waste your money, I have two and can gladly send them to you; that way you can see how useless these are for yourself. The positive comments are deceptive, must likely posted by the manufacturer and salesmen who got stuck with these.
I couldn't get a 90 angle only 50 with a clearance from the wall of 0. Also it say that it max is 460mm, however it only extended to the end of the rail for 400mm total extension. Make sure your preset tv mount hole are no more than 400mm ( 16").
It works with my Yamaha receiver. If it uses ir signals for remote control this product should work.
This IS a blue tooth antenna... I did not have Bluetooth until I plugged this in and the drivers were finished on their installation... the micro plug there just sticks out maybe a quarter of an inch from your USB slot and it does not use any other antenna...
I do not why it says that but don't worry it is a 500GB hard drive. I have one myself.
Yes
It ships with two plastic inserts for the MacBook Pro or MacBook Air. Unfortunately it won't fit a Dell unless the laptop is as thin as the Apple laptops.
Yes, it will fit. I have a 15 inch MacBook Pro and it fits with the case and some room to spare. I REALLY like this product!
Yes, the colors are interchangeable. There is a backlight button next to space bar.
That's correct. It attaches just like the Apple magnetic cover. You detach it and move the ipad into the groove, to use the keyboard. Closed it looks very professional.
Yes comes with
Hi Matt, unfortunately I have not been able to use the converter because it is not compatible with my system.
Yes, it works beautifully. Slides and glides with your finger or the stylus.
Command+shift+4 works just fine, to give you the crosshair screenshot mode on your mac. I use it all the time as well.
It is indeed Mac only
Hi Laura. I just sold my Kinesis Freestyle 2 keyboard on eBay last month because of my unhappiness with the key action. Yes, it is a long throw and quite unsatisfying. It isn't tactile at all and I expect more from Kinesis than this. To specifically answer your question, there is no way that I'm aware of to shorten the keystroke. I wish there was!
Yes it takes 5-7days to arrive in USA EU AU .Best
yes it came with original packaging. I had to replace and shure replaced them
I can't remember, but there is nothing about it that isn't obvious.
Don't think so. Tablet would be way too slow though, can barely run one extra.
7 pro
As long as you have a USB port available to plug in the mouse. I have mine on my Dell desktop computer and I'm running Windows 7.
Although a fun animal print, this IPad Mini case has only 1 function and that is to protect the mini. No extra slots for anything. Also arrives with a funky chemical smell that takes weeks to air out before you can use it.
Not sure I have the model: gt-n8013 But it Works on mine
There is a hole for the front facing camera but none for the back.
no
I only use the four it came with....I don.t know about 12!
Can you please elaborate on how it's not fitting? Is it just not getting mounted to the cage? Is there a way that you can send pictures, so we can further assist you?
No
Yes, this is really an iPhone function. If you are listening to music, the turn by turn directions will be heard in place of the music, and then the music will return. The radio must listening to Bluetooth for this to work. I have the TomTom app, and it works great.
Yes. You can use your iPod or iPhone to select/control the music; OR you can do it through the radio; OR with the included remote.
Yes That is the same enclosure I have
Yes it has aux plug and a USB plug that can be installed coming out of your glove box
Yes, I recently bought this and it come with everything you need for Bluetooth calls and mic is included.
If it accepts double din then yes. You may need a faceplate kit which doesn't come with the stereo. You can also check fitting guides on crutchfield.com
Yes it does come with three sets. Front Rear Sub All of them are. 4v Pioneer actualy list it as a 6 channel.
It must be 1ohm stable I have mine on a boss riot r3400d its 3400 watts youll need some pretty descent power to drive 2 of them
I have it in a subthump box under back seat in a 2013 silverado crew if that helps. I had to remove the plastic cover from the back of the subwoofer.
The best thing to do is to build one yourself but depending on what vehicle the woofer is going into you can find it on amazon.com
It's only $100 just buy it and you don't have to worry about compatability
Yes if it is 52mm diameter
Yes - fits mine perfectly.
52mm
We got skammed does not fit or screw on
yes it will
It should work, But I can't guarantee it... (Apple has their own way of doing things....) Whatever that might be...
Yes there should be no problem with a DELL laptop - it's a USB device and should work under any Windows-based PC (Windows XP or newer).
Answer from Titantech: Please send us a picture of your dashboard. Our engineer will confirm it for you.
I really don't know. I bought one and it doesn't work. I would find another device. Save your money.
It appears that it does not. I Don't have any such PSUs at hand where I am right now, but from looking at photos of "The Sticker" on the web it doesn't appear to have the UL mark on it and also, it is not listed on UL's site. The only Corsair AX supply on their list is the 1200W version; See this UL list at the following link - http://tinyurl.com/qa6f4f2 .
Yes.
I don't have a picture to show you, but my husband has that color phone. This case completely covers the blue. In short, you will now have a white phone.
You might try using apps, like Google Drive to access your media, music ect. There are many apps that make it easy to access the content on your personal server or PC. Some off the top of my head would be PLEX, Twonky, StreamToMe and of course XBMC.
It comes in its brand new original boxed packaging that you would see in the store.
Can't respond concerning that specific device, but the specs do say "Padded Laptop Sleeve Secure Padded Compartment Accommodates most 17" Laptops."
Sounds like defective unit ,I had no trouble with mine once set.
This machine has 4GB Ram
I see only reburbished offers in the site, so I suggest to contact each dealer. The one I bought was new, and had no docking station.
yes I am doing it now plug into usb and mic port and bam, careful with the wires very thin and cheap, speaker is awesome
here is a link to Crutchfield. Take a look and see. Hope this helps. http://www.crutchfield.com/g_400/All-Car-Speakers.html#?avf=Y&nvpair=FFBrand%7CPioneer
The Pioneers TS-A6975R would do it with an amp of 300 watts RMS, because if you use something higher you could blow the speakers. The Kenwood Excelon X500-1 would do the job or something within that size.
If it's a 6.5 or 6.75 it should. You may have a 6x9.
Not sure about air - I have an iPad mini and it fits fine - I would check on the size of the iPads
I would say No. I love it, easy to clean and protects your ipad.
Instead of an amp I would change your current radio to any modern pioneer. It will provide more than enough juice to these speakers. Cheaper than an amp, easier too, and you get the features of a new radio.
Mazda? I have no idea. Trust the guys who sell speakers. They know. My recommendation? Buy QUALITY. The speakers I installed in my F150 were infinitely better than OEM. Good luck.
i just got mine in today, idk why it says set of 15 but mine came with one box (2 speakers)
The depth of the speaker is on the description so measure your blazer. If the blazer is a 6-1/2 speaker I'm sure it will fit.
Will I can't answer that question but I have found the best way to find out is to go to Crutchfield.com and research your car there and it will tell you which speaker fits front and rear and then come back to Amazon.com and buy it
Remember they are 4 way coaxial speakers, they are going to sound very clear and clean but they don't tend to deliver a lot of bass. It also depends on which door or deck of the car you installed them. My opinion, they are good brand and for the price and the quality of the sound that they deliver it's worth it. If you want a little more bass you can add a subwoofer and amplifier for deeper bass delivery.
Yes it is priced for a pair.
Sold as a pair
I'm afraid that these speakers may not fit.in your 2004 Aerio Sx, being this car is made for regular 6.5 speakers , however you could make adaptions but I personally wouldn't do that, good luck.
Yes they are 4 ohm.
Yes
Yes it comes with a lanyard.
Clean adjust and lubricated
This unit plugs directly into the wall but it does have a jack that allows you to plug your phone into it as well. Kind of like a fax machine.
Yes, I have used this is on my Mac computer and it worked using the HDMI port. If you have the remote control, it may or may not work, I ended up using the PC to change the slide. I have not tried it on my iPhone or iPad.
Not sure, you may need a USB (to your camera) to VGA adaptor (to the projector) converter
Unfortunately the Smart Cover does not fit on with this clear hard cover for iPad mini
yes fits perfectly
No you need DOCSIS 3.0 Cable Modem. This is a DSL modem. You could plug it into a cable modem and use it as a router only as it has a LAN/WAN port.
The smartphone app they use is called EagleSense, so you can look for it in iTunes. I don't know about MAC, but their tech support is actually pretty good. You can call to ask them at: Rosewill Support Service Call Center Hours: 1-800-575-9885 8AM - 5PM (PST) Monday - Friday
You might need a computer for initial configuration, but once configured there is no reason to have camera this webcam connected to PC. It is wifi ready.
This is the "Ti" model. There is a newer model called the 650 TI boost. It costs a bit more though. This card still has plenty of power.
Yes it will. Just download the latest software from the Microsoft website.
Sure. Just plug them into the headphone jack.
No, but you can pause and play with the mic button.
Yes.
They should be. I have not washed these, partly because my nine year old daughter steals them for an unknown purpose, but with similar items in the past, I just tossed them in the washer with a small load of clothing.
Rachel, hello there and Merry Christmas. No, this particular product is specifically made for the RETINA MBPros. There are iPearl cases designed for non-retinas. You definitely have to look at your model number; the cases are specified in that matter. What year did you purchase your MBPro? It could be model number A1278 or A1425, DO NOT TAKE MY WORD FOR IT! Check for yourself and contact iPearl to avoid purchasing the wrong size etc.
Yes, there are 4 non-slip, round plastic pads. There are also 2 flip-out feet to angle the computer.
Hello, Yes, the alarm system once triggered, will sound for the determined amount of time you personally chose (00-30 Minutes). Then it will shut off, and reset. Meaning the alarm system is armed again, awaiting the next break-in attempt. Thanks. www.FortressSecurityStore.com
The light strobes until the alarm is disabled by key fob or cell phone.
I believe the system has a chime function that can be enabled even when not "armed". I have it off as I have this system in my shop. The Einstein system for my house has the chime set on and works perfect as well.
Yes. The window must be opened before the system is armed and it will ignore that sensor.
In some places I just use one sensor/magnet combo in vent position...allowing window to remain open a few inches. If window is fully closed, alarm will sound if window is pushed up such that the sensor and magnet pass each other. Alternately, you can use two magnets for instant alarming in either position.
Yes the panel makes beeping when there is an intrusion either from door/window contac t or from sensor.
Im not sure I understand the technicality of your question, but its a SSD hard drive.
Programing the scanner to specific frequencies is very easy. If you're not into reading manuals, you can go to YouTube, which is what I did, and watch a little kid show you how it's done.
I used these for heavy lifting sessions and they stay in place for me just fine. They stay in while deadlifting, squats, box jumps etc... I'm not a runner but I think they will be fine.
As far as I know these disks are for dvd burners to be played on computer or dvd player. Hope this helps.
I have used these to burn/copy several of my VHS tapes to DVD; most of the tapes did have music included on the tape. I mostly Burn/copy pictures from my PC to DVD; pictures that I have uploaded from my camera. I have also successfully burned Music from albums that I purchased on Amazon which were downloaded to my PC to DVD, so to answer your question, you can rip/burn music to them but you cannot rewrite over them once they have been used, they are not rewriteable (like DVD-RWs). Hope that helps.
&#304;f you have sd card reader you can open records easily. But you can see your records with hzz usb cable.
Yes I did from cigar lighter. It's so easy and no problem.
No, but the front facing USB ports are not guaranteed to work if you don't.
yes it does I love you too load the program with a SD card if you go on their website you will see detailed instructions
I have no idea about your specific computer but do know that you should not attempt this installation without the new SSD being at least as big as the one you are removing.
AJ, it's a matter of horsepower. If you want the ability to drive speakers with clean, pure signal, it's practical physics...you need a lot of box for the components. In this case, the manufacturers can concentrate their connectivity and brains in one box and pure power in the other.
KLipsh RF-82 or a less expensive RF-7
It will easily support the the refresh rate on your TV, if your TV supports HDMI interface. You will need at least 9Mbps sustained on your WiFi to support a 1080p High Def streaming image. Your ISP may become your bottleneck, pending their actual speed delivered to you. (1.5Mb, 3.0Mb, 5.0Mb, 10Mb, 15Mb, etc)
Yes the back is a separate piece. Only see gray on edges.
It should if it listed as a phone that fits-the carrier does not matter!
Yes, absolutely. It's meant to not fall out. I simply stick my (fat) finger to the opening & use my nail to lightly pull it out. Great buy though, we'll worth it(just don't plan on removing the case too often)
Yes, it has a webcam; however, we had some kind of issue with it not working, but we were able to fix it with some kind of file thing. You might not have that problem, though. You can take pictures or use the video camera.
This mount works for the remote provided by GoPro with the Hero 3+. I use it on my motorcycle. The only problem is that when the remote is installed in this mount you cannot plug it into a power source to recharge. You have to remove it from the mount to recharge it.
No. You have to use your Tablet charging cable for each device separately.
its just a keyboard, I know that it sit by gravity and connection clips.
Yes
Nope! It has a base stand, but no bolt holes or other mounting structures in the back. It has a Kensington lock slot for security, but that is all.
The body and lenses are genuine Canon. The camera body is made in Japan and both lenses are made in Taiwan, so take that for what it is...I think those at both standard manufacturing locations for their products. Hope this answers your question.
Mine works great with the PS3 on COD games. Lots of hours of experience, no TV troubles, big and bad in all the right ways.
No. Part of the issue would be new models have faster and better hardware to support new software features. They prob could do it but typically most manufacturers don't.
No it won't.
The dongle converts Apple lightning to HDMI. VGA connection is only for video signal and carries no sound. HDMI however, carries both. This adapter will support audio and video from your Apple device to another A/V source.
No, it won't. You have to find a convert kit with 9006 bulbs, like that http://www.amazon.com/Xenon-Ballast-Lampen-9006-HB4-55W-6000K/dp/B008MU2PJ4/ref=sr_1_5?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1379456965&sr=1-5&keywords=HID+Kit+9006+6000K+Xenon+HID+Light
Its a pair. 1 for the left and 1 for the right side. Its the set
Yes
If you are asking if it works with BF4, the answer is yes. Running this with a quad core CPU and 8GB DDR3 memory. You can play with high settings on.
If it is a good PSU like a Corsair, Seasonic or an Antec you will likely be fine. With a cheap PSU it will likely shut down your computer periodically at best and instantaneously at worst.
ELECTRICALLY
Yes, the Audio Fox Wireless TV Speaker is compatible with all TVs. You will plug the transmitter into the applicable audio out port on the back of your TV. All TVs are different so fortunately the Audio Fox comes with analog RCA cables, a digital coax audio cable and a digital optical cable to be compatible with any TV.
No, it doesn't have a strap but is very easy to carry with one hand like it was a book. The material it is made of allows a firm grip.
You don't have to use the case with the keyboard. You can just use the keyboard with the tablet.
It's just a surface rt tablet mine is at least
Yes it will. That's what I use.
I purchased the black case, and I love it. Unfortunately, I cannot help.
I don't know, but it does fit the Surface RT well.
on mine, they are. I have the original Surface RT.
Works fine on my original mini. It violently snaps ship. Hope this helps
The cover is held magnetically when it is closed on the screen. However, if you peel it back from the screen it flaps free even if you pull it all the way behind. This is a really beautiful and sturdy case.
Yes. Also, the files are "filename.wav", if you don't have an audio player that will open .wav files, download VLC.
No
Thanks for your question. ARCAM is the manufacturer it is assembled in Asia. This is a fantastic sounding amp. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud ARCAM dealer.
Mine does===
The Aune T1 has RCA line out but the volume knob does not affect the volume to the line out
It does not. It has USB and line level inputs. I use it with USB and I like it very much.
It should work just fine. 3.0 is backwards compatible.
What's your question
The Little Dot is a Class A amplifier, not a DAC. It only accepts analog inputs and outputs. It is a headphone amp. It should be able to be used in conjunction with your laptop to power your headphones.
It is only necessary to add a DAC if you have a very demanding headphone (mine were: AKG K701 and HiFiMan HE-400) and if your PC soundboard has interference from spinnng harddrives (in my case Thinkpad X230 it was) audible in a silent environment I recommend the SMSL Sanskrit DAC. Very affordable and great sound.
Yes!!! The NO answers are incorrect. A record player signal needs to be adjusted for the RIAA curve that is applied to the Vinyl when it is made. You will need a Phono preamp before this amp, otherwise the music will sound horrible
I'm pretty sure it's referring to the power supply as it says "Green LED on Power supply..." Yeah?
Yeah you can pretty much use with anything which has an HDMI output.
2-4gb ram
You can use any brand that supports the 55" TV, it will depends on what you want, I mean if you want a fix wall mounted tv you can use the "Cheetah Mounts APTMM2B Flush Tilt (1.3" Profile) TV Wall Mount Bracket for 32-65 inch LED and/or if you want another model with an extension arm to move your TV, you can use the "Cheetah Mounts ALAMLB Articulating Arm (20" Extension) TV Wall Mount Bracket for 23-55 inch LCD, LED".
It connects with an optical cable. Any TV or AV receiver with an optical output can use the soundbar.
No, it does not have a VGA input.
I wouldn't buy this TV if it got up and cooked me dinner. The picture is horrible and is missing "features" they claim it has (True Motion). Don't buy this TV!!!!!
I have tried it on my Macbook. The main gestures work: left click, right click, scroll up and down, three finger slide for page forward or backward. Right now, I am using it on my computer at work. This computer has windows 7. There a lot of gestures work, too. Best part is, you don't have to install a special driver. It works right out of the box an an Apple computer as well as on a Windows 7 PC.
Yes, but not all of the gestures are supported.
I bought this touchpad for my windows 8 computer and had many difficulties with it because of the gestures settings.I would suggest returning this keypad and buying a more generic keypad. I wish I could be of more help.
Yes it does. Easy 1.2.3. connect. I have had this unit 8 months now and its great! The 3D is awesome and i like the cinema 3d/Passive, glasses used in theaters not the electric. The sound bar quality is great. If they are still offering free shipping, jump on this..This is the only place i found this still for sale new.
Yes - only certain programming is 3D. You can choose whether or not to view those channels.
Sorry I couldn't say. I would trust the cpu compatibilty list but if you don't, you might email the manufacturer or something like that.
I haven't had this problem. I've been using mine for awhile, and all clamps cinch down nice and tight. The only ones that I've found need extra tight cinching, are the two handles as there's more leverage at work there. I actually was suspect that it would work as well as it does as the price was way below rigs from Red Rock Micro and Zacuto. But I've been pleasantly surprised. Something sounds wrong with yours and you may consider exchanging it.
I don't think you could use it directly, but you could use it as a storage drive for your kindle and then use your computer to transfer files.
Yes, the iPad mini "snaps" into the case. It's a VERY secure/snug fit. But, you can take it out whenever you want. It does take a little effort, because of the nice tight fit.
Yes, we have ours connected to a 12 volt motorcycle battery and installed on an ATV.
red and blue
I don't believe so.
No. I could not find a sim-card slot anywhere on the unit. There are phone-in and phone-out jacks for a regular telephone cord, but this unit does not have wireless cellular backup as advertised. Very disappointing.
Thanks for your interests. If you just want it for alarm purpose, you do not need to connect it to a phone line or internet. When you want it to call, you need to connect it to a phone line.Hope the information helps you a lot.
D80 is nikon's dx camera with cropped sensor. This tamron lens works well with this camera.
Yes. It will work perfectly on the d7100. I bought this lens a few months ago and have been impressed with the build quality, pro features, and optical clarity of this lens. The only thing to be aware of is that it will have the full-frame equivalent zoom range of 105-300mm because of the cropped sensor on that camera.
Yes, EF lenses will work on both crop sensor cameras (your T3i) and full frame cameras.
The Canon version of this lens should work perfectly fine with the 7D mark ii
I don't know, but this jump drive is extremely durable. I assume it will work great/not vibrate. This is by far the best jump drive I have ever owned. I always have issues with my jump drives breaking/cracking, but not this one.
If you can use EF lenses, this is interchangeable
I don't own a Sony...great lens!
Yes it has Bluetooth.
There is no dust cover on my thumb drive. I have also never had a problem with dust? I do think that the lack of moving parts for "closing" these drives make it more resistant to dust/water. By removing that mechanism the device is rarely exposed when not in use. I your plan is to expose this to direct water or dirt, consider another option. I'm a Navy Submarine Sailor and routine expose drives to both, and this one has proved durable. Hope that helps.
2.0......and a little bit wider than most jump drives which has interfered in one tight space computer I a have to use. It also seems slower than my other jump drives.
Yes, it will work, although since the T3i is a crop sensor camera, it will photograph at 56mm rather than a true 35mm.
if you're considering the faucet looking piece of the housing, it extents 7 inches from the back of the plate. The back of the plate which is what I would consider the housing is 7 inches top to bottom, 5 inches in width and the depth of the base is 1/2 inch. Hope this helps...
Female bnc coaxial
1600 X 900 on mine.
Yes
Hello, The best resolution available is 1920 X 1080: Thinkpad W530
Yes
No it does not
Yeah
Yes, it is compatible with the 2012 Nissan Altima
No, just the basics; Note One and Word. Actually this computer was my wife's purchase, and she regrets buying it now. It is much too sensitive to touch, and the keyboard is very hard to get connected to the tablet, and keeps coming loose. Would look for something else.
Yes
Confirmed, this works for stereo input to your GoPro.
This go pro adapters it the legit adapter but on sale. It works on the gopro hero 3, 3+,and 4. And it is compatible with all the editions aswell, white edition , silver and black edition. I highly recommend getting the adapter so you can get better audio when motovloging/ other production things
No.
It's separate from the TV volume, at least with my Sharp Aquos. I was able to add the soundbar on to my Logitech Harmony 880 remote.
Haha. It can be a little tough... Remove the outter rubber cover.. Take a butter knife or screw driver and youll see two random spaces while looking at the sides.... Put the screw drive in and twist at it begin to come aprt about halfway.. You have to be a little more creative and use a similar technique getting the second half opened. Best of luck
It was tough and with no directions! Remove the silicone cover.The inside black piece separates from the back black piece (see if you can see the seam and pry it apart from there) and then the iPod sandwiches in between.
No, there is not one included.
Yes
I am a musician and use these for recording... Understand that when you are transmitting via Bluetooth, you give up some quality... When plugged in though they are VERY good on the top and bottom end.
You can use it for microphone and headphone without an adapter for a MacBook Pro with Retina Display (and I suspect, for other Mac laptops as well).
YES , CAN YOU BUY IT , THANKS....................
I ended up having to call and see if remote would work on mine. It did work just fine! Great price too!
No, never tried more than one device on mine. However, the reason I bought mine is because I had a chance to connect to one at an airport. There were four of us on it, and we were all happy. We did not mesure the current draw, but we were satisfied with the way the device was working.
No, batteries!
yes, use the vesa mount (included in the package) as your wall mounting template.
It will be picked up by your Internet automatically....anything you want secure you need to create acct with LaCie and then store your "secure" files in that folder it creates which is password protected.
Hello Amazonian, Yes this adapter works with Linux. I attached a link to the driver below http://www.mediabridgeproducts.com/store/pc/FAQ-Wireless-Networking-d7.htm Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@mediabridgeproducts.com
Yes. It has a red pointer laser light. Yes, it works with MS Office 2013. So long as you are using a bluetooth enabled device.
The Bluetooth Smart Pointer will work with Spotify, on compatible smartphones and tablets. Please email support@satechi.com for further assistance. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
It does hold the iPad. However, if you have a large case on the iPad (I.e. Lifeproof), it won't.
No, too big, get the x grip phablet holder
I use mine for the new iPad and it works well. I do not have the dimensions of the mini, but I can tell you that unless it is close to 8 1/2 inches the mount will not put enough pressure to hold it in place.
unfortunately no, but still a good graphic tablet
The unit is installed inside the circuit breaker box. You need to have at least 2 spaces available in your breaker box for this to fit.
Don't have any experience w that case, Mark, but again, remember that the stand comes with a variety of foam bumper pads. As I wrote previously, I had to mix-and-match the various thicknesses in order to get the right combination for my particular case. You will most likely need to do the same thing. Hopefully someone who has one of these cases can provide you with a more definitive answer. Cheers!
The cables plug into the laptop itself (this is just a stand and not a true "docking station"), so it depends on how you orient the laptop on your desk. I have mine behind my monitors parallel to the monitors, so the cables are on the left and right.
Yes, the LED uses a molex connector and is not connected to the reservoir.
the description probably applies to all models.
I have no idea
Yes - that's the battery life. 4 lights = 100% ; 3, 75% etc. 1 light is 25% indicating charge when have time. U can still use it w no problem while it's charging. Also there's a printable instruction manual on the jlab website that's only a couple pgs long if u have questions._
I would guess it is. I use it every day on my golf cart with my iPhone via Bluetooth.
The physical difference is the the connector. On SATA drives the data connector is separated from power connector, while on SAS it's one big connector. Also to note, SAS receivers (cables, cages, docks, etc) are backwards compatible with SATA drives, but note other way around (you can't use SAS drive with SATA-only devices)
The sound is ok. Nothing special. What you get is a very good monitor at a great price.
Nope, not this one. Works great with my 4s but the connector changed with iPhone 5.
Android devices have the capability of reading ebooks. Many public libraries also offer free ebook services and walk you step-by-step through this process.
just type 7" tablet case. they are reasonable
Yes i had an app on mine that let me do it
Tap on home page, there's a icon at the to right hand side. Select that then it will take you to all other apps then look for camera and select it your camera will pop up.
this dock broke --- connection would not work === after only 2 months! does not provide a usb port only a charge connection.
Yes. Is perfet.
If you are connecting the usb cable to a computer or 12 volt plug, it will only charge when the tablet is powered off.
I'm not certain, but it should be. Works great on a Neewer brand cheapo manual flash.
Yes, it should fit that camera as well as it fits the nx1000. They are basically the same devices.
no use, the forms are different and this is importane!
No, it does not. This was one of my main complaints about this keyboard.
Yes, I'm using it on my Samsung Galaxy S III. Seems fine to me. I like the USB adapter.
Yes that's right. It will function just like a flash drive.
Yes
nope&#12290;
sorry, it was a gift, i don't know.
yes is correct
yes
If your flash has a hotshoe it will work. It won't send TTL information, but that doesn't bother me as I shoot so much in manual anyway and like to be in control of my exposure.
I have the canon T3I. We used this rail with a follow focus and a matte box. It works with the 18-55mm lens, but not quite long enough for the 55-250mm lens. The follow focus I glued an O-Ring to the follow focus gear, to friction drive the lens directly (without a gear on the lens). It also increased gear diameter to be able to flip the follow focus gearbox closer to the camera and therefore leave room for the matte box.
yes, it comes with a flash
No. The gsm and wifi goes through Alarmnet total connect and requires service through an authorized dealer like us. Our service is $8 alarm monitoring, $8 gsm service and total connect is $4. Total monthly $20.00. No sales tax or hidden fees.
Yes and No. If your Internet wifi goes down what will you use for backup? 4G card is a great backup in case internet is down or disabled by thief. I have both and it helps me sleep at night.
They are 4" long
Yes it does; although, the port is a mini hdmi port. You would just have to get a new cord
Very Easy. Just make sure your screen is clean and dust free before you put on the protector.
It fits on a mini but it leaves bubbles on the screen after installing - I don't use it.
This particular item will work if the device has a 7 inch or more screen. If you're talking about the galaxy note phones then no it won't fit. The next size down will fit even with the case.
Yes
In my experience with this seller not all the controls they sell are motion even if they announce them Like that amazon gave my money back
I don't know but it's a good idea
It sounds similar to my case...I have been told that you have to use the drill into the concrete and use the anchors included. I decided to have someone do it for me
I don't see why not. It holds my 60 inch plasma and that thing weighs a ton. You have to anchor it pretty deep into the studs in the wall. This mount is really heavy duty.
No... You should never mount into mortar as it can eventually crumble and your TV can fall.
The opening on the mounting plate is 4" high so will not accommodate a standard 5"wall plate unless it (the wall plate) is mounted horizontally.
I have a 60" mounted but cannot get a 90 degree tilt because the arms are too short to turn that far without wall interference. I had wanted to do the same. The mount is strong but extension arms could be longer.
Yes.
Answer from Titantech&#65306;It supports buletooth connection. So there is no problem with your wireless Headphones. It supports Headrest and overhead viewers.
Answer from Titantech: It works with bose speaker system. The screen 800x480.
I think it would. As long as it's the model with the super drive in it, everything else should be the same.
no they are very hard, but smooth
The VGA adapter does work with the original MS Surface. Make sure that you have a separate VGA cable to connect it to your display device.
It is from Microsoft, not generic.
Yes, mine does and I have Sirrus running in mine. We have gotten very use to it and other than a little slower the OEM boot-up, it works well and we are pleased.
I have no clue... it fits my 2013 wrangler
this unit seems very good i havent used it alot but it does have the US map installed. it is pretty accurate. i will check later about canada. i do not know about lifetime updates. also it does pick up a signal pretty well.
This GPS system is a bit more challenging then the Garmin. It's voice activated and the map direction are large which make it easy to follow. If I had choose, I would prefer the Garmin. " less challenging"
No, the drives utilize the same connector.
Same happened to me.. it is pos unit.. waste of money
S.Payne is correct. The "Special Input" is called a pre-amp to boost the very low signal from the turntable's cartridge up to something the receiver can use. I have the "TCC TC-750 BLACK Audiophile Phono Preamp, Pre-amp (Preamplifier)" and I am very happy with it, however there are other, more cost effective pre-amps available on Amazon depending on the audio quality you are looking for.
Yes. You can use a set of speakers on only "A", only "B", or both A&B at the same time. Works very well.
This receiver doesn't have wireless capabilities but, it does have a USB port on the front panel and I know that there are headphones that are wireless with a USB adapter. So, that could be an option for you. I am very happy with the receiver
Car antifreeze already has built in antimicrobial properties. If your using this in a PC. Assuming your not doing sub ambient cooling and not mixing aluminum and copper, straight distilled water is better. Glycol can leave deposits and gunk. Plus it will stain your lines. I have even heard of it breaking down acetl top blocks.
Yes, it will work with the iPad 2/3/4 and mini.
Don't see why not? Sticks to my motorcycle fairings. Imagine I would stick to any smooth surface. It's stout!
Hello, it doesn't work, one conection in the down side of the notebook is different. Regards.
Yes it is
Yes it worked fine
It will work for any DSLR or mirror less camera.
So it kinda collapses on itself. Once it's flat, twist opposite corners and it should fold up into itself. Hope that makes sense.
Yes it will that is what I am using it for&gt;
Yes, unless you glue the holder in the location you want the clipper will fall and not hold its position.. I glued mine and it works ok now.
Yes, they made the squares on the back the same size as the regular Nabi. It's just less of them.
Eventually Yes, there will be letters sold in individual packaging =0)
I don't know if these will work on a Mac. I suggest you try looking for specific Mac screws Try here "
Yes they will. Although I had to set the speeds in the Bios, which I've had to do for other high speed ram modules.
I think you should check if the battery you have is a J1KND. My DELL model was not specified in the list but it is the same battery and it works perfectly well.
Mine came with a regular USB to micro USB cable that you can plug into a computer or something like your iPhone AC adapter to charge the keyboard.
Yep it should - the plastic is quite hard so should do the trick.
It will automatically come on if it's in a powered down state and u plug it in to charge. You just have to power it back down. It does charge in a sleep state as well. I haven't really payed attention to how long a full charge takes because I charge it at night, but I can tell u the battery last up to 6 hrs. I'll look into that the next time I fully discharge the battery
Yes this cover will work for your ipad mini 1st Gen.
Yes
It didn't work at all on my tab 2 7
7~14days, if you buy more than 15, we will use dhl send to you, 3 ~6 days you will get it, thanks
there is a small cord that is included with this Mic
I can't find your question, but I like the Sony portable disk player a lot. I have litterly hundreds of cd's. I don't know how to download all the cd's, but I don't need to. I use the cd player when I work out at the gym. I usually carry it in a vest or light jacket pocket and all goes well when I exercise. No skipping or other problems.
No.
it works find
Yes
I have the Ipad2 and it fits perfect. Thanks!
When the order arrived there was a stylus with the case; however, there was no screen protector. I ordered a "Tech Armor" screen protector. I have ordered many different Tech Armor screen protector's and have always been happy with the product. Here are the screen protectors for the iPad 4. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008CC1AM0
I have I-pad 4, is does not hold it securely. Not happy at all.
I can't be positive because I don't have a gen 1 iPad but I do NOT think it will work because of the difference in the power port on the bottom.
Yes, there is a slider along the bottom you can tap on to skip through a file.
I don't know. But in my experience, you should use the one that comes with it.
Yes
I have a H P . And the battery has a hump on the back and I needed a flat battery.
I have two of these on XPS 8700 computers and they have been great. I don't think they have anti-glare coating and if you have some bright sunlight from windows you will get reflections. Do not notice any problems with desk lightning.
that's right . the s2340l has an edge
2 pounds
I don't know about needing more or different ones. I have an older TV so I just used the cables that were sent with it. Sorry, I couldn't be more help.
i don't put yet the camera in my car.i hope it's will work properly to my car.....
It will read zero as long as third wire has power to it.
No. The meter must be powered by a voltage between 4.5 - 30 VDC. It will happily measure the 52 VDC source, but you will need either a voltage regulator or a separate power source (like a battery pack) to power the meter. If you use a battery pack to power it, you will need to connect the (-) terminal of the battery to the (-) connection of the voltage source you are measuring so that they will have a common ground.
Not what sure what you are asking about. This is a basic lightweight laptop that does not support Windows. It is good for E-mails, web searching and web purchases There are many games on it but I have only tried a few. It has been crashing on me a lot lately and I have had to reset it. I bought it a year or so ago with and purchased an extended warranty which I may use before it expires in Dec. rather than trying to fix it or have it sent back to be fixed.
The device itself is, but I wouldn't think the software would run under Win-8.
1.6V running @ 2133mhz [XMP], 1.5V running @ 1600mhz [XMP], and 1.5V running @ 1333mhz [JEDEC] ... For more information check the product PDF from Kingston here: http://www.kingston.com/datasheets/KHX21C11T3K2_16X.pdf
The predator memory can be overclocked to a higher frequency 2666 as opposed to the beast which claims 2400. Benefit would be for an imdividual that wants to overclock their computer
My DDR3 memory is currently using 1.512-volts running at 1333MHz. I commonly buy faster memory and run it slower for more reliability. This also lets me switch the faster memory to an updated memory board at a later time. Happy computing, Superticker2
Yes it is but you have to go into the bios once installed in order to get the correct frequency out of it
Yes, but it is just to keep curious people out. It is not a strong lock, mainly to keep the case from accidently opening. The case is not real heavy duty, but works for the light weight stuff I put in it. The price is good for what you get!
The inside height of the case is 5" without foam. If you use the foam, it fills, the top part about 1" and the pick-foam for the lower half is about 3" deep. I store 2 large flash-guns and 4 smaller ones, plus flash accessories for photography in mine. Not sure what you want to store in this case, but keep in mind, this isn't the most durable case out there. It's for light-duty only, which is why I stressed "storage" for my old photography gear. Hope this helps.
There is foam inside. It's pre-cut into squares... just pull out the squares you don't need to make the spaces.
I am not familiar with your exact laptop, however this memory is Desktop (240 pin) Form Factor, you will likely need something designed for laptops which are typically 204 pin memory slots.
Yes. I have them on mine.
New Jersey
You can't. Any external or internal lock will be subject to inspection. What I do is keep a detailed inventory of its contents and ask to be witness to inspection.
I don't believe so. Thus is an "ever ready" style case that is designed to give the camera more protection. You might check with the manufacturer to see if they have an accessory that matches to carry a spare battery and SD card. I have seen attachments that fit on the strap. I hope this helps.
Absolutely yes. Of course you have to open the case but you do not have to detach the front part at all. I do it frequently.
The power supply for this speaker is really weak. I purchased the speaker for the first time and returned it since it did not work (I suspect because of the power supply). When I purchased it for the second time it did not work as well however instead of returning I replaced power supply with universal power adapter and it started working after that.
Hi Dianne! This unit s formatted for Mac OS 10.5 or later operating systems and requires reformatting for Windows operating system. Compatibility may vary depending on your hardware configuration and operating system. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to use this unit with my Mac OS 10.8.5 operating system and sent it back after talking with the WD tech people. I ended up buying a G-Technology G-DRIVE for more money. Works really well. Costs twice as much, but is compatible with both Mac and Windows systems. Check out Amazon for the best prices! Hope this helps!!
Yes, but... As it comes, the drive is pre formatted as a single HFS+J partition for compatibility with Mac OSX operating systems. To use the drive with Windows operating systems you must: 1) Reformat the drive to a single NTFS partition; 2) restore the WD SmartWare software and disk image. For me that sounds complicated. You have to go to http://support.wdc.com and refer to Knowledge Base Answer ID 3865 for information about reformatting a Mac drive.
It is Ocosmo company. See this link: http://televisions.reviewed.com/content/ocosmo-ce3201-h3le3-review
yes you can
pretty sure it is back-lit
Yes.
It does not...It's got everything except Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
here in the states it's 120 volts.
It has a one year warranty.
Yes, I use them for my android all the time
No
The coby remote works fine, just as well as the one that came with my TV. did the only thing is after having my new coby remote a short time my Son surprised me with a new tv.
Yes I have the replacement remote by by redi.......the volume controls work fine. I am very happy with it.
Yes, just get a pre-amp with a digital connector, pretty simply for any aux connections.
yes this charger should work with other batteries. the charger has an auto shut off when battery is charged.
No, Sorry (Ps I have the 42" TV not the 55)
Yes, they are individually packaged & then in on larger clear bag
I don't bother with warranties, generally. They are more hassel than benefit. Olympus lenses are well made. In over 30 years of using numerous film and digital Olympus lenses, I have never had a bad lens. I've owned the 17 mm f1.8, for over a year, and it works flawlessly.
No adaptor necessary. It will also fit any Panasonic m43 line or any other camera that is labeled a micro 4/3 mount including the black magic m43 body. The M43 mount system is universal regardless of brand.
It should! I use the wire on a 2014 Mac Pro with a Asus 4k monitor running at. 60 herz
I think not. These are 84mm filters designed to be compatible with the Cokin P-series holder. The Z series filters are 100mm (4") on their narrowest side.
The kit contains everything you need as long as the filter mount on your lens matches one of the adapters provided.
No
Yes, I used them this morning with the iPhone 6 earbuds.
They are 16.5" x 5" x .5" thick!
Yes
Hi - quiet key, so quiet that I can be typing while talking on a headset phone and the other person will not know. It's a Mac computer keyboard (not for PC) and will work with anything on the Mac, including Windows that newer Macs can run.
It has a built in ir an it works great the light that comes as an accessory is just normal white light though
Yes, it has a standard USB port - you'll need your USB to Thunderbolt cable that came with your iPhone 5.
It has a weather channel. You can tune into it, and put the radio on stand by. Once a warning or sever alert is played back, the radio will turn on and play back the message. The battery gets empty very quickly like this, so make sure you have an alternative source of energy (like put it next to the window where the solar panel can provide power, or plug in the ac adaptor).
You should be fine with your outside options. We mounted our screen onto a wood frame (like a picture frame) and then hung it from the ceiling. Hope this helps!
The work the same just a newer size is all
no
Standard spade terminal dimensions.
It comes with the android os on it.
I can't say from experience but I would say yes because the ipod touch has Bluetooth.
Yes. If the Macbook has Bluetooth or just use the auxiliary cable
The radio will fit your 2013 Mazda 3, if you have Bose system in your car, you'll need an adapter interface to connect a new stereo and retain steering wheel audio controls, entertainment system, safety warning chimes, and factory amp
Yes it does,but specifically the Motion XPS shows up,don't know about any other apps..
Yes it will
You can contact Customer Service team of Kocaso at 866-777-0079. The best solution if to have them perform a firmware installation. The files and the firmware are available at http://mymidpad.com/firmware/files/
Hey Les, Yeah I got it for my daughter and we use it a lot, are you sure it is fully charged and the jack is all the way in? Other than that I do not know, sorry, hope you get it to work.
2x2x2 inches. Though I should warn you that are multiple models of this device being sold. I had ordered it from an Amazon vendor (shipped by Amazon) and the quality was inferior (lighter: smaller batter, and FM not working). So be careful. But if you get a good one then it is a nice device. Quite loud - minimal features in terms of pausing and restarting from same point after shut off.
I'm not sure. I put it into a Dell Studio 1745 & it works fine.
I don't know. I put it in a Toyota FJ 2010
i know it will hook up to the back up cam. and warning. sat. antenna and steering wheel controls. but it fitting in a mazda Cx9 i have no idea. but if it does depending on what kind of speaker system you have you might need a modulator so you wont bow the amp system.
it has a piece with buttons thats removeable so that noone can use the radio if it gets stolen
the bass is better with a bit narrower sound stage. refer to the following link for more discussion on that product. http://www.head-fi.org/t/626971/akg-k702-65th-anniversary-edition
sorry.i don't have k712.so i can't say the diferent
Works great with my iPhone 5 with ios7 update...no problems
Hello Branton, I purchased this for my husband IPHONE 5S and he has a Outterbox Commuter case. He can charge his phone with the puregear lighting car charger plus the Otterbox case gives his phone the protection that he needs. Happy purchase :)
as far as i know you can't connect to an external antenna, sorry to say!
I fit *TWO* 17.3" ROG laptops in here, along with a 17" HP laptop, a 15"Acer laptop and a 13"Asus laptop. This bag is perfect, if you always have more to carry than you have room. It's like a small suitcase. Not kidding.
Yes they would. One on each side.
Make sure blue tooth is turned on your mini, this is found in settings on your mini. Turn keypad on. YIf this doesn't work charge your keypad, your mini and keyboard have to be charged separately.
I'm not sure but I don't see why you couldn't. I know mine wont work without wifi. This isn't much help but you should talk to your server and find out for certain
yes
I am very unhappy with this product. With in a week the screen shattered. I was unable to get in touch with anyone who could help me.
yes.
At first I was very excited about the IRulu and actually order a 2nd for my husband. The original one has stopped working completely - won't take a charge and the second one has turned out to be good for only word processing. However, we enjoyed them for about a year. To answer you questions downloading was dependent on how well our internet was working.
Yes it works fine but the only problem is that the jack for our on tablet is in a very awkward place and can be damaged easily if not unplugged before closing cover
I sent it to someone for a gift so I will be unable to answer your question. I do know it was high quality and very nice
Yes it fit perfectly and has worked flawlessly
I wouldnt know sorry. I bought it for a 2003 Accord.
Hi Michelle, Sorry we have no individual case with color option for sale at present. This is a bundle including 7 cases in 7 colors (black, blue, purple, hot pink, pearl white, yellow, green) For sure, the purple and green you want are included in the package. Hope this helpful. Thanks! Cici
As far as I know, DLP Link glasses are the only ones standardized across manufacturers. I did try this transmitter with Samsung RF glasses, and it did not work. Further research led me to the conclusion above.
I bought it for an HP Envy DV6 Notebook and it fits. Check the specs of your notebook to that of the DV6 and if similar, it will fit.
Yes it will! Just beware that once the bottom half is snapped on you will have to pop the side off while charging, because it covers the hole slightly. Other than that the case is great!
No it's not a proam it by a company called advanced digital it's still a great job I've owned on four awhile now and it really gets the job done its very steardy
No
I don't think so because I tried it on my older model hp & it didn't fit. But go back to discription & it tells u what model fit it.
No It does not. I bought the same model for my computer, received it and it was way to large. :(
looking at camera, if the lens is marked 58mm it should work. get adapter and filters to protect lens a uv fiter, poloriser are best. uv on all the time
No you don't have to have the RJ45 port plugged in all the time. Some people may not have a wireless lan set up. Also, it may be easier for initial setup of the device.
Yes, it is an upgrade from LE and AI, and, No, it does not come with a USB dongle. Thanks.
Yes, it would be able to be upgraded from elements 7. I had LE5 and I upgraded. It is worth it too, I think. 7.5 is awesome and really easy to use. The quality of audio you are able to get from it is very good. Tons of features and plug-ins, high quality effects, everything needed to record, also a new mix console. And cubase 7.5 comes with a usb licenser, if u don't have one already, to register it. I wish I wouldn't have waited as long as I did to upgrade.
Yes it Has , We use ARRI Lighting
Go to Nikon and find the one that goes to your camera and then you can find the right one on amazon for it much cheaper. I don't recommend using anything other than the right one.
I have not had any problems with speed on this device. It's a little tedious typing in the setup information with a remote rather than a keyboard but once that is done you should have no problems with speed. The only thing I use it for is Netflix and sometimes Pandora. It works fine.
Actually, NO! You need at least 1.5 mbit/sec to download Netflix and other streaming movies to watch. Should you have your own ethernet network, wired or wireless, you can view movies stored on your PC providing the PC has at least win7 or 8 (or in the future, win9, win10, etc.).
no
Hi. I would say about 5 hours. I do not play games and am not a heavy user, but I do stay online for long periods of time. ALso, when you do charge it up, it charges surprisingly quickly.
@H. Swayne, This is Sean Mills, a co-owner of Grantwood Technology. Thanks for taking the time to ask a question. The TuneBand for iPod nano 7th Generation should come with (2) straps to accommodate a wide variety of arm sizes. One strap is 19" long, and the other is 12" long. If neither of those two straps fit, then we do have three other sizes available. Please contact us at support [at] grantwoodtechnology [dot] com to arrange a replacement strap at our expense.
The package comes with two bands, one for smaller arms and one for larger. I am on the small side, and the smaller band fits well on my upper arm. My husband wears the larger one on his upper arm. Have not worn it longer than about 1.5 hours, but I find it comfortable for that amount of time.
It's not a completely contained case. The case is open at the bottom where headphones can be plugged in and the touch screen area is not covered or enclosed. It's not waterproof. I live in Portland, OR and have not had any problems with my Nano or my iTouch running in the rain, but there are areas of the Nano the are exposed. The silicone case which covers the majority of the unit does repel the water.
Mine did. It will charge with any micro USB as well
Make sure the Bluetooth on both devices is on. You should see the keyboard as an option in the Bluetooth menu. Select it and the iPad should ask if you want to connect.
No these are designed for electric locks.
No extra fees
Probably. My MacBook Pro works with it. MOFI tech service is great and they will help remotely if you have a problem.
The main difference is the 888 is single band and the 5re is duel. In the 400 MHz range with the same antenna they will perform the same. Basically you just get more bands with the 5re
I wouldn't drop them in a lake but it works fine in the rain.
No.
The HDMI port worked on mine. I don't think you are missing anything. try another HDMI cable
Yes!! Works great!! Has to be dark for sure. No duskiness
The Steadicam Smoothee currently accepts the iPhone 3GS and 4, iPod touch, and the FLIP Mino HD, although mounts for additional phones and cameras are reportedly on the way. It sells for US$200. You may be able to modify the smoothee to accomodate the note, but I'd goggle info on that before purchasing the smoothee
10 1/2 inches long and 7 inches wide
The fit is perfect. Couldn't be better.
I believe there is a thru hull transducer for fiberglass hulls
It I'd not blue
Yes, this has a metal brushed black top lid.
No, it's shaped perfectly for the 15in, the 13in would definitely slide around.
This only has composite in and r/w audio. So depending on what outs your MacBook has you'd probably need a hdmi or vga out to composite video and possibly a headphone to R/W audio splitter. At radio shack your probably looking at spending 20-40$ depending on lengths for those adapters. You'd really be better off spending that extra money on a projector that's a real projector. This is a child's toy with a life span of likely &lt; 3 months. Mine lasted about 5 minutes.
It will. The original iPad required less current which is why there is a destinction for newer iPads which require 2.1A.
It will be fine. Your phone will only draw the current it needs to charge. The nice thing about this one is that it can charge two phones at once. Or other devices--iPads, Kindles, etc.
I've had a Garmin GPS and Android (Google Nexus 4) hooked up with no issues.
Mine did. The cover which is also the keyboard.
Yes
sounds like the battery might be loose inside and on son=me of these you can take it apart using your finger nail and then check the dc pin and battery as I have on another uit and it fixed it, otherwise trade it out or send in for repair
as long as you have the app for iPhone but it will almost be same size as viewer on your camera
Hi, I dont know specifically if it is compatible as I am a Nikon shooter and have never used that flash. However I have used it with a Nikon SB900, their biggest and it fit well. I have also used the SB900 and this diffuser (which I really love) and a PocketWizard Flex TT5. They all fit well enough together to provide nice light with decent ergonomics.
Unfortunately, its only adjustable not removable.
This is made to fit on a standard light stand, not a tripod. It will work on a tripod, but you'll need an adapter "spigot" similar to this.
This charger does not have enough "juice" to charge a tablet. It will charge it but probably to less than 50% of the Kindle capacity. Buy something with over 5 or 6000 mA/hr.
Yes McCool (nice name) It will charge all the Ipad, Ipod, Iphone Products. You should have a cable that will fit it with your Ipad but if not you can get one cheap on Amazon.
this device works with my dell and ibm laptops, i see no reason why it would not work for you as long as you have wwan antennas
Yes you can connect an external harddrive and it does support usb otg.
There is. And I am very satisfied
This is a Windows PC in the form of a tablet. If a normal windows computer can do it then this can to.
The Asus VivoTab does have a micro USB port and you can get a short adapter cable (about ($9.00) to allow use of thumb drives, USB mouse, card readers etc. I don't know if it supports USB printer connection as I have not tried that with mine. I have also used the adapter arrangement to connect directly to my Canon camera to directly download photos from the camera.
Hard
220 V
Yes. I watch streaming videos a lot, mostly use netflix, youtube, and other various movie apps. The browser does support flash. This device is like a Android smart phone that hooks up to your big screen tv. Android OS is known for supporting flash and Iphones do not. You can also download different browser apps from Amazon apps and Google play.
I use Win7, but if set up as per instructions, and if your hands and the window are clean, I would assume it is defective.
Facebook will always let you use your password (in fact, we can't change that for any website). What our product does is let you use your fingerprint to put in the username/password for any website. So you would use our fingerprint reader on your computer, and would use you username/password on your phone/tablet like you always have.
Great!
According to the Philips website, this is compatible with the iPhone 3G, 3GS, 4 and 4S.
I have extras because I bought a new pair of headphones, but all I can say is get them from Best Buy along with insurance so you can just get a new pair if that happens. Its cheap and they're bound to keep these for a while...otherwise maybe ebay.
I use mine for all my homework and emails so it's on all the time and I get over two hours of battery life at least and I'm constantly doing things on it.
The only thing I can say about the difference would be the manufacturer. Both the original battery and this Wasabi battery seem to preform about the same as far as my experience goes. The included charger works in the car or in a household outlet with either the with my original GoPro battery or Wasabi batteries. I have been using these batteries for the last 5 months in my Hero 3 Black Edition and have not had a problem. I hope this helps!
Mine came with a built in foldable US standard plug and a European adapter it can plug in to, as well as a 12 volt car adapter that can plug in to it as well.
The Wasabi batteries last a little longer than the 3 Black batts. The new 3+ battery will not fit in this charger without a slight modification. The 3+ battery is slightly thicker. I have been using the 3+ with the external battery pac and it will last through two dives taking continuous video. But so will the Wasabi and the external pac.
I bought these for my dad so i dont have them handy, but i am almost positive they hook up via headphone jack. I believe this is the only way.
I have Intuit Go Payment and it works but feels a bit loose compared to without the case. I'm not sure about Square.
I honestly do not know.
No I have not noticed any issues with sound. I love this box.
Yes we ship all our orders for amazon.com from CT.
Even though this is a bit of an old question, I'll answer it for anyone else wondering, no this will NOT fit the Nook Color.
A basic manual shipped with my device, but I'm assuming if you need any additional support or information you'll need to contact Poetic. http://www.yourpoetic.com/contactus
Hi, Marcia- I tried to find it/figure it out as well. No idea. Don't know if it actually has one. Sorry couldn't be more help.
I do not know the answer to that. You might try contacting the seller. It should work.
Doubtful, they are very form fitting.
can you be a little more specific please
I no longer have the paperwork; but this is the description of the item when I ordered: HardBack for Nook HD+ 9 features an all in one design with ultra thin hard plastic tray for protection the back of your Nook HD+ 9 Soft microfiber interior lining offers anti-slip protection when roll back cover is in typing position, and adds much needed scratch protection for your screen. This is a wonderful cover for the Nook HD+ - very beautiful, very functional - I highly recommend the item.
Yes, it works well. I usually set it to -.5 EV if there is mixed sun and artificial light in the room.
I did a few tests with this product and I stopped it after about eight minutes or so. The built-in 8gb memory stick seems to hold quite a bit but I've had a hard time getting this thing to record properly. Consequently, I haven't used it that much. Hope this helps!
Yes, they work great. Used them when I went on vaca in hawaii and the Carribean earlier this year. Lasted atleast 3 to 4 hrs max.
I have the 4836 and it fits perfectly. Very pleased with the product.
No. While the Jackery is charging itself, it can not be turned on to charge devices that are attached to it. The Jackery can only be turned on when it is not connected to its power source (mini-USB on the Jackery end, USB on the power source end).
In your carry-on you should have no issue. You cannot put most batteries in checked baggage though.
I use my phone while it's plugged into the bar, and it continues to charge. I'd think using the bar while using GPS-related apps, including Google Map, would be a good idea, since map functions suck a lot of power.
Yes it does.
9v DC 1A
I've only had mine about a month, but if you're looking for something small, this would be a good buy.
i dont believe ther are any accessories for this perticular tablet..
I was never able to get it to do anything, I just threw it in a drawer and forgot it.
do not use an ipod, have used droid and it seemed to work ok
According to the Specs "The E1200 features four Fast Ethernet ports". To my understanding that is 10/100 not the Gigabit speed.
Yes it is, my husband really likes his!
Turn on your Bluetooth in your Laptop, after that you will get a notification in your Laptop and there you will find the code or whatever!
If it has the same usb port it will, I sure like mine, it work very well. Good luck
Hello. Yes, you can download Movies and TV shows through the Google Play Store or through various Apps that you can download from the Google Play Store. Thank you
Yes you can. YouTube or any other app
Go to your local Library they will not only show you how but if you get a Library card you can down load ebooks for free.
Hello. No, the Kindle and Nook App are not pre-loaded onto this Tablet. If they are available through GooglePlay then you should be able to download them. Thank you
no way not with this Himedia CRAP
if you mount the camalapse to something like the ultraclamp, and turn the whole thing upside down with a smartphone attached, yes it will turn clockwise. but be careful because the top portion of the camalapse is not securely attached and your camera or smartphone may go crashing to the ground, depending on the weight.
No it does not use batteries it's moves like a egg timer so it its very smooth for a time lapse
If you purchase and use the For Leather formula on the waterproof motorcycle gloves, all you will have to do is apply the product to the outside, following the instructions. We have attended multiple trade events, including the Americade event in Lake George, NY. We demonstrated not only on our gloves, but customer's gloves, as well. All kinds, insulated, waterproof, etc.
No it doesn't. You a see a slight film, but not really noticeable
Yes, it definitely should. I worked an event as a promo model and was so impressed with the product that I got some for myself. If you are going to use it primarily on black leather gloves, I recommend the black leather formula (because that formula is made specifically for leather and works spectacularly!) If you use the original formula on the leather, you'll want to do several coats. :)
Yes, I did have a paper with instructions.
I consider this as a must for me. Easy to use and much better than a tripod mount. Excellent and very well made for the money. Give it a try.
My Ipad came with a AT&T chip, and I dont see it would not work with other service providers' data plans. Besides, my purchase was for overseas use, and it works just fine here.
yes... that right... this table is good for some games and internet like facebook, youtube... but there are many problem when download update app.. as kindle, flash, primevideo amazon,.. etc
I have purchased several of the Epison 3D glasses. The price (which used to be higher) has always covered, only, a single pair.
I have a sony blu ray player (HDMI) and an older Phillips TV. This converter works using the S Video input on the TV and HDMI on the player. Came with cables too. :)
It does take an HDMI input, but only outputs through RCA cables or S-Video.
It is now available from one of our resellers.
It does come with a remote and sound is very good. If you have an audio out RCA it should work fine that is how I have it installed.
No there isn't an optical input but there is a coaxial input.
As long as you have audio inputs and outputs, i dont see why not. Mine is hooked to a 52" Samsung.
It has 3.5 mm Line in, so it will work with any device that has a 3.5 mm jack (cell-phones, tabs, laptops, portable mp3 players). Its ideal for your trailer and will fill it up with sound.
Yes
Definitely do not count on it working in a 220V outlet. I had another mini adapter that I loved until I plugged it into an outlet in England. Not only did I incinerate the adapter but I blacked out the entire B&B.
Yes, it comes with cables. I don't know how well it will connect with anything, because mine STOPPED WORKING a week after I got it. Good luck.
I dont know the programs. But the computer is fine.
8gb
This machine has USB 2.0 port
Hi Kim We are manufacture of this device, now we have US, EU, UK pin for optional, and australia pin plug is under developing. You could purchase EU plug adapter at avantree website or korea local website or amazon.de for optional Should you have any further doubts, please kindly keep us posted. With regards
Not long. And to be perfectly honest I'd go with a nook or a kindle. This really was a junk experience.
Yes, it does have the standard, Google android play store loaded on it. However I should mention that it runs pretty slow. It's an older tablet and I never use mine any more. It's just too frustrating/slow.
I've had it only for 2 months, so I cannot answer your question. Olga
I haven't taken mine off yet, but some of it I've peeled up. The material it's made of, I don't think it would. I haven't seen it to leave any stickiness or marks on my laptop. But like I said, I haven't taken it off yet.
Yes! They're just stickers, so they would go well with any laptop or tablet. :)
Unfortunately not, I bet you could troll around google and find some drivers but it doesn't come with any and Windows is clueless. As always, the cheapest solutions turns out to be the worst one :)
No you shouldn't.
Check the wiring. Bad monitor
Yes, that's what I use it with.
It came with 10 different connectors. Double check it again. Look at your adaptor for HP laptop. Compare it to one of the 10 connectors. I am surprise if none of it match. Also, check your HP laptop adaptor for voltage output and set the Ycpower on the right output voltage. If none of it is compatible to your laptop, then there is not much you can do, but to return the unit. Good luck!
Im not 100% sure but when I put it on my room floor by accident it charged from the light. It also works on really cloudy days even when there is hardly any light at all. Also, it's a little bit bigger than it looks like in the pics and stuff so make sure you have a could way to carry it.
Yes
it doesn't matter; just leave it in the sun to charge it! IF your unit won't charge from the sun, then there are 2 possibilities: 1. your circuit board is faulty and you need to replace the whole unit. 2. you live in a place with latitude above 41 degrees or so, so solar power DOES NOT WORK in the winter because the sun is too weak. Seriously though, it uses a pair of AA Nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries but THE UNIT IS SEALED so you can't really get to them.
Yes
No. The mini is a mATX/ITX case much smaller than the Midi. Just in case you mistyped, the Midi R2 already has this side panel.
hello, Thank you for choosing Perixx Products! We apologize about the issue you are experiencing with the product. although the Perimice-711 was built for PC system compatibility, it is designed as a plug and play so it can still work with your iMac. Please try to plug it in a different PC and see if the same issue occurs. Please change your batteries to a new batch. Don't forget to switch on the button when done installing the new set of batteries. If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
NTSC only.
No. Only one side has a player.
No SIM cards are usually not included, you have to get a SIM card from your carrier.
No, it does not.
No, the xyboard has wifi as well. It would work just fine without Verizon service. Just connect to Wi-Fi at home or wherever.
You should be able to do it. make sure the back of the case is lined up before trying to screw the board in. This is a normal issue.
They have to be on a card or a jump drive. There is an usb interface
There is no automatic repeat button. You can go back using &lt;&lt; button after the track is played. There is another not so neat trick. But i will suggest anyway. Create a folder and put only the song you want to be auto repeated. When you play from this folder at the end of playing it should repeat I think. But this may not be the way you want repeat function - sorry
Yes. Sure does. And they work.
It's a piece of junk, I had to turn around a buy a Roku to use. Sorry, but if soon enough return it.
Answer from Titantech: Yes, it fits your car and the steering wheel buttons work with the unit. Your stock usb port works as well.
It's the Radeon HD 7640G
One year limited warranty. Warranted to be free of defects of workmanship under normal use. Excludes damage from improper care of handling, accidents, modifications, unauthorized repairs, normal wear or other causes which are not defects of workmanship or materials. Will repair or replace or refund.
depends on where you downloaded the songs from.

It comes with a charger.. A micro use that works with all android phones... I personally bought the pogo charger which snaps at the bottom with 2 magnets..
Nope. It comes with a MicroUSB charger
nope, it doesnt =/
Contact Amazon support.
Yes. During initial setup it goes out and downloads patches and upgrades. This can take a while with several reboots.
Yes you can. But don't expect it to replace a standalone camera
Yes it will Doug
No
Unfortunately no. Just the 5/5s. 5c is too bulky
Juice pack plus holds more charge and therefore more bulker whereas air is thinner and holds a bit less charge.
My understanding is that the phone first then the Mophie. You have to make sure the Mophie switch on the bottom of the device I believe on the back is switched to off when charging. When the switch is off you are using the phone battery. When you're battery gets low on the phone turn on the Mophie switch and it immediately fills your phone charge. When it is charged turn off the Mophie power again. I didn't read the instructions and thought it wasn't working. Love the device now.
when you go to pair it again, the number will pop up on your tablet's screen just like it did the first time.
I have the first gen Google nexus 7 made by ASUS. This is a good match for the exterior and the keyboard does work. I mostly use the swipe and type while it is propped up in the case cradle but have used the keypad. The pad is just small so imagine you typing on essentially what is the length of your tablet. Good luck.
I couldn't find it on amazon you have to go to there home page just Google fx-sports. It's around $33 dollars with shipping it comes from England. My silicone case got a hole in it the first time I used them and as far as I know you can't repair them.
Any brand with a standard mount on the back. The mounting plate has configurations for numerous configurations. This is a universal plate for all sets. This is a great product at a great price.
Yes. it has a built-in DVD reader and burner
hello friend thank you for your inquiry yes, we have this item in our stock if you have nay other question please contact us freely have a nice day Emily
that is not one of the numbers listed for ones it will work for. I'd call Toshiba and ask them.
Yes,the half-press focus works great.
Yes, both battery icons do show up.
No it does not. Came with a screen protector and the case.
The battery on these units are a complete joke I would return it and buy a JXD7800
You can not drive this with a usb connection. It takes only an analog input. You need a DAC (like one from Fiio or Schiit Modi or MusicStreamer) to run off the usb port. You can use the analog out from your headphone port - the sound is much better if you use a good DAC from the usb port though, especially is you run the DAC output through a passive attenuator so you set your computer sound output to the max..
Yes, but through your computer via Audacity, which is quite easy to use. If it's a tape you enjoy, you might as well save it on your computer at that point. And you can burn discs easily via Windows Media Player or Itunes. No speakers, just headphones on this unit. Can't beat the price
See David's answer below. I have Sennheiser HD 650 and wouldn't want an additional to this on the holder. Cheers, Alex
Hey...holds my HE-400's no problem. Not sure if that helps.
the case does not have any opening for the rear camera.
Mine paired right away with the wireless and Bluetooth. Try resetting a few times. I love mine
Yes -
Yes we do have kit and harness for your car, harness is standard, if you have premium audio factory system or factory amp, you will need amp bypass harness.
I dont know, but mine charges off of a usb port on my computer
Yes and it will autofocus. I use it with my d600 and 24-70 f2.8 and 70-200mm. You just adjust the aperture on the camera just like any other lens.
In regards to your inquiry, it is compatible with the D40.
They should work on any Nikon body. I've put them on an old Nikon manual SLR, D40, D70, D90, and a D5100. The connection to the camera body is not as smooth when you attach a Nikor lens, but it does fit. Just play with it, and turn with constant gentle pressure. It may feel stuck but it will come off both the lens and body no problem. Hope you get It to work. These extention tubes are great!!
I record 6 hours @ slp! The quality is great in my opinion! I record TV shows on my Magnavox DVD recorder! I have never tried the other speeds, but I don't see how they can record much better!
Yes&#65292;Text Formatse supported by Kobo are Pub, PDF, TXT, HTML, RFT.
You should try one of the device only resets http://koboproblems.wordpress.com/2013/07/15/how-to-reset-and-factory-reset-your-kobo/
Yes, on the right hand side of the monitor.
Yes
yes ipad mini
Yes, the hot shoe mount is with the flash control / dimmer / etc. I use it for macro with D-series Nikons
Yes
http://www.philips.com.hk/en/c-p/SBT75_12/wireless-speaker/specifications
Try unplugging all the cables and cord and then replug them and restart the unit.
It just has RCA, co-axial and optical connections. (And I had to buy an optical cord) Hope this helps!
I tried but didn't have any luck with it. was very disappointed.
I don't know. I could not fit my ssd into it, which is why I bought it. I sent it back.
I have had this computer for approximately 14 months and my battery holds charge now for only about an hour to 90 minutes. I am having difficulty finding another one, can someone please tell me what replacement battery would work? thanks!
Miracast
Yes
My player works great! I can fast forward or rewind during the playback of a song by pressing and holding the double arrow key on the bottom. If you press the button and release, you go to the next or previous song, but if you hold it down it will fast forward or reverse; you can watch the time lapse counter on the screen.
I am not quite sure what that means- I had a lot of songs already downloaded on my computer that I had previously purchased- I just easily put the ones I wanted on this player- just plugged the mp3 into the port and downloaded the songs- no problem -no set up-
It would require external speakers to pick up sound in its mic
Yes - single band only 2.4 ghz
Hmmm....good question. I never noticed that. But, lack of HDMI was what--unfortunately--caused me to have to return this projector. I have a new Asus notebook computer and this projector was not compatable so I couldn't use it
Supposed to be usa but these days not sure.
Yes... But tight fit!
The one I have would only work on the first edition Ipad.
Yes. But recommend for use only on a desktop or table. I am six foot four and can't use it on my lap for more than a few minutes since the platform it provides is too long. I gifted one and the recipient doesn't use it for the same reason. The instructions are useless unless you are proficient in Chinese. The keyboard is very good if you intend to use it as a desktop computer. The Bluetooth connection is excellent and automatic and the keyboard has a good touch.
The keyboard is magnetic, so all you do is lift it off (the entire piece, including the wrist rest, not just the keyboard itself).
I have used this to examine a sore spot on the bottom of my foot works great
No it was preloaded with 8. I just purchased this in December from HP.
If it does, I haven't found it yet so, nope.
The model number is dv6-7247cl , its a envy and yes its a year warranty.
I'm not sure, it fits my HTC Droid like a glove.
I have a Bose docking station purchased in 2012. Connect the Tenergy and it works both to change songs as to increase or decrease the sound. But be careful: I also have a JBL docking station that is not compatible with the Tenergy.
It is great!!!
Not sure if it would work with the Audi.... I use mine with the Bose dock
No, this laptop does not have a touch-capable screen. You navigate Android 4.0 using the mouse pad just as you would navigate Windows or Mac OS on a conventional laptop. The integration of a cursor into Android works pretty well for most tasks once you get used to it (learning how to select things by doing a "long click" was a big help for me), but the lack of touchscreen and gyroscope sensor does limit your ability to use some apps. I downloaded a racing game I couldn't play because the laptop doesn't have a gyro sensor, for example.
Yes, you can, but you can't use an Apple Smart Cover
I replaced this with a graphics card with much less RAM (256mb), which made it faster. It depends on what software you are using on whether the increased speed allows for a better graphics setting.
The drier it is, the best it works ... I think microwave is easier to avoid burning it
There is an opening for the loop of the included wrist strap! It will not work with the wrist strap that came included with the iPod touch, just the wrist strap that comes with the OtterBox
Yes, works fine with my mini iPad latest version.
That would depend on what shipping method you select when placing the order. Most carriers (UPS, FedEx, USPS) do not require a signature unless you specify that the shipper (Amazon in this case) stipulates that to the carrier.
ours is good!!
No
No.
Yes, almost all headphones will fit.
yes
Yes
It does not, the fit is extremely tight. It barely fits over the naked phone with a screen protector.
Yes but must specify for 4/4s as sizing is different for iPhone 5.
I tried 3 of these mice. The first worked beautifully. The second one didn't track unless the mouse was in direct line of the receiver and only a foot or two away.On the third mouse the scroll wheel didn't work. I suggest you return it and get a different model.
Yes
Yes, but it is very limited. I cannot yet find out how to download things into it...
Both are relatively good products I went with the iSmooth it's very clear and makes the screen feel smoother than ever but Tech armor is always very good as well. Just pick anyone of the two you won't be disappointed def easy to install
No very little. I still wipe mine off with a shirt once a day or so but I generally have more then average dirty hands because of working outside etc.
Because the screen is curved ever so slightly towards the edge the screen protector doesn't go edge to edge. Every where I have looked they don't. It does fully cover the display part of the screen with a little over hang. I don't really notice that it doesn't cover the whole thing.
Yes..u have to download from app store
All depends on what you plan to use it for. Usually more is better. I have the 16GB unit and that is fine for me. I will never use the 16GB. But if you plan to download a real lot then get the bigger one. There is an expansion slot on all.
Susan You can download the Kindle app through the Google play store and from there all of your kindle books are readable through the app. You can also get Barnes and Noble books--- And books from Smashwords by using there website through the browser. --- I've done all three of them and not had a problem yet.
The Google play books app on the nook HD and HD plus have a read aloud feature.
Not if you have them downloaded before you go
You did not order this item from BlueProton. We would suggest that you contact the merchant who sold it to you directly through your Amazon order history.
Yes, I use it everywhere that has free wifi.
Yes, it is run on the android system,
The device works with the LG Optimus G Pro and LG G2 smartphones.
No, this adapter doesn't work with anything but the LG Optimus G Pro.
Just a standard cd dvr optical drive. Unfortunately I don't know the brand ect.
No
yes,since the charger plug is US plug,the item can work properly.
Hi Edward! Thank you for your inquiry! Battery will last 6 hours Aiste BisonOffice
The screen can be set to any angle when on the keyboard.
These are the following dimensions: Overall with stand: 21.9" x 16.5" x 8.6" Specifically the monitor housing: 21.9" x 13.6" x 2.0" Specifically the Screen:19.5" diagonal / 17.1" horizontal x 9.5" vertical More exhaustive specifications are on the ViewSonic page here: http://www.viewsonic.com/us/va2037m-led.html
yes
Yes. I installed Linuxmint 16 Mate version in a dualboot with Windows 8.1 Update 1. Windows pre-installed, updated it first then Linux installed. Uefi requires specific steps to install Linux bootloader correctly but it can be done.
No, it does NOT. I had to return mine.
I really don't know. I have the Samsung Note 10.1 and it works flawlessly. I really love it. It feels very sturdy yet the screen functionality is uninterrupted. I hope that helps you.
Clear from my experience. Matte reduces the display quality considerably.
Dear buyer, which device do you own from Samsung? We have screen protectors for the Galaxy Tab 2 7" and 10" as well as all 3 of the Galaxy Tab 3 devices (7", 8", and 10"). All of these can be found on Amazon, let us know if you need the direct links. Best, Tech Armor Support
It's clear, not glossy at all. If I could at this, you know how paint comes in flat, glossy and semi-glossy? This would be considered flat...
As long as the headset can pair with bluetooth signals id say yes it can. But honestly i have not tried and do not have bluetooth headsets. But by holding down preselect #3 until pairing pops up on the face unit and itll sync to any items searching to pair.
no
probably, i know it works with windows 7 64 bits
Yes, it is for all samsung galaxy cameras.
March 30th but I can only find it in black http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lightweight-Smart-shell-Google-Tablet-Samsung/dp/B00AHBKW2S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1362578166&sr=8-1
Reg
Yes
It's pretty stiff....
If you can return it return it, but if you cant then open up the bottom there are for screws unscrew them and then there are four more screws holding a the green computer boards. after unscrewing everything pull out the green board and put your mini usb charger to the bem. then slowly move the mini usb down it started charge but after afew times the charging metal fell off.
You will need to check with manufacture about both return policy and compatible issue. I don't know. Mine is 2012, SE.
I don't think so. It doesn't work with 2012 Camry LE. LE doesn't have the socket to plug in. Only SE & XLE has build in. That's what I know. Contact the seller for detail and confirm answer.
Each compartment is 1 3/4 x 3 1/4 and each watch cushion is about 1 5/8 x 2 5/8. They hold all my over sized watches as well as my husbands. Hope this helps. It's a beautiful box.
No
Yes, I used it with both my iPhone 4 and th 5 that replaced it
I doubt it. It was a tight squeeze for my iphone 5c
Yes it does, one of the main reasons I purchased it. I've purchased 3 and have never regretted it.
Yes, it is. It will fit in a normal height slot or in a slot with a low profile. The length of the card isn't overly long or overly short, about average. It really shouldn't be an issue I wouldn't think unless you have an unusually crowded case or unusually tall heat sync on a motherboard chip near your pcie slot.
Yes. It does. To be specific we've used it to push video out of the DVI and the VGA at the same time.
If you are using a iMac, there is special memory and this will not work. But, it may work for other Mac desktops so check apples website for support.
It can work at 1.5v with these settings: speed: 838MHz timings: 11 11 11 30 41
No, it won't. What you need is a vga or dvi connector
sorry but i want to buy want to buy this equipment with warranty thanks
it works well with my Canon XT and 300D cameras!:)
I can't answer definitively, as I've never tried it, but if your bluetooth device is capable of receiving and transmitting FM programming, I don't see any reason why it wouldn't.
I use it with Ipad 2 (iOS 7.02) and iPhone 5 (iOS 7.02) and it works perfectly. I guess it works with every bluetooth 2.0 and above
If it has bluetooth it should work To be sure go to Cambridge Soundworks website and ask
Yes. That's how I do it.
Works while charging; there is power switch. Use of the bluetooth connection is selectable in "settings"
No mic connection. It has a built in microphone for Bluetooth, but the quality is not great.
Yeah it works while it's plugged in and charging. You can listen to it while it's charging.
It is loud enough to hear comfortably for around 30 feet. It is quite nice.
Not exactly. To use MS Office you must activate it (read, pay for it) then it will complete installation and then you can use it.
Yes. It's fabulous too.
No. All it has on the unit itself is volume buttons and a Bluetooth button.
Yes, it comes with a USB cable and audio cable but no pouch or charger....I use my USB cable and charger for my BlackBerry and it charges fine.
Volume switch is at back
comes with 12 months Lenovo warranty
Yes of course as long as the printer is USB connected or wifi. there is no LPT port on the laptop, but almost no computer has such nowadays.
Mine has been working flawlessly on both 2.4ghz and 5ghz networks.
Yes, this model comes with a 3-year Lenovo Worldwide Depot Warranty (mail-in or carry-in service). The battery is covered for 1 year.
how long will shipping take, how dose the DVD,cd Brunner work
We offer a 90 day warranty. Thanks, Skyline Engineering, Inc.
Camera, mount, sticky pads, manual, disk, memory card, power cord. The cord is quite long. Maybe 10 foot or so. Long enough to thread it properly in just about any vehicle.
No. That takes a separate attachment. Honestly there are better cameras now for this price range.
I use the foam to suspend or float the transducer when the unit is used in a stationary application. When fishing off a dock it is useful.
There is a small sensor (2 inches by 2 inches approx.) that registers the images that goes into the water, beside or underneath the boat. If that sensor is placed in the water through the hole of the ice it seems that every thing should work fine.
Yesbit works with the galaxy s3. Sound is great too
I have the same problem. It's garbage and I want a refund!!
Yes, use the plug-in found in the forum. The EAGLE uses zigbee to communicate with the meter, but will communicate with VERA via IP... http://forum.micasaverde.com/index.php/topic,14767.0.html
yes
Over the ear hooks, no. But they come with inner ear wings in small, medium, and large.
Not sure what you are asking. Once the two PCs are connected it is like copying from one folder to another. You can copy as much and for as long as you want. You can change to different folders on each PC for additional copying.
the keyboard hooked up to my tablet very easily. i really liked it for the short time i was able to use it. my tablet will not take a charge, they think i received a bad charger and so i am impatiently waiting for one to be shipped. sorry i can't give you more input. good luck, linda
It froze up constantly...
If your monitor has a template for VESA 100 mm mounts it's likely it would fit. But the arm on this thing only extends so high. I've got it supporting a 21" monitor, and fully extended I've got 8 inches from the desktop to the bottom of the monitor. The bottom of your 34" monitor might hover just inches about your desktop.
Of course, plugs right into one of the USB ports.
Normal tablet could be locked to a specific carrier, while unlocked can be used with any GSM carrier usually by SIM card.
for using WiFi you need no sim card.
It worked with Celtel 3G in Tanzania.
We have an LG... Same technology, so yes
The battery fits perfect.
sounds like you have a bad cell in your battery
Yes it does
It can if you stack the filters past 2. Otherwise I do not recall having this issue. Getting a filter holder that has smaller gaps between the filters can help allow up to 3 filters. These filters though are best to keep at two since they are not glass. This is to help keep as clear as possible picture.
Yes. As long as the drivers work and you make the proper partitions.
I bought this battery for the UV-5RE Plus, it did not fit but I modified it with my Dremel tool and it worked fine. I do not know about the UV-5R. Good luck.
It comes with a panel you remove to install the passenger airbag light - it's a great radio- what you see is what you get. Spend the extra money for one that connects to the net and you can flash new apps on it.
of Course, it will charge anything as long as you have the proper cable
The cable itself not including the ear cables is 35.5 inches long, however the ear cables are 15.12 inches long. Add those together and you get 50.62 inches of cable from ear plug to audio jack.
You will most likely notice a delay when watching a movie, I have had several of these things from different manufacturers and they all have delay. Some of them seem less noticeable than others, I use mine for watching TV and have grown accustomed to the delay almost to the point where it does not bother me and I fail to notice the delay. It all depends on your tolerance.
A USB cable was included in my order.
I tried it on 1080P video and it did not work. So it won't work on 4K video. So I bought the Accell Ultrarun Pro high speed with ethernet hdmi cable. This one really works. But its more expensive then the other one.
the warranty from amazon is probably much better than the manuf. see amazons policys. VERY important. you probably need a signal booster in line when using this length of HDMI cable
All of the cords are about three feet long, it is designed to be installed close to where the components are located.
Normally the IR Bug is attached directly to the IR window of the component you are attempting to control. But we have used these in cabinets on the back of the doors facing equipment racks and they will work from several feet. I have not tried to use for more distance than that but it may work. Hope this helps.
We have over 15 of these and they are very dependable. Use RAID 5 to keep your data if a drive fails. Tech support is excellent in responding and getting a replacement drive out to you.
I do. It is compatible and works well.
For ETTL they'd have to be Canon compatible, but even then I'd check with the Phottix user groups/user communities about each specific flash you have in mind.
about 10.5 ft wide and 6ft high (give or take a few inches)
Intel HD Graphics 4000 w (lacks the Nvidia dedicated graphics included in the last model).
Yes
Yes, when it is dark you should see them glow in red color.
The mounting bracket is a flexible metal and can be adjusted according to the angle desired
Hello!!! It working good. Thank you.
Yes
I purchased this computer not too long ago as well as an Asus 24" monitor ONLY for the purpose of playing Battlefield 3 and battlefield 4. This unit runs it perfectly even with Windows 8. Extremely smooth and will run with no problems at all. A great purchase, especially for the money.
CyberLink PowerDVD
Hardware sticker says Made in China
Not familiar enough with zagg to give a good answer. The permanency and ease of installation plus the quality of the material and the way in enhances the touch screen vs. masking make it 1000 times better than anything else I've used. I have been using various screen protectors for different BlackBerry and Nook touch devices for over 4 years now. This is the best so far. imho
No I do not think it will fit the Galaxy. See Specs. This is one of the statements on the site: "Compatibility - Specifically designed for Barnes & Noble NOOK HD+ 9" Tablet." I wouldn't risk it.
Mine looks like new. I had forgoten that I had bought a refurbished one until Amazon asked me to answer this question.
No
Mine hasn't run while docked, but I would assume the sound would play through the phone as well as any audio. The unit only acts as a charger.
Sorry it does!;
It's a 2.1 system so comes with the sub woofer
The Samsung EX2 purchased from Amazon includes the Samsung International Warranty Certificate that guarantees the camera for a period of one year from the date of purchase. It is the standard warranty that covers against defects in workmanship and NOT accidental damage, normal wear and tear and postage to and from the service facility. The list of Samsung service facilities worldwide is extensive. Samsung Agents are not listed. Hope this helps.
The AC adapter is imperative. Your monitor will not work without it. The stand I think is just as important as well if you want the monitor to be able to stay put on a flat surface
Works great. Never an issue with lost connection or interference. There is a very, very slight delay. Maybe a second or two. This is not noticeable, however, unless your are in the room with the monitor viewing the iPad/iPhone. We are very pleased with this purchase.
Actually, according to the coverage list there is coverage in South America--based on the information provided at this URL: http://www.pocketfinder.com/how-it-works/coverage-map/. As for a monthly service: yes. A monthly service is required.
THE FL3360L has Fl360L has lower guide number of 36 the fl 580 guide. Number is 50 also the fl360"coverage of the output of the flash is up to 85mm the fl580 flash d use it output is up to 200mm bottom line more powerful unit I would suggest you go on line and down the complete specs for both flash guns I have the fl 360 and use it with the panasonic DMZ 200 and find the unit does a good job L M
yes
This thingie promises a lot and unfortunately doesn't deliver. return it.
No, it comes with Windows 7 Pro. I recently bought several of these for my company.
No. 2 cameras, 2 video screens, unless you have could rig a splitter for each camera signal and a switch to allow each image to show on single mirror.
No, it is not truly a docking station in that sense, more a port extender.
No, you cannot upgrade the processor as far as I know. It is not intended for intensive workload although it is much better than regular desktop PCs even if these have more CPU processing power. The reason being that it is designed as a server. It runs very efficiently 24/7 and is mostly silent. You can add more RAM but it is recommended that you use a server graded module.
Mine didnt come with a cdrom drive. So i guess you can put it there. Just find a adapter or housing for it. Ther drive bays are for 3.5 drives. Most ssd comes with 3.5 adapters. But if you need the space use the cdrom slot. And get an external dvd reader.
Yes, there is Windows software. As to Linux, don't know. Sorry.
Hi. You don't need widi. Just hdmi on your tv and USB on you laptop. This thing works pretty good but does not have the greatest range. You need to be in line with the receiver antena.
I couldn't get it to work with line of site 10 feet from my TV. So my guess would be that the answer is no. I have 40 years experience in RF electronics and couldn't for the life of see why it wouldn't work, but I returned the unit and gave up. I also have a Masters in Computer Science and the software installed find, but could never actually get the unit to connect. I hope this helps.
No. You can plug this right into your TV.
No, it can only be done with an external tuner, after many internet searches by me and two stores that sell this I find no such tuners. I returned mine to the seller for a refund. What you have is a VHS/DVD player only, not a Recorder.
Accessory handset only with charger base - requires the actual LS6195 series phone to operate. I use this one in my kitchen and main phone in bedroom. You would need to sync accessory with the main phone. Face-down charging, Caller ID/Call Waiting*-stores 50 calls, Handset speakerphone or touch-tone dialing. So far, I have not had problems.
Nope
Mine does not have a usb adapter it takes a completely different type of plug also not a mini usb
Yes
It will focus hand writing 10" away
I think what may help is motion detection. I already asked the tech support guy and he said they are working towards this functionality. I would think it be done soon over the next release or two. So far my camera works great so over all its a good by. good luck ;)
the side without the velcro hooks
No, the microphones are built into the speakers.
I don't think so. I think it is only Samsung phones
Yes if you set up an action to send an ACH transfer to your coffee shop whenever you detect it
We have Model 280 B so i do not know if it will work.
To clear things up, I have the 600 watt version of this. And yes it does have a 8 pin 12v cable
Joe, it's been a few months since I assembled my system but, as I recall, the cable lengths were all very generous. I don't think this should be a problem for you with this PSU. A big plus is all the variety of cables and connectors that are included with this unit. Very versatile package that was highly recommended to me by a serious "techie" at Tiger Direct. I took his advice but made my purchase here.
Nope, just power switch and fan rotation. If you are uncertain if it's PSU or motherboard failure, you can always try to manually turn on the PSU. If you look at the ATX power connector, there's a green wire that if shorted to a black negative wire, will turn on the psu. At that point you can see if the fan activates, test the output of molex connectors with a multimeter to verify proper output.
yes, you can use it
The unit is powered by using the AC power supply, and it can also be powered using 3 AA batteries, you should use both together, in a power outage it will switch to using the batteries. Also the frequencies are stored in EEPROM non volatile memory, which means that it will stay in memory even when there is no power. Thank you.
You have to hold the button down for a bit. The accidental bump is not long enough.
It can be used with or without mic.
This is strictly a marine radicand had no GPS capability, VMG requires GPS capability
On the product page under product Description it says &lt;&lt;Software: Google Play, Gmail, Google Talk, Skype, Google Maps etc.&gt;&gt; So, I would assume that it does. =)
Yes. A button on the back outside the case switches between white, blue, and red with the fourth setting being off.
I didnt keep the power supply. I needed a modular power supply for my build.. It comes with all of the necessary connectors to work with virtually any modern MOBO.
Yes
It is 64 bit
Hi Eleanor, No, it does not. Thanks, PCrush
Yes it will. Provided that you have subscribed for international data roaming. Or you use a local pre-paid/post-paid data card. There is an option to enable overseas roaming, however you need to access the option via the software.
It unfortunately has bad wifi reception even with dual antenna. What I did was open it up and wrapped a copper wire around the antenna and now I get 3-4 bars at 4-8mbps. You could also solder a copprer wire to the antenna as well.
I have same 10.1 2014 version. I got red case...fits like a glove...came with Bluetooth keyboard..if it is same case. think I pd 23.00. my case does not have elastic like the picture you show. cannot comment on case in photo.
There are 5 speakers that you plug in to the speaker spots Center, Right, Left, BackRight, BackLeft. If you are pluging it into a computer there is only one cord needed for that and to a dvd player is with 3. The manual is pretty helpful unlike most manuals.
Not so far(after 1 month)
yes,,,,very confusing
Yes it does.
no
It's an aviation radio designed for a pilot's headset. The connector between the radio and headset is supplied with the radio.
Yes, the scan works will your memory presets.
2.1 however it runs slower. A great deal of third party junk plus win 8. Trim the fat and it runs better
It should, on the box it says it works with Mac OSX 10.6 or higher, and gestures work on Win7 Ult. They should work on Mac.
Yes you can, no problem.
I believe it is a different receiver.
Because the mouse uses bluetooth, establish the link between the two first by pressing one of the keys, then using your finger or thumb on the mousepad of the remote. If this does not work, try the procedure listed in the manual for pairing the remote with the unit.
you get the completed video only.
You should be able to find any questions about the specs here at the company's website : http://www.brinno.com/support/Download/TLC200f1.2/TLC200%20f1-2%20-Manual_(EN%20A3)_20130903.pdf
Works with any USB drive with Windows
No is not.
It does not have room for 2 drives and yes you can downgrade. We did and love it. Call Dell and they will send you recovery disks for free
Hi, i am not aware, i bought it for someone else and have already gifted it to the person
No
i have minecraft for this and it works great. this laptop can even handle complex online games such as half life and halo and left 4 dead. i was very suprised. this is a great gaming laptop for not huge but popular games
Yes. Mine came with HDMI
Hi jprgbigbuyer I believe it does if I'm remembering correctly - I'm pretty sure, but I'd confirm that when you buy. I'd have to look in the back to confirm but I'm unable to do that right now.
If it would be, it would clearly state
Yes you can, there is no problem.
The cord and transformer measure about 9 and a half feet in length. The distance from the wall plug to the end of the transformer is exactly 4 feet. Distance from the end of the transformer to the small plug that is inserted in the laptop is about 5.5 feet.
Yes you can...it has a writer mode.
I do believe so, but I can't verify since the computer is at a family members hows
No, it isn't touchscreen. :(
Yes all you need is there
Yes
No, just one.
Yes both are included. I have already changed to a different mouse, thinking about changing keyboard too.
Yes, I have done this. You'll want to press the key combination to enter setup before the computer boots into Windows and switch from UEFI to BIOS. Once you do that you can put in your Windows 7 disc, boot to CD, and install the OS. Dell has Windows 7 drivers available for this model.
Mine is a desktop, don't think you would want to use it like a laptop.
The iPad clicks in to keep it in place, and the elastic band does keep it shut when wrapped around the iPad. I also use it to hold the iPad in place when upright..
I don't really understand the question, so I'm guessing here. If you connect 2 USB BT transmitter to a computer you'll have to pair one to the speakers and the other to the headphones. But if it's only one USB you'll have to pair it to the speakers or the headphones every time you switch between them, and the speakers don't turn off automatically
Well, Plex runs on the 5N without a computer, and when connected directly via Ethernet port the 5N is still quite speedy for file transfers, so I think the 5N is more versatile. If you were doing huge file transfers and editing huge images and videos I'd say get the thunderbolt version. But I'm very happy with the 5N on my network.
My Drobo units work on Both Mac systems and Windows system. Yes it works fine with Vista, but best to check Drobo.com to answer all your questions.
Mine did that too and I found out I put the music on in the wrong format, I believe it has to be mp3 format or something along those lines
Yes. Using mine with Windows 7. My previous one worked with XP, Vista, and 7
It is roughly three feet. It is a straight cord but where it connects to the headset itself, it coils for an inch and a half or so (like you can see in the picture).
I have a I Phone, but I think it would tho. I think it's like volume and pause. If you have cover, you have to take it off to plug in.
I am not sure if I was home I would look sorry but it works great
Actually it works with any carrier.
My daughter is 3 and son is 6. They love their headphones and have used them on the plane a few times. TThey are great. The only problem I have is that the kids can easily switch to parent mode. You can tell they have done this because the colour of the lights on the ear pieces changes although this. Is only helpful if you are actually constantly looking at your child. I think a redesign is needed for this aspect.
Yes you can use it with a computer. Talk about some serious sound!
Not
The charger works on my phillips norelco men's razor.
I think so, as long as your tablet has blue tooth feature it should work on Android & Apple tablets. Easy to set up, just follow the instructions.
No. This kit is only for units that look as shown 2011 and 2012. In order to add a second HDD in 2009-2010 units you will have to replace the DVD drive with a tray for the second drive. OWC has those kits. Otherwise you could just get a larger drive instead.
The kit did not work for me. I ended up damaging the delicate logic board. There was an expensive repair which cost almost as much as a new Mac Mini. It looked easy on YouTube videos. In reality upgrading is not easy.
Yes
As the product said "OWC Data Doubler SSD/2.5" Hard..." YES it can.
Hi Donna, yes, that is the part number. the part numbers on HP replacement screens are usually in this format. xxxxxx-001
Please note that the SMA connector is female. It fits on the pin on the antenna connection on the Baofeng radio. There is double ended male SMA adapter that is for sale on AMazon. Screw that on the RF coax cable and the other end will fit your female antenna connector on the Yeasu FT60. Hey, I didn't look at the FT60, if it has a male pin it will fit without the adapter. Good Luck, Ron
Just the cable, excluding the connections, is just shy of 21 inches.
1.3kgs
Ans: No-but easy to remove from case when need to dock
Only if you choose a 7 series case. Cases are different. Case is awesome though, made it through getting run over at 50+ mph.
No and no nfc
Yes. It gets wifi. Great little tablet
On the front, lower right of the computer, near the bottom and to the right of the center insert that runs from the top-you will see a small white triangle. When you depress the triangle the panel directly above that will swing open and your CD mechanism is located there.
Yes, but would not recommend this unit , or sender , they never sent me rear view camera , and cd/DVD player stopped working after like 4 months. Also seller is pretty much impossible to contact
Yes, but only slightly, not much range of angle. Enough to control glare or adjust for user's height
Screen is 14.85W/11.85H 19 diagonal - 16 inches from the desk to the top of the screen. I do not like the wide screens for office use. Comparing to other monitors in my office this is by far the better screen. The screen is much clearer and the colors are much more vivid. This is one of the highest rated screens according to my research.
No. Only the lens it was designed to fit.
No, this one is special design for Nikon 70-200 f/4 VR
lens mounting area is 67.9mm OD collar ID with clamp tightened is 67.7mm
It is basically this camera: http://www.dahuasecurity.com/products/ipc-hfw2100-7.html re-branded to Qsee.
If you have some kind of converter I would think it would work. As long as the converter doesn't burn up or something. Because the system is always on.
I have the otterbox cases and I just have to take the rubber off the plastic shell of the otterbox fits in the charger
Circle shape thermal paste is included on the water block.
Push Pull Configure is where you have 4 Total fans if its for the x60 is as follows Fan1-2 blows this way &gt; this is kraken IIII then you have the other 2 fans blowing this way &gt; that is push pull
I bought the 3 year extended warranty through square trade 122.97
It says it does, but there's nothing about it on the manual and there is no instruction on how to use it. As long as I'm not that into technology, so far I haven't used mine (supposing it is there somewhere). If you're counting on that, you better know how to find it and make it work, because their support SUCKS
Yes, usb ports (3) but NO touch screen.
It doesn't show 1600x900, it states 1366x768 (720p)
Hello Jose Luis, I have this Laptop with OS in Spanish, but keyboard is in English.
Dear Customer, You can find this product by visiting following link http://www.amazon.com/Alienware-X51-SlimStyle-Gaming-Desktop/dp/B00HX0KE88/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1389986075&sr=1-1&keywords=B00HX0KE88 Thank you
Is that a question? It's not like I misspelled the word. I wrote the review in about a minute to try and be helpful to those interested in the product.
It's metal and I bought mine a year ago and it's still on my windshield. The suction cups are plastic or runner or some random material
No, you need the one we sell for the AppRadios for use with the AppRadio. Thank you.
Mine is 8GB. It's an "ASUS - 14" Laptop - 8GB Memory - 750GB Hard Drive - Black Model Q400A-BHI7N03".
Intel HD Graphics 4000
hello,i bought this Body only kit, and it was complete!!!, with battery and charger (US Pin) but you can use also an normal CE (europe) cable. Everything was fine
Yes... It does come with the Pentax strap
Each computer receives one usb connection and one hdmi connection. The one usb takes care of both the mouse and keyboard. Hope this helps!
Nope.
Mac mini's do NOT ship with monitor or keyboard.
I returned mine...couldn't figure it out!
The Bluetooth Smart Trigger is compatible with the iPhone 6+. Please email support@satechi.com for further assistance. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support

Please email support@satechi.com for further assistance. Thank you, Satechi Technical Support
Yes, there is a Kindle app available for Windows 8.
No it has a full version of Windows 8 which is upgradable to 8.1
Nope
Next to the new Jot Script, it's probably the most precise stylus I've seen. Far better than the fat, rubber nubs on most.
According to their website no it doesn't: http://www.adonit.net/support/jot-touch-4/
I used it with an iPad 2 before I got an iPad 4th gen. It works fine as a "dumb" stylus with iPad 2. In other words, you can draw with it, but Jot Touch 4 is not compatible with the older version of Bluetooth on the iPad 2, so you don't get pressure sensing and the buttons don't do anything.
On a technical level they can, but not all apps will have it integrated for the Phone versions.
Yes.
It looks like only 30 days
I'm not sure, but probably 16GB.
x86 32bit
Digital or analog video cables
It is an awfully expensive solution for USB ports. In any event, I developed difficulty with my keyboard off of it, although it worked initially.
Thunderbolt and usb 3 input output: hdmi ethernet, 2 usb, audio and mic
Yes. It comes with software to play blu ray discs on a PC. It does NOT come with any for Mac.
If this is the one I ordered it did not work and I returned it - that was a long while back. I never found one that worked and that included calling the company.
some meters you have to turn on before you plug them in, some you leave off. try both ways and see if it connects. or get help from the life scan web site.
I can't say for sure but it does say Canon on it so I would think it would have to be. Works great.
I have the Note 10.1 N8013 and the keyboard works with the tablet.
Yes , this the best I ever bought .
I fits as a sleeve and keyboard protection but the holes are a little off since the placement of buttons and plugs are slightly different between the yoga 13 and yoga 2 pro
It is. I successfully placed the first one and I'm thrilled with it. No fingerprints, reduced glare. Easy application.
You have to go in your settings in the iPad and turn on the Bluetooth. And you have to push the middle button on the actual keyboard and make sure it's turned on as well. The on and off switch is on the right side of the keyboard. In the Bluetooth settings on the iPad it'll show up and say if it's connected or not.
Both, Thomas. However you need to provide the USB wall adapter.
The unit comes with a small control box and remote. Box plugs into outlet near tv.
I believe 1 1/4 inch. I'm in Vermont now, my antenna is in Florida.
Yes, The Key Board Can Be Removed And Used As You please Whil Ypure Connected Through BlueTooth.
It comes with an external DVD/CD drive. I have only used it to load TurboTax CD.
i have the s200e and it comes with a 3rd gen i3 processor and a external dvdrw drive which is good don't get the q200e because its an old processor and the x202e the only difference is it has bluetooth
It has a standard US keyboard. Note that the keyboard is not backlit. I think it should be at this price point.
Because amazon reused the heading form when this computer DID come with 7. Not that everything is 8 or 8.1. They had to change the tech specs.... windows 8 is an ok system. But 8.1 is more user friendly.
My laptop came with Windows 7 loaded and disks for both 7 and 8, as well as an "application and driver recovery" dvd.
I am sorry that currently the supplier only produce silver and black one. and we have another type of tube amplifier that has blue or red :http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JKFCDA6
No you don't. But many customers still choose to use one since the sound performance will be better with a preamp. Hope this anwers your question.
Yes it will. It has same basic requirements as my phone
the 810 can read the results from a power meter which is different than the cadence sensor--power meters can be pretty pricey--and don't come with the 810 package!
Hi, This item only fits for Macbook Pro 13-inches(12.78" x 8.84" x 0.95"). Please check the model of your device. Model number: On the packaging box or purchase receipt. Serial number: Look under "About This Mac" windows. (http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1529)
It did in the beginning and then it just quit playing them. I took it to the Geek Squad and they were unsuccessful in getting it to play DVD's again. Evidently, it has something to do with the Windows 8. They told me that I could buy a Video Media Center from Microsoft to resolve the problem but since they were not able to install a "Free" Video Media Center, I declined their offer.
No ipad mini is 7.8 in. I think it might be a little bigger but no your coby is too small Here is one that will work http://www.amazon.com/Durable-Rotation-Backseat-Headrest-Tablets/dp/B0085S0838/ref=sr_1_2?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1376949590&sr=1-2&keywords=7+inch+tablet+car+mount
yes it fits perfectly. The case is really awesome! I like it a lot.
Asus says the onboard CPU only takes 17W of power to power on. The rest depends on what else is assembled in the system.
it has some rubber stick on pads to make the air fit. I am using it with a 2. It is a very sturdy stand.
I think you have to actually turn off the bluetooth on the ipad in order to use the keyboard on the ipad. I'm not sure because I'm not using this keyboard as it doesn't work properly for me. It keeps repeating letters so I no longer use it.
Yes the keyboard will work/type with the bluetooth of the smart TV from their listed spec. You may always return it if it does not first off but better to ask to save us time. There could be one issue, it is navigation. Samsung sells a bluetooth keyboard listed for the smart TVs have a touch-pad built in. So you use their standard remote that came with the TV and place it into the restt area of the keyboard organizer instead of a tablet.
Yes, this does appear to come with a remote. Package Contents: SBX1250 Sound Bar Speaker System AC Adapter Remote Control with Battery RCA to 3.5mm Audio Cable User Manual Warranty Information Wall-Mount Kit
Yes, this has a power button and volume control.
I have not had any issues with my CF backup. It is very easy to use.
No; the clip would be smooth; like a garage door opener clip is.
I don't have a A701 but I do have a A720 7 ". On my unit the detente on the on off switch failed within a couple of weeks. The only time i can get the net is when I am within a couple of feet from my router. I returned the unit to Azpen for repairs and they did send me a new one but it still has the same problem acquiring the net. My home network works great with my ipad but not with the Azpen.
Yes. Old description. And supports usb SCSI mode which is rare for these. Even through a hub if the hub supports it. I like the anchor hubs.
Yes it will work fine, but of course only at USB 2.0 speeds. You can also use the USB 3.0 cable it comes with to plug into a USB 2.0 port.
This is a "Stepping Motor Lens". MICRO FOCUS is an automatic feature of this lens.
Yes. The 60D will accept both EF and EF-S lenses.
Still haven't used this product as yet. Not sure
I don't know what is the type of the battery for remote, I am using it from April and I didn't have any problem.
We are sorry that we not provide shipping to your country right now. As the shipping cost is way too high considering single item cost
I used it in my Ipad, and it worked fine. I think it will work with MS Surface.
Not sure. Check out their website. They have the answers there.
It only changes the dvd drive. Everything that you would have downloaded would be on your hard drive, so as long as that is in working order, you're fine.
I can't find the user guide online. The hard copy is 23 (3x5 inch) pages. It includes, Warnings, Product Description, Nomenclature, Operations, and Specifications.
I'm not a Canon user so can't answer ,but Nikon D90 and D3300 work OK.
Not that i notice with a canon 60d
Everything u need is Inside the box best place to connect power for camera is to hook up to reverse light
This one looks like to be installed MS Office, but you need Product Key for it. I mean, when you click MS Office icon and select "I already purchased Office 2010", you will see pop up "Enter your Product Key".
Hi Yes forward your shipping address and we will get the shipping cost and will adjust price to cover extra cost (if any) Thank you
you can look up the specks on it for weight, now you aint going to put it in your pocket, like those slinder cameras NOw it aint as heavy as some of those monster fancy cameras but for the money it is nice, do have wee problem focusing, video is nice, expanded side gives you a better grip on the camera. I did get 2 extra batteries and charger for $30 which allows a one and half hours of video. see my film on youtube (donze52) to see this camera videos.
Model #Li-50B, 3.7 V 925mAh
Yes, this package we offer today does include a 4GB memory card.
Perfect! Carefull with light and transparecy of water
Sorry, I bought this as a gift-I don't know the answer to your question.
Date stamps are there, but no time and location stamps.
No it does not have a view finder. So far I have not found that to be a problem.
Have not read the manuel, but have not been able to do it. Says "file cannot be read" or such.
Yes it does have a 1/4th pod mount
Yes it does have a flash. There is a little black switch you push on the top left and the flash opens where the Olympus name is over the lens. I have this camera, and it's a great little camera.
I have not had a problem with the screen but, then again, I don't use the camera a whole lot. Hopefully, someone else who uses their camera a lot can also reply.
I have the Olympus and it hs worked well for me due to the shock proof aspect and the waterproof. I dropped it twice on a trip once in the water and it is still like new. I have not used it for diving yet but have a friend that has and her photos were great. I will be diving with it in a couple of weeks.
I was told by my vendor that the new model TG-830 has the GPS function which I love. The resolution is higher and is HD for the recording. You can do the comparison on both features. When I purchased mine the newer model cost about $100.00 more and now is about the same price.
yes, to the left of Iauto there is a "P", when you select that you can now tab down using the joystich to manual set you photo options
No it is stationary.
No, this radio does not have End of message programming. it does use S.A.M.E. Technology
This question is along the lines of "is Ford better they Chevy." Both are transportation - both get you where you want to go. In both situations, one being better than the other, is all dependent on your individual taste and wants. I would suggest you find a retailer for each machine and sample the features of each. In the end beauty remains in the eye of the beholder.
No pen, and since it doesn't flip I wouldn't want to write much on it anyway. Myself I don't find the touch screen that useful, except for debugging touch gestures.
The touch screen feature is not always on as it can be easily locked. I use the shutter button almost 100% of the time. I should be trying the touch screen option, but I am happy using the shutter button to take my photos. Let me know if you have any other questions!
As far as I know, it is not. Have you looked at the Olympus web site? You might also want to Google Olympus 50 HS flash power to see if you get anything. I hope this helps.
Thank you for your time. For question of this type, we advise contacting our sales department directly at 1-800-991-3350 between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. EST Monday through Saturday.
The menu is in english.
If your camera has the eyelets for a strap it should fit. The section to got through the eyelet is less than 1/2 an inch.
yes but it's is very fragile and easy to damage
Not sure because my case was not for iPad Air, just ipad. Sorry I can't help
Thanks for the inquiry. At this time the case is only available in black, however we are considering additional color options. Please let us know if you have other questions.
No last years model
I don't think you could go wrong either way, but I have to tell you I'm a raving fan of this card. The sound quality is superb, the feature package allows flexibility you won't find with the Asus, and the software package is waaaaay better than the Asus'. I have a lot of Asus products and I like them, but the support and continuing upgrades that Creative offers makes this card my overwhelming pick.
Requires software. Easy to use and it has a nice little click sound as you switch from headphones to speakers.
I don't think so, it seemed to be built into the case. I didn't try to remove is so I'm not a 100% sure.
Yes. It has a standard tripod screw hole for a tripod stand.
I am not quite sure but I don't think so, maybe not if you see something wrong with you can just to the return option
My charger fits fine .
BMA 17 BTR BN1JWP Wasabi 3.6 volt. replaces4.3Wh. replaces1200mAhreplaces NP-BN1
It comes with a cord that plugs into the camera. & then you plug the other end of the cord into an electrical outlet. You don't need to take the battery out. If you plug into the computer, it transfers the pictures from the camera into the computer.
No it uses a rechargeable lithium ion battery that comes with the camera and a wall charger comes with it as well.
absolutely terrible! Especially if using video feature. Didn't last 2 minutes at the beach with a full charge.
yes
Yes. It does have a tripod mount on the bottom.
I have one. Once i saw the question I tried to do it using my Ipad mini wired to the projector througt an HDMI cable. The answer is no. I tried to do that and it doesn't work as expected. This projector has just audio inputs. I think if you plug a RCA cable from your device (PC, DVD, wherever) to your VS 320 projector it'd work. I'm not sure but i guess so. Best wishes.
A search of the product specs yielded this claim: "Supports full duplex operation with IEEE 802.3x flow control and half duplex operation with back-pressure flow control." That being said, full-duplex is pretty much a standard feature of any modern-day LAN adapter.
It uses custom cables. Each 12ft extension cable is $100. So tack $200 onto the price tag.
It doesnt have one, but I feel is not need it. But it may help.
I don't think so if it says for 13" it fitted mine because mine is a 13
4.5"x1" guestimate?
I use Mac and I didn't have a problem. There is an additional download of NTFS on the Seagate support sight that might help but I didn't need it. I plugged it in and didn't have to turn it on for my computer to recognize it. There is a factory reset button on the bottom which you might try. If the unit doesn't power on it even when it's disconnected, it may be bad from the factory.
Yeah, Seagate has their app available on the app store from where you can upload anything from your phone to the HDD over WiFi.
From the Seagate Wireless Plus Frequently Asked Questions page (http://knowledge.seagate.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/005087en): What operating systems are supported by Seagate Wireless Plus? Wi-Fi enabled devices with a Web browser, iOS 4.3 or higher, Android 2.3 or higher, or Kindle Fire; Windows 8/7/Vista/XP, and MacOS X 10.6 or higher. What Seagate Wireless Plus apps are available? Where can I get them? The Seagate Media app is currently available for: iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch at the Apple App store Android devices at the Google Play store/Android Marketplace Kindle Fire at the Amazon App store
Maybe, but the air will be pretty rank.
Yes
Yeah! It's not as close up as you'd get on a regular camera lens, but it's better than phone quality.
Yes, you can connect to the RAVPower and stream directly from your SD / USB device to your iPad.
Yes. I have ativ 500.
the case doesnt. you have to buy the tablet with a keyboard bundle as the tablet can also be bought on its own so be sure before you buy.
Only thing I could see that would possibly interfere with doing that is the wireless sub. I would contact Polk and see if is possible that there may be interference. Other than that I don't see an issue.
Yes. The iPad Mini can lay almost flat against the keyboard and you can use the front facing camera. They do have a cut for the camera in the back though you do have to turn it vertically against the keyboard to use it. See my review that I will be posting soon and I will show you. It'll be a video review.
The backlit keyboard has more angle options (versus one for its predecessor), a backlit keyboard almost double use since the iPad mini is already providing illumination. Kuddos for the first improvement, it goes the extra mile in comfort. Both keyboard cases are sturdy, toddler proof enough, and comfortable to use on a regular basis.

Yes u can
You can download the "FBReader" from Amazon app store. This is my favorite program for reading free eBooks (mostly classics). It allows you to configure where the eBook library is stored on your tablet's internal memory or external microSDHC card. On the other hand, the screen resolution of this 4.3" tablet is too low at 480x272, so you can only view a small region of a normal book page. If you expect to do a lot of reading, get a 7" or larger tablet instead.
Yuo you can, and theres several apps too for music.
I have a 2011 328xi coupe, and it already has a bluetooth sync which impacts this.
Yup, there is a button on the top, just like on a regular camera.
Yes
No. It's highest recording frame rates are MPEG4 and AVCHD.
No, there is no case with this camera. However, due to the small size of the camera, it is quite easy to find a small padded case that fits the camera.
Hi Joe, the camcorder can record in either 60i or 60p in HD quality. Thanks_Mitch
never have used it. I just use the SD card but in answer to your question it has a "MULTI" socket (they call it) that a AV cable connects to (sold separately) that the audio and video comes out of.
Yes you can if it's on video mode you just simply press the photo button on top though be sure to focus it so it isn't blurry. If you want advance options switch to photo mode and simply read the instructions from that point :)
4. Requires HDTV and HDMI cable sold sep. 9. For PC: Requires Microsoft Windows XP SP3/ Windows Vista SP2/Windows 7. For Mac: Requires Mac OSX (v10.5-10.7) 13. Requires via VMC-UAM1 cable (sold separately), AC power for camcorder, and hard drive formatted in FAT-32. USB-hub not supported. External HHD/USB media should be less than 2TB(Terabytes).
I wasn't able to record any paranormal activity in my home. Your results may vary
An sd card. Mine is 32gb. The bigger the better to store more video.
i ordered my wifi adaptor from sony online store. you can find it in the below link: http://store.sony.com/wireless-adapter-for-handycam-camcorders-zid27-ADPWL1M/cat-27-catid-All-Camcorders-Accessories
No. It does not have a line out headphone jack. You have to move up to the 430 version for that feature. The 380 has a mic in port. I monitor my audio via the hdmi port and a $13 hdmi to VGA with sound adapter I got on Amazon.
Hi there! The model of the AC adaptor is AC-L200. -Anthony
Hi LafLa, this unit can use external devices that can be connected through the Multi interface shoe and/or the mic jack in which the mic uses the battery of the unit as a power source. We cannot guarantee functionality with external accessories that uses a different power source. Thanks_Mitch
Thank you for contacting us. We'd be able to assist you best by phone, please call us at 1-800-991-3350 between 9am-6pm EST to discuss the different camcorders we sell before you place your order.
Not that I'm aware of.
Yes.
Hi Thank you for your interest. But I'm sorry we can't guarantee the compatibility with on board graphic chipset. Please use the graphic card like Nvidia GT620. Thank you.
I have had this TV for over a year now and I game on it. I've played Rock Band, The Last of Us, Uncharted, GTA5 and other games, and I have absolutely no problems with lag. Make sure you set it on game mode, however.
are you having on tv as broadcast, or on streaming movie from a pc that was recorded ?
Yes, it will line up with the 140mm fans' screw holes, unless your fans have a 120mm mounting pattern like http://www.amazon.com/Prolimatech-Ultra-Vortex-Mounting-Pattern/dp/B00B1WQ4VA/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1381095474&sr=8-2&keywords=140mm+fan+with+120mm+mount . If it doesn't have the 120mm mount pattern, this filter should lineup properly.
Full measurement of the entire filter is about 140mm x 140mm outer measurement, with an effective 130mm x 130mm of filter, 10mm of magnet on all sides. The magnet will cover a slight portion of the fan, but I don't think it would significantly hinder performance. I use this filter, and honestly the dust it catches greatly outweighs the size of the frame.
I correct my previous response. I cannot get twonky beam to work with the Seagate central 4tb. But it does work with the WD My Cloud 4tb Network storage. With WD My Cloud Public Share loaded. It load automatically when you first connect the device. I open the icon on desktop (pc) and drag/drop the movies or what I want to share. Works with Ipad, Android tablets/devices. I have 3 devices simultaneous playing. Flawless. SWEET!!!!
air flow through the filter is not restricted when the filter is clean. just remember to clean it every 3 to 4 days to prevent dust build-up
Yes you can access files remotely from work, friends, during travel. There are instructions to set it up. In addition, there is an app - Android - Seagate Media - for accessing files on mobile devices. I am sure there is one for apple too. I hope this helps. If you purchase and run into any problems, their tech support seems very helpful and friendly.
Had to be plugged in
VGA. No DVI.
No it does not.
yes, it is. No problem with wi-fi connection.
I've had my ACER for three months. Installed a WD MYBOOK 2T the first week and have never had a problem. Works great. On the ACER there are both USB 3.0 on the left side and 4 USB 2.0 on the back. the MY Book is plugged into a 2.0 slot (middle position). Try changing the USB slot you are plugged into. Or totally delete the MYBOOK and re-install.
Many times I don't use the touch screen. I just use the keyboard and mouse. Never looked into actually deactivating it.
yes
you have to buy it
Yes, we pay for the 3 year option which was an additional $250. Laptops are notoriously less reliable than towers, partly because they get knocked around more and partly because you have so much heat generating stuff in a confined area. I was responsible for PC support at one point in my career and we expected that 30% of the laptops would need to be worked on in the 3 year life expectancy we had. Some numbers I've seen don't make me expect things have gotten better.
Yes, it does. Its a very good laptop, very comfortable and fast.
It should support photo shop and the computer has a terabyte so that's a lot of pictures probably more than you have
Yes it has a CD drive that can operate as a DVD burner
Lynanne From what I found on the Internet these 2 items should work together if the correct driver is installed. Regards Audio Systems Plus
The case is quite tight to the bare iPad. My experience with otter box is they are fairly thick. I do not think it will fit.
Genuine leather. I genuinely like this product and highly recommend it. I wish they would make the same for other tabs
This is for the 7 inch HD Kindle Fire. The one right before the 8.9 inch HD Kindle Fire. Not sure about generation due to Kindle does not have Generation on their products. I hope this helps. Please do not hesitate the email me with further questions. Thanks! Kayla Johnson Skinit Customer Service
It means you need to buy a separate accessory for it to have a Bluetooth. The part that you need is the JVC KS-BTA200.
You can hook your android phone up with your charger cord and with a double sided male head phone jack cord.
AMD Radeon HD 7640G Discrete-Class graphics and up to 3053MB total graphics memory
Hello, It comes with AC Adapter (and Power cord). Best regards, Amuras
yes.
I use a Lepai LP-2020A+ with mine and it sounds pretty good in my opinion. You get a little distortion at very high levels but that is only at extreme volumes.
They're basically the same, except with a (built in) lower cross-over point from mid range a high range. So, these (depending on how you look at it) are either "bassier," or "have less treble." Although I believe the cross-over point isn't much different. So essentially the same speaker.
Sure they can but there only about a foot tall so better on shelf or table.
I have let my 5 year old play on the wolvol laptop and she did fine. I like it myself.
my tablet says nothing abt an hdmi cord as a part of my purchase..i don't think it's capableof a tv connection, unless it can connect with a usb prt.
Yes you can get Netflix on this device
16 high,4 1/2 deep,16 1/2 high 13 wide
Yes
Comes with multi screw sizes Philips head. Don't know thread pitch.
The Mount-it Adjustable can lock after it is in it's final position?
Yes.
I would say anywhere from 30 to 45 min!! This is just an estimate and not a fact.
I would say no. It is made very specific for the type listed. I had to return mine.
no, i bought it for my HP Envy 360 and it does not fit
I don't think so - I don't see any expansion ports on the inside of the PC. I think you're stuck with the built-in graphics....
No. It comes with only a keyboard and mouse.
If you are referring to a USB thumb drive, the answer is it has a USB port. I have not yet had the need to use that yet. When you connect to your iPad it directly links to Photos. Hope that is helpful.
The volume buttons are on the top right of the tablet next to power button
Yes it is compatible with any operating system that has usb and as far as I know all windows, mac, android and Linux do. However the keyboard and E-Blue Mouse LED lights do not turn off with the Computer. You will have to unplug the keyboard to turn off the LED lights. This may not be a problem if no one is sleeping in the room with the computer.
Feels mechanical, that was until keys stopped registering and then stopped working all together..
Not loud but down plan on keeping this keyboard for long. Had mine for 3 months before the W key would stick and eventually stopped working. Spend a little more to get somthing better than this.
No its not.....although there others similar to this one which are
I used a converter with built-in plug adapter. If you just change the plug you still have too much voltage (220) and could fry your laptop.
Yes it is. It's based on the percentage you agree to with Inuit. I do big sales amounts on transactions but it's never a big percentage that comes out.
Yes it is
We bought it to use in Canada. Don't know about Costa Rica. Call them
Yes, no problems
Yes! You are allowing a different version of Android to take over from the Nook software. You can set it up to allow switching bank to the Nook when you first start up. In the Nook your game data is still there.
Yes, it plays dvd and cds. Yes, it burns them too. These depends on your PC application software. I don't have Windows 8, so I cannot answer your last question.
Yes, it supports several DDNS providers, as well as rudimentary, yet usable, firewall/port configuration options.
Yes
hablas espaol ..cual es tu pregunta?.....quieres saber el peso de la laptop sola or el paquete completo?
microsoft office does offer a free trial to try it out for a month and you can either download the full version or purchase a copy from a store online or locally. I'm using the trial version and it's nice......i intend to go full version at the end of my trial
No, that is not true. I have a Logitech wireless mouse and keyboard connected to it, and they work perfectly.
Yes it is blue tooth enabled.
Lenovo yoga hardware specs are better than mac book air. You can fold and rotate Lenovo yoga whereas mac book air is like traditional laptop. Yes, MacBook air is thinner than Yoga and Apple's red eye retina display gives true colours (which apple claims but I have found Lenovo yoga's colour resolution is as true as real!!). I am not a fan of Mac OS, its window management, maximising & minimising windows and apps are terrible (in my opinion). Lenovo has windows OS and windows OS is very easy to work on (for me). I hope this helps! Thanks
No, but unless you can't live without it this is great little computer.
claro.
Yes, it is upgradeable to 240/500GB M2 SSDs, but you need to void the warranty (as it requires modification of the internal hardware and opening the computer) and requires some configuration from the HDD, so it is possible a clean install of Windows may be required after modification to accomodate the new SSD drive.

Hello, Yes, we ship to UAE. Best regards, Amuras
Keshav, rethink buying this thing. Looks decent but it's really cheap plastic (including the hinges) I use mine as a desktop but less than a year of use the hinge broke and the plastic surrounding the screen came off. The keyboard does not feel right as the keys are embedded on a 'soft' panel and there's some 'give'. Software sucks(Windows 8), had to reload some of it for it to work. My U410 has a Core i7, 1.9 GHz. No more Lenovo for me.Thank you.
I think so, I use some Adobe software like Photoshop and Illustrator with no trouble. It does have 2 video cards so it will take on some graphic processing quite easily.
They take microSD cards.
-Yes
Yes. You leave the battery in the camera to charge it. You can either plug it into your computer or wall outlet. I've found that it holds a decent charge, and doesn't take more than about 1-1/2 to 2 hours to recharge. My initial charge may have been closer to 3 hours.
No. It didn't even fit the itouch.
You can use SD or SDHC card. I use an SDHC 32 GB which is good enough taking movie( underwater or anywhere).
I honestly don't remember, I just check to see if the battery and charger are there. It does not come with an SD Card. It does have built in memory of 70MB. According to the packing list from Panasonic, it does include battery, charger, hand strap, usb cable and software disc. This camera was in the standard retail package.
yes
It will get sand on it. The camera is pretty well sealed and it likely won't get sand inside.
In the box is the camera, the lithium battery, the AC adaptor, handstrap, USB connection cable,, owner's manual and CD-ROM to install the software on your PC and product registration card. No it did not come with a memory card (just the internal memory).
For a little point and shoot it is amazing. I am a medical investigator and frequently have to shoot scenes at nigh with poor lighting. I was pleased and amazed what a nice job this little camera does in VERY low light situations.
Yes, in "client mode" it acts like a wireless adapter for wired connections.
couldn't get it to work for me ???????????? don't know
No it shouldn't affect it.
No its for indoor use only. They have outdoor versions of this camera.
Yes there are several apps you can use to view this IP camera with your Iphone.
yes you can!!
Battery life isn't the best other than that I love it
It does have apps to use to read.
Yes. It can be charged in place through a USB cable or removed and re-charged by an external charger. Extra batteries are readily available on Amazon or elsewhere.
i do not believe so. i purchased one.
There should not be, but if you use a "slow" memory card that could be the cause. Also if the camera is ser tot postview pictures,after they were taken.
camera includes rechargeable battery, battery charger, shoulder strap, lens cap, lens cap cord, USB cable, CD (software and owner's manual)
1/2" (6.4 x 4.8mm) & it's a 16 MP backlit CMOS sensor.
SD/SDHC/HDXC Here is a video from this camera: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxESNlKDn6I&feature=youtu.be
No
Not sure I understand the question. Any more details?
We use the canon eos 60 and it fits. My understanding is that it will work with most 35mm and 58 mm cameras. I hope this helps.
Nope
yes, it should. it works with any camcorder that has a standard 3.5mm audio input
never had that issue. maybe your electric flow or socket
With a clamp or device that you can attach it any where you need , charger that can be attach to the cigaret lighter and also what I did bought a device that can have a better visibility since I ride motorcycle I am very happy it has saved me several tickets but you have to learn the signals.
Yes they do, it's a tight fit though.
yes
Matte
If you shut if off while a song is still playing, it will come right back to where it had been playing when you start it up.
No
Yes
It'll fit.
There are no zippered pockets. 2 open pockets inside bag are just the right size for a paperback book.
it should if you have a double din opeing
I bought this and installed on a 1999 Honda Accord. You may need to contact the manufacturer whether it's compatible with your 2012 smart car.
if you have a double din opening it will fit
Not sure. I returned mine because it didn't power on when I installed it.
You have to hook up an external tuner
I dont know who is the map provider and neither the map addition.
Answer from Titantech: Yes, steering wheel control, it is ready, nothing else need to be added.
No, AA NI-MH batteries put out about 1.2 volts. So they need to be charged at about 1.4 ish volts, this charger would overcharge the batteries
Appears to be 19mm X 25.5mm for the board only and another 3mm for the usb connector.
No.
Ok I look around and talk with some Sony technicians all they said was to get 5400 or 7200 rpm as long as it is SATA2/ SATA 3.0GB/s

Thanks for your interest in the Lanyard Neck Strap. Yes, we can ship directly to you in Canada but we can't do it through Amazon because they blot out all phone numbers, URL's, email addresses, etc. within their email system. To contact us open a browser and search for LapWorks, Inc. Go to our home page and in the upper right hand corner is a contact us button. Good luck.
Works great with my nx2000.
We have not connected a microphone, but this cable simply makes three iPad headphone ports where there was just one. It does NOT split out the left audio, right audio & microphone, just duplicates them. You maybe able to modify the cord to make one female jack with wire connected to mic only, and with its stereo audio not connected to anything. This could allow other jacks to be used for headset
It will be 3 identical signals. It does NOT split the channels.
I've had my case for a while and never found any scratches on the Nook screen. The case is actually great when closed because the screen sits back from the keyboard so there isn't really a way for that to happen.
I'm not sure about that specific nook. They keyboard only sometimes worked for the nook I had. I returned it. Don't waste your time and money.
this does have a cover for the front screen. beware it is very tight on ur iPod though. Dj
Yes it does
yes
Android reader apps available supporting mobi files
If your Prius has a single DIN frame it will fit
Nope
Yes, mine works perfect
Yes
Yes but be sure you have the correct iPad side connector. Or adapter
I don't think so. But you can try sync it with the bluetooth
Any metal near will affect the reception.
it's matte
No. It doesn't. You should buy an external one if you need.
This netbook does not have a VGA output. The only video output it has is HDMI. You can see the full specifications here: http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model-datasheet/NX.M10AA.015
Yes. I am running Photoshop CS6. Mine is i7. I am still tempted to up the RAM. But you should have no worries.
Yes, one Year.
I just bought this for a gift took back home, no idea sorry. Consult with an IT guy/gal to show u the difference.
It's very easy to upgrade. There is a plate on the bottom front of the laptop that has two screws on one end and then tabs on the other end where you can slip a small flat blade screwdriver on each of the three tabs and gently lift up. The two DIMM slots feed your new memory just like any other soDimm. I just checked to make sure. I already have two 4GB cards in mine, so I'm happy.
Yes it can. I use a wireless mouse.

Hi D. Le, Standard battery life of this unit is 5 hours. IF watching a movie, it could mean that it could be lower then 5 hours. Thanks, PCrush

Hello Frank, We offer standard and expedited shipping services. Our standard method can take 4-14 days to reach customers while our expedited takes only 3-6 days. Lastly, we only ship within the Continental US. Thanks for your interest!
Hi - what is the max ram and number of ram slots?
almost all laptops rams are upgradeable
Is there a rear view camera input? = yes . no not included. Is it automatic? = yes.
No, the headphones were completely dead when I received them. I plugged them in for a test and they worked. The headphones will work with the audio cable when the power is off. I just tried this out.
Yes
Keyboard is fairly secure. Yes the keyboard iss removeable since it is held in place by magnets Just be careful when folding case into different stances, as I've had keys pop off. Now a few of the keys don't work. I don't think I would reorder this case for its keyboard function. It does give very good protection for the tablet. I've dropped the tablet and no damage. Now the inside leatherette? Is slightly peeling. In general it has held up as I use the tablet so very much.
The notebook was purchased from
Nope
yes http://ark.intel.com/products/72055/Intel-Core-i5-3337U-Processor-3M-Cache-up-to-2_70-GHz
100-240 Volta AUTOADJUSTABLE, the plug is like the plaga they use in EEUU VERY GOOD ULTRABOOK!
Adobe programs are fine. I'm not into gaming, so don't know about that.
Please check with Sony and the Sony Manual. But I believe its, Ctrl + F12
I did not have any problem with motor noise so far. I use zoom a lot since I use my camcorder recording my son's marching band, although recently I started using a separate digital recorder for better audio. I hope this helps.
My research of the two units showed No difference besides the color. Neither of them have wifi included to my knowledge.
On par with other camcorder, has wind cancellation built in a+
I would check the headphone jack to make sure it was not mono or make sure that it is stereo compatible. I'm not an expert only taking a guess
I haven't heard any noise on my videos.
Yes to both questions. A major down fall for this camera is the zoom in. It is absolutely HORRIBLE.
you can use any type of panasonic similar to VW-VBT 190 or 180, but they have 6 lugs, your camera only supports a 5 lug battery, so ya have to cut off one of the middle lugs and it works just fine. BURNSIDE
Recharging is by USB which can be plugged into a computer, your car, or (with a power adapter) commercial power.
About 2'.
There is no stand and no screen cover, the case fits snugly around the iPad! I hope this answers your question :)
The case really doesn't interfere w/ the buttons. I'm extremely pleased with it
not that I've noticed.
The only external control of the camera that I am aware of is through an app on the smart phone. It can hook up via WiFi and a router or directly from the cam to the smart phone. An app called Panasonic Image App is used on the controlling device. I personally have not found a use for this and have had difficulty in getting a consistent connection but that could simply be as a result of my ignorance. From a video and still pic standpoint this is one awesome cam and I am completely happy with it.
Yes. I posted an image of the box contents:
This is a standard size mouse not a small one and the detentions I think are on the website.
Hey Kiss 73 fan, it SHOULD work. It's the exact same cable and exact same port (pin layout). The only reason I say "should work" is because I bought this cable hoping to extend my logitech speaker system, similar to yours, and the diameter of the 9-pin S-video was ever so slightly different and the outer connector would not fit in. I think the sizing incompatibility was just an unfortunate adjustment logitech had decided to make.
Call Lenovo they will be able too help you with that
mine did not have the seal broken. there was no manual. the company website also has no answers. the keyboard works well, at least for me. hope this helped.
Yes it works with galaxy s5. I am using it about six months with s5 without any issues.
works great with my s5 - it is a standard SDHC card - I'm sure it will
It's a typo it has 6GB of RAM.
That I can't help you with. I would like to believe so but considering when they mailed it to me, UPS left it on my door step in the pouring rain so I mailed it back to Amazon. Amazon was great about emailing me te shipping address, giving me a $10 off coupon for my next purchase and free next daily delivery when I found that laptop again to purchase if- but I haven't seen it again at the price I originally paid for it which was $399 and now I just seen it for like $525. Good luck
As long as it's on an iPhone 4s.... It has the old style plug in
recommend you don't buy, not useful. It lying in my store room. Your tablet will easily come out if you bi mistake hold in wrong direction.
From Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LED-backlit_LCD_display): A LED-backlit LCD display is a flat panel display which uses LED backlighting instead of the cold cathode fluorescent (CCFL) backlighting used by most other LCDs.
Yes...I took the Blu-Ray player out of the box last night and the first thing I put in it was a DVD...played great....I don't own any Blu-Ray disks yet, so looking forward to seeing what they look like
According to page 38 of the operating instructions it will. I tried playing an AVI file using a 32GB Kingston USB and could not get any thing to work...Video's, pictures or MP3. Might be that it did not like the USB device I used. I will try another device and post the results. UPDATE, I used a Sandisk 2GB USB Flash drive and the AVI file played just fine...So did the pictures and MP3 files.
Yes, it has an Ethernet port (LAN 100). Built-in Wi-Fi & Ethernet port. For access to streaming content and more. Ethernet port provides simple wired network connection (cable not included).
The sound quality is good but I've always had it hooked up to a Sony surround system. Sounds amazing. I recommend you do that. Great tv
According to the manual With Component in main window the following can be in sub window: TV channel (CABLE/ ANTENNA), VIDEO IN With HDMI in main window the following can be in the sub window: TV channel (CABLE/ ANTENNA), VIDEO IN, COMPONENT IN It looks to me like HDMI can not be in both main and sub window.
The sound quality is good but I've always had it hooked up to a Sony surround system. Sounds amazing. I recommend you do that. Great tv

Yes. I sold them for $60 on Ebay to recoup the cost of the card a little.
They work with anything with a head phone jack and they are great!
They can be separated, but they must be plugged in together to make sound. The cord connecting them is about 2-3 feet long.
On the inside of the battery cover there is a little black switch that you slide to one side as you pull the cover out of place. The switch is spring loaded and allows for the easy removal of the battery cover.

Can't see why not if you have 110 volt ac power or conversion it works on batteries also
Where is this case shipped from?
Yes it works great with the Passport Max. That is what I am using it with.
You have to buy a cord that plugs into your where your headphones would go and then into the aux outlet on the stereo.
exactly, the audio jack is only for audio IN
yes it does
Has it's own rechargeable battery. Doesn't take long to recharge. Nice camera.
Yes
Yep! Has a tripod mount
Only One.
Yes it does
Yes I did. It came in a box with the charger and a cable cord that would connect the camera to a tv or a computer.
The battery comes with the camera and Amazon will recommend a battery for it so you can get a second one. The battery life depends on how many pictures you take or if you use the video setting. It is always wise to have a second fully charged battery with you just in case yours dies when you least want it to happen. Let me also point out while you are asking about the battery that the memory card DOES NOT come with it so make sure you order one when you order the camera.
Yes comes with a rechargeable li-ion camera battery and a plug in battery charger. The only thing you need to provide is a memory card.
You might try friends who have the camera or a local camera shop or eBay where someone may be selling a package.
as a basic answer depends on how much you use it, For me I got the camera for disney and only one day did it die... but that was after 2 days of using it a lot. but it hold a charge for months... which floored me!
DO NOT BUY!!! It was absolute junk!
Unfortunately there are many sellers selling counterfeit copies of these cases on Amazon. If buying on on Amazon you might want to stick with a seller that has a good rating over going by lowest price.
It is possible yes, however only using certain headphones and aux cables that are of the appropriate minimum size. For example, the iPhone headphones set that comes with the phone fits in nicely without the extender, however some of the aftermarket products are too thick at the male part of the cable to fit through the opening of the Mophie case. Hope this helps!
I am not sure about the Otterbox but I got the Mophie juice pack and couldn't be happier. It keeps the battery going all day, Finally.
I have not received it yet.
I used a 1/4-20 machine screw through the hole to mount the plate to a monitor. It works just fine.
This canon battery adapter plate takes Canon BP915/930 series batteries. It will also accept Samsung SB-L110/220, Samsung SB-L160/320, and Sanyo UR-121 batteries.

If you are a professional and have calibration software then I'd say yes, VA panels have excellent color and contrast but still are a notch below IPS. IPS cost 2-3x what VA panels do but if cost is not a factor go that route.
I think it's cute.
Yes
I'm not sure what they're made of, but it's a soft foam material. They are permanently affixed.
Yes
I wouldn't say there is a max age limit. My youngest is 4 and loves them, my oldest is 8 and my niece who is 9 uses them as well. They adjust to fit an adults head too.
Hi Jose, this computer can RUN Arma 3 without any problems. 50+ is attainable but will depend on your game settings.
yes
Hi Richard, the price to upgrade to a Crucial 512GB SSD is $155.00
I don't own a Galaxy 4 tablet; however, the scan disk works well in my Galaxy S 5. Just be sure you get one that does not exceed the limits of your device.
It is working so nice thank you
Lenny - I don't think you can on a used/refurbished item. I think 90 days is it...
You don't mention which Sigma lens you have, but I have a sigma lens that fits my D5200, but make sure that the lens itself has automatic focus as the D5200 doesn't have automatic focus.
Yes. Also at 1080 you can use the following frame rates 60,50,30,25,24.
I have not used the D5200 for sports photos - but did use my D5100 for sports photos and it did fine - so I would think the D5200 would do fine as well.
Yes. Two 2TB drives in one enclosure.
I put the two disc in the same array...6Tb...but mabe is posible.
Yes, definitely. I've downloaded numerous tracks and uploaded routes routes and waypoints from the Garmin app BaseCamp.

Depends on the file system you use, out of the box it can transfer files upto ~64GB
I really don't think so it was a gift and is already wrapped. Sorry
Item(s) will be shipped out normally within 3 business days after the payment is cleared&#65292;including shipping-address confirmation, sourcing, quality control, and packaging.
The Kingston DataTraveler 100 is an older model than is the DataTraveler G3; on a functional level, the newer device has faster access speeds, and on a cosmetic level, the newer device also has an activity indicator light and a keyring.
I'm not sure but these Ben speakers sound good when you place them around the room
Yes, the unit will work off its internal battery,
Traffic Function is the updating of trafficflow on the venues in in the vicinity for possible routes you might traverse I.e. red is extremely slow , and green would indicate good or regular speeds.
It is a continuously-updated feature, but not 100% accurate. The updates rely on what has been reported by state/county DOT sources, which are not 100% accurate. Therefore, sometimes you will find traffic jams from accidents, which may not be reported, or delay notifications on the Garmin which are not actually there (no construction on Sundays, for example). Needless to say, this is a newer technology that compliments your own common sense about traffic conditions.
From my limited experience, Yes!
It sucks
Yes, it is very quick to response.
I have not done it personally. However, the manual says you can preview multiple routes which suggests you can choose your route. If you google "Garmin Nuvi 2577LT manual", you can look at a pdf of the manual. Maybe that will answer your exact question.
sorry, i do not know but i can recommend something that DOES have maps of europe, namely WAYZ, which is an app you can get for any smart phone, and is -- sorry amazon -- a thousand times better than the garmin. it leads you around traffic jams, and has much gentler manners to boot.
2597LMT has the all features, it looks like, selling for $149.99, brand new. The 2557LMT doesn't include BT. I would buy the most cheapest used. As long as it's in very good condition and has all accessories. This is pretty much what I've done and it works for me.
Not realy. Stand is not made for that.
I might be wrong code ..
All vizio remotes work on vizio tvs hope that helps
Yes, if you also purchase a converter. I bought this one. (Loftek HD Fury Pro HDMI to RGB Component converter) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009YP7Y56/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 , it worked fine on my old Mitsubishi rear projection HD TV. But I found it's limitation of web browsing to be an issue and instead purchased the Visio CoStar but paid like $75-80 for it - NOT $299 like one selling now on Amazon.
I placed my on a shelf, but I take that an appropriate stand is one sturdy and strong enough to withstand its weight of 16.5 lbs. Speakers should be at ear listening level, while seated, and out of the way from by-passers to avoid bumping into one of them. You may want to take a look at these websites. http://www.amazon.com/SANUS-Speaker-Stands-Bookshelf-Speakers/dp/B00006JQ5O/ref=pd_sim_e_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=1JG2EH4RR4B68HXSKQT3 - http://www.computeraudiophile.com/f12-headphones-and-speakers/stuck-selecting-desktop-speakers-17435/
Yes; it fit this model keyboard and it was a bit longer than the one that was included originally.
Yes, fits and works great with the 70D.
7. This laptop is great. All depend on what you're using it for. There are not a lot of accessories. The processor is amazing, graphics not too great, but you never have to worry about storage.
Don't remember. I sold it.
I have a Galaxy S4, and with an Otterbox on, I can squeeze it in the XL. So I am confident an iPhone will work too!
This was a bit tricky, because the screen came with adhesive pre-installed, i applied the extra adhesive to the body of the ipad.
Stylus yes....rite in the middle there is a spot for a pen (or stylus) note pad?....yes....but it would be in the spot behind the credit cards slots..that's were I keep my cash.....so it would have to be the rite size note pad.
Definite first generation.
I have it for the RX100- "II". From the looks of it, the body and LCD in the back seem-to-be exactly the same, but I cannot be absolutely sure, as I have not seen or handled the "III" model. My suspicion is that it is exactly the same and would therefore work. The GGS glass is essential IMO to have on any high end camera, whether dSLR or a camera such as the RX100-xyz. Hope this helps.
I have one on my RX100II and I believe they only have one model that fits the RX100 and the RX100II.
According to the Sony website they both have a 3" LCD screen. I can't be sure as I haven't seen both cameras in person together but I can't imagine they opted for a different size screen as they seem to have standardized that screen for a few different models.
Only once. And then it won't work again. And getting it to record in the first place is really hard. There are other, better, products out there. Don't waste your money on this one.
My camera came with the camera, lens, lens cover, battery and charger. I purchased several items separately - a wrist strap (OP/TECH USA CAM Strap), a camera grip (GR-N2100), a good UV filter, a high quality SD card (45 MB/s), spare battery, and a small camera case. Despite what most reviews have said about poor battery life, I have not had a problem. The grip I purchased makes for a huge improvement in comfort when holding the camera - downside is you have to remove the grip to access the battery and SD card.
It works fine with a Nikon 1 V1. The 35mm equivalent is ~ 18-35mm.
No, this lens is for the Nikon 1 series of cameras; J1,2,3 and the V1,2,3. If you are on a budget you will want to buy the Nikon 18-35mm, and if money is not an issue the Nikon 16-35MM for Nikon 810. Hope this helps. :)
There is quite a delay. it does take beautiful pictures and the zoom is fantastic!
Comes with neck strap. I bought the black version of the case Not brown.
Definitely, yes!
Yes
Nope. There is a battery though.
The box contains a wrist strap,a cord to charge your battery while it is in the camera, a usb cable, software CD and user manual. I purchased a separate charger to charge my batteries... so I would not lose time taking photos. I love this camera!
Yes
This is NOT a TTL flash, so no, it won't work as a TTL flash with your a6000.
Don't. Buy. Sucks
no, ultrabooks don't have cd drive.
The cable I am using is about 2 meters and works wonderfully, I can not tell you the limits.
This device is not Bluetooth enabled. It is certainly not the ideal way to connect two devices, but if you have the right outputs and inputs it may be the least expensive way to bridge two devices. It accepts inputs for 3.5mm audio cable (standard output on a phone, tablet, laptop) and has another input for red/white like in an old fashion RCA cable. The outputs include an optical and a coaxial.
yes it works with 220v( from 100v to 240v)
Make sure you are under the music note icon, it is next to the movie icon. I just used mine on Sunday. I had forgotten to scroll over to the note initially so it confused me for a moment, but knew I hadused it before.
Amazon Video is one of the apps. With my Amazon Prime membership I am able to watch 'free with Prime' titles, and rent others for cash (I have not done so).
I don't have it with me right now but it works very well and I'm pleased with the transaction. I'll check it later.
It's supposed to. Concept R isll
This unit has its own USB port which works once it is installed. USB in the center console might not work.
Can't say for sure, the BF-888s has been discontinued could not find battery listing
The charger connects to the desk charger base unit, not to the radio.
Im not sure about it. What I bought doesn't work eather for my uv-5r.
Back. Plug it in before you slide the unit into the dash.
Hello, thank you for your interest in our products. To answer your question, yes, our monitors work with the iPhone 5s. Mobile Monitor Technologies provides the Male-Male HDMI adapter with the purchase of a monitor and you would need to provide the appropriate Apple adapter. If you have any further questions, you can be in touch with us directly at contact@mmt2.com. Again thank you for your interest.
No software is included
You would have to take it to someone that can remove #3 weld
Yes
They are great. Hold same charge as original battery at a lot cheaper price
I don't know for sure. Canon has all kinds of cameras and batteries. Mine is an ELPH510HS. If your batteries look like these, there's a good chance they will work. Gail
Yes, it can.
Yup... they're a really tight fit and hard to press into the slot, but once they click into place the first time, it's easier after that. I bought the same thing, and it came with two 1550 mAh batteries, which are almost double the capacity of the battery that came with the Canon camera. The charger charges as it should and I'm very happy with the setup. Don't use a hammer to get the battery seated, but just push really hard. Regards, Wendall
I sent it back. It did not work. The manual was also poorly written.
yes, it sends email
Yes it comes with a 60 day trial, but you have to make sure you register it and download it.
it's just an output, but its's nice because you can watch netflix or something on your laptop, on your TV
The steering wheel works partial no all funtion, sync does not work
The answer is yes. There are several models of the T100TA comprised of different features. This unit happens to be an older model in 32GB SSD. I have owned both the older version and the new version with 64 GB drive. The EVEcase fit on both.
Hi Dan, I think I answered this question elsewhere, but the laptop should support 16GB. I have the earlier version of this laptop (V5-171-6422) and upgraded it to 16GB with no issues. The Intel CPU specification declares support up to 32GB, but 16GB is the maximum for this device since there are only two memory slots. If there is a limitation of 8GB, it's either the OS (I'm running Linux), marketing, or deliberate neutering of the hardware (not sure why). --JT Review
All you need is a monitor. The keyboard, mouse, and wireless adapter are included with the computer.
Hi Corey, 450 watts is the minimum requirement for an Nvidia 660 Video Card and it uses two 6-pin connectors. You can use the power supply on this system with an adapter to make it work (it only has one 6 pin connector) and that would fulfill the MINIMUM requirements of the video card. Ideally though, you would prefer to use a higher watt power supply with at least another additional rail for the video card.
I have that set up exactly, and it works well. Once in a while it will block a wanted call, but I find that if I call them back, the next time works fine. I can only guess at the cause. I've got the blocker on the phone at the farthest point from the modem, and it works.
NO!
Yes. Makes it so the kids can't call numbers you don't want them calling, if there are numbers you don't want them calling.
Pwr+ Rapid Charger charges HD Fire in under 2 hours. Don't have HDX so can't answer that one.
I am using a 80GB SSD and a 500GB HDD and it works great.
I couldn't connect to mac so I actually returned it.
Yes, it fits fine.
If your car requires a standard bulb (H4 for high and low beam in one bulb for example) then yes they should work.
Side
Would say its 64 it's a good PC no problem s and. It's quick and easy
Hi, It is an Intel Graphics Media Accelerator HD, DDR3 SDRAM, shared. Thanks, PCrush
No, there's none.
For the price it's the best you can get in my opinion.
Its black and blends nicley into the bottom of the screen. I could only tell it was there when i run my fingers across it.
Yes
Any of them will work, you have to decide if you want less noise (40) or only a little less noise (50); and less distance reduction (L/0.2mm) or more distance reduction (R/0.4mm).
i haven't measured it, but note that the travel reduction is NOT equivalent to the toroidal diameter; only the inside edge of the o-ring makes contact with the stem. (and anyway, the o-ring isn't even 2mm thick, so a 2mm reduction is totally impossible.)
Its isn't supported
It may not be the issue of HDMI to DVI cable. Can you check if the mini PC works for HDMI enabled TV or LCD monitor.
We bought this for our camper. We had a straight post mount coming off of our counter. I connected that bracket to the existing mount. Our tv is a 32 inch plasma, not sure of the exact weight. It seems very sturdy heavy metal construction. It does a great job.
Sorry I also have the uds655.
With or without an additional partition, you can use it for external storage via USB.
That, I do not know.
I have had the same problem but do not know why
Yes. I bought this model specifically because I didn't want to overpay for additional memory. I added this, right from Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LDLV6S/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1; and it works fine. I think 8GB is the max, but you should confirm that. I did not pay attention to that because the laptop was for my grandson.
2.54 mm BSC between pins. It matches standard american female header connectors
I have not tested yet..sorry
No, this is for the iPod NANO.
Yes it does.
I've had so many problems w/ this tablet I don't know where to begin. I would highly recommend NOT getting this tablet until they have worked out allot of the problems.
As shipped this machine has a DVD drive that will play a CD but not record one.
The Audio-Technica ATHM50RED has a coiled cable.
Subtle differences. The M50xbl has 3 detachable cables and of course has a different color scheme. Personally, I'd go with the M50xBL if the detachable cables are worth it to you. Otherwise, I'd save some money and go for the ATHM50RD because they both sound exactly the same.
Yes, it does. There is a stand on the back of the case. Check the second photo to the last. It shows the stand on the back of the case.
With just the iPad mini inside, it measures 14/16 of an inch. When you add in the keypad, it measures 1 and 2/16 inches closed. You don't get a notepad and I haven't put one in but I imagine you could add another 3/16 of an inch. P.S. I don't use the keypad as much as i thought I would.
Plastic
We haven't had up yet but it looks as though any other USB cord for anything except iPhone (like droid charger cord) would work
Yes
One
Compatible with a Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone; "Holder" that's included ;it CAN hold a Galaxy S2 smartphone!
yes
Have never washed it yet. I would think a damp cloth?
I detach my keyboard all the time all the keyboard is it is a Bluetooth keyboard in the testicle the only thing that keeps them together is like magnetic yeah
Yes it is
To my Knowledge No. There are talks about the new 4k players they are developing using XBMC as their front end interface.
I use the 52mm and it works well on my RX100ii.
yes.. but don't put so heavy things on it.. I put raynox 6600 and it drops!
As long the adapter runs on 50/60 cycles , and puts out 120vac 60 cycles - European 220 is 50 cycles.
This mouse is small compared to the average. It does not feel uncomfortable and does not cause any hand/wrist pain so far but it is a small one, although I've seen smaller ones.
It is for certain smooth and silent.
No
man made material
It will only fit the ipad mini.
Usb 3.0 is the same for pc's and mac's. If you have a 3.0 port it will work. The provided cable is short, 2 feet maybe. I bought this to extend it. http://www.cablewholesale.com/products/usb-firewire/usb-3.0-cables/product-10u3-02110e.php This really is a good hub for the money, it's well built, and it's powered even when the computer is off so it charges your devices when the computer is powered down.
Depends on what devise you have plugged in. A usb stick should work without the power cable, external drives would not.
Yes mine is mounted as close to the ceiling as possible, just a few inches away. You use keystone to adjust the throw. Just make sure to mount the LENS exactly in the middle of where you want the picture. My last one the lens was in the middle with this one the lens is on the side so now the picture is skewed a couple of millimeters. Only noticeable to me, but still noticeable.
This version uses all AAA, for both the remote receiver and the control.
16GB DDR3 1600
This unit includes a wired USB mouse and keyboard.
That's up to your preference, but there are multiple hdmi ports in the back which can be used to plug in both your computer and your cable/satellite/etc. You'll be able to use one of the touch buttons on the bottom right of the monitor in order to swap between inputs.
I lost all interest in this monitor when I learned that it was only 1920x1080
This card can only be used in devices compatible with SDHC (Secure Digital High Capacity) cards. Some devices that use SD (standard capacity) cards can also take SDHC cards. However, SDHC cards are not the same size as MicroSD cards, so those will not be interchangeable.
No way, very lite weight , I love it......
If it the same size as a Galaxy Tab 2, yes, it would fit.
No way, very lite weight , I love it......
If it the same size as a Galaxy Tab 2, yes, it would fit.
I don't believe you can, this KVM is manual and it does not have the ability to control more than two (2) devices an any time.
If it the same size as a Galaxy Tab 2, yes, it would fit.
Nah just yank on it. It will pop out.
Absolutely not, and you won't like how tight it is inside.
Every 2min or every 5min the video breaks into another file. No real difference.
Technical support via Intuit's website is included. However, if you want to speak to someone who really knows what they are talking about I believe there is an annual fee. However, if you are a new customer and this is the first time you are using QuickBooks they used to provide technical support for the first 30 days for free.
The center mounting bracket does pivot on the post... However this is essentially a two monitor mount. In order to get the third monitor on, the two outside monitors would have to be nearly flush with the desk. I have a 26" and a 27" monitor and have virtually no room for the third without putting the outside monitors flush with the desk. Now, with that said, I am extremely pleased with the quality of the mount, I just don't see it as ideal for 3 monitors unless they are small monitors.
I think as long as your dvd system works with wireless headsets, they'll work. I have a Ford Freestar, and they work perfectly. I have a friend who has a Volkswagen Routan and they work in her van, too.
Transciever, QHM-05 DTMF Microphine, QMB-01 Mobile Mounting Bracket, QPL-01 DC Power Cable, User Manual. If ordered from Advanced Specialties Inc. you also get: CP52 Head extension cable (3m)/Cloning Cable, PC51 usb Programming Cable.
Nope! It has hardline wires coming out of it and no ports to accept wires.
Yes. That's all. This also comes in plain OEM packaging.
As long as your motherboard has an available PCI Express slot (x1 x4 x8 x16) available this card should work just fine.
No I'm sorry unfortunately there isn't
It fits perfectly with my toshiba encore 8" (Item Dimensions L x W x H - 8.40 x 0.43 x 5.40 inches) that is a quite big 8" tablet. Galaxy tab 4 8" is smaller (Item Dimensions L x W x H - 8.26 x 0.31 x 4.87 inches)
I guess it depends on the intent. I use this monitor for work and listen to sports radio. The sound is plenty loud enough and clean. If you're watching movies then yea, it's not going to be the best but for a monitor they do the job just fine. If your watching YouTube or just wanting sound, not bad IMO.
No. This does not have VESA mounts. it will have to remain on the stand.
Yes it will.
I have not tested the metrics of how much weight the float will hold up, however depending on the density of your PVC pole it may float itself. I'd test it in a controlled environment before trusting any water rig, but you could cap the ends of the pole trapping air in the pole causing it to be more buoyant.
I think it's better than the GoPro one due to it's attachment methods being velcro (so it can be removed) and it has a hole for a leash or tether so you can really back yourself up!
Yes
Should work fine as long as you have u.s.b ports.
Excellent! Very comfortable on the ears for long periods of time. Additionally, they cancel out noise which is helpful when working in any setting/area.
Yes. It is the way i use mine.
M.D., contact the company or ask an electrician. I leave my batteries in...so they can charge if the electric goes off...I live in Florida, we have lots of electrical storms.
Will this play CDs? YES and the sound quality is excellent.
Not sure on the compatibility I believe it works as long as it's LGA 1155. The case I'm using is the nzxt h440 and its plenty spacious but you can get a micro atx case and from nzxt if you want something smaller.
Yes it does. Use u it all the time. Great to only carry one cable and plug for charging phone with micro USB and Note 10.1 only by adding this adapter.
I'm not sure about the SMS wireless the reviews I've seen say they have good sound quality but range and battery life need work but if I chose to go wireless I would go sennhiser there wireless quality and audio is the the best
Amazon sales may or may not be from authorized dealers, and that may change from day to day, so you need to make sure yourself. You can buy this headphone from the Apple store online, but if you buy from someone else for a reduced price, you may risk getting a fake. Always buy from an authorized dealer at the dealer's price. You can find out on the Amazon site whether a dealer is authorized.
One size. It means it will fit anyone's head. I have a rather large head and so I was kind of worried when I bought these, but they are the most comfortable headphones I have ever owned.
It does allow for both voltages
Short answer, No. Long answer, I guess you could, sort of, maybe connect it to a device that presents itself as a HID device and this guy feeds it the data. This module can't even plug into a PC without some other device adapting its' output to a suitable format. For example a USB to COM port dongle.
mine is hooked to an amplifier to use as a tuner and surround sound which operates 5 speakers, so I guess if it were hooked up like that you could...hope this helps
I have the samsung galaxy 2 tablet, but I'm very sure it would, easy to sync to your device, its a great unit... stsys charged a very long time, if anyone has Bluetooth capabilities, then this keypad will work, several feet away, never misses a beat.....I love mine
This ring light does not come with the diffusion cloth.
that is the correct part for the ipad 2 that I was working on but I do not know how many version there are; I only found out after I took it apart and compare to what was available on the on-line stores.
that hkc tablet was not good. I bought it for my son's birthday. less than a month is broken. I call back for an exchange, they refused for an exchange or a refund
No it don't
I don't know
I really don't know as I am not familiar with the game of minecraft.------Mac
Windows & what? I don't know what you mean, sorry:)
Yes time is displayed while listening. contrast is not great but has not been a problem in the shower
No wi fi on this TV
YES, it installed Google play so you can download wide variety Appa
No, it has a mini USB port w/ a cable to transfer data (e.g. music, video, photos and other files).
This tablet includes Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR standard.
Yes, this camera loops the video recording so that if the memory card is full, the oldest video is deleted and overwritten. I like that it saves the video in 2-minute segments (although there might be an option to make it longer than that). Larger video segments take longer to download or open in a video editor. Also, if something happens and you want to prevent that 2-minute segment from being deleted, there is a 'lock' button which will prevent that segment from being deleted.
Yes, it will work.
It's got a switch to draw from one or the other. I've run it on NiMH only w/o AA and it works fine. I assume the reverse is true.
hello friend, the link for lcd http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CPIUOV0 and touch screen http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BJ5O9MA you can order them directly. we will test them well before shipping.any question, please let us know.
Yes but they will fall off at times if u bump them or rub against something
No
Yes
8gb I believe
This is only good in the US. Thanks for asking.
If your not using a cable box.
The faceplate is removeable, but it doesn't include a case for the detachable faceplate.
I was told that the placement of the antenna within the tablet makes a huge difference in reception. If its buried in the middle somewhere, reception could be poir. I returned mine. Piece of junk.
sorry, i don't need print...
yes, you can download all sorts of apps. It doesn't work very well for some of the high tech ones, but most standard ones it works just fine. You can delete them if they don't work. I have put in extra storage that helps.
We are using the collar on our standard poodle. It is working well on his medium curl, inch length hair. My sister uses the collar for her large male German Shepard who has thick, longish hair. All of us have been satisfied with the product and haven't had a problem due to hair type. I'd investigate the return policy for peace of mind.
With the Akita's thick fur, I'd recommend the Dogtra YS-500. Unless you plan to shave the underneath of his neck, the garmin bark limiter won't work reliably.
I have an 11.6" folder that accommodates the tablet and keyboard. The dock gets left at home. If you wish to carry the dock, I suggest something larger than 11.6". I do carry a tiny Targus 4-port USB hub when I travel. That is enough to take care of expansion issues.

The ability to use more than one finger to accomplish a task. For example, using two fingers to "squeeze" an image to zoom out. Some games will use more than two fingers to accomplish multiple tasks at once.
Hi Barbra, If you have wifi you really won't need a data plan but, you can add one. And, also gps.
No problems with my unit. I prefer the Android OS to Amazon for both online use and as a reader. Battery life not great. Overall, I'm satisfied, especially at this price point.
No, it does not. It has D-sub and DVI only. You can get a DVI to HDMI adapter cable if you need it, but you'll be sacrificing quality from a true HDMI. (http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-HDMI-DVI-Adapter-Cable/dp/B001TH7T2U/ref=pd_bxgy_pc_text_y)
I don't have an Air, but it works on our iPad and iPad mini.
Not sure but it works
Yes
The speakers are wired and it has an external antenna. This was no problem for me. I consider this a great purchase with above average sound quality
Yes, this unit comes with a remote. The cd eject button is on the unit, not on remote. Only had it since Christmas, sounds good. More features than my previous Bose unit.
Yes
It has big sound for a small unit. Very clear no static.
audio piece is 7" wide x 91/2" deep - speakers are 5"x9 1/2" ea. The 3 pieces sit together very nicely but speakers are not attached.
Yes. It will play MP3s directly from a USB stick.
one CD can be inserted at a time...
No, they don't. These are poorly built and I would not purchase them again.
No
No rechargeable battery, must be plugged in to the car in order to watch the movie.
sorry, we do not offer any international warranty options.
Height 2 and 1/4 in - length without battery 4 and 1/2 in - with extra battery 5 and a 1/2 in. - width with strap about 3 in - Very compact fit in the palm of your hand well.
Yes
The B stands for the color which is black. You may choose any color that we have in stock.
I love my case - it fits perfectly and the angle is great for reading. Not steep at all - I only use mine in the upright position so cannot speak for the angle that looks flat. I would buy this case again, it asked.
I haven't seen any other color options in person. I have bought black and a small kindle fire case which does a decent job on holding the tablet as well. The leather case (Tabsuit) doesn't protect against drops!
I don't see why it wouldn't, however, it has "holes" or cutouts for volume & power buttons, etc. that may not match another tablet.
Sorry, I have no idea...
No, I don't ever have to remove it. It has all the built in openings for the charger, power, and volume button.
Yes it does and I really like it. fits and works well.
Yes, it does!!! it comes from yellow to red line.....
Power was about 5' and video was about 20'.
Yes, it will work with D5100, but doesn't support TTL.
EXM is manual, EXT is a TTL ring flash.
I use this monitor with my MacBook Pro. I had to buy a Thunderbolt/mini-display to HDMI adapter (or Thunderbolt to DVI, or Thunderbolt to VGA) but the expense was minimal and well worth it.
No
Mine can definitely tilt. It sounds like yours is either defective or the hinge is just really tight! (some pictures for proof: http://imgur.com/a/MAN8L )
power supply and power cord, DVI cord, VGA cord. No HDMI cord.
yes
18.30 inches
I don't notice any effect from the backlight bleeding, in the daytime or night. I'm very pleased with all aspects of this monitor.
Yes it does Cathy, and it works very well. I can drop it in my bag and go.
Samsung phones don't tend to be picky about their micro sd cards so it shouldn't be an issue. I don't know about the S5 but this card works perfectly in my S4 and Tab 3.
Yes, it has a one year "limited" manufacturer's warranty, which is typical for electronics. However, because of the cost of the headset I would buy the extended warranty, if available. I purchased my headset at Best Buy and paid an additional 89 bucks (?) I think for 2 more years of warranty over the standard warranty.
Hope i'm not too late for your question. You actually need an adapter, check http://www.turtlebeach.com/console-compatibility and click on the model.
Yes! there is a 30 day trail; then you have to purchase your own.
It's 10mm long by 7mm wide.
Hey, I am so sorry, but I am unable to answer your question, because I do not know the configuration processes. However, you can ask am amazon representative, they are always readily available to answer your questions.
yes, but when you're programming them, best to only have 1 plugged in at a time. I've used 2 switches simultaneously under Linux.
I own both. This is sharper and faster to focus than the 70-300. With either lens, "faster" is not a consideration. Both lenses are sharpest at f8 and require plenty of bright light. BTW, the lens hood from the 70-300 works on this version for those wondering...
It has 6 USB ports. Just use any keyboard with a USB interface.
The large opening is 7 1/8" x 5 3/4". The foam is 1 1/4" deep. My foam is not customizable. The cutouts are fixed.
Thank you for contacting us. At this time we can only guarantee delivery by the 10th if you place your order today and select one-day shipping at checkout.
8.5 inches including the little metal tab that you screw down onto the case
Don't really know haven't owned one but I can tell you that it has run just about every game at 1080p, 60fps and very high to ultra settings. I highly recommend this card.
No it will not. I have couple of L702X, and it does not work in them. The card itself is wonderful, though. I upgraded all of my DELL M4700 with these cards (6 in all) and could not be happier!
I got total 223.57GB shows on windows 7 disk manager. For reference, my Samsung MZ-7TD250BW 840 bought 2 years back shows 232.88GB.
If it contains an internal or external mSATA slot, then I suspect that it will work. Do a google search and you can find someone who was able to disassemble a V5-573P to install a mSATA SSD (although a different brand).
no. it uses m.2 format
I used that cable on my old mac and a brand new retina, and was working ok until yet. ;)
Nope. This is a Thunderbolt cable on both ends.
Yes, This is the stock Apple cable. You will get full functionality ... including cloning.
This pole is specific to the GoPro camera mounts. A standard mount for another camera would not work without having the GoPro Camera Tripod Adapter Mount GTRA30. If you had the mount in addition to the stick, any camera would attach just fine.
Hmmm... mine doesn't extend, so there's no moving parts to leak. I've taken it scuba diving several times and never had a problem with leaks anywhere. The best part of it is that it floats. If the cord accidentally slips from my wrist, it will float up to the surface. I use a cable tether for the GoPro just to be sure it stays attached. It's never detached, but I want to be sure!
No, it can only be used with a cell phone. It has been a very helpful recording device. I love it.
I would not recommend this device. As far as I can tell, and I tried numerous times, bluetooth recording was not available. And recording otherwise has not been satisfactory.
Not foldable, unfortunately. The ear pieces do, however, turn to make them more flat if that is needed.
You have to purchase it separately.
supposed to be 1561...thats mine i hope it works for you
We have just placed an inquiry with the manufacturer, and I'm sure we'll receive a quick reply. The description is provided by the manufacturer, though as a vendor for this product, we ourselves should have caught the disparity earlier. We'll post the manufacturer's reply as soon as we receive it. [Our hunch is that the last bullet provided to us is what is incorrect.] We're very sorry for the inconvenience! Honfleur Home, LLC
No glass protection at all. Unless you count the small raised space between the lip and glass.
No it doesn't stand up
Yes I bought it for my sons iPad mini
It only protect the back and sides of the iPad, but the rubberized corners helps to protect the front if dropped. It does not come with a screen protector. It's very sturdy and I am pleased with it overall.
Unfortunately the answer to both questions is No
YES!
Jumbo frames are just on, technically there's no way to turn them off
Shared
There are no threads on the end of the lens, it's not designed for a screw on filter. Plus it retracts fully into the body when you turn the camera off, and the lens cap snaps to the edges of the outer ring to cover the lens. There may be some sort of filter arrangement that would work with the lens extended, but I don't know how well.
It does have continuous shooting, just hold down the shutter release. It also has a burst mode, high and low, which is faster. It's a small camera and so is the buffer. Trying it with 12 meg JPEGs the buffer filled up fairly quickly but it did process all of them, 30 frames, in about 15-16 secs. A lot better than my K-5 IIs but I don't use continuous shooting very often. The MX-1 also does some nice video also.
One.
The camera came with a 8 GB TOPRAM SD HC. I haven't tried to use any other card in it.
Yes it does. I use it for all the pictures of the details of jewelry and watch movements for my e-bay listings.
I don't understand the question.
Camera, wall charger, USB cord, wrist strap, and information are included in the box. You'll need to purchase SD cards and a case separately. I LOVE my camera.
EXR auto mode detects it.
no
NP-50A came with my camera.
The factory claims it will work with a SanDisk 64GB and 128GB card, class 10 or faster. Here is the link: http://www.fujifilm.com/support/digital_cameras/compatibility/
The instructions that are packed in with it say its only compatible with 1.3
This is my second fuji.The first one lasted about 10 years. Best pictures I've ever taken! I love this camera! Good luck in your decision!
If you are OK with the weight of such cameras then yes it has good control over shutter speed and it captures moments fast. I would suggest for small cameras if you want it for adventures.. These size cameras are useful for nature photography
Unfortunately no. The mSata and Mini PCIE are similar but of different technologies. Mini PCIE : http://www.supertalent.com/products/ssd_detail.php?type=Half%20mini%202%20PCIe mSata: http://www.supertalent.com/products/ssd_category_detail.php?type=mSATA mSata can be configured on some Mini PCIE slots but not on the Dell Mini 9. Sorry for the bad news but keep trying and look around. I hope you find a Mini PCIE for your DELL Mini 9!
If you can get your toddler to be still it's great. Unfortunately for my toddlers who are constantly on the go, I get a lot of blurry pictures.
At the highest resolution the lag time is about 2-4secs. On the lower settings there is almost no lag, and still decent pics.
This camera does not have a touch-screen
This processor has Ivy Bridge generation Intel HD graphics.
Yes, this chip is fast enough to meet the recommended requirements for minecraft.
Yes it does. You will ser the exactly the same thing in four tvs connected on this device...
It says OIS on the lens. Not OIS II
China,
There is no strap. The small one is for the pen holder.
Yes Perfect fit with correctly located cut outs for speakers and all connectors
Good Morning, The item should have come with the USB wire in which you could plug it in to. Thank you.
I am not sure. I can say that it was perfect for my MacBook Retina (13") 2013.
I don't think it will fit, because I was reading one of the other questions that have been answered for this product, and they say that the bought one fore their macbook pro 13, but it didn't fit.
Very wide. Yes, it can fit A big tablet.
Good Morning, I apologize but our fitting guides don't show the 2014 so you would need to speak with a professional installer. Thank you.
on the Retail Box it says, "Made in Korea"
I'm not to sure with the kia's but you can check the measurements and check your vehicles measurements. If anything they might have to shave or cut it to fit. Sorry if this didn't help to much.
It comes with stock thermal compound on it, but I purchased my own.
I think the ethernet cuts out when you plug in the usb, so don't think they both work together.
You might want to check in their website http://www.axxessinterface.com/steering_wheel_control_new.aspx I don't know the firmware you device came with
No
Yes, see http://www.msimobile.com/level3_productpage.aspx?cid=7&id=387 Windows 8 * Intel Core i5 Processor * 11.6" IPS Full HD Touch Screen (16:9; 1920 x 1080) * Built-in Chicklet Keyboard * 128GB SSD (mSATA 3) * USB 3.0 x 2; Mini-HDMI 1.4 x 1 * 8GB DDR3 1600MHz System Memory * THX TruStudio PRO * Built-in 720p HD Webcam * Jackson Peak 802.11 b/g/n WLAN * Giga LAN 10/100/1000 $1199
4-5hour without playing game
128 solid state drive
Yes. no problem to use a stylus in S20. Personally I never use OneNote before and we will consult MSI Tech Support.
Yup. The right side is longer than the left side by by about 13 inches it is around 18.5 inches from where the two sides split.
It fits my daughters iPad 4. So yes - it should be good for iPad2. Also - the pink color is darker than what is pictured online. (its not salmon colored) She likes it though.
Hi, The belt doesn't open but there is a button under the belt which will open. You can split the case into. One piece is like regular case and other is like screen cover. Girls will love this case.
Throw it in the garbage. This USB stick killed one of my hard rives. The company sent me 2 instead of one. I threw both in the trash! No kidding around it harmed my computer. This is a huge ripoff!
I am not a tech guy. But, my experience with this drive is simple: it does not work. It looks like it saved the files but then the files are not there.
From my testing on 2 units these are really 8GB faked to read as 256GB. Formating does not matter, these are FRAUDS!
It does off my antenna. I am in the Pittsburgh market and I get all of the local networks substations like MeTV and the like. Hope this answer helps.
All recordings are saved on the Hopper's hard drive.
Looks like the MR230B includes a 3.5mm to dual RCA cable as well as the other cables. Bluetooth version specs the same. http://www.augustint.com/products/bluetooth_music_receivers.htm
The battery lasts around 3-4 hours fully charged. I found it very useful to keep it plugged in while using it at home.
Yes it will
It will do better than the standard headphone out on your computer or smartphone but I don't think it's designed to drive high impedance headphones. Having said that, I have no actual experience.
Moved around a few times and DR360 broke at base of arm. Not happy with durability.
Don't know about a venue 8, but it's a really sturdy mount that will definitely hold a small tablet, I love it
Yes it should. They both have a 3.2" RFT-LCD. The only difference is that the 750 has a "tilting" LCD. View this link: Photographylife.com/nikon-d750-vs-d610
Yes in retail pkg
Yes! I use the sleep machine app. And the alarm sounds over that. Hope this helps
Yes but you don't need to as the battery last's a long time
I don't own this but I own the JLab "The Crasher" and the case is identical to the picture shown here. One of them is probably a rip-off of the other. Based on the good reviews on both this SimplyVibe and The Crasher, I'd go with the cheaper of the two which is this one.
Your radio needs to have the xm radio band. Is piggybacks that function.
Yes it will. Thanks
Mine only came with a USB charger. To wall charge I hear you can use an Apple converter, so hope that works.
Upper left button, hold down until screen says "shut down, no". Use bottom right button to change to yes. Use left bottom button (press lightly) and it should shut down. It is confusing at first. You can use the bottom left button to change back and forth from watch during a round too. Hope that helps :)
I actually don't even have Windows 8 on it anymore. One day it randomly crashed, then wouldn't let me play any videos. Then after that it stops letting me connect to wifi at all. Then it pretty much wouldn't let me load anything. I formatted my drive completely, reinstalled Windows 8 and it was still doing it. I ended up just putting Ubuntu on it.
No optical drive, just usb
Yes it does have a backlit keyboard
Yes, the keyboard can be backlit in blue. You can also adjust the brightness of the keyboard using the F9 and F10 keys.
I use vMeyeCloud app on Android to connect to my 8ch DVR. The quality of the app and the service is quite low, but it works sometimes.
You can, but their is no need. Connect the optical cable directly from the sound bar to the tv and the sound from your gaming system will play out of the sound bar assuming your gaming system is connected to the tv via a hdmi cable.
Yes TV comes with an app available on android or iPhone. Allows much more than that to
Yes, i tested both and the plextor is the best ...
yes, but they only lasted a few months and then the wires at the phone plug end wore out and now the sound cuts in and out. I did like them until that happened.
not sure. this is my first product from Asus and it fits perfectly on my Asus X551 notebook
I have the s56c series. They are awesome
I have been using it with the Nexus 7 bought July 2013 and it works perfectly. It makes a great package and protective case. My only complaint is that there is no place to keep a stylus which I also like to use at the same time so as to keep fingers off the glass. Otherwise, completely satisfied.
The 330 has several issues. I had a battery problem. Check with Canon. They replaced my 330 with a 340.
Yes I just take SD card out and use a sd card reader [plugs in USB slot on computer] and I use a Program called Picasa Or [free on the net a google program] you can just use USB and remove rubber cover on the end of camera and plug a small to reg size cord in and hook to usb on computer. Great little camera Ronnie
I'm pretty sure it's just a digital camera. So no it can't send pictures through the internet. If you download the photos to your computer, then you can attach them to an email.
No, it's very odd this does not come with the USB cable.
Yes.
Never tried it with a tripod but there is a spot for you to screw it onto a tripod.
Much better than our previous camera (a Canon AS 3000 something-or-orther) that wasn't HD quality. With a large memory card, you shouldn't be disappointed. We do the majority of filming outside and have been extremely happy with the picture and sound.
Btr nb11L lithium ion
Little square flat battery. Cannon Battery Pack NB-11L.
I've never timed it, but I went for an extended horseback ride with friends, shooting video every few minutes, for sometimes a few minutes at a time, and never ran down the battery. Did probably a dozen little vids, and still pics, too. I've never run out of battery, but after I've used the camera quite a bit, I put it in the nifty wall charger, so that I don't get out there and find a dead battery. Hate that! Love my camera!
Only if the micro SDHC comes with the SD adapter. I don't think it takes micro SDHC by itself.
SanDisk Ultra 16GBSDHC Class 10 Flash MEMORY 30mb/S
It has a setting for manual or auto-focus on the side. I love the camera and kit. Great value!
If you are using a hdmi cable or component cables then you would get your sound when you plug it into you TV no receiver needed
Unfortunately I had to hard wire my stuff. Not the biggest problem but I don't know if it'll wirelessly do it
yes mine came with a harness
4x50 peak, 4x22W RMS
I was using this radio as a radio only , I sold car with this radio and I don't know more . FM is not very strong however .
Yes it does but this isn't your best bang for your buck.
Hi, this is to replace the factory installed. Thanks
I suppose you could... As long as the covering allowed sound to travel thru... Problem is there is an infra red remote signal receiver on the unit. It can install within about 3/4 of an inch below the tv.
Our installer reported that the sound bar is powerful at volume, therefore a solid mount is recommend .. Besides ,, what's $40.00 after $600.00, just do it right the first time, had mine installed with three play 5's, insane TV room with zero issues 9 months later, SONOS ROCKS
Don't be fooled. A DP2M and a DP3M ordered from this source on 3/29/14 were both gray market imports - NO USA WARRANTY. Amazon was very sorry and was going to "investigate" but there are still answers here that tell potential buyers that these have USA warranties. Amazon took them back but what a hassle!
Nope just the regular pin cable monitor connection.
11.25 inches without a stand...13 7/8 inches with the stand.
No
Yes
It has a universal power supply, you may have to provide your country specific power cord however.
No it is not. If what you are really asking is, "Is the box quiet?", I can say that there is a definite light hum while the box is on. I have two of these in my living room (to store my movies) and I only hear them at night after I have turned the multimedia stuff off before going to bed. In my opinion these are quiet boxes. After all each box holds up to four disk drives.
Absolutely. It works really great. I would highly recommend it. I would purchase it again.
It is small enough to fit under a pillow
4 hours
That I don't know but you can look up the specifications of each and see if it fits on it.
It will only work with the newer apple iPods, IPhones, and iPads or if your iPod has Bluetooth. It has the newer smaller lightening connector unlike the older iPods and iPhones that use the 30 pin plugs.
Yeah, it works great with it.
Not the screen. The sides and the back only.
No they do not. It's a good solid case
No it does not. Only fits 2014 Mazda 6 USA model.
If your 1.3 came with Ortofon 2m red as mine, then get the Ortofon 2m red NEEDLE only. If the damage is extensive, then the whole cartridge would need to be replaced.
For games that require you to react fast to events, definitely not.
You would have to get a different adaptor. I hope that helps.
i have this camera does anyone know how to make this work with my i phone.please email me @ petkey2@netzero.com

Will dis fit my 2003 Toyota Sequoia
I am pretty sure 90% yes if you have to work in detail just to little bit
You can change the settings to have it start playing the movie where you left off when you start your car.
SLB-10A Li-ion. This is a good kit for the money: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006FJU4TW/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
The unit supports A2DP, available on all but the oldest iPhone. You can stream any audio, including voice navigation, siri, music, etc. You can also make phone calls and speak to siri through the unit. Find your iPhone device here: http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3647
No it does not. There is no port for it.
Im not sure.. Amazon has an option where you can check if the device you buy fit in your car...
Yes. It's a good radio. Bluetooth for hands free and a USB to charge phone. I bought one for my son's car and it works great.
So far, the answer for me has been yes. I'm not sure just how many you can save in there (I think it automatically saves after you put it in the first time), but so far, I've got 3 in there and they appear in the drop down list every time I go to email a photo.
It depends on the setting and whether your constantly using the flash.
It's been a while since I used mine but I think it did have that option under the set up menu
This unit does not have a GPS or maps.
Manual state's 350
Yes it is easy to remove the unit bu unplugging wires on back of unit. The wiring to the transducers and battery stay in the boat. I use in kayak and mounted the unit on a base I can remove and put in car when not in use.
The price of MaaxTVlN4000 is highhowever I am not paying monthly fees or any other kind of fees.
Yes, it can. It sits straight up, not at an angle (no tilt or slant).
No. I accidentally bought it for kindle keyboard and the case is too small.
Hi David, For best quality, it is mostly good indoor. Thanks, PCrush
no they are not waterproof, no idea on any brand since these are electronic units. I cannot even recommend one.
Approx 11.25" by 7".
It will work. You can have the lens attached to the camera and it's an easy in and out.
Yes this should fit on them mother boards and yes it works usb 3
I did too. I just finally took them off!
No, the rechargeable battery inside is not replaceable. I use mine almost every day for over 8 months without any change in battery life. If you're worried about the battery not being able to hold a charge in a few years, then you may want to contact the manufacture to see if they offer a battery replacement service.
Absolutely, I use it while in my hot tub all the time.
I don't think so but it's lasted longer than any other rechargeable battery player I've owned. I'm using it right now and continue to use and love it often. Santa brought for my 10 year old and I pretty much took it over. Listening to Jethro Tull with it and it sounds amazing.
Pentax provides that answer on a by each instance basis, as reviewed by their service department. That said " you pays you money and you makes your choice" I don't expect to get mine any more exposed then to a sudden rain storm or being out in one. I think most people would be better served with a care full study of the alternatives , if you get my drift.
I don't have the WG-3 GPS Green. I have a WG-3 Orange, no GPS.
A little thicker than other cameras but took it on a cruise and was in my pocket on several islands with no issues
did not purchase that model do not have an answer
No. Your device will have to be out of its case.
From the Celestron web site: "The 32 mm and 42 mm versions of the Nature DX binocular series feature built-in threads that allow the binocular to be attached to a tripod using a binocular tripod adapter. These threads can be accessed by unscrewing the logo plate found on the front of the hinge"
The face is not removable.
Most likely will need to buy an adaptor. I had to buy one for my 2007 Ford
Yes. It fits but it is tight, not room for the hood or other gear.
To configure the device (setup time and date stamp, use the various recording modes and adjust the recording resolution) you will need to use the Z12 software which only works on the PC. Once it is configured though, you can view the videos on any computer.
I do not recommend anyone to buy. It just trouble
Yes
yes
Video capabilities is good.......good sound and ease of use!!!
Nope, honestly the quality sucks.
It was not compatible with my printer. I have an HP 3n1 and they would not work together sorry.
The one I purchased for my niece did not and would not stay connected to the internet. I ended up sending it back and purchasing a better tablet that did not require a lot of messing around with setting and had access to google play. It was not worth the savings in my opinion for an item that did not use mainstream apps or App Store.
Have you tried the reset button? It's a little pin hole on the bottom. Also as weird as it may sound I've removed and replaced the SD card when having various issues with mine including not taking a charge or coming on and things worked fine after that. Makes no sense to me but that has worked. Goes with out saying but are you sure the charger is still working?
Turn on menu screen, select settings, then scroll to reset to return to factory settings.
Picture quality is excellent. The on board computers aparently correct lens and noise errors you get with point and shoots. Not quite as good as a 3000dollar Nikon or Cannon but nearly as good. And the multiple shots in each picture allow infinite depth of field Something you never see in any other camera except maybe a pinhole camera .
The manual is online in English. Just search google for it. But it doesn't explain how to change the camera to English. You have to look for the "tools" symbol on your camera screen and click on that. It is a symbol that looks like a gear. It is on the left sidebar of the camera screen. So when you turn on the camera. Push the menu button. Look on the far left. There should be an arrow and a "tools" symbol. Highlight the tools symbol and hit set. Then scroll down until you see language and English.
Yes a wall charger is included. I hacen't tried to charge using USB port on computer but wall charger works fine. Its not a fast charger but will fully charge in couple of hours.
I have both 30 and 45 MB / s, and makes no difference. But I am not happy with the speed filming. HS 1000 must be kidding. At almost 480 umlig to get sharp images, even with a tripod. Maybe I do something wrong? - Must try more, I think.
The Ex Zr 400 does not...that is the camera I own. Youtube shows people using the feature on some Casio cameras, so it does exist on some models.
I've had no problems at all with the USB. Transfer time are longer because the images (and especially high speed video) themselves are larger. You do have to press the power button after plugging it in to activate. It charges through the USB port. I did have one SD card go bad, but the SAN Disk Extreme Plus 80MB/s is holding up well.
Thank you for the question. I think that EMS is probably about 10 days although your address is not known.
This one is about a foot longer that the original if I recall.
have no idea. Just bought it and plugged it in and it works!
Yes, it will work with newer iMac as well as older type with 2.0 & 3.0 however super drive from apple seem to use more power. I've used panasonic DVD RW driver similar to super drive seem to work with USB hub.
I contacted the seller. It is in Japanese. There is no ability to change to any other language. The text on the camera is in English and it ocassionally shows up on some of the menus intermixed with Japanese. Many menus are only Japanese.
Panasonic catalog states HD.....This indicates that the lens features the "silent design" for improved video recording and offers excellent focus-tracking performance .
No
Yes...
If it has an hdmi cable it should.
The mic is a three contact standard 3.5mm jack. It works with my iphone 5, so I guess it depends on the game counsel's input.
Yes, mine does.
Yes
No, works great in real time. I watch direct tv while running using it. No delay.
In the settings change AUX from iPod to USB and it will charge/play audio from iPhone 5/iPhone 5s through usb-lightning cable.
I don't believe it transmits Bluetooth, only receives Bluetooth audio from your mobile device.
Chances are it's not the microphone. It's your speakers that is worn. I never have an issue with the mic. Any aftermarket speaker is superior to factory.
no you cant
According to fitting guide it should fit
Yes this unit will fit your vehicle.
I had a portable hotspot for the wifi, but if you turn on connection sharing on your phone it will work as a hotspot even if you phone is connected to the stereo (cable or bluetooth). Keep in mind this will use up your data plan.
2013 but do NOT buy. It is a complete Piece Of ShxT. I have had three of them. I got my first one in June 2013 and have two returned under warranty. The one I currently have is about 60% operationally, I have done about five different software updates so far and all fix one problem and make two more. The hardware is great but the software to run it is total shxt. it takes about three to five minute to boot up and half the time it does not boot correctly so you have to re-boot it.
It does list *Steering Remote-In* in the product features list.
it is gps it is automatic make sure it is on
You can operate it in HE or standard or a combo mode where it will select the best option. I have changed the settings once but I would have to dig into my manual to be able to help you. Mine is 8 the combo setting now and works great.
Mine does this, too. Not a big deal for me. I always just remember top left for SRC button.
Comes with. Works great too.
Yes it is
A friend and I installed mine ,and I have had no problems.
It should, but call your local stereo shop or two to get a second opinion. To see if you have to modify the interior of the dash. Some makes of car have odd ball stereo sizes.
No. It's big for the iPad air
No the handle wasn't included
I have the 3rd iPad and it fits that one.
I haven't had that exact issue but I did have problems with the mouse/track pad not working right all of the sudden and I called ASUS tech support and they had me re-install the drivers for it which fixed the problem immediately. Maybe you just need to re-install some keyboard drivers, call ASUS they will walk you through it step by step or find another solution. Good luck! 888-678-3688 or customer service 877-339-2787
Yes it's on the underside of the computer left side near the edge. I've had it since September and I just found it
Survey Says... "DING" With all 5 "J-Hook" holders extended all the way out, my tape measure read 10.5 X 7.5" Hope this helps. I have an iPad Mini in an Otter Box Case and it works Perfect.
Yes.
Yes it does
If you go to asus' website and search the model number you should be able to find it
This computer will run Skyrim on High Settings as selected by the in-game "auto-detect". Upgrade to 8gigs of ram, 1600mhz, as the APU uses system memory to boost GPU performance.
Yeah you can upgrade it up to 8Gb ddr3
no
3'30 to 3'45. Much less than ASUS claims.
Question 1. do not consider the plastic back where the brackets attach as weak. The complete system is very robust. Question 2. If you think there is a problem with the design I suggest you direct that to the manufacturer.
Fog proof. I haven't really used them in down poor or dropped in water so don't know about waterproof.
I am a baseball fan and they are great. I have not regretted this purchase.
Nikon says that at 1000 meters the FOV is 163 meters. Since a yard and a meter are only differ by about 3-inches you would probably be safe to guesstimate the FOV is on the order of 163 feet. Looks here: http://nikon.com/products/sportoptics/lineup/binoculars/aculon/aculon_a211/spec.htm
Excellent binoculars. Light weight combined with high guality image. The zoom function is terrific when needed. No question that I would purchase again.
Oh yes. 7 X 50 size binoculars give the highest resolution and magnification available in a hand-held unit with no external support device needed. I use mine for bird watching all the time, and the optics are excellent with Nikon.
Macally only make this item in White
Hi, this enclosure is working on 110v-240v. I think you need an adapter to use it in French power outlet. I hope this can help you.
Of course. Bread machines don't discriminae.
Camera does not come with a memory card.
There are multiple languages to choose from. Chinese is one of them
Also... be sure you allow the camera to autofocus before taking the picture, it does this with a partial (light) press of the shutter button.... you will know it has auto focused as it will beep and show a green target in the display, once you see the green target press the rest of the way on the shutter button and the camera will take the picture.
I'm not sure where you read those dimensions. I just measured the camera; it is 3 and 5/8" long, by 2 and 1/2" high, by about 1 and 1/8" thick (at the thickest end).
Yes, you can charge it with the USB cable that comes with the camera. However, you need to be careful not to damage the waterproof seal on the access door. You need to have the waterproof access door open to connect the cable any damage to the seal will cause the camera to fail under water. The battery seems to have a longer life than my other camera with double AA battery's. It also seems to charge faster with the charger(included) than with USB.
It has done all I've needed it to do and become a solid family picture workhorse.
yes. It can stitch together multiple shots into a panorama.
Yes, you can set the camera up a wireless hotspot so you can directly connect your phone, tablet, etc to the camera and download pictures, post to Facebook, etc.
no raw
No it dose not extend out. The internal lenses move, but they don't move out past the filter ring.
Yes, it is meant for full frame. Works great on my D800, and should work equally well on D600 and D610.
US
It was designed for the original iPad. Apple probably made a tiny change somewhere on the air that causes your problem. You'd think they would make a Minisuit Snap Hard Case II (specifically for the iPad Air) since yours is not interchangeable.
I purchased one and would say less then 8 ounces
No, it will only work with 'E' series laptops.
Yes. I ordered mine from Amazon the registered the case per the instructions I received in the box. Several months later I had some tears in the rubber piece and used the waranty for an exchange.
It extends about a quarter inch around the perimeter of the mini
No. it cannot.
Yes, there is a full Alarm Service Settings where you can set by hours, by day, by day of the week, you can setup sensitivity and even chose to send images or a video clip by email or messenger.
I use the original power supply... The extension just lengthen the power supply cord
Not sure. Sorry
I've had my SB1 for about 6 months with no issues with the remote from any angle. I have a habit of always pointing the remote towards the soundbar.
Midland Model: BATT9L
FinePix F900EXR accepts SD Card, SDHC, SDXC cards.
120V only
Hi, if you notice the picture which show the receiver's rear, you'll see you can use 6-16&#937; speakers. If your sub is powered, you should be fine.
No phono jack, although there are other RCA inputs you could dedicate as a phono and set up in the input matrix.
in addition to the Ethernet cable for the Denon unit, for airplay to work, it will require a Wi-Fi connected device and be on the same network as the Denon unit. IE: your iPad will have to have some way to actually talk to the Denon unit, WiFi is what - it does not require the internet to work, just wifi (internet if you want anything online obviously).
Good question! Yes it will
Dustin, Yes, you can hook up a turntable to this unit. It has left and right channel audio inputs that are assignable. However these are not phono inputs which means you might need a phono pre-amp connected between the Denon E300 and your turntable.
Yes, this item is compatible with your camera.
yes
We have not had any problems with the power button........
I love it :), watch all my movies on acer
Hello, the pixel response time is 2 ms. Thank you, FloridaTek support
You can hook a bobber to one of the loops so the camera will look upright instead of up and down. We never hooked a line to one of the loops
Only manages one HDMI input at a time. It is suppose to only run the powered on devise, but this feature has not worked for me. I only have one HDMI input and have Apple TV, Direct TV and my blue ray connected to this 3 way. In order to change devices I need to push a button on the switch to line up the HDMI from the device I want to use.
No, this has 3 inputs, but only one output.
DVI-I if I remember correctly.
Hello, Yes, you can use it in Europe and it has 4G capabilities. Let me know if you have any more questions. Techno Giants
BM Premium
I have this hand grip and love it. As with all my electronics, I always turn them off when not in use. It is just in case. I have not experienced any problems with the unit by shutting off both switches. I would advise that you do the same. Can only help.
It has one on the back
yes
Yes
Ive only had it for almost two weeks..but honestly so far it works pretty good downloading games is super fast also.but like i stated before trust me the camera/picture quality is horrible.(the worst ever) and its a little heavier than i imagined...screen resolution is ok but you definitely wouldnt be able to see the screen outside on a sunny day .
I don't know, I have a tab 2. sorry.
It worked fine on my 2000 honda civic dx (50a at 2000 rpms about) it does have a problem with shorting out though at least with the one I bought. It worked again after I disconnected it for about a month. Has clean push, meaning not alot of distortion. Hope this helps.
This amp has been kicking for me since I bought it. Was actually thinking about buying it again soon.
Man they make dash kits for any car if u research/car toys will find em but honestly I would go double din big touchscreen pioneer instead
No
Yes
Altho i havent tried the camera yet its supposed to be a two camera
Yes you need internet access in ordwr to view rhe cameras remotely
Yeah you can go up to 180 feet in bnc cable.
yes, the DVR has to access the network to be visible on the computers via the internet in another building.
Excellent
My kit came with the stands.
My wife uses it to charge her iPhone 5 and iPad. It's a good charger.
No
The picture on the stock photo is accurate. The one we have is a different color but it fits very well. I'd buy from them again.
No! Unless it has an umbrella ella ella
yes, and the outer layer is hard - my daughter loves this case.
As long as you use the correct tips and insert them properly, they shouldn't.
Yes
yes - using on my Toshiba L755 and cannot tell from original
Yes
Nope. It's not likely to get it. Pioneer seems to forget about supporting their product when they no longer make it. You have to go NEX to get Carplay.
Yes
No it will not harm your pad, your converter should always be a higher wattage.
don't know works well for my wife in the Philippines 200 volts 50 cycles
I bought them at my local Home Depot
Not exactly sure what you are asking. The transformer gets slightly warm but the losses do not seem to be large.
The easy way is to get an inverter like this: http://amzn.com/B004MDXS0U and plug a 110V power supply into it. A cheaper way would be to use a voltage regulator to provide the 7.4V, but that requires some skill with electronics.
Not that i have found. I had to install a plug outlet on my ceiling in order for it to work.
I just got one and it is not.
Yes the inside is also purple. The keyboard is black.
Sorry, my laptop arrived damaged and it did not turn on. I had to return it.
Yes it does. Its especially useful when the PJ is ceiling mounted.
This is just the receiver only. I paired mine with Klipsch Icon speakers from Best Buy. They are an absolutely perfect match. They have a wide range of sounds and can handle the power of this receiver easily. You can also look into other brands like Polk or Bose but you'd be over paying.
It has a parametric EQ that is kinda difficult to adjust. It is the only thing that I do not like about the receiver.
I think you need a receiver with a PHONO input, this receiver does not have one. Only the more expensive ones have that input.
No. This unit does not have an input for a radio transmitter, which is necessary for wireless connection to speakers.
yes it does....5 steps 0 to -4
It says in the literature 4K passthrough for video.
You can play CDs and tapes through attached devices; e.g., I use my DVD player to play CDs.
This is compatible with any laptop that uses SATA hard drives. Do some research on your laptop and see if you have a SATA hard drive.
Yes I have 2 installed in MBP 13" 2009 and 2012.
Hi Don't know 100% but earlier the keys were in the bottom of the laptop. Also you bougth the licence with the laptop so either Microsoft or Acer should assit you with all isseues. And the clone should work as original and Microsoft should recognize your licence number. Ask these fellows before proceedeing in case you still hesitate.
I just installed this in my ps4. works fine and has 861gb available after installing ps4 os and update
during set up, how was the volume set in your computer/pad/phone? i control the volume in my setup, from my iPad. i believe that i too had that issue, and my son enlightened me. i may also have incorrectly set up the blue tooth. certainly glad my son is patient... because i have only been retired from being a computer programmer for over 30 years, would have hoped that i would have been able to set up a small speaker on my own!
It cannot. Just one speaker at a time.
It can charge from any wall adapter or computer (slower) with a USB port or micro USB plug. So as long as the source works with 220v you'll be fine.
no
good DAy. These will fit without any drilling or anything
yes . VIVITEQ INC
Yes, this unit comes with a remote control and connect to Netflix when connected with an Ethernet cable to your local network or it can work wirelessly with the DYWL5 wireless dongle. http://shop.panasonic.com/docs/how-to/2013/video/2013_BDP_How_to_Log_In_and_Search_on_Netflix.html http://shop.panasonic.com/docs/how-to/2013/video/DMPBD79_Blu-ray_How_to_Connect_to_Your_Wireless_Network.html
This unit has firmware updates available for download through the player or the below link. http://shop.panasonic.com/shop/model/DMP-BD79?t=downloads&support
The total applications list is: Netflix, YouTube, CinemaNow, Vudu HD Movies, HuluPlus, Picasa Web Albums, Facebook, Twitter and Rhapsody.
The phone will not be secured in the stand but you can rest it on one of the hooks. Just be careful because it's not secured and can be knocked off easy.
Sadly no. It comes only with a 5V USA only type power adapter. I uploaded an image of it on the main page so you can it up close. However, you may want to go to their website and see if they offer a Euro version.
According to legitreviews.com (which did a teardown on the unit on 1 Apr 2013), the chip set is the Genesys Logic GL3520 USB 3.0 Hub Controller
For me I found external hard disks worked, but I would get short term disconnects. I replaced my hub with a Anker hub and haven't looked back:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GSLMTQ8/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
It works well
the oppo is a blue ray player. the play station three and the cable sound like they are plugged into your tv and you've run out of hdmi connections. save your money and get an amp that will accommodate your connections needs. way to think 'out the box', using equipment for more than it was intended.
Yes.
Don't know sorry
ALL PORTS ARE EASILY ACCESSIBLE
Yes!
Dont know. China maybe...I just bought it
Never had one of those so can't say. You can can compare the dimensions on of the iPad and kindle to see if they are close but I would have to say if the kindle isn't at least a bit smaller in width/height depth your going have tough time getting it in and a harder time getting it out. But this is just my opinion.
I had trouble getting a clear focus at the 12+ power range even though I had it on a tripod. I was watching a golf tournament about 250 yards away. I would say no.
No Problem The only thing you would need is a good tripod. I find that holding the 8250 Nikon by hand during the day looking at wild animals is one thing but at night looking at the moon or stars its a lot harder to keep steady. w
Yes
No.
RMT-B107A is remote needed Thanks EF and Dime
Using the remote is the easiest to open the door
Dear buyer: Yes, this item will work for you.
Yes
No
Plastic box is aprox. 17.5 x 10 x 2.75 cm (7 x 4 x 1 in), keyboard is 16 x 7 cm (6.5 x 2.75 in), pad is 3.25 x 3.25 cm (1.25 x 1.25 in), keys are 0.75 x 0.75 cm (0.25 x 0.25 in).
yes, and you can toggle the backlight with a button on the pad.
Another reviewer said they used it in the Dell E6530.
I don't believe it will fit. Try the 2nd Hard Drive Caddy DELL E6400, E6500, E6410, E6510 Modular Bay (original Newmodeus), also sold by Amazon.
Yes.
Since I attached the magnet the compass still works OK but the directional arrow on google maps rotates randomly, makes it very difficult to know which way your traveling. After I removed the magnet the phone still acts the same way. I can't be sure if the magnet was the cause but its pretty broken now and it may be as its quite an old iPhone 4S or that the magnet permanently damaged it, hope this helps.
Yes I have had the same problem. I think that it has to do with the AUX music device it's hooked up to, phone, iPod etc.... I haven't had it do that when I've used the built in radio. I believe if you go into the volume control of the device your using there should be a setting for that. Hope that helps&#128522;
You set a timer first. Then adjust the perfect position. And boom! ;)
No AC adapter, the unit needs to be hard wired. Thank you.
The one I received had one
does this include a battery?
Two usb doors. 1 of them is 3.0
I'm sorry I don't know the answer to your question. I am confused by the part numbers, and it is extremely difficult to get assistance from ASUS. That being said, I enjoy my ASUS pc very much.
Not sure what old dongle you have, but this takes minimal setup. You select which keyboard key you'd like to link to a remote button, and then press that button on the remote. Simple, easy. As for a blinking light - I don't believe so. Mine is hidden under my tv, and I've never noticed any sort of light coming from that area.
Having this TV for a couple of months and playing my PS4 on it, I can say that this is an excellent TV for gaming. There is no motion blur, and it is very high quality. Depending on what games you play can determine which HZ rating you will want. All and all however, it's a great all around TV.
YES. I have this TV and it does pick up the Digital Television Channels via the antenna. It does a heck of a job pulling in channels from the antenna, HDTV programming via antenna, as well as cable channels without the need for a cable box.
I believe plasma tv's work differently from LCD tv's and the 600 hz is correct.
Both camera view and speakers show. You might have to adjust the tablet ever so slightly from time to time to center the camera. I placed a piece of lightweight foam behind the tablet to keep the tablet from moving at all. Problem fixed
Yup - it works perfectly - just connect your camera to your laptop, turn it on and go to the drives. Then click on the proper drive for the external device and you should see a menu of four items; select the one labeled video and it should open with your videos - no names, but the files are there. Drag and drop them to your desktop and rename them at will or drop them into whatever folder you want. Very simple, and easy as pie! K.
I'm getting a 111 minutes of recording time on a full battery charge.
I dont know. I dont have xbox, I use them with playstation3 or a macbook, and they work amazingly in both cases
I bought the 60in la6200 and the magic remote did not come with it. It came with the standard remote which does the job but feels like a cheaper quality. I use an ap from my phone to control the tv, which seems to work really well. Prob not as well as the magic remote but it makes it easier to type and do other smart functions on the tv.
If you have Simplink capable devices (or not) then run to Onkyo then to TV. As far as video quality, the Onkyo can upscale a 1080p source to 4K but you would need a 4K display to take full advantage of this feature which the LA6200 is not. You may also need to run a fiber optic audio cable back to your receiver.
No. It works fine without.
The base does not swivel. I mounted it on the wall. The wall mount swivels.
I would not recommend this if there is going to be a lot of light, but on the other hand, this item is amazing! we have ours in the bedroom with a lamp, if we turn our big light on, you can't see the tv as good....
Yes. :-)
Yes just upgrade it
There is no DVD drive but it does support netflix.
That is a reference to the "refresh rate", meaning basically that a higher refresh rate makes for a smoother picture if fast action is involved. Usually sports fans and gamers look for a higher refresh rate.
I didn't. The remote that comes with it is simple to operate.
I would google that but I would say you want to be at least 10 feet away from the tv
It has 3 HDMI inputs and also the 3 colored AV inputs. I used the HDMI to my cable box and the reception is amazing. Then I connected my DVD player with the 3 colored wire.
I received a damaged TV but Amazon replaced it. Just open the package timely to report.
no that is one thing it does not have. That is false advertising.
no
Hi! Look at the site of TDK. Information about it.
No. It's battery is in built. But even after years of use, you can unscrew the side panel and replace it.
As long as music is paying through ours, it stays on, but once it goes idle for a little while (about an hour I'd say, but I never timed it) it will shut off automatically.
yes, but only one
On a 1-10 scale I would say 7.0
Yes...its just like any other tv except it also has google tv integrated with a web browser. U simply connect ur tv to ur cable box via an hdmi cable...if u have a surroind sound receiver u can then connect the reciever to the tv w an optical cable (like $5 on amazon) to get surround sound for anything that is playing on the tv.
Nope.
The only place double the pixel definition is mentioned here: "DOUBLE THE DETAIL. This stunning picture is the reason you wanted HDTV in the first place. With almost double the pixel resolution, Full HD 1080p gives it superior picture quality over standard HDTV. You'll see details and colors like never before." Taken in context this means that 1080p is almost double than the "standard HDTV" of 720p. If you want more than 1080p, buy 4K Ultra HDTV.
Yes!
They use regular lg glasses u can even use ones from movie theatre and they r cheap. http://m.lg.com/us/tv-accessories/lg-AG-F315
At this time, LG does not produce or have a specific compatible wireless keyboard for any of their TVs. Logitec makes wireless keyboards, and we have found that they work well with Samsung, but neither Logitec or us can promise 100% functionality
Lame, but so was a sound bar. I Spent a $1k on a Bose surround sound system. Now the sound quality matches the great picture.
Yes
Mine came with a base kit and wall kit. Just had to buy better screws to put on the wall.
I know this is an old thread. But its 25,000,000:1 Dynamic ContrastRatio
What is "Time machine II"? We recently canceled our 30 day free trial of Amazon movies? Is that what you are referring to?
The Vesa pattern is 400mm X 400mm and it's the other way around with the magic remote, it can control other devices and eliminate most remotes, but using a regular remote on the LA700 might work but you will lose alot of access to the TV's features.
TV, magic remote with batteries, stand(unattached), screw for stand,
My TV shows the Amazon Prime app on the LG smart hub. You may need to run a software update but it has been there on mine since I bought the TV several months ago.
Try enabling the clear voice feature found in the following menu option. SMART Home &#10174; Settings &#10137; SOUND &#10137; Clear Voice ll.
Make sure your 3d is not on? Happened to me.
Yes it does. 3 I believe though I'm not near my set to confirm.
I use 1.4v ~
W3 is analog input, so you can transmit any sound source from headphone socket, rather only from bluetooth enabled devices. (you will need a compatible usb power pack for this)
You should be fine. I use mine in a Jeep Wrangler with a factory overhead soundbar. I've had plenty of volume even with the top off. Maybe you would need the pre-amp if you have a big subwoofer.
Hi! I have one of these, and while I love it (huge screen, great battery life, totally customizable file organization, best markup/annotation capabilities of any E-Ink reader), it can't read Amazon format ebooks (.azw format) and can't be used to access the Amazon ebook store app that comes on Kindles. It does (technically) have wifi capabilities that could be used to get to the amazon mobile site, but the wifi is unreliable at best and sometimes causes the device to crash.
27 x 2.6 x 16.8 inches
LED
Mine came with the Adaptor which plugged into a standard wall outlet.
You do not need an outlet at each camera location. The cable that provides the video feed is paired with a power cable.
Yes. Micro USB.
yes you can
I have not been able to attach captions or text with it but downloading the photos is a breeze. I have not read the tutorial for this camera so hopefully someone can give you a little bit more info than what I gave you.
Yes, the pouch is included
No only a earphone jack - I don't think any mp3 player has a speaker - takes too much power from built in battery.
Yes, you can pick from multiple screen colors.
Yes its on the back.
Pyle's just don't have the build quality that the jvc's do its better to buy quality over the amount of power a set of speakers can handle
They do with a bracket.
You can take a look at http://www.crutchfield.com/p_105CSV628/JVC-CS-V628.html?showAll=N&search=jvc_csv628&skipvs=T And see if it feets your car. (Link "Does it fits my car?")
Yes it does works very well
Yes it will charge you IPod and yes your wheel controls will work with the iPod because it is running through your factory radio. Also great to hook up to an Iphone and use Pandora.
Dont believe so. You can get an adapter for this cable to fit android
No SIM card slot I can see. Don't remember about expanding to 8MB; I don't think so as I bought max amount I could. If I stumble across how to check what I have or what I ordered I'll update.
No but you can buy Spanish keyboard stickers. http://www.amazon.com/AMERICAN-NON-TRANSPARENT-KEYBOARD-LETTERING-BACKGROUND/dp/B0010VJPMW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1389324057&sr=8-1&keywords=spanish+keyboard+stickers
Yes it includes the keyboard base. The keyboard includes a battery built-in as well.
Hi Stefano, this unit does not have a 3G or 4G feature. It might be on some other models, but on our end on the Helix models, we do not carry the ones with a 3G or 4G feature. Thanks, PCrush
Yes, we have 2 units left as of this moment. We can ship it today if Amazon processes and gives us your order before 3:30 pm ET.
You don't. You actually want the refresh rate to match the frame rate of the content
Which card slot are you referring to? This Acer has two, but I am unsure which size cards the hold. They are located on the left side of the machine. Hope this helps.
I purchased this laptop and it is indeed the 15 inch model.
I really depends on which phone you have, the phone's battery capacity, and how depleted the battery is. Many phones can used immediately by simply plugging the pack into the phone (with the pack supplying the power).
The galaxy note 3 has a 3200 mAh battery and the NT600C is a 6000mAh battery supply. So it will charge the Note 3 to completion up to two times if the NT600C starts at full capacity. For a smaller phone like my nexus 4 it recharges the battery nearly 3 times.
I've left it for 3 weeks and lost about 25% of its charge. So after 2 weeks I think it loses 15% or so. It sustains a charge a lot longer than another device I have does (1 week for the other device).
Yes. The device states on it "Input: 90~240 VAC"
Sadly, it does not.
Yes they are I use them 4 times a week at the gym had mine for 8 months no problems they are amazing
No, you don't have to buy the skin separately. It can be used without it, but we have never done that. The eyelet is part of the skin also.
Short answer: No. Not unless it was built for Europe. It uses transformers in the power supplies and there is no external switch 120 to 220. If you want to use it at 220 and it was built for 120 you need an external 220 to 120 transformer (do not use a switching down converter, it will generate a lot of noise).
Yes
No it won't! Other than that no disappointment!
Yes and no. I have ipad 4 so if ipad 1 is the same size and they give you the correct screw it will work. Since the screw was too small I tossed the product and bought something almost exactly the same but it was made in the USA and I bought it at Rite Aid
The brick can only connect to one device at a time. Sounds like your brick is already connected to a device. To disconnect, hold down all 3 buttons at once til the beep then retry pairing.
It is adjustable via the buttons, and I believe that the built in speakers are muted.
No, they don't. There is a pause/play button though that also acts as a talk button, if your device is paired with your phone. The music will pause while you answer your phone.
I am not sure I don't think so I installed one on a 2008 I had but I think the 2014 tailgate has changed since 2008
AC Adapter (called switching adapter) says INPUT: 100-240V - 50/60Hz.
Sorry, I don't know the answer to that question.
Mine did not.
It has HDMI in. Most newer computers and laptops have HDMI or at least DVI on PC output. There are DVI to HDMI converters if your PC does not have HDMI out.
No it does not swivel flat. In all aspects it is like a regular laptop except the fact it is a touch screen.
The most likely answer is when this hdtv was shown at the 2013 CES (Consumer Electronics Show) many retailers thought it would sell well so bought a lot of them, but due to Cnet's review of the tv nobody bought it creating an overstock and a price drop due to the CES's date of jan 7 for the new 2014 models. Don't quote me on this though as I am not entirely sure this is why.
It has HDMI in. Most newer computers and laptops have HDMI or at least DVI on PC output. There are DVI to HDMI converters if your PC does not have HDMI out.
The version I purchased did come with a keyboard, but it was from a different vendor and it was stated in the description (with keyboard)- yes SIM card from ATT was included as well
The software can be updated. The set has wifi capability and can upgrade over your network connection. Be aware that if your network/internet is interrupted for any reason for even a few seconds, you will have to start over. If the set is within a reasonable distance from the router, you might want to make an ethernet connection.
I'm not sure if it has a head phone jack (but I don't think that it does) as I've never needed one but it does have an optical out which you may be able to connect to a wireless headphone transmitter.
It has a set screw that you loosen and then just lift up.
Hello Unfortunately it does not come with an anti-glare. Thanks Best Regards, Rachel
I ordered the same item and although it played the CD, it skipped. I sent it back and Amazon was great to immediately refund my money
I have the short black one.and yes it does but I show it was longer.... for the bed... because I have thick mattress and box spring.
Yes
Yes the power adapter cable disconnects from the power/USB cable. The dual cable doesnt disconnect from the keyboard.
I watch nbc very often and have not experienced any problem.
Not mine.
No. And it does not have warranty outside us. Mine is broken already :(

No - But it has a usb port and you could use an adaptor
Hello CC, I do apologize but the pricing on these TV's doesfluctuatee and you do have a 30 day price match on this TV.
Yes, this TV uses the mount standard VESA 200.
I just measured mine and it 24" wide by 12" deep. Dave

The tv comes with the standard Samsung warranty of 1 year from purchase.
Colleen C., You can mirror with an Android device on this model. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
My iPhone 5c will connect to my U8700 TV but then it will immediately say connection lost. No luck so far...
blazeman, This will work just fine in a motorhome. The LED design draws less power than ever. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
It does. It comes with a set of spacers for the top two holes so that the standard mounting brackets will sit flush. I mounted mine with an existing mount from my older flat screen.
I have measured 5 1/2 inches from the bottom of the TV's edge to the center to the mounting bolt
I recommend that you go to the Samsung website, look up you model, download the manual and look up connecting peripheral devices. There are full instruction for connecting to a wireless keyboard and mouse.
The "Auto Motion Plus" on Samsungs (a different name on other LEDs TVs) is what causes the "soap opera effect". Most video experts recommend turning the feature off.
we have 40 inch in a small room speakers that came with fine with us maybe in a very large room you might want larger speakers listen to your new tv first
Hi... if you have same tv.. you should get 4 free active 3d glasses free from Samsung in box.. new version lighter then previous heavey glasses. .. yes its active... hope my answer will complete your question. .. thanks :p
Use the direct tv remote as your primary remote.
They use the same box for all three tv sizes. So with that said the 50 inch will have more space to fill with cushions or any onther packaging they use to secure your tv.
Silver
its the same as buying any kind of insurance. if you can afford to pay a local shop 250-300 to fix anything that breaks at any given moment should something go wrong then no dont buy the extended warranty. if this is a large purchase for you - and coming up with 300 would be difficult - go ahead and get the plan. the last thing you would want to invest a lot in the tv, have something break, and not be able to afford to fix it. -CD
Actually I bought this for an 85 year old man and he's very happy with it but he probably wouldn't know the difference.
Use 120Hz to watch movies and regular TV. The 240Hz is for watching sports with high motion. It really comes down to personal preference once you watch for a while you will figure out what bothers you about both rates. The new TVs allow you to turn the features off in the menu structure. There is only about a 30% improvement from 120Hz to 240Hz. You have to experience it to make a decision. Go to a big box store and make the change in the menu to allow you to see the difference.
I have the 75" tv and the legs are 64" tip to tip.
it has both those apps , it is simple to access both. Really glad I bought this tv.
I would download the manual from the Samsung website for total information about this tv. I did too thoroughly check it out before buying this fantastic television. I do this with all major items before purchase when possible.
I have never reset my tv but the apps on the TV suck. My Hulu app barely plays. I called samsung about the issue and tech support really couldn't help. So I don't use any of apps on the TV; I have an apple tv. I suggest you do something like that if you can't get the apps to work. The tv is still really awesome...the picture is amazing!
This TV works gr8 with Wifi...
Yes, but the 55" will not fit in the overhead bin.
My Brighthouse server did supply me with all the cables i needed.
No and no.... No touch-screen, no office. I bought Office 360 at my son's college for $79 for 4 years "rental." I thought it was a good deal since Microsoft would not upgrade my Office 98.
Mine lasted about a year.
Yes, it came with a black plastic snap-on cover which serves to "blank-out" the unit and also could be used to blackout the illumination when driving in dark places at night.
No detachable face. I don't think it had a remote.
The wireless remote works via infra-red like your TV remote does. I've found that it will function through one of those tinted plastic stereo covers, but, mine will only work if I am oriented toward the radio face. I cannot, for example, use the remote to reliably control the radio if I am standing at the bow of my center console due to the radio's face orientation aft. Edit: This just popped in my head, but, you can probably use one of those IR repeaters common in home stereo and mount the receiver in a more conducive location.
I think 45 watts per channel. It's in the description. It's very loud with 4 speakers. I run 4 6.5's alpine with this unit and 1 10" sub on a seperate amp. Sounds clean and loud. Can hear it doing 59 mph
Yes
Checked the TV and manual and it appears that it only works with 110/120 Volts
The touch remote is infact backlit.
My TV is in our Great Room (family room) with one wall essentially all windows so there are times when there is a lot of ambient light. My experience is that the factory settings were satisfactory for my location. - from Southern MD
I've had no problems
Troy Archer, A third-party device may work, but Samsung doesn't have a headphone adapter for this model. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
C. Gilbert, New Samsung televisions sold by Amazon come with a 1-year Parts and Labor manufacturer's warranty. For extended coverage, inquire with Amazon during the checkout process, as additional coverage may be available. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
This tv can has a great picture from the sides. Probabiy among the best.
Yes it does.
No it is for the ativ only
Nope - been used regularly for 3-4 months.
The way that the screen mask on the plasma tv is designed, there is NO visible attenuation to the left or right of center of view. When you are either above or below the center line of view, more than 10 or 15 degrees, visible attenuation to the picture takes place. The set is designed to be viewed at zero degrees with respect to vertical and zero degrees with respect to horizontal +/- almost 180 degrees. Mounting above a fireplace will definitely cause some picture attenuation when viewed from a typical viewing position. Sorry...................
Yes. You can easily insert micro-SD cards to increase storage capability.
Yes, it does! Great quality...
There is an extra battery but no USB cable. You can buy a card reader with USB connection.
Manual says mp3 and photo playback only from the USB ports. http://www.axessusa.com/images/products/TVD1801-24.pdf
YES
Not at all. I found it would really only work on a hard surface.
It does work pretty well in both 14.04 and 14.10. Plug and play, no need to do anything beyond plugging it in.
I can't answer about 80 feet, but I have had my keyboard 30 feet away and it worked fine.
This is only used to connect two mc4 connecters to one wire..ex 2 solar panels connect to one wire in to inverter,,hope this helps ,,all mc4 connecters be them 10 gauge or 12 gauge wire all fit this connecter..
yes Mine connects with my other drives.
It comes with one in the door panel, one rear, one top, and one front (4 total). The front, side, and top are Megaflow 200mm (200x30) fans. The front one I believe is actually 230mm, but fits 200mm as a replacement. The rear is a 140x25. The fans can be heard but are very calm and quiet. They are 19dBA.
This is an amazing case! You should look into getting one for yourself.
I have not seen a MB this case can't very easily accept. I have an Asus Maximus V and I have can fit another half of one I there. Hope this helps
There were two fans included in my case and were not LED.
Supports up to 6 fans. Two come standard and provide adequate cooling. See http://us.coolermaster.com/product/Detail/case/mid-tower/haf-912.html. Specifically two in lower front (one optional) , one in lower side (optional). These are intake. One upper rear and two top (optional) exhaust. I am running a 1T fixed and a 500 gb removable drive, 8 gb memory and an i5 processor on just the two fans that came with it, no problem. I blocked off the two upper grates to preclude grandchildren inserting "things".
Yes you can.
No it does mot have those keys on it.
Without any packaging (cardboard, plastic wrapping, etc) the bag with everything in it plus the tripod is 12.6 lbs. If you go with 14 lbs you should be safe. Hope this helps.
Yes it should work fine. Just remember to take any rails or connector adapters off the old drive and put them in the exact same place on the new drive.
Yes it uses the same pata connection. The "100" in your ata-100 is just the speed. It'll work.
Yes
I do not think so; it is snug for a 6" Nook Simple Touch reader.
Real simple to put together. .anyone could do it
Yes. I ordered a sling when i bought mine. Put the sling on when i assembled it.
I have "robin-hooded" bolts at 50 yards. I replaced the laser sight with a ranged scope with elevation lines. As long as you adjust for windage and range, 20 inch bolts with good 125 grain broadheads should be very deadly. Based on fps at 300, I dont think I would want to go any further out than 70 as you kinetic energy drops exponentially. I can say that it will through and through deer at 45 yards.
That's the large bolt that is used to mount the limb to the body of the bow. That bolt tends to loosen after a while and adds vibration noise to the bow when shot.
Must buy model designated iPad Air
No clue. Accepts standard tripod mount iPad snaps into plastic mount
Yes..it comes with a stylus.
No they are not. I have been trying to research the setup on wireless speakers but there seems to be no video on it. But they connect to an adapter that then gets plugged into the wall. So picture the rear speakers with wires from them, to an adapter which plugs into the wall for power. Basically it comes in handy when you can run rear speakers underneath a couch and have access to an outlet. But if you want to mount the rear speakers I think you're better off running them through regular cable wire.
I don't know the exact length but they are at least 20 feet. I needed to extend one of my speaker cables and since they have a special connection at the end, I just cut the wires, added normal speaker wire, then connected the factory ends to the speaker wire I added.
Yes It plays standard formats - MP3 and MP4 etc.
There are multiple output options. 3.5mm/1/8inch, optical, usb, Bluetooth. I have my tv plugged in with optical and use the 3.5mm for my computer, bluetooth for the phone and still have unused USB ports.
I believe you should connect your Roku directly to your TV. Then use your TV remote to switch to either HDMI 1, HDMI 2 or HDMI 3 (just depends on how many HDMI inputs you have on your TV).
I can't say for certain, all I know is that it provides comfortable sound I like for my desktop-tv & laptop. It's Total waltz which any one can enjoy. I hope this can help.
Yes, I think so on the back you'll see that as well use the front knob to adjust the volume. But man, I must confess this New VM Audi produces a comfortable bass! I love the sound quality it produces. And the money I spent worth the value! I hope you too will enjoy it!
15W RMS left channel, 15W RMS right channel, 50W RMS sub woofer. Not too bad for such a small system.
This is the 2 x 4 switch which can share four USB peripherals between two machines. What you want is the IOGEAR 4 x 4 (GUS404) switch, which can share up to four USB peripherals between four machines.
No it does not have an MP3 player input.
Hi Leo- I am sorry to hear about the issue you are having. We do not offier technical support, however you ca contact LG directly at 800-243-0000 for assistance.
Yes all the above. but the LG BP730 i found it very unreliable. I've return more than 3 units since my original purchase. but with all its flaws i still own this unit. i just love the 4K Upscaling.
As long as the TV has an HDMI port for external A/V input, certainly.
Unfortunately you can't. When I called their help center I was told that unless it is specifically stated in the description, it is not supported. Not only that, but they also told me that they reserve the right to change and/or cancel what they support at any time. As a result of that conversation, I boxed it back up and sent it back for a refund.
DIGITAL AUDIO OUT (OPTICAL) & HDMI
Really don't know but the Garmin nuvi 3597 LMTHD is awesome -- the best one I have ever owned
I don't know if Surface Pro and Pro 2 sharing the same screen. Even if they do, the shield doesn't fit either, since the cutting window for camera is in the wrong side. I had it replaced once and still came out the same, so I quit.
Its glossy but it looks real nice. Easy to keep clean I love it.
its possible but i'm not sure. You can get a usb splitter to test it out
Not sure about the mini, but it works like a champ with normal sized
Yes adapter does allow you WEP. We are currently having some problems though and may need a tech to help us out.
Internet-connected with built-in 802.11n Wi-Fi and preloaded and downloadable apps
It can be mounted, but the steel stand that comes with it is what I am using now.
Yes
Yes
It comes with ac adapter. It uses alkaline D cell batteries
it needs 6 D size batteries, but i have to tell you this is the best built, sounding, boom type box on the market. Quality piece of work.
No
If your Galaxy has Bluetooth, yes.
No, it's single core. I am impressed with it's speed in surfing the internet, loading apps. Don't buy it if 3D gaming is big for you though. It's a nice quality build, but Nexus cut corners in the area of processor and graphics to get the price so low at $149 for 32gb. I also have a Google Nexus 7 32gb and it's clearly better...but it cost $229.
Yes
As far as movies and TV shows, I would suggest signing up for Amazon "Prime". I think it is $79 per year. If you order anything from Amazon that has the "Prime" logo, your orders will be delivered in two days. Along with your "Prime" subscription, Amazon gives you access to a lot of movies and TV shows. For an ad block, try this link. Google Play had to shut down their app due to the usual BS. https://adblockplus.org/en/android-install
not sure if you can or where you can get one. I bought this for my nephew. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
Any phone with a headphone jack.
If I remember correctly I think it does. I would ask customer service if you can.
Spanish
Yes - as long as your mini is not in a case that would prohibit the lightening connector on the iHome unit from reaching the opening on the iPod. Or you could use the USB port on the back of the clock to plug in your lightening connector cable. The iPod would not be sitting on top of the clock but it would work just fine. Hope that helps.
I had no problem connecting - what are you trying to do and what have you tried? Are you using a wireless access point?
Yes! The tablet comes in the box with its charger and a compatible stylus pen.
Front facing only (upper right corner).
Don't know which one is best but I have been using Sonos sound bar and have been very pleased.
We recommend you test a video game system or Blu-ray player to determine if the problem continues. If it does, please disable the Motion Picture Setting found in the TV's Advanced Picture Setting.
Each speaker is 3-1/2 in wide, 3-1/4 in front to back, and 49-1/2 in high w/o stand.
I just bought mine for BB yesterday. It does say in the menu and in on the box that it has 4k "upscaling". Not sure how good it is becuase I only have 1080p lg tv.
how? my projector this runs to does, but i have not found that option on this device
Yes, it works just fine with no issues
I have photographed salmon in fresh water about two feet deep with no problems and amazing results!
Judith; I have primarily used the camera for still /semi-still pictures. I have a friend who uses hers for live action at rock concerts and gets outstanding results. Hope this helps, R
I couldn't get WiFi to work at all...good luck!
It is small enough to stick in your back pocket with no problem. Just remember not to sit on the camera and crush it. They don't come any smaller. I don't have the actual sizes in front of me but it is "VERY" compact. You will be happy.
Hi Melodie D., yes this Sony DSC-TX30/P has a built it mic and has speaker for video playback. -Ely
THIS IS A GREAT CAMERA AND THE 50X ZOOM IS PERFECT!
I have owned this camera twice!! lol. I bought it and sold it to my sister in law and then tried playing with some SLR's and didn't like the cost for buying lenses. This camera is about the best I have seen in its class. Its low light capability is higher than most power zooms on the market right now it will go up to 12800 ISO which is higher than most.
No, it does not have Carl Zeiss lens. It comes with a Sony G lens (F/3.5-6.5 G)
If I measured right it is 13.2 ! It's an awesome system I love it ,it is so clear! Darla
Wendy, unfortunately the camera only has 16X9 and 4X3 aspect ratio's. A little shot composition (planning) ahead of time will negate that problem, but I realize that point and shoots like this camera aren't usually used that way. I have printed several 4X6's and been very happy with the results - even though it took a little extra effort.
Dale, does the unit itself not turn on or just no function to the head unit?
Yes, I think it was 9ft if my memory serves but don't quote me on that
8-base is more curved than 6-base, and it just depends on your frame choice. Talk to your optician. (Price difference due to availability.)
i bougth it for my friend. i dont know about it
The vendor/shipper should have this information. I suggest that you contact them by e-mail.
Port images or videos from camera to pc without removing sd card from camera...also essential if computer has no card reader.
Sorry, no - but it's a nice little listening machine. Have a pleasant day!
Hi J. I've tested this with an iPhone charger/5S and it does not transfer bus power thru the hub. The USB handshake can not accommodate multiple pieces so i suspect this will be the case with any USB powered android as well.
I'm not for sure but I think there's a feature were it just plays in park. Some states it's against the law to play a dvd while driving.
Yes
I let crucial.com scan the laptop. It said it can have 8 gb. 2 sticks of 4 gb
No it did not come with the keyboard.
Sorry, but mine didn't even work that well - plugged it in & got a very bad picture, colors also far off - Flickered a few times - then never worked again. Returned to amazon.
The AWG is anywhere from 28 to 30. They don't give out that info on their website; at least I couldn't find it. I did find the 10 foot version on a different site and that's what was stated. Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
Yes if the devices have HDMI connections.
It will tell you! It's a wonderful machine!
Yes
I charge mine with the USB port on my laptop or with a USB universal outlet charger. Either way once charged it stays charged for a nice amount of time. I hope that helps you out.
This amp has a 60 watts at 4 ohms RMS and the pioneer speakers maybe 100 watts at 4 ohms you want to get a 100 watts RMS amp this one will be able to drive these speakers only at 60% of their capacity
Not sure.
Yes. It's a 4 channel amp so you will have to bridge 2 of them. If you are running subs on another amp the cut out issues could be from lack of power from your battery/alt. Try adding a compacitor..
You can buy the speaker line to RCA adapter to feed your speaker lines into the amp. I used an Audiocontrol LC6i in my setup but not necessary unless you want to add subwoofer and amps.
Yes
Could be due to overloading though I'm not so sure. I would suggest that you check with your installer.
Yes it will comes with everything quick easy install
I'm not sure but I'm sure they will fit. If they screw holes are off you can always make new ones
I don't think it would work very well. Because of the higher voltage used in a home unit, a greater internal resistance is used in speakers for indoor cabinets. It probably would function, but not like it is designed to. I believe max wattage is about 60 or so, if I recall correctly.
Speakers I got we're not list as MARINE type so probably shouldn't be in a wet environment
I think the rear speakers in a civic are 6x9s. So yes they should fit. But I don't think these speakers would be much greater than the factory speakers in the car.
If the battery is fully charged, it should last for about 6 hours. This is a rough guess based on my using it for about a week, a short time each day, before needing to recharge the battery.
You'd have to go by the manufacturer's instruction's, I wouldn't know, it was a gift for my son.
Yes, on the bottom
Seems genuine to me. If it's fake, I can't tell the difference.
the current 300W power supply should be able to support up to GT630 Graphic card. But if you do need to upgrade to a higher end graphic card then you will need a higher power supply.
It depends on where you go and what you look like. If you have big boobs, no one will notice your camera no matter what you have.
A fisheye lens with the Sony NEX mount, preferably designed for the APS-C sensor. Like: http://www.amazon.com/Rokinon-FE8M-NEX-Fisheye-E-Mount-Cameras/dp/B005FKT7GS

yes. You click on the Amazon button on the controller and you click on Amazon prime
No. You have to have 3D content and use the glasses.
I think a lot of answers to these questions can be found here: http://store.vizio.com/e500da0.html
there is a delay
My kids love their tablets,plenty to entertain them,i bought extra insurance and sd cards
Yes
The D2 web site says it has a micro USB slot, but I haven't held one in my hands to verify this.
not on its own, but i've read that it's compatible with Eye-Fi cards, however.
it can onnect to any tv with an HDMI port. this blu ray is HDMI only. It will work as long you have the available port. if your tv is hi-def you probably have the port. I think all flatscreen tvs also have the port. hope this helps.
NVIDIA Corporation GK107GLM [Quadro K2000M] (rev a1)
Hello. Yes, it includes full insurance if you purchase this item from us. This policy differs from seller to seller.
Yes, it does.
In general the laptop is well made for the it's price. I would recommend this product..
Mine did not. It has a recovery partition to restore back to factory default.
Hello, you may need to change the music mode, it supports MP3 format or MAV, thank you!
Sorry...no clue...I have a T4i...I bet it does work. Check the Satechi website for compatibility.
Do not get this model go with the regular wireless remote made Satechi, the cell phone app is very buggy and often times will simply uninstall itself. Unfortunately the submini connector is very specific for example mine is T3i mine will not work on any outside the rebel line. So be sure to compare your connector with those listed for your camera. Also these are made for dslrs that have full manual and bulb capability.
Yes, it came with the remote. Highly recommend getting an amplified antenna, bigger the antenna the better, if you can't get enough channels, try rotating the antenna or move the location. For me by moving the antenna from one side of the house to another (it went form 6 channels to 80 channels)
There is a maximum of 8GB of Ram Capacity, but the laptop comes with only 6GB.
I haven't tried it both ways, so I don't know that there's a difference. But I have my main connections go directly to the TV and run the optical cable for when I want better sound (which I don't always care about), and that works just fine.
Yes, but it is only a stereo Aux connection. The ports (for left and right input) are on the right of the back panel.
I have earthlink, so I don't personally know but this modem should work with At&t DSL internet service.
The best performance is over Ethernet. The USB port allows you to plugin the manufacturers wireless adapter so that the Transporter can operate over a wireless network. I believe the USB port is not supported for any other use. but you can use the Transporter wirelsslt by installing a
Yes. However it's done by installing the Connected Desktop application on your PC/Laptop or Mobile Device. On mobile devices, it's a matter of choosing which files you want to download from your folders etc.
Yes-the transporter can define permissions on files as well as which transporter has priority. The transport is not all to all as you can define folders with different properties.
In have a JVC DLA-RS46U with an RF transmitter. The X500 is a newer series with 4K capabilities, although it is still using JVC's D-ILA technology. I would expect it to work with normal 3D 1080P sources, as long as you have an RF transmitter, but cannot speculate about its ability to work with 4K sources.
Yes I confirm it works fine with the JVC RS46 projector.
Yes it does. It can use bluetooth to connect to a phone and make calls or to a computer to do voice chat.
No
I have a these glasses and Panasonic AE800u, works perfectly.
No
I'm not a gamer so I can't respond to that ... I'm using the computer for real time navigation and it fits my needs. You have a choice of processors, memory capacity, and Hard drive (I used a SSD 150 GB, 8 GB ram, and i3 processor OS Win 7 ... conservative but I want a stable platform)
The 1st device on the left is a clear weatherproof camera enclosure (mountable on any camera mount/bracket) that does not quality or motion detection). The larger device on the right end is the VueZone base station that is plugged into your router (and power source) linking the cameras to the Web.
go to myvuezone/settings/basestation you will see a deactive selection
Not to my knowledge.
It is complete with free shipping within the USA
Hi Tired, You need a Sony Lens Mount LA-EA4 Adapter to attach the A-mount lens to your E-mount camera. -Vincent
hi, yes it will work with the a65
This is a LED TV.
IR sensor!
Yes
Very poor with no boost in volume using bluetooth or direct wired
There is only a HDMI out in the back, no other audio input or output
Yes. It hooked up my nextbook tablet.
I'm sorry but I don't know. The case was bought for a Sony camera.
Like a laptop keyboard
i used it in portrait once but it just sets to oneside and uses one edge to hold it inplace not to sturdy
No, and if you're looking for functionality, look at Midland. These are nothing more than glorified toys
"Screen fit" will fit the picture exactly to the tv screen, with no black bars on top and bottom or on the sides.
No
It does, as long as you're connected to an internet via either wifi or direct wire. That being said, it's cumbersome to get to and I'd bet that unless you have a spare Bluetooth keyboard sitting around, "99%" of owners (myself included) never use it at all. It's far easier and more convenient to use your smartphone or a tablet/computer for such things...
Yes
Intel Graphics
Just received it today and it works great with the 7" Chromo android tablet.
Yes
Yes it can.
when i bought my case it came with 5 internal fans 1 large side fan and 4 small fans, and quite honestly the case is amazing my system never goes over 40 c i added 3 extra small fans to it as well
Yes, Micro ATX board fits in X-DREAMER4 case.
No, it is the case only.
Yes it will my grandkids has a 7" tablet. I order three of these one for each.
Yes, the one I got did.
Don't know, mine came without one too, but it's like a mouse, just plug in the transmitter in a usb port and it should be recognized and work fine.
Does not jiggle. Is very stable. I'm very happy with it.
No, I didn't receive any stickers.
This is strictly USB hub. I have been able to use the ports for both power and data using a Windows computer. I have been very happy with this hub.
No, Only the first eight (8) ports are POE+. Of more importance is the 192 Watt total energy budget. Figure out the power demands of the equipment you are powering. I am powering four Netgear Access Points and can easily add four more. Also, when first turned on it takes about 90 seconds to detect and power remote devices before allowing data transfer. Since August 2013 to now, March 2014, the switch has only been rebooted once.
Yes. The switch is plug and play out of the box - in my case it was "wire the Comcast modem to the Barracuda VPN and then wire the VPN to the switch"... No config necessary on the switch side - just on the VPN, as expected.
Yes
No I had to add a video card
hi John, It comes with the following: Keyboard Mouse Warranty Card Power Cord Quick Manual Driver CD Mouse Pad Thanks, PCrush
I can run it on medium to high settings with no problems.
Yes. This phone is awesome. My mom has had it for 5 months now with absolutely NO problems. The speaker is loud. I'm happy I made this purchase. I definitely recommend. You will not regret it.
yeah we have black, white, red, brown and pink color. You can search in our store. Thanks
Yes right on the front picture 2
I only use the FM transmitter and have found the remote not to be useful for me. Good luck finding the answer you are looking for.
No; no external connector. But I just wrapped some wire around the antenna and it boosted the gain as you'd expect. I'm receiving a faint FM signal across the building where I work so that I can listen to another worker's XM. Works well.
The one I bought did not, but it was a used one. However, on HP's specs page for this laptop, under Productivity Tools it says: "Microsoft Office 2010: Buy Microsoft Office to activate Office software on this PC." That may mean that on a brand new laptop, there's a trial, and you would have to buy the software to keep using it.
Yes, it does.
Sure, it will partially rewind...
yes it has front & rear camera
No. Just USB, audio and power.
No and yes.
it has front & rear Camera
It takes phone calls but it's not clear for the caller to hear me talk. It's made more for listening and convenient to answer calls. I just switch to my phone for conversations.
It is Bluetooth
It comes with a digital cable. You just put one end on the back side of the sound bar and the other end to the back end of the tv. I hope this helped.
My sub-woofer has an RCA type connector that attaches to the rear of the sound bar. As you look at the rear of the sound bar, there are connections facing back and connections facing down (under the "lip" of the cutout area). The sub plugs into the down facing connector. I hope that makes sense!
Yes. As long as it has an audio cable input, it will work just fine. I use it on my galaxy cell phone devices so I'm sure it will work on your TV.
Yes you can connect by way of plugs in the rear of sound bar
I believe that this model is referred to as "2013". When I have searched for accessories that is what I've purchased using.
3rd generation but called the Rider 5 for whatever reason. Excellent unit.
The Rider is Water Resistant to standard IPX7 which means it can survive being submerged in one meter of water for 30 minutes. Some of us who tour will occasionally be caught in a downpour so this is a good thing.
You have to have a Bluetooth device to hear voice commands. I have used the Bluetooth but most of the time do not in my Truck and on my Motorcycle. The display is plenty large enough to see clearly what is going on and when turns are required. For me the Bluetooth is a bit of a hassle and quite frankly I don't miss having voice commands.
There is no button on the remote that will let you switch different speaker sets.
It works fine in Russia with 220v
Eventually, but you have to leave them out if a cool breezy place. I left the out for over a month to dissipate the aroma.
Although a bit tight, mine fit just fine and I use regularly for travel.
the mat itself is 5x7, and the center opening can frame a 3.5x5.5 image; these are really nice mats!
Yes it's dishonest. I was duped by the same ad. Bought what I thought was a dvd combo but sadly it was not. Had to buy separate dvd player.
It is not magnetic.
Metro 72-5600 for $6.55 thats what I used and they worked fine no cutting of wire john B

Did a pin in the hole reset the tab? If it did you would know. The other thing you could try is letting the battery die completely then fully charge it.
1. Pick either screen, put in DVD. This will become the master TV set. 2. Put wires into dc out and av out ports on this master screen 3. Plug the wires into dc in and av in ports on slave screen 4. Take remote and point to slave screen. 5. Press "source" button until you see " Av in" come into slave screen 6. Point remote back at master screen and press play. This is how it worked for me. Every time you turn on TV sets follow this sequence.
Yes. I would think so. As long as your subs are wired in parallel you'll be fine. Keep in mind it's a 600 watts rms output so you'll be getting 200 watts rms a piece. But even at 50% to each sub I'd imagine that for the price of this amp you'd be getting a good bang for your buck.
Oh yeah defenitely yes. True rms on this bad boys 1000 watts rms. this amp is so powerful.
Yeah it Will. I had this amp and it is a monster. It was powering 2 12 inch kicker cvx's wired into a 1 ohm load in a ported box tuned @32 hrtz.
I had the same problem with mine. Went through 3 sets in a week and after a week and a half the amp went up in smoke. Exchanged it for a massive audio n4 and couldn't be happier.
Yes
2 10" infinity dvc ported downward facing. Running amp at 1 ohm and it sounds amazing
Why wouldn't you use the correct 1/0 vs starving the amp with 4gauge
Yes it is
It comes with a holster that allow them to be folded or open it has it has the ability to be clipped to a bet The sheers have a small clip. like a pen to attach them to a cargo pocket
They work best using the plastic clip that goes on your belt.
No, this modem is compatible with the Comcast system, you should not have to call them to set-up modem.
Technically yes if you are very proficient with the mouse. It would take several sweeps to cover a newspaper page and the software would then stitch it together - but lots of room for error when tackling something this large.
It just comes with the cord to plug in a socket.
Yes you can
Essentially. Consider it a second high def port. Most people use it to connect the tv or cable to the blu ray player. This way all tv/cable shows are in 5.1
I do not own a Wacom tablet, The Genius EasyPen Tablet runs a Window 7 operating system and I got with my tablet Corel Painter Essential 4 with it. It comes with its own software to use right away the software to set the tablet and pen up is easy to understand. Bashar I would recommend it for the software alone and the tablet works great. I am not an expert in Graphic Tablets, Wacom seems to be popular too, I looked at the tablets on Amazon and I am pleased with my purchase.
When you have a light on the stand and have it extended to any level, you can always move it around by untightening it and then moving it. It wont fall down if you hold on to it and even if you don't hold on, it will not fall because of the air cushion.
Closed it's 31 1/2 inches. I was impressed with the quality.. better than I expected.
Yes, they can.
Loud when download is normal because it is spinning at full speed for maximum transfer rate. Listening to music from a CD is a slower spin rate because of lower data transfer speed.
The ASUS H61M-A/USB3 is a Micro ATX form factor.
The square bases and necessary stand necks are included in the box.
I have not hooked it into my TV as I have another set hooked into the TV but you should not need any other pieces or products to amplify sound. These speakers do a pretty good job of that already. So no, you won't need a preamplifier.
The light has to be blinking, not solid. Press the button to make the light blink.
That is a reflection from the picture. There is no white strip. These speakers look really slick and they have worked awesome for me.
Speakers aren't designed for wall mounting. Plug connections are on the back. You could put them on a shelf. You would need to come up with your own method to get them mounted to a wall.
If your installer sets you up by bypassing the parking sensor, you don't have to stop. If the installer will not by pass the parking sensor, you will have to stop to change the map and change music folders. Best Buy installed mine and the installer bypassed the parking sensor so my unit allows me to change as I'm driving.
The opening in the dashboard should be double DIN.
besides the camera, you get the battery, battery charger, long wire for battery charger, plug for battery charger[you won't need the long wire to charge the battery],camera strap,usb wire,manual, warranty papers, i think the viewfinder blind. by the way, this is the best camera i have ever owned.
Camera: One year standard I believe. https://support.nikonusa.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/333/kw/digital%20imaging%20warranty Nikkor Lenses Nikkor lenses come with a standard one year warranty and Nikon Inc. lenses sold by authorized Nikon Inc. dealers will have a Nikon Inc.

Keep the Customer copy of the form as well as the original proof of purchase (sales receipt).
En la caja viene la garanta con Nikon.
I have used them with VGA, HDMI, mini HDMI and daisy changed HDMI (duplicate screen, not extended). I don't know what "dmi" is, bit if you mean dvi I would expect they work too as the device has a dvi-d input port
No, the stand is too short for vertical use. The stand has a custom bracket that only goes on in the normal orientation. However, the are standard mounting threads in back of the monitor, you can use a custom stand.
Recharging is not an option that Ive found or needed. Ive had my mouse for months and am a heavy computer user. Ive not had any need to replace the batteries.
Absolutely man. It will definitely fit. Both horizontally and vertically. This box booms bro.
1.5 cubic feet
Yes you can!
I am sorry I wouldn't know because I am still using the same charger that came with the Neuton mower.
Since installed I have not removed my iPad Air yet.But I 've just did when I received this question to answer to your question and I want to see if it puts any scratches or damages on the bezel or any where else and found absolutely nothing's ,no scratches or damages at all.it is still looking good as it just came out from case/box of Apple.Thxs.Hope this helps
Although the specs at Amazon says 12 oz, it actually weighs only 8.4 oz. The iPad Air weighs 16.8 oz, so combined, it weighs 25.2 oz.
It worked for us.
Yes! I was able to do it with mine!
No. All speakers are wired
once I had it hooked up such is I did not like the sound quality so I put it back in the box where it has been for the last 2 months Anna purchasing the 5500 of which I had already had one
To answer your question yes you will. But by doing so you will no longer have additional support for volume with a game console (Xbox). I used the optical out from the Samsung and put it in the T.V. set. I also used the HDMI out from Samsung component and into the T.V. so that I can access the Blu-Ray/Samsung Apps. Hope this helps.
It's not really like another model that I have seen. Its got the surround sound built into the dvd unit.
Dear Sergio, unfortunately this unit does not yet have compatibility with sat radio. We are still doing the research in the development in that are, we had some samples but they were not successful thus they need the research more. As for the back up camera, yes they are all compatible. thank you for your interest customer service
Yes
Yes and it works well!
Charging cable only
This does not have an illuminated keyboard.
In fact, I have not received my cameras up to date in order to check them, I sent several e mails inquiring about delivery status and prrof of delivery to my shipping address but I got no response.
I plugged in a passive analog mic and it sounded horrible.
Does it have a foot to connect an external flash? If so then it should work. It just goes in front of the flash and slides into the foot area.
It only sends SMS with a link which provides you with a map and a pinpoint on it showing you where the unit currently is. For those who need more information, you can receive a pure text message that provides you with the following: Latitude & Longitude (manually plotable via the website), speed, direction, time, and current battery level of the unit.
use your fingernail or a small coin where it says open
Readymaderc carries the 3 wire video cable.
Dear Gurinder, it only take 2-3 sec.
Hi, it provide feature to do monitoring with camera using WiFi. I has 3 options - direct, indoor, outdoor. I checked direct and indoor and galaxy s3 and ipad (iOs7) - works great. You have to download everio sync2 soft. Then do some simple setting with you camera (connect to home router for indoor) and you can see camera image on your device. You can start recording and make picuters from phone or tablet. Very nice feature. For outdoor monitoring - you should have external static IP. Didn't try this option.
Have no clue what you mean. If you mean 'have I used it to repair the camcorder'. The answer is no. If you mean "do I want an extended warranty on it?", the answer is HELL no.
The case covers the home button.
Yes. It requires no internet connection to monitor and record. You only need wifi if you want to watch it if you are away from home
i dont know where can be used i just no it cant be used in leland
Yes, you need a 4-wire (TRRS) cable to extend. You would have to search for them on Amazon, but you seem to know that it's a TRRS cable, so you should be fine.
The unit has a built in SIM card, you do not get to choose who the provider is. You simply pay the company a monthly fee. If you are asking will the tracking app work on a phone from straight talk, the answer is yes.
Yes.
Nope. Just the grip and two trays. One for 6aa and one for one EN-EL15. It's a real nice grip btw, and sometimes you can find deals on used ones (they're quite expensive new).
Yes thereby is wiggle... I was rather disappointed with the overall fit of this nikon product. If it wasn't for the fact that this deals with the battery I would've gone 3rd party for sure... However I've heard horror stories about 3rd party batteries and battery packs
This product works for the Samsung Tab2 10.1.
please order the item on the link :http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GGGBVDW it will be shipped from USA, and will take 3-7working days to arrvie you if your address is USA
Yes, it will fix it. But you have to make sure u have the right model for your device. The best way to do that is to open up your device, by cracking it open with a thin plastic item like a guitar pick; I used my finger nails. Go to YouTube and watch a few videos if you're not sure. You should see the model number right on the ribbon.
Have you contacted their customer support department? I had an issue with mine and they returned my email within a day with a solution to my problem.
As far as you can with two slots of laptop RAM. I was able to put 8GB in there and it improved performance a lot.
nope
I believe it is a digital monitor
My dvr won't work wish I hat got a name brand myself
Yes, as shown in the pictures.
Yes, the NVR software is included with the camera.
Yes hooks in like a regular speaker for car audio
As far as I know it should...I absolutely love the one I have..gives it more bulk to handle..and protects it....
It fits mine just fine.
yes.my son loves these
5.5" x 4.5" at it's tallest/widest. The speaker cone itself is 2.75" diameter.
Paul's TV delivered my tv and took the box with them, no glasses were left, so I just assumed they were still in the box. An email to Amazon customer service was a quick fix. They credited my original order for the cost of the glasses and I ordered them separately.
I have the 80 inch and it does that
I have this TV about 8.5ft from the couch an looks excellent you don distinguish the pixel at this distance, and the size of the image is like you be in a movie theater, i dont think you must have any problem if you look it a little bit away, about the bright you alway can adjust it but i dont think this could be a problem, i use it whit one of the image presets and the TV looks amazing.
No, this one is not compatible to your model tv; however Amazon does have a remote for five dollars that is compatible to your set. You have to check in product description. Good Luck...I'm very satisfied with my purchase.
No
No, it does not have AM
We did it with bungee cords :)
If you're talking about the actual cable, it can be replaced with any standard usb charger, such as an Android phone charger
No, it is for an htc one m7. It's a fake otterbox anyway. I returned mine for a full refund.
With really thin phones like my HTC One M7, it seemed to almost double the thickness of the phone. It was too much for me, so I ended up switching to a thin Dyztronic case with a screen protector film. Great protection with the Otter box, but sacrifices style for function, IMO.
It does not for us it works perfectly fine.
No it's made for the HTC one
Can't you just return it?
http://www.cctvcamerapros.com/Audio-Surveillance-Microphone-p/mic-cctv-02.htm that link as instructions and a mic compatible to this dvr but any mic should be fine that that has its power supply.
No I haven't but I'm using it thru Bacnet
Yes
No, power is only needed when using items that exceed your computer's usb maximum millivolt output.
I don't know if you can make DVDs but I have burned many CDs using the disk drive to listen to music in my car. So the drive isn't read only if that's what you mean. I'm sure you could make DVDs just might mean u need to download some special software I don't know. Wish I could say more! :^) happy holidays
3 usb 2 2.0 and 1 3.0 and yep it has a card reader, look at the websire stats mine is just a review, I'm not selling one
Mine died 4 months out. I bought refurbished with only 90 day warranty.
Theres a small Input button under the monitor next to the power button that lets you switch between your different inputs.
Yes
could not get it to work as the hotshoe on a HDR_560V does not work!! Major disapointment .
Lithium re chargeable! Been so long using it, no need to change...
not sure what the question is. in any case, the remote works very well with our Panasonic TV
yes
It works for the Panasonic Viera, so I'd expect it to work for the TC-p65sT30 as well.
No, wires are with this
Yes.
I have the rugged case on my 2013 nexus 7 and it fits fine. I actually think it fits better with the case than without.
All comes with one year full warranty.
Really good, wery happy with it!
Gently twist turn squish until it locks.
Yes it does have a hole cut for it
Yes!
With the way this charger works, it depends more on the battery model than the camera model; here are pictures of my camera's battery; if yours is the same it should work fine. http://i.imgur.com/yw5NjHs.jpg http://i.imgur.com/op5iGuM.jpg
It comes with remote
I have no idea.
The fan/exhaust from my power supply is facing downward and out of the case through the bottom vent. I have this case sitting on a desktop... and have not had any issues with heat. The feet on this case are about 1/2" tall and provide enough clearance for air to escape. I don't know what you are planning to set this case on... but if you put it in a normal place you should have no problems with heat.
Just use magnetic fan filters externally. You can find the here on amazon or athe Tiger Direct. That way you can just slide them of to clean when necessary
Yes, the Noctua NH-D15 is compatible with the CM Storm Scout 2. Make sure to check your RAM profile since RAM with tall heatsinks may interfere with the cooler.
If you already have a double din stereo it will, but you'll need the additional wire harness kit, and trim installation kit for your car.
Yes, it has a cutout. You can install aftermarket coolers without having to remove your motherboard.
Yes a 4 year old girl can hold it in. My 4 year old granddaughter play with the walkie talkies all the time
There is a port on the top, under a rubber flap.
I Don't think from the manufacture.
Hello. The exact dimensions of the unit are 7''W x 4"H x 7.25''D including the face panel.
Check your connections, or turn off power and disconnect the power outlet of the amplifier and reconnect in 15 seconds. If this doesn't work consult a qualified personnel.
Signal Processing HDMI features up to 4K Signal Processing features HDMI Pass-Through up to 4K This is right off the web specs by Pioneer.
The case can fit the Gigabyte geforce gtx 970 g1 gaming graphic card, but you will need to remove the upper hard drive cage to fit it.
It likely has nothing to do with the receiver. You may need to go to the cable/satellite receiver settings and change it to HDMI output.
You will have to "assign" the component being used as a component input (explained in the manual). It will do component and analog, like your older dvd player, cd player, ect. No s-video. It will play it through the hdmi, but the receiver will not convert the signal to hd.
Airplay works fine to zone2. HDMI, COAX and Optical digital sources will not.
mine was install by a professional,so i had no issues,i drop my car off to them at 9.30 am by 11am they call and said it was ready.must say everything works perfect love the back up camera.once the car in reverse the camera come on.hope that help
I do not have a GoPro 4 so I do not know a 100%. If it is the same housing as the 3 it will!
Yeah it has a webcam, it is not HD though.
The battery life is about what you would expect from any other laptop. That is unless you purchase and extended life battery.
Yes it can be used in USA but I do not recomend for 110, 119, 129
I'm not sure if you're asking like you want to watch your TV thru the surround sound or you want to hook up another component either way if you run it through RCA's and run itthrough the auxiliary it works fine
very easy. yes to sunrise/set
No, the band is far too large(width and diameter). You don't have a lot of room for much on that lens.
Nope just slap it on some metal and screw a nmo type antenna on it
pl 259 which is the male
Yes. It still works with Bluetooth
No, You do not need internet to listen to music on this device. If you listen to music through pandora or youtube, then yes it will use data on your plan. But, if you have music save in your phone, simply need to connect via aux or via bluetooth to listen.
Yea bro, its 3.5mm.. What is the male to female connector ?? If you dont mind me asking
no microphone
I don't.
Not if you can plug an Ethernet cable to in
I've not used the Zone function yet, however, I did check out the manual: Here's its detailed response: Good Luck! Zone Function &#9632; There is no sound &#12256; Audio signal from "NET", "USB" and "BLUETOOTH" input selector can be output for Zone function. Connect audio components using the analog audio (RCA) cable as audio signal from the components connected using HDMI or digital audio cable cannot be output for one function. Note that connected components may have to be setup to output analog audio signal.
no you just sync it to your xbox 360.
I was also frustrated that mounting the speakers were not straight forward. I solved the problem by ordering the following mounts from Amazon: VideoSecu 2 Black Universal Satellite Speaker Mounts / Brackets for Walls and Ceilings 1EH. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VFVQWS/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Good luck
Power!
If it was purchased new from an authorized dealer, or authorized internet dealer, there is a 2-year warranty on parts/labor. If purchased elsewhere, there is no warranty. You will probably need to ship it out order to get it fixed at an authorized service center as there's not many around.
Never used that option as I have an HTPC and PS3 and all my other PCs and DLNA devices such as tablets that I use for this
Yes they will both show up and be usable.
For me it wasn't a perfect fit. It did fit just not as tight and protective as I would of wanted it. The keyboard does come attached. Overall I did like this case though, the color is beautiful!
Honestly its not bad but the keys are really small making it hard to type and I just ended up putting back my old case on it with no keyboard.
It does not charge the iPad. It is just a case with a keyboard.
Well first thing you should do is get TB pro then back up all user apps and data and copy them to your PC .2) copy all your pics onto your PC or memory card. 3) sync your data to gmail account finally anything else you like to keep save it to your PC. After all this just get Samsung Galaxy note 8.0 Gt N5100 international version like I'm proudly sporting you'll get best of all the worlds , phone and tablet . then just transfer everything to it and you are done.
This pad is good for traveling around in world ... it 's good prefect size for reading , Movie ...it 's a easy way showing photo to grandmother , one thing , I dont like , it 's no Flash light ..Camera function is worset than my Galaxy note , it 's 95 % good for me .. Good seller help me so much , when I have a liitle problem . Seller good care of me .....
Yes
yes, it it equipped with threads on the bottom to attach to a monopod/tripod.
Battery should last for approx. 200 shots, but if you view & edit in between taking photos, or take video, it uses more battery life; if it's cold outside, the battery can also be affected. I always bring a backup charged battery just in case.
No, the radio cannot be charged via USB; however, there is a car charger/battery eliminator available that will allow it to be charged and operated off of your vehicle's cigarette lighter.
The knob is for on and off and controls volume.Love the radio, its well built ,easy to program and sounds really good.
it will not support 3840x2160 at all... check out the website. http://www.nvidia.com/object/product-quadro-600-us.html
I don't recall installing a driver. Are you going directly to nvidia? http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us Be sure to select exactly what is your looking for and choose the OS that you are running. I believe that have support available.
Also, OpenGL 3.2
You should not. The adapter has a 15 pin (female) connector on one end. If you are connecting to a monitor... just make sure your cable is 15 pin male...
I use it when I have to connect to a projector that is not HDMI compatible. This adapts your Surface Pro so you can connect to a projector with a VGA cable.
apparently all they will fit is an iPhone 5s
I have a Poloroid 7" tablet and it fits perfectly...someone earlier asked me if it actually contains 5 covers, but I couldn't find the packet at the time...I have found it now, and it does contain 5 covers. It seems to be good quality, and as little as I use my tablet, each should last quite a while.
You sure can, i got a bunch of them here in amazon http://www.amazon.com/Easyfashion-Electrode-Acupuncture-Adhesive-Massager/dp/B00D3ZYLVI/ref=pd_sim_hpc_1 for cheap!
Native (in camera) recording is 8 bit 4:2:0. So you compromise image quality by using internal memory.
I have a base and an extra handset and they both are exactly the same phone, so I would say you could just get the base set and be fine.
It should. It fit my 46 in tv.
This product is for Apple products like the ipad and iPhone. .. the usb portion is to charge the unit while in use...
if you mean antivirus, just choose your preference, I downloaded AVG and it has worked perfectly ..
Yes, internal rechargeable battery included.
All monitors show the same thing
This allows you to take one computer and split the video signal to multiple projectors. You can have up to 4 projectors displaying the same image. It is perfect for a large venue where one screen cannot be seen by everyone.
No. The Monterra has Wi-Fi and has the google android OS, so the google apps works just as they would on your phone or tablet. To use in areas where there is no Wi-Fi, I would recommend using your phone as a Wi-Fi hotspot and then connect your Monterra to your phone Wi-Fi hotspot. Or many carriers have a portable Wi-Fi hotspot as part of your service so your phone and Monterra will work where there is no Wi-Fi.
It's an upgrade. More mAh is better.
I think all models of U53 have the same battery, but if you want to make sure contact asus costumer service.
I have the Uniden DECT 6.0 and in the remotes I have a BT-1008. So I would say yes. R C Smith
Oh yes. Zoom works great with video. No shakiness at al.
I am not sure but it did not work in my phones and I did not know who to return them to.
Yes!
We use it daily and it works great, no problems ever with speed.
Yes
You will have to go into my computer and select the drive to open.
I'm not exactly sure, my guess would be around 10 pounds, I think the shipping charge was $15
You have a bad one then. It should connect to your PC and charge
Absolutely.
No, just a single record, and nothing is automated. You'll have to find something much more specialized and expensive for that.
It can play 33's, 45's or 78's.
I would suggest the amplifier. You can hook it up straight to speakers, but it still wont be very loud. Hope this helps.
I am not sure my daughter had it for 2 day and had to send it back because we had problems charging it so I thought it might of been defected but when I received the replacement the same thing hapend within 2-3 days so its not I good tablet to buy. Dont wast your money on it. NO BUENO
Well, it's being used for playing games only and that's all it does for the person we bought it for so it's hard to give a definite answer. Less than 3 hours. Hope that helps. Overall, I don't recommend this particular tablet, at all, for anyone. Good luck!
Yes it does.
Unplug it then plug it in again. make sure you do wait at least 15 minutes before unplugging and plugging back in again. for whatever reason it takes a few times of plugging and unplugging before it works. I three of these. one of them had this issue I don't know why but after the third time I plugged it in and waiting patiently for 15 minutes looking at a jelly bean jar the finally kicked over.
Yes richard at least u need wifi to search the net on the craig smart tv stick
To be honest, they should work with any Samsung HDTV version 2012 and above as they are Bluetooth. Samsung usually will update the consumer if they change any hardware spec versus compatibility with older models.
Rebecca Condon, The part number is (BN44-00659A), and it can be purchased from Samsung's Parts Department directly, or a replacement charger cable can be found here on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/T-Power-adapter-Samsung-Power-Adapter/dp/B00KQYD3MC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1404889158&sr=8-1&keywords=%28BN44-00659A%29 Thanks for your support of Samsung products. --Mr. S (BN44-00659A)
Not to my knowledge or experience.
I'm not sure I understand your question. Each of the HDD versions have a fixed memory. I ended up buying the SD version and added a 16GB SD Card. There may have been some overhead loss, but I think I got pretty close to 16GB of storage. (P.S. - For a couple of reasons, I eventually went with the SanDisk Wireless Flash Drive. 4 kids can watch 4 different movies, and the adults can listen to music)
If it is dual 4 ohm wire it in parallel and it will be a 2 ohm load on the amp which is 500 rms which should match it perfect
No it doesn't, but they are very inexpensive. Besides you won't need it once you've set its output.
No. This device is for when you want to go from an older computer without HDMI output to a display that has only HDMI, like some TVs.
USB outlet is on front in faceplate
No antenna mount, The camera fits inside with the standard antenna. I installed a Foscam F18910W.
metal. The dome is plastic.
Works just fine for both.
I leave mine in all the time. As long as the Bluetooth stays active on your phone it should still connect when you hit play.
Just hit the Phone button on your phone and dial as normal. If music is playing, it will stop in a second or two. When the call is ended, the music will start playing again. This is how it works on my iPhone.
you cannot use the mini-usb cable with apple products. If you look at the part of the Flex Smart that plugs into the car, you will find a USB port. Use the cable that came with the iphone (lightning charger) and connect to this regular USB port. You can now use your regular iphone cable to charge your iphone 5.
Yes the keyboard does light by hitting f5.
90 days. Thank you for your business with us.
I bought the Finite Hardback case ($7.99) and it works very well with this keyboard. The case is designed to pull the bottom out so it can up. You can plug in the dock the same way and keep it in the case. I would recommend both items together. I will post Pics of how I do it on the product page for both items. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CRU33H8/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Yes
Yes it has plenty of space for added drives and has an extra power cable.
Just tried them on my 3 year old. They stay put. A little loose, but for just sitting still they're stay on just fine. Also they're very light so they don't bother her at all. Hope this helps.
Hi Maria L., remote control for this Sony MDR-EX100IP/B will work only on compatible Apple devices like iPhones, iPod and iPad. It will not work on Android phones such as your Xperia Z3. -Ely
No mic, phones only.
The sound out of these headphones is great. You can hear a good bass. The question here now is, "will I buy this headphones again? Yes, I will buy them.
They completely close the ear canal.
This is fashioned for the Barnes and Noble Nook. Nook measurements are: Height: 9.46" (240.3 mm) Width: 6.41" (162.8 mm) Depth: 0.45" (11.4 mm) It fits the Nook HD+ 9 perfectly. It is important for screen view, access to controls and so on that the case fits well and is designed to be compatible with what it will cover. I'd recommend that you keep on looking for a brand made specifically for his tablet.
It was later at least A03, August 2013. I guess that depends a lot on the seller!
Buy a vga to DVI-D adapter and a DVI-D cable. Do not use a vga to HDMI cable with wide gamut monitor.
After connecting to the wireless card and using its web interface (ezshare.card/photo), I can only download from the card but not delete images on the card from that same web browser interface (the interface doesn't have a 'delete' option, just download). I have to delete images off the card using the camera or by inserting the card into a card-reader connected to the computer.
No it is not.
I put the stand on in about 30 seconds. Very easy and there are instructions if you ned them. I don't think I needed any tools, but I may have used a screwdriver. A butter knife works as well
Yes, it will show a 720p because it is 720p monitor :) 1080p IPS field monitors are way more expensive.
don't understand the question
No fee, no charge...ever. I will not going golfing without it.
The capacitor is not a battery,you will still need to have it charge and have a battery connected to cap.you will still need a battery to keep it charge. But if you have your Solar panel connected to a battery and cap then to pond pumps,yes it would work great......but solar panel by itself will not charge cap. Plus once you disconnected cap from battery the cap will lose power immediately. Solar panel will keep your battery charge and the cap will stop the pumps from draining battery
I would used this low of a cap. I would go with a 3 fared, or even a 5. I'm using this cap and It's great but I'm runny 1000 w and I still dim my lights
I had the floaty backdoor already installed so mounted like that fits quite tight

Sorry I don't know about the canon sx280. I know it did not fit Nikon s70. I believe it was because the Nikon was a waterproof camera and it was bulkier than a standard point and shoot.
I am not sure all I can say is camera I am using this case for is only 3 1/2 x2x1 and it fits with very little room to spare I do not think there is enough room left to fit your 4 inch camera
The Elitebook has a DisplayPort connector rather than HDMI. I bought a Rocketfish Display port to HDMI port cable and was able to connect to my TV and also to a projector. As long as you have a HDMI input on your monitor, I would think it would work.
Nope, that's only possible if you use XRAID (let the NAS auto handle the RAID levels). If you manually configure it as RAID1 initially using FlexRAID, you don't get the option to convert it to a RAID5 when you add in another disk later. You'll need to use at least 3 HDD to start with RAID5.
Hi Dan -- this is a network attached storage device, and as such your PC would access the NAS via the network connection. However, if your concern is access restriction, you can restrict access to other devices on the network in a variety of ways.
The phrasing is kind of confusing but I think what you're trying to say is that you're trying to connect a device with a HDMI output to a screen with a Component input. If that's the case, then no it won't work. This box turns a Component signal into an HDMI signal, not the other way around. If you're doing the opposite, then yes it should work.
Yes, it has a stereo headphone port in the rear. I connect it my old laptop with a cable that cost me $1.99.
The wall plug part that clips on is specific to the outlet shape use where sold. That can be adapted, of course and the unit does accept worldwide power (100-240 VAC @ 50/60 Hz). It's also worth noting that the output from the charger is high-current USB. A micro-USB cable is included. The charger is rather large and I travel with smaller ones for other devices (like my iPhone). Those chargers will also charge the speakers though perhaps a little slower than the included unit. Very flexible!
This works on Bluetooth technology this one has a 12 hour battery and can charge your devices the flip can not but the flip you can take calls thru it
I don't know, but this device is very durable. I've had it fall twice on concrete with no damage.
Yes, absolutely
Works with any MP3 player. It has an aux input for non bluetooth devices.
These by a long shot. I've wasted money on Beats headphones thinking they must have something going for them. Initial listening sounds good but after a few minutes the sound becomes tiresome. I would suggest that you give the Monsters a try. These are bright and accurate. The beats are murky.
I got a pair of these around Christmas time... as far as I know they're the same as the ones that are more expensive. Mine does have the switch for noise cancelling.
Yes, they still sound great. The batteries just allow for the noise cancellation feature that makes them sound awesome. We are very pleased with the product, the look, and the price point.
I've had nothing but trouble with these cables since I put them in. Switched back to our 100 ft cat 5e cables and problems went away.
I don't know why it wouldn't. I use a Pc with windows 7 and it works fine. It simply plugs into your computer with a USB cable which allows you to transfer your tape audio into a program like Audacity (there's one of these for MAC). Then, edit if you want and make your CD using MAC's equivalent of Windows Media Player or any other CD burner you're familiar with.
It may just be a matter of the settings on your computer. Mine automatically export to iTunes. I don't have it in front of me...so I'll try and give a more detailed/more helpful response later on.
Yes, it will work with Windows 8.1, I have tried it on three different Windows 8.1 systems (Lenovo yoga, Surface Pro and Asus) and haven't had any issues.
Yes, it can be used in Venezuela, but I am only sure that it will work with Digitel without any problems, I would not know if it will work with Movistar or Movilnet
If you have SIM from any carrier, it works any Global GSM system
like a glove
If I remember correctly, Windows 8 Pro product key is encrypted in BIOS. You can't see it (you see it only in BIOS in encrypted format). You never know the actual product key number and you will never lose it because it's on the chip in the computer. Windows 8 Pro software will pull it from there automatically when you install Windows 8 Pro from the disks provided in the package. Windows 7 Pro is currently installed through Windows 8 Pro Microsoft Downgrade Rights Licensing Program.
I don't know. It's designed specifically for the HTC One. Unless they are the same size, no.
It is made of lightweight aluminum.
I think you just have to be careful with your slides - compared to sliders costing several hundred dollars you are not going to get the same results but I've gotten great results with this by not overloading the weight and just taking my time.
If I am not mistaken it will fit all 2k models. If you are still unsure do a Google search to make sure before purchase. Hope this helps.
Yes
It has slots to plug in vertical stand. And it has many ways to use the slider vertical
Answer from Titantech: It fits 2010 Sportage. We have no online installation manual. The installation is easy.
I don't believe it would fit honestly. Based off of the images I've seen of the acer chromebook, the lay out of the keyboard is different than that of the MacBook. If you're still unsure, you can compare your laptop to images of the MacBook Pro and see for yourself. But I'm very sorry to say that it may not fit. I hope this helps! Have a great day!! :)
This drive come with the seagate dashboard backup software and its compatible with mac computer. The expansion drive comes with no software and is only a windows drive.
yup...I've used it many times already to move large files back and forth between my Windows desktop and my MacBook. And with the USB 3, it's very quick even for a lot of data. It's faboo!
Yes, is USB 2.0 compatible
That's the answer I'm looking for. I have tried to recover a very important file myself with no luck so far! Nothing in the instructions that even gets into recovering files. I am afraid we may have lost them forever!
INPUTS HDMI: 1 Component: 1 Composite: 1 (shared with component) PC: 1 RF Connector for Internal Tuner: 1 Ethernet: 1 USB 2.0: 1
No wifi
It only has 1 but I bought splitters and hooked up for more with no signal loss
the system is not wireless. there are wires from the reciever to the cameras and power to the head unit. there is a wireless remote. there is a single heavy cable with audio and video component jack at both ends, looks similar to s-video cable.
The videos are saved as MP4 files and can be edited with any software that supports the use of that type of file. I posted one directly to YouTube, after doing just a little editing using Windows Movie Maker. Hope this answer helps you out. Bob Plyler Kodiak Alaska
Nope
Not come with everything from the Sony website,only on
Yes, if you're creating a wireless bridge you'll need two. I use one in an office located about 300 feet away from the other; I get a strong (18mbps), reliable signal even at that distance!
Plug in the cable from the HIDEF port to your computer and Windows 7 asks if you want to download the files. I DO NOT try to use WiFi.
To answer your questions. No and Yes :)
No, its a separate software CD that comes with the recorder that you install onto your PC.
You're on Amazon - look it up!
Mine works in continuos auto focus on both my D800E and D4. Yes it has a bit of vignetting wide open. A couple stops down not so much.
It comes with a battery, camera & cables. I bought a quick charger (off brand) and another battery and it's worked great! If you want the case I would go for the bundle, but I wanted to choose the case that would work best for me.
Good news/Bad news, I like the video quality and the sound is good, however it seems to really deplete the battery, I was at 1/2 battery left and a 5 minute video left me with a dead battery. It's the biggest complaint that I have with the camera.
Nikon has a great reputation for its cameras, always wanted one. The price was very attractive. I am very satisfied with this camera. The 20.1 mp is fantastic, takes excellent pictures even in very low light situations. The rechargeable battery is also a good feature.
It was clear, when it would focus. It acted as if it couldn't focus most of the time.
You still have to purchase and put the memory card inside the camera so you can have greater storage capacity. SD cards can also be purchased on Amazon for very reasonable prices. 25 mb is very little memory. The SD card is required for all digital cameras just about.
I believe all my equipment came in one box.
No I don't believe they will. They need to be flat on both sides. Yamaha suggest not to use brackets but I have with no problems. I am unable to search my previous orders right now but they look like flat wall brackets on both sides. I wish I could give u a name... Sorry
It's just a regular camera with no view finder which I find VERY annoying and no wide angle lens. Its NOT an artistic camera like a Canon Rebel. I'm sorry I bought it.
Yes, it has a rechargeable battery.
L-3 3/4" x H-2 1/4" x W-3/4"
Yes it does.
Yes, I have only uploaded pictures from SD card & was very easy. Pop SD card into computer select which program you are using & it takes only a minute or so & you are ready to view.
no
Si funciona a 110 y 220w.Es exelente!!!
Yes, when it works.
Interpolated 120hz, kinda means it is 240 but not really. The TV is crap
Inside the front bottom pouch there are slots for pens and pencils. There is also a spot that holds a TI-84 calculator perfectly and another that will hold a cd case. There is also a smaller hidden pocket near the top of the bag that i use on occasion to put my wallet or receipts.
It depends on the Smart TV! Some recognize the unifying receiver and connect. Some do not.
yes it does. you will have to have a long headset cord, it's in the back.
Hi Mary,sorry I do not stream.Great tv though!
I keep virtual surround on and it sounds good. Ideally, you should get a sound bar for this tv.
Are you plugging the yellow cable in the green input? Just a suggestion off the top of my head :)
No. There are 3 ways you can hook up a DVD player, the HDMI being the best. RCA cable is one of the options.
I believe so
As with any USB device, unless it is designed to run from a router it can only be used by one device at a time. It is however the best long distance Wi-Fi antenna I have ever used.
YES.
Get your money back. Oh that's right you can't I'm still waiting on a call tag to return this because it doesn't work. Been waiting since May 25th
It does have mic labeled jacks but i use aux for my tv
yes u can. you use the AUX INPUT
Yes am/fm radio. Speakers are about 8.75w13.75h and 10.5" deep, Sub is 9.5w13.75h13.5d and 8x11.5x12 for the stereo
hey keith, i have had that problem before with another system and i had to buy another system. i would check youtube to see if there are any solutions to that problem.
It looks like 1 piece is smaller than the other but they are all of equal size! Amazing shelf system
My system is Pisector and it works perfectly. Not sure if it will work on anything other than Fortress or Pisector
No, Samsung sells a nice case with a neckstrap.
yes. this can be hooked up to a small home amp. That's exactly what I use for. I have a Fatman tube amp with no radio so I connected this device with a 1/8 jack to a pair of RCA plugs and it works perfectly.
Yes,but not a loop type.You record,hit stop,then hold down this ( &lt; ) and then to continue hit record to continue. Good luck!

Works fine, heavier cable than the OEM product.
Sorry I do not know the answer to that. I would doubt it though since there is not a complete seal with the various zipper compartments. I would think water could get in there.
32 wireless defense zone display (Zone#1 to 32) an d 7 wired defense zone display (Zone#91-97). Every defense zone can set independently arm, disarm, delay alarm and so on.
no but neither do many wide angle lenses.
I'll ship within 4days after your order.
Very easy. Hook up the USB or remove the data card and insert it into your PCs card reader. I use MS Photo Gallery. The data card is right next to the batteries.
No It doesn't
i contacted the seller and its only the screen.
Its a laptop screen
Yes this will need to be removed before docking
Should be the new design.
Yes
None as far as I know of. I purchased the 480 gig version and all that came with it was the SSD and an adapter to make it fit in a 9mm drive space if needed. The Crucial website sells software to assist in installing the SSD so check it out to see if that will help.
Yes it does
ipod 5th gen (as well as iphone 5c & 5s) has lightning port, so all charging accesories (including docks) will need to have lightning connector. Anything with an old 30 pin (very wide) connector will not work.
Yes. I have a iPod Touch with lightning connector. The Sony is an excellent bedside alarm integrated with the the iPod. I highly recommend.
I felt this was obsolete and returned it.
Jeremy, I wouldn't take no for an answer. It depends on the configuration of the bottom of your case. If it is not too thick, 2mm or less and the horizontal opening is 40 mm or more, it should work. I have another case that doesn't work because the horizontal opening is split into three openings. Hope this helps.
yes it works. Its been month since i bought it. Works normally.
It is a magnetic attachment so I doubt it would stay on if you dropped it. Also- it is only one sided to protect the screen so if you dropped it iPad down it wouldn't really offer any protection for the back. If you are worried about a protective case, I would buy an actual case. As far as a bluetooth keyboard goes it is a really nice product though.
That is correct, there is no cover to protect the back of the iPad. You could buy a jelly bean cover but that would increase the width of the product. The lack of protection is why I didn't keep the one I ordered.
my keyboard does not have this keys you mention... all keys work for me.
Yes all you need is the converter for the plugs
no it does not.
I tried this with a unit I purchased September 2014, and when I connect the Anker to the USB charger, it shuts off the USB ports. I was trying to use it to split a single 2A USB car charger to charge 2 phones at once, but it wouldn't do it. Both ports would shut off as soon as I connected this to the charger. In the end, I just charged one phone off this, and the other off the car adapter. Thankfully, it has capacity to spare.
This is made for strobes like the canon 550, 580, 600 etc. Any strop that would fit on top of your camera. You do not need a heavy light stand as the unit is very light weight. This is not for a studio strobe where you would need external power. Extra battery pack is a good thing though. The unit itself has all the tilts you should need. I use this on a medium to light light stand and have never had a problem.
You don't really "program it" but set up the unit to understand what models of units and which inputs and outputs attach everything together. Then the unit issues the commands to power on and activate the proper inputs and outputs. The website has tens of thousands of devices in its database.
You should have no problems. I use mt tablet & my computer. You will just have to tweek the projector settings for your 3D.
There is a hdmi input, but no output. I use a home theater system with amp and only send the video to the projector
Mine came in original LG packaging...make sure you are getting the US one and not the international one. It comes with one package of photo paper.
Hi Sorry don't know anything game machine or cable boxes. I just have it in the garage hooked up to a couple cheap speakers. It does work there. Once more sorry I can't help on your question.
I connect mine to a USB 2.0 port on my Mac Mini, and it works fine. It does charge an ipod, albeit slowly, but an ipad connected to it will not charge. All flash drives that I have connect to it just fine, and file transfers between my mac and drives work perfectly.
yep, even surface Pro
Yes of course, I have two of them chained.
No. It gets its power from the USB port. I have USB 3. It does a good job powering in my external hard drive.
When you have or use an USB Sync or Sync USB it is to transfer or scyncronize information from your computer to a device (eg. iPod) or to other computer. A 3.0 USB port is an adapter that you attach to your computer to turn one USB port into a multiple USB hub. It's a splitter. Your computer should be 3.0 USB compatible to be able to use a 3.0 USB hub. The USB port 3.0 is a high speed data transfer port, almost as fast as an Apple Thunderbolt port.
I plugged mine into my Mac via the USB and was able to transfer the files with no trouble.
I am not sure I know what a divider is either but when I looked on the menu and clicked on the third icon that looks like a pencil it has as one of the choices that says "Divide Current Position."
That's what I am using right now. Replace the rotating dasd with solid state. Wish I could do that on my desktop. I am not sure what that PC model is, but it will work. You must have a way to copy ALL data from old drive C:. I used some purchased utility to help. To be done only if you know what you are doing.
This is not suitable for gym because it drops quickly while running. S2 is made by metal so it is heavy to carry. For gym, you should prefer in ears like having extra plastic holder. Bose is good for gym and some sennheiser models are also OK
The shape looks pretty standard to me. I reckon you could use any tip and attach it on...But the box already comes with 5 extra tips... Good luck -Happy owner of a pair of Fidelios
This will only work with a computer that has an mSATA port, which is highly uncommon in a standard desktop PC. I would guess that you would want the 2.5 inch SATA I/II/III version of this product for your Presario. Look for model CT120M500SSD1 here on amazon.
I have replaced a drive, not in a VAIO but an HP entertainment laptop and it fits and works just fine.
Absolutely. Its a great and efficient laptop. I would certainly recommend it. Just realize that the screen is very small.
No The ram is soldered onto the mother board..
I had to call them for something else and the tech said I had a 14 month warranty.
Get a Yamaha.
We'll get this verified but it will surely work with Mac.
Unless in party mode(zone 1 and 2 linked); zone 2 will only play analog from local sources. Zone 2 will, however, play internet(pandora, airplay, spotify, etc) and network media independent of zone 1. You will have to step up to the A1030 to get digital zone 2 from local sources.
Yes it does
Not sure about XL 310, i used it for an XL340 but i believe it is the same family of mount. But my previous reveiw i said that it is bit loose and do not hold as fiem like the original (the gps can turn with the road vibrations)
Yeah , if that's all you need it for then yeah, it'll get the job done. But the radio part of it is not too thrilling
For what i know yes because im using them in 3 diferent sistems, and the 3 sistema can de text and idenfy the sensors
If it recharges your phone then it should work. Love mine on my kicker dock!
This will work if your speakers have a USB connection
Power is received when connected to a 30 pin connector power source 3.5mm input should work at this point

There are 2 micro USB ports (one works for memory/thumb/flash drive, and both work for mice/keyboards and power out). There is a micro HDMI port (standard) that will mirror exactly what is on the tablet to a TV (but with a 13.3" screen, that won;t get used much, like it does on my phone), and there is a microSD slot. All ports are uncovered. There is also a charging jack and a 1/8" audio jack.
Logitech keyboard groove is made only to fit the iPad and doesn't allow any back covers to fit entirely inside the slot. We have an alternative product that is compatible: http://www.amazon.com/LUVVITT-SILVERBACK-Protective-Back-Skin/dp/B00ATGWD00/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1387222342&sr=8-1&keywords=silverback+mini
Will start in the begunning.
No, it won't run off of the power cable... at least as far as I can tell
The case provides some protection when closed. When open it protects the back only, I also had to install a screen protector. As long as it is closed it will be protected. I am happy with mine.
Yes, as long as you have bluetooth it will work
It only has digital keystone correction and only vertical. Don't let that sway you though, this is an excellent projector! You just gotta take the time mounting it correctly.
I am wondering the same thing..... I was considering buying it until i noticed that. I mean, really, is this correct or was it meant to be days instead of months? I would love to have that clarified. Going on a vacation in a month but want to get the camera within the next week or so.
this camera has a threaded mount on the bottom, for a traditional tripod screw - you would need an adapter to go from this traditional screw mount to a go-pro like mount. I have not looked into if this adapter exists, but I would hope so, I want to use my xp200 on my ski helmet
I'm 50/50 on it. There are a lot of plusses for the 35 (1.3 stops faster, shallower DOF, phase detect autofocus points on the entire frame, image stabilization), but one big negative (twice the price). It's also less sharp, but it's not soft by a long shot. If you shoot in very low light, fast subjects, or video, the 35 is the better choice. Otherwise, the 30 is an excellent deal.
We apologize for any inconvenience. This item unfortunately is not sold by us, therefore we do not have the additional information requested. We are addressing this with Amazon as well. Thanks for your inquiry and again we apologize for the inconvenience.
Yes there is a charger
Hi Jose, I have had no issues with overheating and its been in the case for about two months.
It is the new model!
Yes
No it doesn't
I have had no problem with it sliding off any kind of surface. The little rubber part in the middle of the back does a great job holding it in place, but still slides easy enough in the pocket.
It says it comes with a lanyard but I don't recall because I didn't use it. sorry. it is a great case! No complaints
no it doesn't have a built in screen protector, but it comes with one.
It does fit the Galaxy S4 you model is the T-Mobile model the only difference is the T-Mobile software
Hi Paula. I used these rollers while traveling in Spain and they worked great. I think the voltage is automatic.
mine did.
yes it does
If I am not mistaking I think all MacBook keyboards are the same width even though the screen size is wider, so it should fit the keyboard. Just to be on the safe side go Apple's website to check the dimensions of the laptop. I hope this helps you.
No it is actually wonderful to type on! It's very soft and fits perfect over the keys. :) I love mine!! I have it in 5 colors
Yes that is what I have. It does the job for the price I paid for it. However my laptop doesn't travel much
no
NO, you do not need to pay anythings to use it. I was using it for over a year and i did not have any problem with it.
Yes, it does not move; but it's fairly large and covers a large area under your laptop.
Buy the same one as I have, I'm using a MacBook Air.
Im not sure. I am a droid user and I can do it from my phone. These cameras are nice. Go to your app store and look at some of them and just email the creator of the app if your not sure. allot of times they will list the cameras in the app description.
this is not poe, need other power source, regards
No and unfortunately I ended up dropping it a few times and the case broke. Had to switch to something different
Yes it will. However, if I had to do it all over again I would just get one of the addapters that plug into the cig lighter. that runs it through the radio. I have not been that happy with it.
This works with the base model (1831 and 1832 model code) 2013 Corollas. Will not work with S or LE models.
Yes it will but depending on your expectations. The lumens are enough we are currently using ours for school, it meets the need for the bucks. But if you are in advertising or high definitions is needed for your presentations, probably it will be better to invest in a more expensive model. If your presentations are more in-house I will say it ok, meets the needs and can be seen either in a darker room or with daylight with out any issue.
68 inches from end to end
I don't know. I had it on a Asus 10 inch Tablet. You need to order one for your memo pad. Type in the serial # or brand name of your memo pad and see if there is one available for it. You can also check out M-edge product too.
no does not fit, plugs openings don't match up. I returned it.
I have one on my Asus 10.1 Tablet and it works great for myself. I would not use this on a Tablet if a child is usually it. I also have an iPad and I have a M-Edge bumper on that one, which is much tougher and stronger and actually unbreakable for the iPad. I also have a M-Edge bumper on the grand children iPad. They are 4 yrs and 6 yrs old. They drop their iPad at least 4 times a day.
72 degree
Yes, it works great!! Best purchase to date.
Yes
Definitely not. This item and many other like it are absolute junk. In most areas these grid tie inverters are not legal. Most areas in fact.I would not suggest this item.
The output power will be nearly the same as the input power. If your panels are connected in parallel and in full sun light produce 150 watts you should get slightley less output. The grid tie inverter will match the voltage & frequency of your homes power. Make sure the panel voltage is in the range of the power inverters input voltage specs.
Yes, there is an opening for the camera eye and it is easy to take pictures. There are openings in the case for all IPad functions, including volume, on/off, power plug in, headphone jack, etc. It is a great case!
There is a space for earbuds to be plugged in w/o having to remove from case and you can take a picture w/o removing. I usually remove to take a picture because the case is a tad bulky but it is an easy slip back in. I love the case. It is very nice.
No, the compartment is not as long as the bag section.
Not sure about you camera but the mount screw that attaches it to your camera is a very standard size and fits all my cameras as well as my contour mount.
Not exactly sure cuz I've never used it for a long period. It's perfect for that charge when your device dies.
It is 60hz
If you're asking if they make a snap sound when plugging them into the socket, I'd say so, yes. I've used about a dozen of them so far and they do audibly snap into place.
110 degrees
it has motion detection feature, and yes you can watch live from any device anywhere
It's a 3.0 USB. It would work best if you had a 3.0 port. The only other issue I could foresee is if a surface pro 2 needs a different cable, like a mini or micro USB. If it doesn't work, I'm sure they will refund you within a reasonable time frame.
Hi Nicole, not a chance. Way too small. Cheers, Brent.
Yes, make sure it is 1080p - that is important. It should be but check. The auto settings on any should be off so your video chip/card takes over completely and non-conflicted. It is FINE as a monitor.
Hi Paul - the Mini T does not have any remote capabilities, but if the headphone output from your TV is variable (which most are) the level to that output will go up and down with the master volume so you can leave the Mini T set at a moderate level and adjust the overall volume on the TV itself. Hope this helps - let us know if you have any more questions.
There is no crack on the screen for jmsimportexport laptop. It's all clean.
its plugged into your computer so what ever program you are using on that. Its my daughters and she uses photo shop. Its not a stand alone tablet it has to be plugged into your laptop or pc. The only software it came with is to install it into your computer. I hope this has helped..
No. the Cintiq cannot stand in portrait mode. Your best bet is to remove the stand complete and work with the tablet on your lap.
Yes, we have it, thanks.
Yes

Lenses you cannot; with these camera you actually don't need any more lenses accessories yes! Hope this helps!
Yes the cord is removable and can be replaced. I suggest the v moda cord.
According to CNET these are superior sounding.
No
Mine did not come with a case.
Yes
This one is low profile. It only sits away from the wall the thickness of the bracket, maybe and inch or two to the back of the TV. I have gotten 2 of these. It is a little awkward getting additional wires hooked up after you have it mounted, but other than that, they are great.
It is very light ,but it is very good product I have 32'' tv on it
The lock is to protect your investment in your expensive TV. It makes more difficult for thieves. It is like having a lock on your gate to prevent people from entering your yard. It can be used in a common area where you have visitors. Also you can install it on RV or mobile homes to secure it in place. The lock is not a requirement but necessary on a case by case basis. Hope this answers your question. Thanks. Naresh
Fell apart 2 weeks after I got them, horrible!
Lenses are Zeikos (0.40x Fisheye), Xit Photo (2.2x Telephoto) and Vivitar (Close up Macro lenses). The first two lenses are usable until 70 mm aprox. above that value are useless. The macro lenses do not add expected zoom to the picture. The tripod is unstable with the camera weight. but probably works with another much more lighter camera. Really the kit is worthless except for the filters, the cleaning cloth and the cotton swabs. The camera super.
Photo Xit - Capture the spot - Pro Series 50" Tripod. on the bottom of the box it says Item # XT50TRS. Hope this helps.
xhm i bought this thing for gift but i asked my friend said its worked very slow and very bad machine and all times error error...
No it does not. It was jus shy of fitting
When this watch is not connected to GPS (time only mode), the battery lasts for at least 3 weeks. Connected to GPS, it should last over 6 hours. I have found that it is possible to connect the charging clamp to the watch and not be positioned to allow the connectors to touch. There are 2 small guide rods on the charging clamp, and these must be inserted in small holes on the watch. Otherwise, the connectors are not touching, and no charge results.
I have contacted Timex, and they are going to send me a replacement and see if that one works more accurately. I have only had the watch for 3 months. Hope it helps.
It doesn't work indoors
1 1/8"
Not sure if it will work for you but I have the same thing. I just zoom the phone only enough to get rid of. Of course you can zoom further if you like, I do that all the time
I am using it with the 55 inch UHD 9000 Samsung TV. It does work. I find the sound quality is better using an optical cable than the blutooth.
If you use the Samsung remote, you can control the sound bar regardless of whether or not you use the HDMI ARC feature. All recent (2011, at least) models of Samsung HDMI TVs have made the remotes compatible with other Samsung Audio/Video products (sound systems, Blu-ray players, etc). When you use a Samsung TV and Samsung soundbar, you can actually go one step further if you TV has the SoundShare feature; if you activate SoundShare you can connect wirelessly to the soundbar. Hope this helps!
Yes it does
Yes
Hello: Yes it does. Thanks Jim
Can't say but it works great on my galaxy s5.
There is no install. You just plug it in and set the mode (see the manual) and that is all.
Hi Ray..this unit CAN be set to operate continuously for an indefinite amount of time. It has two "timed" settings and just "on".
Battery is included. The memory card is a Micro S HC. For the money, this is a neat little camera.
It has an standard Jack. So I assume if the Roku 3 has a standard Jack it will work.
They don't "swivel" they adjust up and down to fit your head. Yes the fit over the ears
Hello John S. This is a good link for you Retrevo.com. Go to Manuals and Colby Manuals. This site offers free tech help. I don't have a car that has the aux plug in. I hope this helps. Take Care, Brent in No. Ariz.
Yes, you just need to download the application.
Google android, comes with google play store plus apps, android doesn't and it can not be added later. it is by special purchase ONLY, I found this out the hard way. through the piece of junk android I bought!
Hi, The AXESS never worked correctly. I contacted the seller several times during the first two-weeks I had the AXESS. They could not fix or replace the AXESS; but offered to sale me a second AXESS, at the original price. I felt this was just one of those Amazon scams. I am very un-happy! Thanks, Richard Daniel RMD Financial Corp. 1001 E 26th Ave. Denver, Colorado 80205 Phone: 855-300-6027 Cell Phone: 720-436-4832 Fax: 720-262-8994 rdaniel@rmdfc.net www.rmdfc.net
I just test these products . I am a software developer. This product is good for the price. I mean it is 120 something n is great value for the money. It is slower than the iPad and Samsung tabs. The clarity is not as clear. Very functional tablet n does everything the Samsung tab does which is more then the iPad Overall great value for the money
This unit have a problems with Skype out of the box. I have had no chance to troubleshoot the issue yet
yes all the hardware comes in the box. including wall mounting bolts/lag screws, and bolts to attach to the TV to hold to the mount
The weight is not an issue if mounted as per the included instructions. You would just need to confirm the standard 400 mm or 600 mm mounting pattern. You should be able to Google TV model and find out mounting pattern. I have this for my TV and it is the best and most durable for the price. I love it!
Yes, it is. It's very well built. I have a 42" LCD mounted on it and have no issues. Even with the arm fully extended, I am confident that it will hold.
Had it on a bell modular halmet works great
no, the LED lights don't seem to disengage, even when I powered the unit off and restarted it, I noticed that whatever settings I had active last will stay in effect until I use the remote to change them. The nightime LED's don't seem to have that much of impact on the performance of the camera at night - I didn't notice any difference. However, for $50, even a little bit of footage that can be seen at night is better than just "my word against their word".
First, be sure the rear camera is plugged into the correct socket also be sure the plug is fully inserted too. Turn the camera on, if the rear still doesn't show up press the silver button on the back of the main camera. This will scroll from displaying both to only front, to only rear. I believe it's the button with the down arrow on it.
If you have HDMI out, yes. If not I recommend getting an Apple TV device and bounce off of that to the TV. I use that config at home and at work to do what you are looking to do.
It is an International Warranty. I had never (fortunately!) any experience about application of warranty. Just in case, you've to find the national distributor of Tokina lenses and ask for the specific procedure.
I always use HOYA filters, never disappointed
Yes
Not sure what you mean. The noise cancellation is an on off switch and that's the only way it works. I haven't used this for calls, only listening. I imagine the noise canceling works with calls too.
The macros fit the 18-55mm lens, but the UV filters do not, even with the adapter. The adapter does not fit the 18-55mm lens. It's my fault for not checking the details, now I have to throw the UV filters away and order different ones.
I just received these for my birthday from my sister and the macro lens does not fit my 20-50mm lens for my NX1000 and I did not receive an adapter with this package. What do I need to do to get either the right size macro lenses or an adapter so they work?
Yes. VGA port or HDMI mini port.
There's no artificial "click" so he probably just meant the noise of typing. It's not a loud keyboard.
No - but the zoom is good and strong.
Yes it does have a neck strap and yes there was a tutorial CD.
Not that I know of
Can't say as my machine never worked and I had to return it. Good luck
I bought this model in the Fall of 2011. Don't know which is the best model as I have not purchased another.
I average about 100 or so pics. I never had my camera die on me while out but I always Carry a few extra batts with me in case.
head band isnt padded. but earphones are
i bought them for my husband to wear at work in heavy equipment and have heard no complaints from him whatsoever.
NO it doesn't. You have to provide the head. it just has a mount for one.
It is not compatible. Only work with Surface Pro 1 and Surface Pro 2.
Mine did not come with the two tripods. If I recall right, it came with the 2 small stands that raised it off the gound a few inches,like the one's depicted in the other photograph, but they weren't the tripods depicted in the photograph.
yes any 5vdc up to 2 amp charger with the same connector and positive center works
It has one installed and it plays videos beautifully. That's what our daughter uses her tablet for the most and she's never had any trouble.
yes; you can; its a great product for the price; my problem with it is that it slowed down once I loaded my data (but I had a lot of data to add to it); its great for a teenager, or someone who is relatively new to tablets.....ideal for a grandparent
yes, works perf but most any usb will work
I dont know if it would fit or not. sorry I cant help you
I usually charge every week or two but the longest I have gone before needing a charge is about two months. I use it daily too.
This is for the original iPad you'll need the ipad air zagg portfolio
Neither. The mini uses MOCA or Ethernet. The Roamio can create a MOCA network which will give you high speed over your existing coax line if you don't have Ethernet in the room where the Mini will be. See this review for more: http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/11/tivo-mini-review/
Yes.
All the info on the Mini I've read/learned from my own installation indicate that you cannot use WiFi for a mini. You need either a wired Ethernet connection or coax.
4 hours
Yes it includes the red filter and the mount
the part of the case with shapes and colors is glossy. The other part that looks teal or turquoise is matte its rubber. So you put the rubber case on then the plastic glossy colorful one on top.
I am using that adapter with a mac mini for one of my monitors and it works fine. The adapter itself has some issues with snow at times, but if you keep the extra USB plug externally powered (ie USB to wall plug adapter) it tends to help keep snow away.
Negative... You can not do that as well !!
It should, yes. It just has a video output on it that plugs in to your head unit.
No locks on the unit. But any thief will have to cut the wires. That would make it useless to them.
the product isn't even supported by apple, so the answer is NO.
Could never get it to work. Had a tech guy from work try and he could not get it to work. It is junk! Glad it did not cost much. Return it or try something else. Sorry!
IF you already had the movies on the Patriot. The problem is getting stuff from the iPad to the Patriot, from the Patriot to the iPad works fine.
I was curious about the same thing? Have you been able to find out yet? Also? Although this may sound like a stupid question, are you able to download these movies or music then take them with you in the car for example and let the kids in the back seat be able to watch them on their kindles?
No, there's no light embedded.
Yes.
Ipad 2 only since the ipad 1 has a diffrent screen
Yes, this will fix the shattered glass and you should not need to replace the LTD screen. If you can turn on the IPAD and the screen still is working then it does not need to be replaced. If want to purchase a glass panel I actually purchased 2 by mistake and will sell you one for $30 which has everything still in the box. Hope this helps. Dennis Schaefer
The flex c able is too short, completely useless product. When I tried to plug in it basically broke because of that.
Actually if you are good with jig saw puzzles it will be easy. There is a picture and all you have to find the corresponding piece. Really it is a piece of cake.
You will have to try and straighten the bent corners before replacing the front. If there are any rough spots, you will need to file or sand them down too. This will make for a better fit
Yes, it will work great with your camera. Note that it is a manual lens, it will not focus automatically and the aperture is set directly on the lens.
It will work as long as you have a USB outlet to recharge it. I take mine all over the world and simply recharge it via my laptop.
If that is a smart tv.then go to menu then skype and it will tell you what to use.The 100 and 200 work the same
If your Bravia has the Skype software installed, it will work. Check the Sony website to see if your particular model TV is listed. The camera is a good camera but the Skype/Sony app on the Bravia is pathetic. One expects modern interactive features and you get six year old software. :(
It should, I'm using it with windows 8 64bit
I know a 4s works
You can plug it into the wall but you would need a adapter part like the one that you use for your phone charger. The speakers come with a usb cord so that you can plug them into a computer for power, but if you plan on just plugging them into the wall like I did just use an old cell phone wall charger (the part the cord plugs into that is). Hope this helps!
Don't turn the screen off. You can put the screen into screen saver mode (scan) so the screen will stay dark until a camera detects motion. The screen will come on, during the recording, and then go black again. You can choose to record only the camera that triggers the recording, or record up to 4 cameras simultaneously.
No it doesn't have PTZ. digital zoom on viewer only
It uses Skype. Yes it alert me.
Hello. It has only the Apple connector (for battery charging and connection to a PC). It cannot host a flash drive, external HD, etc.
Probably tell him to call pay pal and ask
Sorry don't know
Yes this would work for the tab 2. I am not sure if any of them light up.
Hello, Purple should be available by Monday. thanks
I bought mine for the RT and it works pretty well. The title says it will fit the Pro 2, but with my case some of the holes for the speaker, charger, and such does not line up exactly on the RT. So maybe the holes will line up better with the Pro 2. even if they don't it's a good cheap case to protect it.
It's just one.
yes perfect
They make a plug that swaps single climate control to daul climate control. And vice versa, also it comes with rear camera video hook up and you just have to buy the camera.
Not sure. I only have a T3i. However if its got a sensor in the front it should
it was Windows 7
I don't know about yours but mine had corrupt files in it, I took it to the computer store and got it repaired. I will only buy a new one from now on. NO refurbished. Cost more to send it back for repairs than having it done local.
yes
I don't know the thickness of the Kindle, but my Audioamp180 will accommodate a thickness of from 8 to 10 centimeters. It might stretch another cm but I have heard of the legs breaking if pushed too far.
Sorry, I don't Know. I had to help with setting up my projector.
yes
It will NOT work with Surface RT or Surface 2, only the Surface Pro and Pro 2. The RT Surfaces don't have a Wacom digitizer, so they wouldn't be able to use this or any other Wacom based Stylus, only a capacitive stylus.
Yes, you can. The same kind of plug you use to recharge an iPod can be used to recharge this mp3 player.
I think sound quality is decent enough, specially when you put it into perspective that you are listening to music under water.
Idon't have a Benq MW523. It works perfectly with my Benq W1070. These glasses are 144Hz DLP-Link which are compatable with your BenQMW523 projector, so they should work. Thanks.
I tried it with my 10.1 2014, but the registration was off 1-2mm to the right of the tip. Wacom didn't say it wasn't compatible when I contacted them. But they had no answer as to why the registration was off, and didn't offer a solution. But maybe I had a bad pen? I didn't feel like giving it another try though, so I returned mine.
Hello SakeBoy, It took my SanDisk CompactFlash Extreme III 8.0GB card just fine, so it should work for your 4GB card. I really like it's small size. Cards fit snugly into slots so I know it's mounted correctly.
No. SIM cards are used to authenticate a phone with a carrier (an identification card if you will). Nowadays, smart phones store messages on the internal flash memory. If needed, though, most carriers keep a record messages; however, you'll need a lawyer or law-enforcement person to get them.
It rings until you answer on some rings and others it only rings once.
Cara, you would be able to fit it all in there, but the smaller school supplies will be loose. There are no real "pockets" inside the case, but it definitely has room for everything you've described.
i too had the same problem when i first connect it to the tv, the very extreme shaking. i blindly set my xbox one to 720p via pictures i found online. the converter will output in the resolution the xbox is set to.
Depends on what you play in the PS4. HDCP protected content will not pass. Non protected content should. Basically, don't expect to play BluRay movies through your PS4 while some games may or may not. This isn't a problem with the Kanex product. Every Kanex product (including this one) that I've used has worked very well.
Yes, it is powered and it needs to be plugged into a standard 110V outlet.
I was only able to stream audio.
Thanks for your question. As an authorized USA dealer we are provided access only to 110V products by the manufacturers that we represent. This is a fantastic sounding system. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Yamaha dealer.
Thanks for your question. The system comes with speaker cable of the gauge that the manufacturer recommends with and designs for the system. This is a fantastic sounding system. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Yamaha dealer.
No the wire with the system was sufficient, but that is using the conventional setup, which is putting the control center by the TV.
Yes it is
This camera takes AAA batteries
yes, i have a sr 80 and it fits perfectly.
3
Yes it does, probably by far one of the best cases for the money.
Yes , it supported not problem
The side with one is where u hook up cable from satellite. The other four are for cables that go to sat boxes on tv
Master Unit must be connected to the DC Power Port, SWiM ODU No power listed
I do not recognize any imbalance of signal strength going to the three tvs I have set up. Signal arrives at each without problem, including cable carrying preamp power back to antenna.
There's an app for android phones you need to download (kenwood music control app for android)
Not on the model sold at Amazon's USA site. It is a model specifically made for the North American market.
If I use full zoom (optical and digital combined is 50-80x) then yes, the images will be soft or pixelated. You might want to make sure you are also shooting with enough light, then you can lower your shutter speed. That will help with the fuzziness as well. I have mine set at 400 or 800 because I don't want to miss action shots, but then I need full sun or light. The more zoom you use the more soft the images will become. But I don't think it's any worse than other super zooms.
4" x 2.5" x 1.25"
Yes
Older film cameras came with a fixed focal length lens as part of the "kit", usually 50mm. Today's digital cameras come with a variable zoom lens of 18-55mm as part of the kit if you desire it. The EF part is the system used that lens mounts onto the body. The older Canon film cameras use a non-compatible FD mounting system. I have this lens and I have no complaints about it.
All EF and EF-S lenses will work on the t5i.....however.....if you are going to be recording video then the new 18-55 STM is what you really want to have. It will auto focus very quietly compared to the standard lenses. The older lenses can be quite noisy and the mics in the T5i will pick all that racket up. Now with the older lens I believe you could set it to manual focus and do fine, as long as the subject will be at a fixed distance. Hope I have helped you some. Rod
the T 5 i has better speed when using the movie function and it has more monitoring capabilities for better viewing of shoot then older versions! Lenses are different as well!
Yes it does and it's incredible. Just make sure you get a larger and fast SD card. I would say Class 10, 32 GB or bigger will do nicely.
I love it how it comes! I'd just go with what it comes with BUT DO order the telephoto lens because the one it comes with doesn't zoom well. And you save a ton if you get the extra lens when you order.
The card is formated in exFAT. I do not know if your phone supports it
Any card available, 32 or 64 GB...
Images can be transferred with Windows Explorer using the USB port on the camera connecting to the USB port of a PC through a USB cable without using WiFi. Another way is using a SD memory card reader connecting to a PC with the camera SD memory card in the card reader.
I've had mine for a few weeks. It is infinitely rotatable.
There really is not a difference between the two..
It should work with IP cameras. I'll have to check the specs. As for viewing, you can view 4 cameras on screen. 8 cameras or all 16 at the same time. Additionally, you can single out any camera to view full screen. Hope this helps
You need this plus a lightning adapter and Lightning-to-VGA Adapter.
Hi It is Intel Pentium G2120 3.10 GHz. Thanks, PCrush
Yes, it does have dual ports for monitors.
I,bought this for my grandson, when I ask him if it was good, he said he liked it, that's all the help I can give you. Edward
Yes
The exhaust fan in the back has a blue led light in it. It's not the most blue on the inside but through the window of the case it's pretty sweet
I think it would have but I just have a gtx500 with plenty of room.
It looks like all you would need is an adapter cable from the Macbook Pro mini displayport to VGA, which costs about $30 from the Apples Store or about $10 on Amazon. The reviews look generally positive.
I do not have a chrome book, but from my experience with the item dealing with android and Ubuntu this should work as a generic hub.
Absolutely, I do this all the time sitting on my couch.
yes it will. My mom has it connected to a HDTV as a second screen
Yes, in the base unit. Not in the tablet itself.
I never had that happen. Once in a while the keypad will pop up on screen only because I'm disconneted from bluetooth... Sounds like it's more of a problem with your setting adjustment on your ipad... Try turning your ipad off and rebooting... maybe that will clear it.
Not that I've noticed
Yes you can use these speakers with an iphone 5. It comes with the aux cord to plug into any headphone jack and play music out of the speakers!
Yes, it is
The tablet needs a usb hub or get a male micro to female but works great
USB charger
Not at all, it has little side vents for proper ventilation.
It doesn't work on Asus google 2013 7 inch tablet but not sure on the one u are asking about
I only used it with a Note-2. It worked great until it started becoming intermittent - seems like the contacts are wearing out? Anyhow, now it only works if i keep about 15lbs pressure applied to hold it in place ...
Yes, it kept my phone charged.
Hello Robert, We test this tablet on both the ATT and the T-Mobile network for 3G/4G reception. On T-Mobile this tablet uses the 1900MHz band for up to 4G download speeds. This tablet does not support the 1700MHz band. Best Regards, Mobile Tablet Shop
Hello, Yes, but make sure that the Straight Talk area that you are in supports either AT&T or T-Mobile. Best Regards, Mobile Tablet Shop
Yes you can. I had no trouble with it on an iPad2.
No...not this surround sound system...u want to look for one the the is compatible for wireless
You can use the Bulb function, at least on a Canon 5D mk3. Just set it on B(bulb) and hit the CAPTURE button (after focusing and setting the other parameters) and the Camranger) display will show a count in seconds on the CAPTURE button. Just click on the CAPTURE button again to stop the exposure. I think this would work very well on night sky exposures.
IE, Firefox and others. I use firefox and have no problems
Yes Any cameras will work with this QSee unit hope this helps I have used all brands with this unit in my shop thanks dellerin .
Yes
The 122 is the 2Ohm version and the 124 is the 4Ohm version.
My husband has eos 650 D and is evidently the same camera. He uses this case.
It looks like 3.75 inches for just the roller part.
I'd contact Clam Case for support issues. My case works fine except the fact that in now has cracks all along the bottom. All of the people I know who've purchased ones have the same issue. If you're within the return date, I'd return it because it's inevitable. http://imgur.com/5HQmqT1
I treat mine like a small laptop and keep it in my briefcase or backpack. I'm sure there are third party tablet sleeves or carrying pouches with a hand sling out there.
I have it on a Macbook Pro and works just fine. If I remember correctly the screen size is the same on a Pro and an Air, but I could be wrong. Sorry couldn't help any more than that.
1 year I think. I paid $286 by checking the new box below the item I was looking at that was $375 plus no tax or shipping. it was easy to set up like they said. plug and play that was what I hoped for because i'm old and techno challenged. igot it 2 weeks ago. so far I really like it.
It has to be connected to the router via an Ethernet cable for Internet access remotely.
110v a/c
Yes, they all are.
Yes, we will sell and ship to France but international shipping is not free
Hello, would be the main O/S Win 7 HP 32bit and some other utillity software that usually is installed from manufacturer.
I have purchased the "B" and "D" (There is no "C" lens) from eBay vendor "eletoponline365" who seems to be an exclusive OEM distributer for these parts. Because the wide angle "D" lens is relatively large it actually comes with an new case made for the lens. Caution: You must take the care of a "watch maker" to change the lens, as you are working with very delicate precision made parts and connectors. Only the 808 #16 is made to do this with. Search RCGroups.com for all the information you could possibly want, relating to model 808 #16.
The TV does have the typical L/R RCA Audio as part of the component cable section. However there is no analog video to go with it. The TV has HDMI ports, Component Cable Jacks, standard DTV/Coax output and one VGA output.
No
Yes
Yes, this will work in an S4 Mini.
yes
If you press the off button, then the light is red on the bottom of the television. I assume that that would mean it's in stand-by mode.
yes it comes with android 4.2.
Yes it is and its now name KODI
I took my E39 to the Dealer with the New SINO Radio CPU and they made all of the Installations.. They told me that they had no Problem with the Factory connections, I even have the Radio Controls from the Streering Working normally with the New SINO CPU.. So I am Happy. It gives the Car a New Ambient since it is 16 year old car and this CPU enhances the Interior plus the Rear biew Camera..
Sorry, I can't help you as I haven't had a chance to use the camcorder yet.
I do not know. I sold this because it was not wifi. I never used it.
You will need a metra dash kit 953305 and ant. Adp. 40cr10 and wiring harness depends if you have Bose or no Bose we could also sell this products Thank you Joe Tech

Both cameras record simultaneously an are viewable from the main screen. As far as I know there is no lag between cameras. I haven't tried the 64 gig SD card. I don't see why it couldn't work as long as it is a class 10 rating. 32 gig seems more than enough to capture a full driving day. If needed u could save each days recording to your computers hard drive so it doesn't get loop recorded the next day. I don't see a reason for this though. Best of luck.
There is a "format" feature in one of the menus. The manual is not very clear, you need to tinker with it, but you will find this menu.
It will not record when the engine is turn off and the battery power has been cut.
Yes the item comes with a power adapter.
The House Party Is smaller, Lower wattage with a smaller speaker. Ion lists a microphone as being included with the Party Rocker. The House Party Does not. Other than that the Controls and Features are the same.
If you are looking to connect your laptop using the red, white, and yellow jacks usually used for a VCR, etc, this will not work. I actually purchased this same adaptor and tried it but found after more research that you need a converter. I finally purchased the (search this) Sewell SW-23000 PC to TV Converter and it worked like a charm. It powers with a USB plug into your laptop so no power cord to outlet is necessary. Picture quality is about an 8 out of 10 for me but I'm very happy with it. Hope it helps!
yes, will do.
I'm not sure what your question is but yes you can write down anything with your stylus using your hand and than save it, ofcourse you would need a program like paint, illustrator, photosho, or any other. In your case you will probably need a program that recognizes hand drawn shapes and translates them to text.
Yes, I am using it with NEX 6's 16-50mm kit lens. I can't speak for 55-210 because I don't have it. I am also using it with Minolta legacy MD lens with NEX-MD adapater.
Should work,but I would expect fairly poor results from that lens,use a prime or shorter zoom
My boys could. Push one side down and pull apart. Hope you can
About average, nothing exceptional Just another antennaq. Good antennas are designed for single band use!
The zoom is manual. You set it when you hang the camera. It has a BNC female for the composite video out. I have two (of a 12 cam system) and they are wonderful.
We have approximately 2000 sq ft home, works where ever I'm at inside.
Yes, I'm having the same problem. It worked good for about a week, then it just stopped working.
Only music will stream to the dongle not phone conversations. When a call comes in, music audio is paused and the phone must used in speakerphone mode or held up to your ear.
Yes i think it will be a great fit
Yes you can. http://www.dish.com/technology/ces/
Yes, that's what I used it for 60" sony 1080p
I apologize for not answering your question properly. Yes, that cable will work for the combo headphones that have a microphone.
I doubt it. If your screw-in adapter cable is broken you can get a replacement on the lifeproof website.
I own a Canon 70D and works fine, it has the standard hotshoe. I think it would work with the 6D
Don't know...I have iPhone.....no problem...but so long as you have bluetooth can't see why it wouldn't work !
I don't I know but it is a great speaker can't beat it for the price.
Get the plus. You can decide later on to purchase a second one to link with it. Totally worth it. I have a classic as well and the plus is newer model and sounds better. Its a little bigger and louder, and longer battery life.
2.6" x 1.38" x .52" tall. The tallest point is the dial on the blue pot. Looks well made, but I haven't plugged it in yet. I'm no electrical engineer, jsyk
Only "OK circle" & "Guide/home" light up. You can press the "light" button to see them light up.
If you mean the thing that the end of the blower fits, I don't know. Mine did not come with one.
Well it seems made with silicon. It have been using for a while and works good.
I believe they will work with older USBs. There is nothing in the material that came with it that specifies anything other than USB....no numbers listed. So I'm assuming it will work with older USBs. Only problem sometimes is the connector shape or size...but you can always get adapters if that doesn't fit.
yes... you'll need extensions and to turn off caps lock
Ugh yeah power
I'm running mine on a 500watt PSU
Yes it does fit ipad air
at least 1 year if not 2. Check their web page out it says there..
I ws not able to figure it out, had to have a computer repair store to set it up. It is very hard to figure it out if you are not computer savey.
there is a VGA port and 2 HDMI ports, and I counted at least 4 on the back and 4 on the front 2.0 USB ports, as far as 3.0 I do not know hope this helps
Yes, you can order through amazon.ca
as long as you have a PSU with at least 300 watts you should be fine-- if the card needs a pci express cable, you may have to use a molex or sata to pci express adapter- just fyi
I got on the Panasonic site for you and ventured into the accessories section of this camcorder. It shows the VW-VBT190 battery as an accessory. You might want to look it up yourself by getting on Panasonic's site.
Yes
VW-BC10PP commonly listed as VW-BC10, so check carefully.
Yes
Yes. They work perfect!
Yes, but you should use a flat white wall, and do not open any lights.
Yes it does!
No, it does not.
You can use 3m all weather fasteners which allows you to remove it when needed, search for item: RFD7090. Cut the strips in half and it fits the mounting bracket perfectly!
Yes it works. You should have a permanent power source otherwise I dont know how long keeps the battery. The cam has a motion sensor also and you have to turn on the parking mode in the software.
No engine noise here. Does well.
The unit itself only comes with one DVD player that links to the 2nd monitor. So out of the box, no you can't watch two different DVDs at once. However you can hook up a 2nd portable DVD player to the 2nd monitor (not included in the original purchase) and then play a 2nd DVD. Hopefully that helps.
This is for 110v only. I was embarrassed with this beacuse I remembered this is for 110 to 240 volt use on ebay. But it wasnt for 240v. Dont buy this one if you only have 24v electricity.
No, no graphics card. This is an external hard drive meant for backing up files off your computer. It does have flash memory to increase the read and write times to the hard drive.
This isn't a computer. It's an external hard drive. There is no graphics card in it at all.
Marcel, it has been a few months since I bought (then returned) the unit. I recall it having a USB cable. Richard
Yes it is.
There is padding at the bottom.
Hi Bob, yes the Power Curve Mobile does work in countries with 220v and 240v. I checked with the manufacturer before I went to Europe and they confirmed. All was well and it worked perfectly on my trip. Hope that helps!
One plug into two and two USB ports.
No
I believe it is. I don't have this exact model but Philips usually is.
Yes has a web browser buit in to vist web sites and u can always download apps of those channel networks on googleplay
Yes
I was able to connect the HDMI port of my computer to the HDE 1080p HDMI converter and then to my VGA monitor with very good results.
It probably will however when the TV does not stand perpendicular to the floor.. One has to tighten the hinge. After a couple of use, it again needs tightening
Hello Jordi, I recently bought this projector for India where there is PAL system. I have not tested this with TV signal connected yet. I am using the projector mostly for movies, internet and games. I am guessing the PAL/NTSC should not be any issue. There is no problem with power supply (110/220) or power frequency (50/60 hz).
the input ports available are hdmi, component, rgb - to hdmi you can any device with an hdmi out port - your sony dvd if it has one, to the component in you could connect the att-uverse - the projector comes with a 3.5mm in to component female cable in which you could plug the component out from the uverse.
the pa77u has netflix and is newer than the pa75u. which i have but i use either my mac or ps3 so its netflix support is not necessary but is a great feature as a stand alone projecter. if that is what you are looking for get the pa77u.
Actually, I think it would probably fit a little better on a larger body. I use it on a D90 and I wear a medium size glove and I have to cinch the straps down about as tight as they will go in order to get a nice, secure fit around my hand.
You can tinker with a bit in parental settings, but it does not get much louder...much depends on the app you're running how loud it will get.
The different between the meep 2.0 tablet needs to be upgrade and the meep 4.0 come loaded with apps, games, e-books and more
No!!!! just face camera only
We weren't sure of this either but after some research online it seems that VRAMC4 is simply the latest software update for the operating system on this camera that provides new smart modes, remote view finder, and "S memo".
This is a computer monitor, not a TV.
I don't know
most thin laptops come with a mini hdmi port. You need to buy a DATASTREAM Gold Plated Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter up to 1080p Resolution for Microsoft Surface Pro Tablet , Toshiba , Dell , Lenovo , HP & More Laptops! and you can get it, as I did, on Amazon. Here's the link http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00917TBX0/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1.
D: I'd call the distance between the bottom edge of the monitor and the desk exactly 5 1/4 inch. There is no adjustment for the height, the high stance on the base is allow the monitor to rotate.
It does not come with built-in speakers.
@B.Smith, The monitor has two native ports: 1 HDMI, and 1 VGA. To be clear, the S23C570H does NOT have a DVI port (any version). Having said that, there are all sorts of DVI-&gt;HMDI adpater plugs and cables (check on-line). HDMI is becoming the standard because of speed, simplicity, and HDMI carries both video and audio. I use a mac video output-&gt;HDMI plug|converter through HDMI cable to the S23C570H; fabulous.
Nice monitor for watching dvds
No idea but the quality is outstanding. NTSC tuner so not sure what standards are in Australia (if Pal Secam, most likely won't work)
No Vesa mount.
yes, it is a great monitor. as far as you losing sound, I don't know as I have mine plugged into my desktop. I'm going to take a guess and say you are plugged in with an hdmi cable. try using a vga cable and see if that works. if it does, try googling problems with the hdmi plugged into a laptop. wish I could be of more help.
Yes. It has HDMI input. You will need an adapter for the mac to convert from their thunderbolt or display port to HDMI. That should cost less than 10. Good luck
Wow black sounds cool I wonder if you can see indecator if there are no lights on
That all depends on the device, most device when they see the Bluetooth you connect. Your device would have to allow you to choose multiple Bluetooth speakers at once.
The tablet and keyboard use Bluetooth to connect wirelessly to each other
There is an elastic holder for it right next to the screen. Totally functional, I think.... I don't use it.
Yes, the cover actually makes the keys easier to see. Illumination is good - around the keys as well add through the letters.
Av outputs
No. Im sorry.
Yes it does
Negative. The camera does not have wireless capability. Cable only
my broke in 2 months it will not work at all...skip this product!
It fixes my iPad 2
60hz
Yes, the TV comes NetFlix ready, and we have had no problems using it with our U-Verse subscription.
Didn't last two days won't buy anymore of them. I think they are using phone applications on a computer and it just does not work but it is cheaper for the people selling them. Hope this helps.
It supports online video, television, movies, music, radio.
No
yes it is. that's the one that the camera came with. however I recently purchased the one that goes up to 200mm I believe it is
Thats odd, maybe your mics arent working. Or you source is very far away. Have you tried doing a test video where you speak directly to the camera? If you cant take it back theres a hotshoe mic available for the cameras
Yes, it shall read all of them.
Plug the box into the socket and attach the wires to both REAR speakers. follow instructions to set t he audio performance. The rear speakers are not totally wireless. They need power from the box.
The specs are 28AWG/1P and 28AWG/2C. Hope this helps.
It has mini display port (thunderbolt compatible) on the small end, and a full size female HDMI on the other
Very durable. I travel worldwide with mine and have had no issues.
It should. Apple uses mini display port. You may have Apple's enhanced variant of it called Thunderbolt but either way the plug is the same. See this: http://www.cnet.com/news/confusing-mini-displayport-with-thunderbolt/
Speaker output 3WX2. I used it indoor sound very good. I try to use it out door not loud enough.
I just did it over night the top of my head it might be 6 hrs
Yes, this unit includes a short USB cable to connect to your computer. This cable is also the power source for the drive. If you need a longer cable, get a new one rather than using a USB extension cable. If you're connecting to a USB hub, make sure the hub is powered (has its own power supply).
I am using it with my MacBook Air (13-inch, Mid 2013) Part Number MD761LL/A, Model A1466. All of my peripherals are connected to it, including a Dell monitor (with proper adapter), and it works well, just as advertised. I am pretty pleased with it and highly recommend it. I hope this helps.
Hi Mary, Yes, item is available in: - Purple ( type B00C2C97MG inside search bar). - White/Red ( type B00C2C9NIY inside search bar).
Yes
It works.
Box says 5.4 Feet
No, it fits my regular Ipad perfect. It is open in the front so you can touch the screen so the mini would fall right out. I do love it though! It works perfectly and saved us the money of buying two IPads and two holders. :)
The MAXX is better plastic. And no there is no holster.
Personally, I don't feel that it is the best fit for even the regular s4. If I were you, I'd get the 5 layer ballistic or the one that slides in rather than clips onto your belt.
Yes. I've never used the belt clip.
The one I purchased was only the case itself. No holder/clip.
Yes
it is HP H8-1534. Thanks, Advancity
Yes, perfectly
No Rca plugs only one AUX port. You could get an aux splitter and send a signal from say a iPod to this and a different sound system though.
The sub woofer plugs into the sound bar and the sound bar plugs into the outlet
during the day they are color, at night they switch to black and white infrared
I have an attic where I ran the camera wires through the eves then plugged them into an outlet that is part of my attic light.
Aluminum, well constructed and designed to look like its part of the iPad
Yes, and even a small transformer such as the LC-100 will be enough for it: http://www.amazon.com/LiteFuze-LC-100US-100Watt-Voltage-Converter/dp/B00BQM9A2A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1386190277&sr=8-1&keywords=lc-100us
You might be fine, but I wouldn't just to be cautious. You'd be safe if you use any 3 or your 4 appliances at any given time.
Yes it will work well
120 volts
Hi Sorav No it does not have any bottle holder. thanks pawan singh
I do not have a 17 inch laptop but it should fit well.
Thanks for your question. The cover should be fitted for your laptop, please double confirm if your keyboard layout is exact same with listing second picture.
Thanks for your question, but we are sorry that this cover could not fit for your V5-572P. Thanks for your time.
Hello I might not be much help here but there is a template picture for this item. I also looked at plenty of pictures of your model and the keyboard layout looks the same to me. If you want to be absolutely sure contact the seller :). Also my friend's model is Acer Aspire E1-472G-6648. I also used this to compare
Thanks for your question. The cover can fit for your laptop. Since Acer has different model number sales in different region, we can not included all fitted laptop model number.
Symphonized is not listed on any of Comply's compatibility spreadsheets. However, I wouldn't recommend using comply tips even if they were listed, simply because the bass and mid boost associated with comply tips would make the already very warm/bassy sound of these earbuds almost unlistenable (in my opinion).
Haven't used the microphone yet. It's integrated on the ear bud line. I can't believe there's any noise cancelling. The sound on the ear buds is great. I've been using the buds to listen to audiobooks.
I respectfully suggest asking the manufacturer. Further information may be found at; { http://www.symphonizedaudio.com/info/About_Us } Good Luck Ms. Lynch. P.S. Suggested reading at; { http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/m/marcus_aurelius.html } Wish you the best. Cheers!/-
Both are "wireless" forms of data transmission but meet different requirements. Bluetooth technology is used to transfer information between two or more devices that are near each other when speed is not an issue: Smart phones, keyboards and mice. Wi-Fi is better suited for network applications that require a faster connection, farther range from the base station, and better security (if configured properly) than Bluetooth. http://www.diffen.com/difference/Bluetooth_vs_Wifi
The magnets do not affect the S - Pen at all. Mines works perfectly.
Yes, you can move the keyboard and use it in either landscape or portrait mode. The keyboard can easily be moved around as it is magnetic.
Pretty much yes. Go here for more info - http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/Home/AV-Receivers/Elite+Receivers/VSX-70
Yes. The mouse pointer will appear when you move the trackpoint and trackpoint scrolling also works.
I think so; but I only work fine with android 2.3 and 4.0.
You have to install the driver read the tutorials
I wouldn't think so. I believe the location of the speakers and home button are quite different.
It will do as you asked. I also purchased this: BUFFALO 8x USB 2.0 Portable DVD Writer - DVSM-PC58U2VB about a year ago and like it much more..Costs more but only requires one USB port for data and power. A great unit with 2 year warranty.
No. I could not fit my whole camera inside this bag. The title is misleading. Canon Powershot SX500 does not fit.
Don't know dint try
I really don't know. I have the a BP620 and it's perfect
Mine came pre programmed for the Blu ray player, Maybe try LG's website for directions
Hello WolverineUM: Yes these speakers get plugged into a 110v outlet. Only one rock gets plugged into a 110v outlet. The other speaker is connected to the amplified rock via included speaker wire. There is a diagram in one of the photos. We hope this help you .
I'm not sure but that's a great question. The speakers are so good and convenient, I'm honking about getting another set for my upstairs deck. The Bluetooth works flawlessly but since they don't have a driver for additional speakers you may be forced to get a second set. Call their Cust service. They were awesome. Nonetheless the speakers are top notch.
The whole thing is built like this: a shoe mount is attached to a ball mount attached to a claw-like phone mount. You can rotate the whole thing around the shoe mount, full 360. The ball mount can pivot up to roughly 45 off center, and rotate a full 360. The ball mount is 90 off the shoe mount, this lets you rotate a full 360 in both the x and/or y axis. Hope all that makes sense
I use it for my Canon 7D and 70D, hope this helps.
It works with any phone the size of a Galaxy S5 and even a bit larger.
When you plug in an external XLR mic, the camera defaults to recording from the external mic. If the mic is mono, you can record from the internal mic on the second audio channel, giving you a backup recording. The two mics will be synced with each other and with the video.
Only differences are the handle for XLR and infrared light for complete darkness. Otherwise all specs the same.
Yes. On page 81 of the operation manual it explains how to turn on the level meter as well as how to adjust the level.
Yes it works, I bought two for xa20.
Picture quality is excellent and stable. Water proof case works fine. Great product.
Hello, friend thank you for you contacting me. the battery is a built-in battery, do you want to change a battery ? what's kind of battery do you want to change ? I will ask for help from my technists about this . looking forward to hear from you. thank U so much ! have a nice day !
Dear friend, thank you for your e-mail. yes, you can take photos, VGA @120FPS Picture Resolution: 5MP (2592x1944), 16MP (4618x3464) Image format hope you like it. thank you
We have a Cadillac SRX which has a hump on the dash close to the window. We put it over the hump and it forms to whatever you put it on. Ours is right up by the window and works perfectly. I don't think there is a place it wouldn't work. We tried several places and decided to put it as close to the window as possible. Works great.
Cobra 7 band covers all of the radar spectrums. Cost? Less than a speed ing ticket.
Absolutely. I use it with my escort 9500ix and it's terrific. I just returned from a 1000 mile trip and it held the detector and didn't allow it to move even when I reached up to mute it. Very convenient, it allows you to quickly remove the detector and hide it; then quickly reinstall it again. Very, very, good product, can't stress how great it is!
Hi Louise. Thanks for the question. These 2 operate on different systems. So unfortunately the answer is no. These speakers work great with bluetooth phones, tablets and the like. Hope this helps. Contact AV-Express for more questions.
Yes they come mounts but you need the screws.
Hi Dan D. Thanks for the question. Seeing as this is a Bluetooth device, that is the only way to connect to it. Smart or wifi is not what is needed. A Bluetooth transmitter is what you will need to connect to the TV to get the performance you desire. It is a small device that is easy to connect to the speakers. It sends the signal wirelessly to the speakers. Hope this helps. Contact AV-Express with more questions.
Seems fine to me, i mounted them outside on a tree, stayed out all summer , no problems at all. I did actually wrap a layer of clear shrinkwrap arounnd them to be safe, but all on all pretty good, they had a good volume level, as well as a good Bluetooth range
i've had connection problems before, but i just "forget" the bluetooth device, and re-pair. that has helped. not sure if this helps you, though. i don't get any wifi interference. that may be a router issue. try restarting the router and, essentially, recreating your wifi environment.
It isn't meant to be used with Ipad Air.
I could not get it to charge and use keyboard at the same time.
Yes but it will be weak. You would need and amp.
If your car has a cigarette receptacle, then is a yes.
Yes, Automatically after 5 minutes on no movement and long as there is power supplied.
It loops through old routine files, but keeps events files whether triggered by the motion detector or the 'capture and keep' button.
I use a SanDisk 32GB SDHC card. Not sure if there is an upper capacity limit. The manufacturer recommends a class 10 card for the fastest read/write speeds.
Manual states that the USB port is for debugging/development. I connected the camera to USB phone charger, but the camera would not show any sign of life. I believe it doesn't power from USB, unfortunately...
I believe that's the case. However, I've not tested it with mine. I have 2 of them in 2 different cars and both have been hard wired to the fuse box with their own dedicated fuses. I've left my truck in the parking lot with everything enabled and haven't even come close to running down the battery.
Not quite good but much better vision than the others.
The default port it uses for the web interface is port 80.
Yes on both accounts. The built in DynDNS client gives you a web URL you can point any browser to to view the cam. You can also directly access the video feed using IP cam apps such as "IP Cam Viewer" and "TinyCam Monitor".
It works with the wanscam camera profile. We use ISpy (similar to Blue Iris). These devices are super low grade. They will stop working/stop responding, yank'em down replace with another unit and then reset to factory default then reconfigure and it is ready for when your replacement unit fails to respond... Good luck! We are replacing these with either AXIS or Bosch no more cheap Chinese knockoffs. PS these don't allow you to modify the FTP name to be over writeable, which is why we had to use ISpy software...
I use mine with on my Apple iPhone 6 with the life proof case. It works perfectly on the Square cc system. Should work with yours as well.
I don't know what that is... I bought it to emulate floppy for a AKAI MPC 2000xl so what it does for me is emulates the equivalent of 300 1.3mb sized floppy disks
I purchase this for a musical keyboard and is perfect. Is not so simple format the usb stick but when you understand how it works is quite clear.
I would guess yes it does, I know it works with embroidery machines. Check out your current drive if it's standard power plug and data cable for floppy, this should work. Te biggest problem is formatting your thumb drive properly, I have some links to the software if you need it.
It already has a micro plug in it. No need to buy an adapter.
Yes, it is fully functional while charging.
It will not stream Amazon Prime. I sent it back and got a Sony Blu-Ray Disc DVD player.
I would suggest that you find a regular build for the input in the range of what you need, instead of modifying the board. You would need to change more than just the caps, you need to perform analysis on all the other elements on the board in conjunction. The voltage regulators on board is most likely too weak for your application.
No
yep there is at least one extra bay, or you can of course use a external USB 3.0 drive
They are both FM2 sockets it will mount and this motherboard should be able to handle it but the north bridge isn't as fast as the a10
No. The Beoplay H6 sounds tinny, and would not be a good choice for professional studio work. Sorry.
The headphone has a 3 1/2" diameter, of which the internal area measures 2". The leather ring making is soft and extremely comfortable on my earlobes and outer edges of my ear. I tend to where the phones for long periods of time. No discomfort whatsoever. Hope my experience proves useful.
Yes to the CANON Phottix Mitros TTL.
Hi Jim G., yes this Sony TDG-BT500A will work on your Sony 55W829. They both active 3D. -Ely
You bet, just use the correct box per Orion's specs (page 21 for this amp) - http://www.directeddealers.com/manuals/OG/Orion/GHCCA102%202008-11MLweb2.pdf
Yes, they should work on your Dell Optiplex 620. I have a desktop of that vintage and these modules worked on mine. Here's a suggestion: Go to Crucial.com and take advantage of their memory scanner-----this will verify the kind of memory modules your computer needs-----this doesn't commit you to buying theirs.
I don't know if it will work with your PC. Check at someplace like crucial.com. It is only 2GB, two one-Gig sticks.
Yes it's increased my video and picture viewing significantly. You have two slots so go for it!
Non-ECC.
Generally that is true, but if you mix the speeds, the PC will use the lowest one.
Yes
Not to add, but bo replace
Try the Crucial website - www.crucial.com -they have an excellent detailed compatibility info service called 'Crucial Memory Advisor' tool. It solved my problem by definitely telling me that PC5300 DDR2 memory was perfectly compatible on my old Dell system which called for PC3200 DDR2 - PC3200 DDR2 is practically unobtainable now. I bought the PC5300 and it DID work perfectly. Thank you Crucial. BTW, the PC5300 I bought was not made by Crucial - I am NOT a salesman for Crucial!
No, but so far I haven't encountered any problems with it.
No! O doesn't work at all! I wasted my money!
Sorry don't know, I use it on an iPad.
Haven't had any issues what so ever, I have a ethernet connection so it's always on par. Other reviews have stated the wifi is really good.
I plugged a HDMI cable from my computer to the HDMI port and changed the input on my TV
Yes, I would say you can. As long as your using Bluetooth it will work.
Yes there is.
It is a flat tray, i have used it for my 6 and my iPad. Because its flat vs a cradle it accommodates any device with that style connection so yes, you are all good with the bigger six. listening to it right now, damn nice sound ;-)
Very basic. Can't really mess up the memory b/c it can only go in one way and the same goes with the SSD. I didnt install a wifi card so I can't speak to that.
I use it all the time with Netflix. Works flawlessly (whenever Comcast is cooperating).
They are not standard speaker wire, it is a single plug connection like a fire wire for each speaker. The subwoofer has 2 cords because one is for the lights on the speaker and one is the speaker hook up. Each speaker overall has about 5 foot length of wire. I highly recommend these speakers. They are by far the best stereo system I have bought and I have never had any trouble with them.
I do believe you can, even though i havent tried it. There is a red and white aux plug in the back.
Yes
This computer has only a web cam.
My kids got me these spealers last Christmas (2013) and I long ago stopped using them. There is a loud background hiss, and popping noises on the bass unless turned down really soft. The bluetooth worked fine with my 5-year-old HP laptop, but really that is irrelevant under the circumstances.
Mixes both, it's one of my favorite features.
I think you would have to unplug the jack in order to run bluetooth. I think the jack over rides the bluetooth input.
Yes and it works very well
Just tested it. Goes to maybe 30 degrees either way.
No, but Kicker did come out with a bluetooth version of this speaker system that you can do that with.
The only thing I can tell you is the plug is the same size as the iPhone plug for the wall charger and that it's able to move(flap)back and forth. Just thinking about now I would have to say that the iPhone with outer box on would not fit.
Yes. But hold it very steady.
The batteries work great with my D3200, had them for about a month now with no problems. Glad I got them
We do not ship to your location .
Dear customer: I will have to look into this issue.
The only way if you installed a password, you have to put the password back to open it.
Yes it is, similar to MacBook Pro. I believe it is an Aluminum unibody construction with rubber/synthetic bottom.
So only the very top is displaying?
It is 1".
Yes, device drivers are available from DisplayLink.
Mine doesn't. In fact mine was slightly to lose and wouldn't stand up by its self. but I just tightened it. also if it does squeak you just need to loosen the bottom part. I think if the squeak is something that's deciding whether you buy it or not, it shouldn't its great product and IF it does the squeak its a very quick fix.
Base AND head! This thing rocks. I bought it as a second mono for my second shooters....I use it, my second shooters get my Manfrotto. Head quicly pops off and I use on my slider/jib too. I love it.
Yes this comes with a quick release plate.
Yes its the same exact as the manfrotto quick release. If you need to know more about the monopod, theres a couple of videos showing the benro monopod, also comparisons of the benro and manfrotto monopod.
The feet is made for stabalizing your spin and tilt so the it doesn't slip from under you. It's not designed to hold your camera unattended.
Hi Steven, Wish I could be more helpful, but I have never tried to use a camera with a telescope. I suggest you call Orion and ask for Tech Support. The number is (800) 676-1343. Hope you're able to get an answer to your question. Cordially, Joe Romaninsky
I bought the Nikon Monarch 8x42 first, then the Bushnell Legend 8x42, both made in China. The optical quality of the two is very close the same within the smaller Nikon FOV. The Bushnell are much bigger and heavier, but the larger FOV can be a plus. The Nikon have a crisper focus.
if you go to the nikon website all that information is available.
China.
Yes
Mine came with 64 bit
One
After researching thru Amazon, the SX 520 HS will accept the 58mm adapter ring. It fits very nicely on my SX 50 HS. I wanted to use a UV filter primarily for lens protection so I had to get the adapter. Also Amazon has a 67mm adapter ring that will fit your 520 with corresponding filters.
No, not one that is a plug in the wall type, but it does charge by plugging into computer USB, and the power last four about 3 hours of continue play time.
No, it has an alarm clock mode but no timer for radio or music on/off. The long silver bar shown on the top is decoration only and not a functional button.
Yes, Code/download your music to mp3/mp4 and copy/move to stick. Use Audacity, freeware or Quick Media Converter Version 4.5.0.6, freeware to convert wma wmv etc to mp3 The mini mp3 player is very nice and plays very loudly. I bought that and several others from that company. All work well and I do not need bluetooth in remote areas of the house. Use TagScanner 5.1.643 freeware to build collection and MP3Gain freeware to level loudness etc. All program easy to medium to use Mike
It's 54"
For right now, on HDMI 4K is displayed at 30 HZ and that is a HDMI limitation. HDMI 2.0 fixes that and this set should be upgraded in firmware before 2014. Then it will be 60 HZ and then it's a video card question on how fast it can display 4K.
The dock fits the iPhone 6 and functions perfectly, but not the 6 Plus.
Yes, it works good with my iPhone6 (even with a case). Not sure about 6+, the cased iPhone6 does not leave much space there.
I've been using one for about six months, and it's not tipped forward or backward. I think that this is because the wheels are mounted right on the rear edge, so protrude by maybe an inch, and the base support at the front is under the outer fullsize pocket that the center of gravity stays within these three points.
It is good working order and I have not had any problems. Only problem, XP is now out. Recommend you get a Windows 7 unit.
NO
yes i can call and receive call on both sim,and it works on my ATT and other network, the only problem i saw is the small text size of sms
Hi We haven't test the device yet, but it should work because ATIV 700 has Windows 8 OS. Our keyboard is working with Android 3.0-4.4 or Windows XP/Vista/7/8.
This is a great mouse. But it mostly is aimed at alleviating wrist discomfort.if your shoulder is what is bothering you, I would recommend assessing your chair and desk set up.
I'm not sure. I was having issues with my elbow and so I got this mouse to help with relieving pressure and "correct" my hand position. Prior to this I used a trackball mouse.
No its not. I own a pair and mine was never done that. They will get some distortion like they are trying to pick up another wavelength or something. That's the only problem I've had out of mine and that has only happens once.
yes they are
Gene, Sorry - there should have been one in the box. We can email you one if you go to our website and send an email from there. Or we can mail you one. So sorry for this. Regards, Don
Yes. We have the same brand tv but the 9000 series on it.
Fits great but the charge cord doesn't fit well when it's on
Yes
Yes it will charge you S3 and will pick up NFC by tapping it. Im sure it could charge both if the adapter went from usb to a splitter
sorry I don't know about the US, I brought the model just to work on wi-fi, not 3G or 4G
Not that I know about, although you can download any app from Samsung or Google app stores and if they have an app that will do that then you would be able too. It has decent voice control if you are in close range.
Yes
Griller, when I purchased these cables they were (2) 10' for this price. I used each of them to extend power to my two inside Foscam IP-Cameras.
It comes with a USB cable that you can plug into your computer. I purchased this as well- http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HQORGQO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and it came with a car charger as well as a wall charger.
excellent quality amazed by the after shots this camera is a beauty takes great photos driving,walking,running the 16 mega-pixels do the trick good investing
I bought this for my parents and a community center. It streams very well for their video/Netflix needs.
Yes, it can be used in repeater mode with your N-150 Router. Best!
5x optical zoom plus digital zoom
Would certainly say any reports such as this are incorrect. Reviewer samples are not paid by the company and are given away to select reviewers for an "honest" assessment. There would be no hidden agenda for supplying a reviewer with a "one off" build that contains higher end parts than what is claimed as this would surely be discovered over time.
I do not believe that the PROfolio has backlit keys. The PROfolio+ (which I have) has backlit keys. Check the videos for each. Only the "+" mentions backlit keys.
I am not SURE. But....when I ordered my second keyboard, I made an attempt to make sure I was ordering the correct one for my iPad 2. I was told that there were very few changes and the keyboard would fit all generations of iPads.
According to another website, 40 Root Mean Square and 80 peak.
Good Morning, I apologize but you would have to contact the manufacturer for that information. Thank you.

I use Nero.
The SBB cann't program a 2008 Jeep. But CK100 can program it.
No, its toylike- I couldn't get mine to work It looks and feels like a kid toy
I have run this relay module on 9volts for 2 days and it still works fine. Bob siegel
Yes
I haven't had to charge mine in a while, by my recollection is that when you plug in the charge a light on the side will be read (uncharged) and will turn green when the device is fully charged.
Hi Vivian, We do not have any case that can fit iPad 1st gen. We only have cases for iPad 2, 3, 4, Mini and Air. Hope that helps. Kind Regards, Angie/ECO-FUSED
To tell you the truth I bought this to record conversation. I couldn't make heads or tails of the *instruction manual* either. The only way I figured out how to record was by trial and error. It sure comes with enough cords. I guess you could just sit down and go into Sherlock Holmes mode and try to figure it out. Wish I could be of more assistance here but I'm a real techno idgit.
thank you for the question actually I returned it back as it didnt match my requirements using it in big room, regarding resolution and illumination (lumins units) wish to help you more :)
Don't know go by the screen size ....
it has a glossy bezel.
"VGA, DVI-D with HDCP ports" so no. please consider reading next time.
Yes, it works with any Bluetooth device. I use it with IPhone, Galaxy S2 and IPad. Great sound for its size. I also use it as a speaker phone in the car.
Yes, you can play music while charging.
I bought this for my husband and I believe he used the ac dongle for his IPAD. The connector for the DIVOOM is the same style.
I do not know, sorry.
yes you can try to find them on internet, I did the same, I loaded the maps from Costa Rica
5 an a half in
This big box is 2.25 per sideafter all displacements. Tuned to 40 but I measured 38hz.
Its only on the outside not on the inside. Better sound quality
Hi Rhonda. Yes it absolutely will. I've deployed it at the company I support with the same issue and it's working flawlessly and it was easy to install.
Hi I'm using it for my MackBook air 13.3" It's good, I like it. Thanks
Yes it does !
No it doesn't require an MBox. Pro Tools 11 will work with most interfaces, and you can find a list of compatible ones on the Avid website. Also, you don't need to have the interface connected for Pro Tools to open...which means that you can work on your mixes without having to be tied down to your interface.
No. As far as I know it works only on Taichi laptops.
I use it for my 13inch Macbook pro with retina and It fits well but with some wiggle room. It may be a little loose on a Macbook air.

This wireless router should work like any other wireless router. If you have a WiFi printer, you should be able to add it to the network, and find it with your Mac/PC/Tablet, etc.
Yes you should be able to use noctua's nh-u14s heat sink. Just make and double check if your case can house it, because it's a massive heat sink. Some case don't support it. Here's a link to noctua's website for further assistance. http://www.noctua.at/main.php?show=productview&products_id=64&lng=en
Yes. I am currently using it with a Sony PJ790V. It is a good tripod and works great with the Sony PJ790.
I wear them with my sunglasses all the time. No problem.
I a pretty sweaty person... and for me it works fine. They are made fairly well and clean up easy with a tissue and rubbing alcohol.
I can't be 100% certain of that but the box claims they should work with any Bluetooth enabled device. The box mentions that they are "compatible with almost all smartphones". That should mean Android and Windows Phone. It's a good question as the box only mentions Apple by name as opposed to anything else, but it does mention compatibility with other devices so these should work. Again, I can't say for sure, just going by what the box says.
Yes. 1000 indicates that it is gigabit ethernet (GbE).
Yes it will work with your ASUS VivoBook X202
all tablets now are all wifi capable...theres no place anymore to plug in phone lines
About 2 1/2 feet long. Its a pretty good length
It's either/or depending on the network that you choose. one will say "networkname" and the other "networkname.5GHz"
Yes, the bag is included.
Yes it will i have the same blue ray player
No this is not the remote you need for your Blu Ray. You need AK59-00166A.
Yes, the ipad mini (thats not retina) will work with this case. A version of the iPad mini retina will be released very soon.
It is extremely stable. The top part twists around so it can lay flat against the keyboard, but it does not hold the iPad in portrait mode - only horizontally.
Yes!
Yes
Yes
You can change the songs in a single folder using the buttons on your steering wheel.. But you would need to change the discs (folders) from the actual player on your dashboard. It is usually the last two buttons to move forward and backward.
Yes. The 2.5 inch height is what you need. I think your controller is SATA II and this is III. That won't matter, it will fall back to your controller speed.
uses AAA batteries
YES
Yes it will. All the intel based macs use a standard SATA 2.5" hard drive. If you are upgrading to a larger capacity drive for more space don't forget to buy a SATA to usb adapter so you can clone your existing drive. And don't use the software that comes with the adapter, download Carbon Copy Cloner, it's the best and it's freeware!
36 inches
I use this with 2 ubuntu machines, a windows machine and my raspberry pi. It's a great little keyboard.
Yes, it works well with Surface RT.
No.
I have not used ispy but you can remote view if you setup ddns on the cam or on the router along with port forwarding. You should not have trouble accessing it remotely with the app of your choice.
I used this one in several rooms, one of which holds that Sharp you mention. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WYVBR0/ref=oh_details_o01_s03_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 As for the holes, there is a template that comes with the mount to mark your wall. And it does nicely fit the Sharp.
This wire is All copper - no aluminum as far as I can tell.
Hello Joseph, In the product description we mention that the cable is unshielded twisted pure copper. Please let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you, Taylor W. VIVO
Hello! This cable is solid copper.
It is very close. No stylus that I've used is perfect, but this is by far the closest to a pencil or fine point pen that I've used.
Yes, but I have not hooked that part of it up yet. It seems to have a lot of things I have not yet connected. Extremely satisfied with the purchase however.
Yes. The ear buds come with a variety a difference sized adapters.
What is your question
It's just audio. If you want to stream video, you'll need the Apple TV
No, just the bigger IPad.
Only if you have an alternate power source.
I believe that you can only play one movie on two devices at same time. I do not have the product with me at the moment but have sold quite a few and that is my understanding.
Yes
Yes, two buttons. One adjusts volume and the other turns device on or off or sets up for coupling. Two plug in ports, one for charging the device ONLY, and the other port allows the headphones to act without Bluetooth connection. Cords for both plug-ins are included.
I tested the device: Iphone its ok Computer its ok But in PlayStation 4 not ok.
I had a something like that happen but only because of a bad connection with my cables and I was trying to do a dual monitor with a lesser resolution. FixING the cables and getting a better second monitor fixed it for me. Hope you didn't just get a bad monitor
Hi . Yes it can also lay flat when you are using int. Bye
Yes, it will work just fine with a wireless adapter. I use an Iogear adapter with wps setup. It works just fine and is unobtrusive.
Yes. One of the advantages of this product over previous high-end Denon amps is that it has digital-to-analog decoders not just for Zone 1, but also Zones 2 and 3. This means digital input from Apple TV HDMI results in signal to Zone 2 and 3 analog preamp outputs. If you are using the amp in 5.1 mode, you also get amplified speaker outputs for Zone 2 with the 2 spare amps (since this is a 7.1 amp). We bought this amplifier for this reason, and I am happy with the result.
Ray, I have 3 doubles plus 1 and and hooked up per directions. They are Bose speakers in wall wired as well. couldn't ask for better sound. Go for it.
I would describe it as a horizontal brushed metallic black just like it looks in the photo. It is not glossy in the sense of polished, but has a metallic shine to it when hit by light at the right angle. It is closer to matte than glossy overall.
Sand Man, There's an audio output on the back, but it's not a variable connection (meaning the volume level doesn't control it, like a traditional headphone jack would). We don't recommend using it for headphones, unless you have a powered headphones set. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
These are my settings: Mode: Dynamic Backlight: 18 Contrast: 90 Brightness: 45 Sharpness: 80 Color: 50 Tint: 50/50 As all things, your mileage will vary. HTH
US, Yes, there is a standby light (red) on this model. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
dylan shoemaker, Yes. Some retailers and advertising can leave off letters at the end of the model number, but UN39FH5000FXZA would be exactly the same as UN39FH5000 (without the FXZA). Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
This receiver has one digital audio jack, one digital coaxial jack, one HDMI with ARC, and a few analog stereo inputs. If possible, you should use HDMI with ARC. Otherwise, use the digital coaxial jack.
I googled the tablet you mentioned and the edges seem too thick to fit in this cover. The tabs are about 1/4 thick and are designed for regular width tablets.
Yes, it can.
Yes it is.
The input is a 2A micro-usb to charge. It comes with one, but the iPad 3 wall blocks and computer USB ports work too. It has two outputs, one 2.1A USB (for tablets and Raspberry Pi and high-current devices, the other 1A USB for phones and smaller devices.
No. It doesn't. One mic is totally exposed. The second has a hole around it so it's exposed as well
My MBA is actually a (A1465) model. So yes, it fits.
it will work on anything that has the old style 30 pin connection and works great
Canon has warranty cover for the body and lenses, in respect to this kit all other elements from other manufacturers, so they had there own warranty varies
It contained a second battery and the battery charger.
If I remember correctly it was two x two packs.
Thank you for your interest in our item. In regards to your inquiry, the 55-250mm lens is not the STM version. If you are looking to create a customized package then please contact us directly at 800-991-3350.
Yes, the original Nikon accessories listed below are included inside the camera box: *EN-EL14 Li-ion Battery *Quick Charger *Front & Rear Lens Caps *Audio/Video Cable *USB Cable *Rubber Eyecup *Camera Strap *Eyepiece Cap *Body Cap *Accessory Shoe Cover *NikonView NX CD-ROM *Instruction Manual

Nope. Not compatible with iPad Mini, as far as the connector is concerned anyway. The iPad mini has the new dock connector. This unit has the old 30-pin connector. However, it can work fine with an iPad mini via Bluetooth, or 3.5mm audio miniplug.
Yes, my friend has an iPad and uses it with her speaker as well, but she sends the music to the speaker using Bluetooth. And I'm not sure if it charges while docking, Iwill have to pay attention next time we use it.
Hello, The items we have at stored at Amazon's warehouses do not have the audio hardware installed.
The do not have to be the same circuit breaker, at least not at my mom's house. However if you have separate breaker panels in your home, it might not work. One note, the units do have to have plugged in so that the hot and neutral wires are connected in parallel. I found out that one of my mom's outlets had be wired with the hot and neutral wires reversed - I had to flip the unit in that outlet 180 degrees to get the two to talk to each other.
my little daughter uses it but i think it last around 2 to 3 hours
The screen is just a giant inflatable. Similar to the holiday decorations and made of same material. You need to provide the projector and audio. Either hooked up to the projector or use a projector with built in speakers
No
It did, but it was very light weight and small. I got one I liked better at the .99 Cent Store.
Its just a case for the ipad, so the keyboard would have to be kept separately. Im sure the ipad will still work with the keyboard, as the cover shouldnt affect it in any way. Not sure if the answer helps, but not quite sure I know what you are asking.
Yes, the iPad back side is encased in plastic. Cover is "rubbery".
The front cover has a magnet that attaches to the side of the ipad. Then the plastic back snaps on.
No. This is specific to the older ipad and will not fit the air2.
Two would light about a 10x10 size room fairly well but you would have to use a higher ISO and/or larger aperture. I have 3 and use them to light industrial shots that fill about a 12x12 foot area. They do put out a good deal of light for their size and have been very reliable. They are only about the size of an iPad. Dimmer works also.
CheesyCam did some tests on these. You can find your answers here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abo-CgPjWo4
The MVM500A uses the new style MVH500 head instead of the older 701HDV head. Note that in the newer design the head in not removable and the pan movement is in the base instead of the head. But it is a newer model and it works well.
Yes. The plate for the monopod is a bit longer than the normal plates.tt doesn't matter though because they all fit each other.
You should be able to cycle through the "input" methods by pressing the 'Menu' button on the front left. Mine works for FM and USB (but I haven't tried Micro SD card yet).
I don't know wattage however; this radio's existing speakers may not work for the beach if you're looking for boom box quality sound. You're better off with a separate pair of speakers.
Yes.
It shows the radio station; however, it only pulls in the ones with very strong signals clearly. In Tampa I get only stations clearly and in Daytona I get only two clearly. It is an excellent mp3 player for small low wattage device. for radio I use it as an external speaker on my micro SanDisk music player which pulls in many stations clearly.
Yes they do. I have used them on both raspberry pi devices and parallax.
36 inches
No they don't come with cpu. You have to buy that seperately.
Yes but they have to be charged via the camera. That means you can charge one battery at a time while it is connected to the camera unless you buy a separate charger. So...if you are hoping to charge one battery and use the 2nd battery on the camera while the first one charges your out of luck.
It can be charged either way. Has a built in USB or a wall charger.
Windows 7 Professional x64bit
No. This is a security DVR and not designed to record television shows.
YEP. PANELS ARE REWV D.
I have been trying to do that same thing. Some scenes get messed up by the auto-exposure. A couple steps down in the settings you can change how bright or dark the picture is but that pesky auto-exposure is still active. Let's hope if they ever put up another firmware update that they include that functionality like when they added the timer function.
If the lens works fine with the camera as-is and focuses well I wouldn't think so. Have you checked the Sigma site? I may be wrong but I don't think the dock is even compatible with many of their lenses. Hope this helps.
Sadly it's probably dead. These things do wear out after a while! Try it on a different computer, but it's likely just done - sorry! :(
The Ir sensor is in the bottom left corner there is a firmware update that is coming out that will make the remote Wifi so we wont have that problem anymore
8 of them, all of good quality...better than the ones given at the movie theater.
yes, it works great with my ps3...in 2d and 3d games
Yes the original Sony battery as well as an aftermarket backup battery. I preferred this bundle over others because the extra memory card was a high speed Sony card, not a cheaper version.
No, for looks only!
Yes! They would be too small for the older models.
Yes. I own two and the cases fit perfect.
The camera, with lens (turned off, so the lens is retracted) measures (Approx.): W x H x D:5 1/8" x 3 3/4" x 4 1/8" (129.6 x 93.2 x 103.2mm) Camera weight is (Approx) (Main unit only) : 1lb 6.0oz (623g) The SD card and battery pack, together, add about 1 ounce (less than 24 g).
Yes both items are Image Stabilized and both will mount on a Canon 60D
Make sure your auto focus was on and check your settings if low light. This camera is awesome if aettings are tight highly recomed reading the whole manuel
yes, is very good,meetings are used to high definition
Can you plug an HD Antenna into the back with a USB dongle & watch local over-the-air channels? - I have not tried it, but I don't believe so. Can it see/browse video files on a network NAS? - Yes. It was able to see my SaMBa share without any problems and play the videos there.
As far as I know that's not possible
no
i do not know n7 well.but as i know 9 inch table is with big screen and cheap price. i feel good to enjoy movie with it.the cpu is allwinner a13 which is ok for common usage.n7 is small and portable with 7 inch screen.but when you used the 9 inch products,you fell 7 inch is too small
Yes, it is a regular size SIM. I've also used a microSIM in an adapter.
Yes, unit will work in the USA but must be unlocked and the APN for your provider must be set up in the settings menu.
It works just fine on my Toshiba Laptop but I don't think that it would be a problem to run it on Lenovo.
I'd make sure polarity is correct on the recharger and also check to insure that battery seats properly.
I don't know cause my subs aren't doing anything with this amp and amazon said they won't help
It comes with RCA jacks only
Yes, and there are multiple options
Yes
No, according to the HTC website. Only phones from HTC.
Yes, but be sure this is the one that will FIT. These connectors can be very confusing, one little un-noticed tab and it did not fit on my application.
I think Panasonic thought about it despite I didn`t find it avaliable at amazon.com You might want to contact Panasonic Customer Care for information.
that indicate the display screen is bad not disconnected.
This happened to me too when I first installed the digitizer. The problem was that the cable on the digitizer wasn't inserted properly into the connector on motherboard. The trick is to lift up on tab on the connector on the other side from where the cable goes in and then insert the cable as far as it will go. Once the cable is in, just push the connector tab back down again. If you don't lift up the tab first, the cable won't insert far enough to make the connection. I hope that this helps you out.
No it doesn't. It has an HDMI plug for say a Blu Ray player but no USB ports.
no vga, yes multidisplay can work still
Matte
I assume you are referring to a raised home/center button on the phone, and if so yes. The item comes with both a white and black button, but I realized that applying the button after the fact of applying the protector was going to be difficult, so I applied the button first, and used the button to help align while applying the screen protector itself.
Well the protector is glass so it's not going to peel at all. I am super picky about how the screen protector feels. This one feels exactly like it would if you had your finger directly on your phones glass screen. Super smooth. This protector is way better than a plastic stick on protector.
There is a cut out for each of the bottom button and the earpiece. I don't know of any other sensors on the face of the phone. It works just like there's nothing on the screen. You won't know it's there except the button is recessed. I like that because it isn't accidentally pushed.
No it is not, BUT I ordered mine two days ago, so the 28th and I just received an email that it will be arriving on June 5th at the latest, so most likely this is just to keep the volume of orders down, possibly before they get a bigger shipment.
Yes.
These are 10/100 only. For gigabit you'd want the TP-LINK TL-PA511 AV500 Gigabit Powerline Adapter.
it was made from Aluminum Alloy.
If both sources are playing they will both be heard simultaneously.
if your computer supports DisplayPort 1.2 I think it will work. I do not use touch screen but I do use it to display three individual desktops on three monitors.
You need a Displayport 1.2 port for this to work.
I am sorry but I do not remember. It has been several months since I sent the camera back for a refund. The operating instructions were terrible.
Hi Tony, this maybe a little complicated, we may need to talk by phone or by email. At this time, i would suggest you to contact the seller to arrange a tech support help for you, thank you.
Your cell phone should be connect to the same network with the camera, and then open the Zsight use search or add function, use add on the right corner, click the code to scan the code of the ip camera, thank you.
Yes, usb cable with wall plug adapter
I purchased the camera as a gift. If an instruction booklet came with it, perhaps the answer can be found there. If not L would go on line to Samsung. Hope this helps.
I am pretty much the same size and the pack fits just fine for me. Shouldn't be a problem.
No, it is too small it is about 12 wide inches inside. I use it to hold a Nook HD+ with a keyboard case. There is just enough for it and its power supply.
Unfortunately no. The quality is good though. The so-called 14" sleeve can only feel a slim notebook like the MacBook. Also due to its curved edges, it is impossible to squeeze in more squarish notebook. So need to get a 15" sleeve for a 14" notebook. I made a mistake and wasted my money. Hope this helps.
Nope. No pocket.
I tested it with a drop or two of water, and the answer is "no." It actually absorbed the water, and didn't resist or repel it.
110... It plugs into a standard wall outlet.
Yes, just like any other standard caller ID display.
Works with
No. One Lense that doesn't detach
best answer contact amazon for any questions regarding jam xt extreme. happy new year
I only got a USB charger
Yes it does
If your Acer has built in Bluetooth it will connect via bluetooth, if not, you should be able to use a 3.5 mm male to male cable.
Yes I pad for music here or any blue tooth device like phone tablet android or apple 3D blue ray player hooked to tv hdmi cable sound bar optical or fiber optic cable still could hook up any USB connection HAVE FUN I LOVE MINE got stands for rear speakers love the wireless ---BUTCH
In the box is a pair of RCA plugs for an analog TV plus an optical connector for digital. Use whichever one is compatible to your TV.
It is designed for Xperia Tablet Z family.
Yes it will work with OBS
Satellite speaker 2 watts RMS per channel; subwoofer 5 watts RMS; signal-to-noise ratio 75dB; frequency response 40Hz-20kHz; input rating 100 -240v ~ 50/60Hz 200 - 120 mA speakers sound AWESOME !!
Sure can but you'll most likely need a 3.5 mm to RCA cable. Unless your TV has a headphone jack in the back.
I think you mean output and no there is not one.
They are compatible with everything. Even iphone
Go to the language configuration and select spanish.
Thank you for your inquiry, this keyboard use Bluetooth 2.0 Standard, bluetooth 4.0 device also can get connect with this keyboard.
Yes, there is one adjustable divider, which creates two compartments.
Yes, this has a webcam.
Roughly (and I rounded down) 10"L x 4.5"W x 7"D. The tablet holder can hold a Kindle Fire HD 8.9" (Amazon's biggest tablet) just fine (by itself). The dividers inside the bag are all removable (Velcro attachments).
I think so. Because mine is Canon T3i 18-55mm
Don't buy it.
About 4 hrs.
my 13 year old son ordered it to take videos while he skateboarded and loved it - he was able to video his tricks and it lasted I believe well over an hour and good quality.
Can be removed without damaging the helmet
My first one had the same problem as yours. Red light on all the time, and froze! I returned it and bought another one hoping it was a defective piece.... My second one start to show signs of defective also! and this one I can't return b/c past return period. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT is my recommendation.
I have the 17" Dell M6600 and it fits in this sleeve. It's a really stretchy material and fits the laptop plus the large charger that this has.
Yup
It is a smooth glass screen, but I've got two around a bunch of bright lights and it's hardly noticeable. I wouldn't let that deter you from purchase.
NO
I am running win 8 for about a month without a problem/ only real complaint I have is the keys are kinda hard to see for me.
They are very soft and quiet in comparison to most other gaming keyboards. They make more of a ticking sound than a clacking sound.
They are backlit with red LED lights, I think there's another variant with blue LED lights too.
I can only answer number one as yes. I really have only used it for data files such as word and excel. I have viewed PDFs and they look fine on my iPad and iPhone.
I just verified this before replying to make sure I give you the right information. Unfortunately you cannot access from a mobile device if it is plugged into your PC. In order to have your PC recognize it, the device must be turned off. If you turn it on after you plug it in, it is no longer read by the PC. If you gave it on and then plug it into the PC, then it looks at the PC as a power source. Hope this helps.
The ONLY way to make sure you get the right screen is to look at the back of original screen.
Yeah..I believe you can connect this to your time capsule within the router range.
As I understand it,for extending you need a USB port on the router.This specific router doesn't have one.
It's lighter, and about as durable, though the paint scratches easier. The main difference is that it's budget gear at budget price, while zacuto is budget gear at insane price.
The Adobe Lightroom 4 is, however I have not tried the included Samsung software.
No, it doesn't have the setting. And yes, you can get the effect with the ND filter and a tripod on manual mode.
3 pin
Most of the stuff is good but the carry bag is a turn down it is not the same bag they show in the ADD
Yes
what how to reset it? there are directions that are easy enough to follow, I haven't had any problems...I still love this pen.
Hi Pom, This unit has 256mb of storage allowing for up to 36 hours of recording capacity in LP mode. The memory format is MP3.
Yep, in fact that is what I do most of the time. It is a little tricky so you will need to practice before you start your workout but after you get it set up it works great.
Stephanie, I've never used it, but it works great in the pool. Give them a call they're pretty accessible.
If by this you mean it will fold back upon itself so that the keyboard is under the iPad, yes that can be done with this cover.
It only works with a USB port.
No,this doesn't support bluetooth.
Don't buy this! It's worthless junk. Only worked one time and then refused to charge.
It does it automatically when you connect your phone to it.
Yes on both. The back slot will hold just about any phone and you provide the charge cord.
There is no weekday only option. However, there are 2 alarms. You can set both to different times and just press the alarm button (acts as an on/off switch, and each alarm has an on/off switch). For example, I will turn alarm 1 on for the weekdays and leave it on. I will then turn that alarm off on Friday and turn alarm 2 on for my weekends (preset to a different wake-up time).
Yes, of course!
Honestly I don't know, it was for someone else.
When it gets shook, it just shows your battery life. I have had mine in my purse for weeks now and it still shows a full battery.
On my LG G2 with a 3000mAh battery, it will fully charge 1 and a half times. I forgot to fully plug in my phone one night and it was totally dead. I fully charged it, ran it for a full day (very bad reception in my building which drains the battery faster than normal use) and charged on the way home . On the second charge, the phone went from 40% to 95% before I unplugged it. The Anker was not fully discharged but only had one light left on it's indicator...if this helps at all.
Yes it will. The only issue I have is that the plug is very short, so I have to remove my phone (I have both the Note 2 or Note 3) from it's case to charge. This isn't the case with the 4200 mah version.
You plug this into the wall socket, connect it via Ethernet to a laptop or a PC. Using IE or Chrome, you connect to the device (see instructions), and the device scans for nearby networks. You select your wireless network, type in the password and it's then connected to your wireless network. Then disconnect from laptop or PC and start using it anywhere around the house.
Don't get this light... it stopped working after only using it 3 times.... Very poor quality!
only one!
Yes. But make sure that the lens is new and has a USA warrantee.
Yes it does, great camera for HD video. I use it for recording Volleyball video of my high school son.
Yes most do, but a good photo editing program is best to use. I recommend lightroom.
Yes, they will
Yes, they'll work for GH4 and GH3.
Net 10 and Straight Talk are run together Like Kmart and Sears if you call the Straight Talk customer Service they ask if it pertains to Straight Talk or Net 10.
No
hdmi cable + mini displayport to HD AV adapter
There are no batteries. I think there is some type of spring device in the hinges.
Absolutely, Christian K.! I have all of these downloaded to my Dell, and it is easy, and fast!
Just cd no DVD ..!
The Nikon D3100 comes with the following accessories packaged with the camera by Nikon: *EN-EL14 Li-ion Battery *MH-24 Quick Charger *DK-5 Eyepiece Cap *DK-20 Rubber Eyecup *AN-DC3 Camera Strap *Body Cap *BS-1 Accessory Shoe Cover *Software Suite CD-ROM *Instruction Booklets *Front & Rear Lens Caps
You can recieve the calls normally, but you won't be able to hear them through the speakers, unfortunately. I tried..
Yes. Single disk, JBOD, RAID 0, RAID 1. Full specs are available from the QNAP website.
We had no problems of this, since the date of purchase. Hope this helps.
I am not sure what you are asking, but I do know that I bought a case which was one of the ones Amazon linked to this camera when I bought to camera, and the case did not fit (it almost fit). The camera does not quite fit the usual sizes for Panasonics. So be careful that you buy the right size.
Sorry to hear that. I have had at least 6 Panny OIS lenses and the switch is very easy on all of them. I would contact Panasonic. From what I've read, things like the ease of zooming and even image quality really vary from lens to lens. If Panasonic doesn't give you a good answer, return it and try another replacement.
Yes, it is
I believe 30 feet
I have not tried to do the downgrade because it works perfect with windows 8
It's pretty graphical.
I have been able to do so with my Samsung. I control the volume on device successfully with remote for Bose dock.
If your Sentra has the standard 30-Pin iPod dock then this will allow you to play your shuffle on it. This will not charge your shuffle however, as the shuffle end of this cord is the same as earbuds.
Hi Cindy K. Burch, this Sony SVF14214CXW uses a HDD (Serial ATA) with a capacity of 750 GB (5400rpm). It doesn't use SSD. -Ely
Yes
yes, I also signed up for the one year skydrive so I can get my files any where I go from any computer.
No, it doesn't have. It have a hdmi port and you also can buy the vga adapter for it
Well I have only had it for about a few months but so far it is holding up great.
No. There's a little slide adapter that has the "prongs" but this product works with the North American standard only. You'll need to find one specifically for your market.
Thank you and we will get this fixed. I apologize.
It works great on my S3. I also use it on my Samsung tab2. It works great.
Hi, I bought it to go in my Samsung Galaxy S4, so depending on what phone you have, it should work. It holds a ton of pictures too! I have about 5000 pictures on it so far and it's still not full!
It only has one on the back
Shaun: I am not sure but this is a Vivitar product and I am sure places such as B &H would carry QR plates. There is a place on the web called TripodQuickRelease. Com that carries plates by tripod model number.
Hello P. Altman, Thank you for your inquiry. The MagnesiumPRO 62" DSLR Digital Camera Tripod is rated to hold up to 30 pounds. Sincerely, Accessory Genie Customer Service
23 and 3/8 inches
I've had mine for over a year and yes. It was worth every penny. It's not staticy and puts sound through clearly. I have a sub I rigged in and it sounds perfect. Easy to install by yourself even if you think you have no idea what you're doing (like me). Good purchase.
Check car stereo model number (it is printed just above CD-IN) and search wether that model have CD changer port. If yes then definitely it will work.
We installed it into a 03 protg 5. Do you have the double din stereo? Is it the original Mazda radio? 6 disc changer?
The plug did not fit my 2005 Mazda 3, but the package said Ford so I think I was shipped the wrong one.
I don't know I'm running windows 7 and it works fine with it.
Yes it fits but needs some zooming if you don't want to make a photo in cylinder format.
Hi Carlos, Unfortunately the adapter tube will not work with your Fujifilm FinePix SL1000. Customer Service Team
Without stripping DRM you can buy any Kindle ebook that states 'Simultaneous Device Usage: Unlimited' (no DRM - digital rights management.) Tor, Baen, Carina, Smashwords, Ellora's Cave, and Samhain are drm-free publishers. Many self-published backlist titles are DRM-free. Download your drm-free book into Calibre (free library management software) and sideload to Aura. The software will convert it to epub format. It is much easier and quicker than it sounds.
Depends on how many your putting in one of those kickers is rated at RMS 800 which is what the amp is rated at. If your using more then one sub I recommend a bigger amp. I have this amp hooked up to two 12 inch mtx and it strong all the time
It depends on what the ohm rating of your Kenwoods and is the 800 watt the rms value or the peak output power of your speakers. This amp will output 500 watts rms at 2 ohms and I believe 750 watts rms at 1 ohm. For example, if your Kenwoods are SVC 4 ohms the lowest impedance applied is 2 ohms wired in parallel. Another example is if your Kenwoods are DVC 2 ohms then you could wire to 1 ohm
There are many variables to consider when building boxes that affect sub performance, but without those to consider there are a few things you can plan with. Your subs can be wired together (assuming they are single voice coil) at either 2 ohms or 8 ohms, with 2 ohms being the better choice for this amp. At this resistance the amp will work very well, providing up to 500 watts RMS (much under the rating of your subs)
Yes it's a Panasonic brand optical drive, from the looks of your computer it will fit nicely in the third hard dive/optical drive bay of the laptop. It fit in my 27 inch iMac, however you may need to remove the front black bezel of the drive so it mounts flush with the side of the lap top. Just flip over the drive and place a small flat head screwdriver into each little notch and it will pop off. Also here is the link to the Alienware manual where it shows the drive location. ftp://ftp.dell.com/Manuals/all-products/esuprt_laptop/esuprt_alienware_laptops/alienware-17_Owner%27s%20Manual_en-us.pdf
I have one installed in the ML05B case and it fits perfectly. To make installation really simple, use the Silverstone or other adapter cable. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A45JATI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1.
No
As a professional Photographer the TT660 is excellent in performance and is hardly recommended.
Yes. Have the item for my d3200
yes, it works on both canon and nikons
I had the same problem but I had two sets of Bornd silent mice. I had the wrong mouse with the wrong USB connector. Just ensure you have the correct matchup. If you lose the USB connector the mouse won't work with another. It's a set that matches.
Yes! Amongst almost all other android applications!
You really do need a ir light . I have two ir lights for mine and it is like daylight .
No
Looks like it :) According to this pic, being that your laptop specifically, you can see to the side of the wireless card, there's a slot for m-SATA cards http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Vo7pU2L24QU/Utt7J_eI1kI/AAAAAAAACok/Y6_eyQdThpQ/s1600/Laptop+Acer+Aspire+V5-573G-7450121Taii+-+Haswell,+Full+HD+IPS-3+inside.jpg That should be enough to plug it in and install your OS. Please, make an informed decision. It doesn't appear to be be much information about compatibility from ACER sites, so please be careful. I'd say you're on the safe side, though.
It fits on my t3
I don't shoot with a Nikon. I use a Canon 60D. This did not fit my camera. Way tight.
No, there is an opening on the side that allows for charging. I placed my Kindle in it the day I got it and it has not been taken out of the case since and I recharge every night.
I haven't had a warranty problem. The camera does a good job however, I found the video file format to be unusual. The supplier did respond to the problem very quickly but insisted the file format was common in commercial/professional video work. I could not read the file in any PC but I did find a program (at a cost) that would convert their format to a more common one that was PC compatible. Otherwise, the camera works as expected.
Yes, closing the display leaves the camera working. It has indicator lights on the exterior that are always on to show what mode the unit is in, so it will still draw attention to itself at night. I cover them up.
20" of cable
No
Sorry I have no idea. I use Windows 7 32bit version.
I'm not completely sure, but I think so. I think I remember time machine asking me if I wanted to use the hard drive as a backup.
I use mine with a laptop, but it stays on my desk, even when my laptop goes with me (rarely). It looks like it would travel well. It's small (about the size of a smart-phone) and looks and feels like it's durable. I would assume it would be OK in a pocket in your laptop case.
Yeah!
Yes, very compatible with ubuntu and mac
Mine did.
Absolutely not if the data is important to you.
If you are using an older machine that does not have USB 3.0 support the slower transfer rate can cause an issues such as this and there is no fix. If you are using a USB 3.0 port make sure your motherboard drivers and bois settings are up to date. After trying all this if the drive continues not to perform to your expectations I would exchange it for a different one.
The product was assembled in Philippines but the hard disk was made in either Philippines or China. This is all that is written on this hard drive.
It should work. I added all the files to it on a Windows 7 pc and my brother in law used it on his Windows 8 laptop.
Product Dimensions: 4.4 x 3.1 x 0.8 inches ; 8.2 ounces Shipping Weight: 12 ounces
Yes. It's what I have on my computer.
If it was it'd cost thousands of dollars. No, it's a 5400rpm drive. But more than adequate if you don't need super fast.
YES.IT CAN TAKE PICTURE AND TAKE VIDEO.
It transmits at 1 watt or 7 watts you change that in the settings.
This unit has excellent frequency stability and as far as generated harmonics are concerned I did not detect any of any measurability. It has an rf frequency chip from Japan that has rave reviews. So you shouldn't have to worry about it.It produces very high fidelity stereo sound and I would recommend it to anyone who'd buy it. I hope this is helpful to you. Regards, Greg
best search those who demonstrate these on youtube
My laptop is 1.18" x 9.87" x 14.94" and it is a snug fit. Yours should for perfectly, with a little extra space so you can put more things in the outside pockets.
No, I don't think it would work. The PLEMO Envelope is only 14 inches long. The width is okay, but the 1 inch depth might also be tight.
Yes, it appears to have the option for mounting on the wall. Be advised it will protrude from the wall by several inches more than a traditional corded phone.
It comes with the USB cable and all u need is to buy or if you already have one is use a USB charger adapter and it will work on anyone one( car adapter, outlet adapter ect..)
That's not the unit I have. So, I can't really answer. I have the gray, almost cylindrical version
Amazon contacted me & asked me to reply since I own one & also have an iPad. Not sure what your question is; however, it works just fine with my iPad. Hope this is helpful
I just tried a sample netflix vid. You can watch it in the browser, but the screen loses video renering on each side by at least 1 inch at the netflix site. On youtube you lose about 1/2 inch on each side. With the youtube app you get the whole screen for youtube vids. I don't think its a tronsmart issue, at least at youtube. I think its an android issue.
Honestly I'm not sure. I had mine for close to a month and after trying to get it to work I just returned it to Amazon. Don't waste your money on this. Get a home theater computer
Yes, it works for standard micro usb and Apple lightning charging devices.
Joshua, My best advice is to contact EVGA with your make, model, of computer so that they can best advise. This Power supply comes with all sorts of cables but I rather be sure than disappointed.
only magellan camera works with this gps
What do you mean with 4 and 5?
read the manual, you can find online
I do not know about the APX, but you can control the bass and subwoofer volume.
IT DOES! We live in a river valley and just mounted ours where a Dish receiver had been, but we still get all the PBS Stations & Sister Stations in Oklahoma. I hope you can locate any glitch and receive yours!
As long as you program it you should be ok
By combine I'm assuming you mean can you program it? Yes you can
good tablet and over the apple recommend it 100%
Sorry can't help, wife does it.
I would first check to see that your laptop could support two monitors at 2560x1440 and then confirm it has to display-port ports.
Yes
Strongly recommend you go to the Gurman site or call Garman by telephone. I bought the GT M 60 and it would not work for my Garman and I ended up getting the 36 which is what they told me on the telephone I needed. The GT M 60 is only for certain newer models of garmen
Yes it does.
sorry, I don't know
It has RJ45, I believe there is a warranty as well.
Charge Yes, Sync no. It will sync with iPad on the other ports but not the charging port.
Yes it will work.
It will work fine on the S5. I bought it and used it for my S5.
Idk if it works with those but when I tried using it on my galaxy s4 it wouldn't format at all was insanely slow and in general just didn't work I ended up returning it and just getting a scan disk micro sd and a Samsung one for my tablet and yes it also did loose some data my phone didn't take to it at all
This kit comes with different size adapters for different lenses, and then the filter holder for holding up to 3 of the filters. In order to use these filters you do not need to purchase anything additional, just ensure that there is a ring adapter which will fit your lens(es). I have this myself, and I know many others, beginners to semi-pro photographers, who also own this set and love it as much as I do. It's a great little package. Hope that helps.
I believe there is a 72mm adapter in the kit, it either screws on or snaps on and then the filters slide into the holder, and work quite well. I used the graduated and full both and was well satisfied with the result. The company shipped just as stated
I don't think so. Sorry
I'm sorry, I really don't know. You'd want to check the dimensions of both the tablet and the case. Also, check to see if the HP supports a USB keyboard. Finally, there are three physical kinds of USB ports, the standard one, mini and micro. Make sure you get the right connector depending on what the HP supports. Or get an adapter. Good luck.
Mini SD cards function the same as SD cards, they are just smaller. You have to have an adapter SD card. The mini slides into the SD card adapter and it is like having a standard SD card.
Yes. It's called "smooth motion effect" on this TV and can be set to High, Medium, Low or Off in the Advanced Picture settings on the menu.
The only lag is the time the V image shows before tuning in. I don't use its tuner, but, when trying it out, I had no issues. I watch everything through the HDMI from ToVo, DVD, etc. Love the unit so far.
Hello, Included accessories Rechargeable NP-BX1 AC-UB10 AC adapter, Micro USB cable, strap, body cap, shoe accessories. Best regards WT-IMPORT
It was not compatible with anything !! It is junk - I do not recommend.
Picture is FAR more amazing on the M-Series. Light bleed is a lot worse though ... The E-Series had bad dirty screen effect and a few more uniformity issues. I have had both and I would NEVER return this 70" M-Series for the basic 70" E-Series again. And even if your not a 3D fan ... You Will Be after watching the M-Series!!!
No it will not... You need 3d content to view 3d
No it doesn't
About 8.25 inches.
Try the smaller Jr. head that comes with the smaller quick-disconnects that should work fine with a DSLR. I have one I use with camera and binoculars. If I had your issue with my MVH500AH, I would consider modifying the dovetail with a hacksaw and file. But, then again, I build and modify astronomy equipment.
QR plate is included
It fits my ipad 4 with retina. Yes, it tilts in any direction.
once locked it does stay in place, it may have some side to side movement but it can be controlled with some adjustable stand offs.
It worked for me pretty well it's a little snug but I like that. It is pretty sturdy as well
The SX50 fits, but barely. It is very difficult to get the camera in and out. I ended up buying Jet Black VG Laurel DSLR Camera Carrying Bag with Removable Shoulder Strap for Canon PowerShot SX50 HS Digital SLR Camera by Vangoddy.
This is usb 2.0
No. It comes with a power cable and two speakers cables, so you're ready to roll (though you'll need mic cables etc.) They aren't particularly heavy duty cables, or very long - probably about 25 feet long I would guess - but they work fine and they fit in the back of the speaker enclosure. Longer, heavier cables wouldn't.
No, it does not. The drive in this computer only plays DVD's and CD's.
Yes. I hooked up a monitor that was about 4 years old and it is fine.
I doubt it. The drivers and pin outs are very unique relative to the rasPi. BBB has it's own screens and even and hdmi out on it
Mine one is A6
Have my doubts, go online or check the manual and check the max resolution if 2560 it will work.
Hello Scott, a GTX260 will work as it has the requisite DVI-D port. With that said, be aware that the GTX260, being an older graphics card, may struggle to run graphicly intensive applications at the monitors native resolution.
Nope. Comes with a hard screen protector. I haven't had any problems with the touch screen when it is on the phone.

My sitting position is about 12 feet away from the TV. You might think that is too close for an 80"; but the picture is razor sharp at that distance. I watch a lot of Blu-Ray's and football - both are outstanding. I really could not ask for anything better! Bob
Go to Vizio.com and get their support Number. I do not know but this TV has all the bells and whistles and seems to have everything.
3 connections with a ground.
Yes it is.
ADP-65GD B Input AC100-240V - 50-60 Hz 1.5A Output +19V 3.42A I use it for my ASUS K52F
The Passport can perform scheduled/automatic backups, the Elements cannot. The Passport is compatible with Windows XP and Elements is not. While Elements states it is compatible with XP on the Amazon page, when you purchase it (which I did), the box states it is NOT compatible with XP.
It does not. It is powered via the USB cord.
If it has a PCI E slot, then yes, this will fit the motherboard.
I purchased for a Christmas gift so don't know the answer to your question.
The warranty is for 2 years from purchase date. If you have any additional questions please do not hesitate to contact us further.
It is come with AC AdaptorAC-UB10 Micro USB cable and Instruction Manual But with no Shoulder Strap
Yes.

Ignore every Bluetooth device that your ipad has paired, and repaire the tower speaker again.
No.
Yes, it has to be and it must be a compatible model for the device.
Freddie Perez, This model does not have the Evolution Kit option. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Is does the phone charge when you have the extra battery attached to it? I have a problem where if I only had the case attached I had to position it onto the base properly in order to get it to charge. And sometimes I had to wiggle the little copper piece and set it back on the base in order to get it to charge. I found that when I would wiggle the copper piece and pull it towards the front phone charge better. But it ultimately became pretty frustrating.
No, there is a specific one for each new model. This is 5/5s only.
I love the fact that the Iphone is TOTALLY wireless, not wireless for communications and then wired to charge. I also enjoy the convenience of having one in my vehicle dealing with one less cable as well. With this device, you truly get to enjoy a cell phone -as a completely wireless device it was meant to be!
Yes, it Does.
Yes
Yes
it is a Nikon item , not chinese
yes it is 100-240 world charger & works in europe.
Input 100-240 v, 50/60 hz, 1.0A; Output 12.0V--- 3000mA . Hope this is what you need.
You would be able to charge the Celetron Firecell by way of your USB port on a computer or charging block with a USB port, but I am not familiar with your lumia 620 device. The Fire Cell has micro USB port and an adapter included as well as a pin type plug. Also included is a cord for charging the Fire Cell. You would need your own converter plug in order to use your wall power supply because of the different voltage. Hope this helps.
You cannot physically rotate the screen on its mount, but if you have an aftermarket one it should be possible. All monitor images can be changed into portrait mode by right clicking on the desktop, clicking "screen resolution", and changing the "orientation" pulldown menu.
The A2500 can use a 32 GB, so yes this should work fine.
Sorry, I don't know. I just stick the chip in the camera and shoot. But I had to call the company (they are in California) about something and they were very nice and helpful and successfully solved my problem. Ask them.
It works perfectly on my 5200...
There is no reason it shouldn't. (The camera's specification lists SDHC cards.)
I don't know. I used Window 7.
It should be loud enough but depending on the noise on the environment the volume the MP3 is recorded.
Not sure what is going on but i can tell you that i have this Label maker and it works just perfect for it and i did purchase at Staples the Original Power Supply and it is that exact same one they provide but this one is quite a bit less money and that was my goal here.
It's broken. I had exactly the same experience, and contacted them. They sent me a new one that works fine.
The Brother recommended power adapter for the PT-D400 is ADE001 which has an output of 12 Volts DC at 2 Amps. This adapter output is 9 Volts DC at 1-2 Amps. You will also need to verify the size and polarity of the connector that plugs into the PT-D400. It may work, but I would not recommend buying this adapter for your label maker.
It is more difficult. It would be much easier to get the digitizer/LCD screen together. I advise you to get the digitizer/LCD. Its only $40 more. It will be waste of money to get the digitizer only
I Agree. I Bought This Item Only Realize It Was Completely Useless Without Buying The Lcd as Well
BL-4C , 3.7V 890mAh. Looks like something you put in your phone.
Yes.It has external speaker.You can listen without ear phones.
Pioneer has a list of phones that work
I have an S4 and to be truthful, the CD-AH200 kit did me absolutely no good. With Samsung products, all you need is a HDMI cable, charging cable, and the 2.0 MHL adapter from Samsung. The MHL adapter included in the kit does nothing for Samsungs. In other words, this kit a waste of money for Samsungs. Cheaper to get your own HDMI cable, charging cable, and the Samsung 2.0 MHL adapter ( http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-MHL-2-0-HDTV-Adapter/dp/B00BTCPQ5C/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1399834849&sr=1-1&keywords=samsung+mhl+2.0+hdtv+adapter )
I used this to make the cables go upwards as there was not enough space to go straight out. As Chromcast is HDMI, I am pretty sure that it would fit into the female part of the adapter.
I really do not understand you mean, or you want to treat me with the question, can you be more epecifico, please?
Works with my pro 8.4
Please call us toll free at 800-991-3350 for more information on this package deal. Thank you, Cameta Camera
No. This is a standard keyboard 10 Key with minimal extras when used as a standard stand-alone calculator. (Memory/Clear, %, +\-, backspace).
Yes, It is working perfectly.
I don't know the exact length but the part is bulkier than the Scosche i2r model and not as long as the Scosche version
Yes. Works perfect. I use it in the car. Retracts perfect.
Yes. It fits all Otter box & Griffin cases
It automatically reorients the pictures..
Yes.
Just one and it only chrages via usb
Yes
The case you had sent is fit with my Envy m6. Thank you
If your HP laptop have rounded corners then this cover will not fit it's squared cut corners, I had to send them back (2 covers). Hope this helps you.
:( no
No I actually purchased this case hoping it would fit my m6-k but it didn't and I had difficulty with this merchant when trying to return it. I have yet to find a case to fit my laptop.
No itstoosmall.
To respond your question, I'm not sure but I would recommend reading the description very throuroughly. If you do order it, I hope you enjoy your new case. It is very fashionable but unfortunately did not fit my laptop.
Yes
Not for the 5 3 and 4
L 21 x W 3.7 x H 7.9
Yes feet perfect
Depends if you have siblings that are rough with your stuff then yes but I would keep the Mic on the headset and have a back up Mic so if it does break. The Mic has the best quality I know of
While in playback mode press the M key to bring up the menu. Repeat options should be the first listing. Press the Power/Play button (|) to enter the Repeat settings options. Using the +/- keys scroll through the options. When you get to the Shuffle option press the Power/Play (|) to confirm the option. You will be back at the Repeat menu once you confirm your choice. Press the M key again to return to the playback screen.
Yes, it plays the most music and audio files.
yes, we can ship the international packages.
NO! the only way to use it for more than a few hours without a recharge is to connect the headphone out on the device to an aux input, if you have it, on your head unit.
I bought a cheap usb hub and have used wired mouse and keyboard. Not sure if wireless works. I do know blue tooth mouse and keyboard work.
This is only limited to G-Tech Evolution Series drives.
Mine came in a box by itself. No wires, no instructions, no CD.
Prob, it fit in my macbook pro, 15
How 7 table do what Tarzan?
It is a Class A amp
I own this and it is made of plastic, however the grip is very sturdy for what it is. The look matches the design of the body so they coincide nicely.
9'
Absolutely!
Nope, it's just for the galaxy s3!
Yes, plus you can put other items in with the MacBook, calculator, spiral notebook, cell phone. . .it's advertised to include the MB15", fits.
It's like any other mount. You can remove it by unscrewing the case from the mount.
Nope. Just a fixed plastic mount. Mine actually broke off. Pretty weak if you ask me.
Yes
Hi, the pole can be used under water as it is not sealed - so there is no depth limit. The remote is not sealed off by the remote pole, so this will make no difference to the depth GoPro suggests. Also, Wi-Fi does not work underwater so using your remote underwater does not make much sense. In any case make sure to rinse the pole with fresh water after use in saltwater.
Not by itself. You can, however, get a GoPro adapter that does mount a standard camera.
yup, mine are connected with them
I don't know, but all of their Classic line speakers are shielded, as are all their subwoofers, including the Super 8 that is meant to be used with the Super Zeros. Go to www.nhthifi.com and dial their phone number; they pick up within seconds. Ask them, they are extremely friendly and helpful.
I havint used it yet, Sorry
It worked fine for my v5-171-6675. I think that the important part is that you have the v5-171 as the first part of the model number. You should contact the seller though if you are still not sure or if your original screen was a touchscreen.
Yes
It works even better with Android devices actually, because you'd be able to use the TuneIt App via Bluetooth, while iPhones must be connected via USB.
The three settings are flat, rock, and jazz. Flat is effectively the off setting.
Yes
Hi All of the included accessories are shown in the 3rd picture on the page. Included with the camera are drill bit, 5m/16.9' composite video cable extension (male to male), and a 1m/3.3' power input plug with flying leads (power and ground). The red jack in the picture is the power input.
I think it was less than ten feet but the video wire is very long. I used a transmitter instead of running all the wires . And I'm not sure about the deck but if it is back up camera ready you should have no problems...just google and read the specs
I bought this laptop as a gift for my daughter. She specifically asked for this one. Though I am not " that computer savvy ", she is..As for " software..I couldn't give specifics..but, my daughter plays music, watches movies, on the web, does a lot of graphics. I'm sorry this probably doesn't help much..all I can really say, is , she loves hers and feels it far surpasses her last laptop. Good luck.
I didn't find Chinese function. Actually, I think it's not work well. &#21453;&#24212;&#22826;&#38590;&#65292;&#30475;&#21040;&#35686;&#36710;&#36807;&#21435;&#20102;&#25165;&#26377;&#21453;&#24212;&#12290;
I know you won't have a problem connecting your iPod and if your amplifier has a regular audio input connector there shouldn't be a problem. I have mine connected right to the stereo (and I use it of other speakers around the house) and have no problems at all
Yes, in the upper right corner there's a battery icon that indicates the remaining charge - it's on all the time.
You have to keep the intake clear of debris, like any pump, and keep the water level high enough, or it can burn out.
Mine is an 8" and it accomodates it with room to spare.
Yes8 I Yes it does it is a Christmas present so its not been used that much
I dont know for sure. I wood think it wood because it is a universal' & my tablet is a dell &it fixs good.BEST OF LUCK
Yes, that is what I use it on
Yes it is. You should have no problem at all.
No, not unless you buy an am3+ motherboard as well
Yes it does, its a pretty decent one as well.
Yes
I don't have that exact laptop, however I have other E-series laptops with 9 cell batteries (the ones that stick out from the back). The docking station will work with the 9 cell battery. There is a slider to adjust the guide for either the 6 or 9 cell battery.
Bluetooth can only output to one device at a time. You will not be able to connect multiple speakers to one phone or tablet. You can however use a 3.5mm direct cable to connect directly to the speaker. Using that method you could use a 3.5mm stereo splitter to connect to 2 speakers at once.

The shipping that comes with the item is fedex ground. That tea from 2 to 4 business days depending where in the us you are. We ship from California. We can arrange for as fast as over night if you need it. Just contact us after you purchase and we can expedite for you......Video Gear Direct
Yes, these glasses work perfectly with your TV (LC70LE655U) and they are fully rechargeable via USB cable. These are also more comfortable to wear than the ones included with the TV.
I up dated and added a Kingston 8GB 1600MHZ DDR3 (PC3-1280) ( KTL-TP3C/8G) And purchused it here on Amazon This is what I did for my computer needs Great Up date! Hope his helps you.
Yes, my config is a Turtle beach headset hooked up to the fiber optic for game sound on the PS3 and HDMI from the PS3 going to the Onkyo then out to the projector. Then I can set the Onkyo to Tuner and play music out of the speakers connected to the receiver, play the game on screen and listen to music out of the speakers.
You'll need the 3000w model as the transformer itself requires 20% reserved power to operate.
Whatever the input frequency is. If you are in a 60Hz area, it will be 60Hz. If you are in a 50Hz area, it will be 50Hz. It transforms the Voltage only.
since it should handle 3000W and your tool is 1700W it should be OK
This would be determined by your video card. The port will work fine. Look up your video card and review the resolutions it supports.
It doesn't come with HDMI cable but Amazon has them at really good prices. This is a great monitor and you will be very pleased if purchased.
Yes, it does have Bluetooth
Yes, you should NEVER try to install any internal components with the PC being turned on. Always install RAM, an internal hard drive, video card, etc. BEFORE turning on the computer.
No. It doesn't have a stand alone video card and just an i3 processor. It can handle relatively simple games (Atom Zombie Smasher, Peggle, anything point-and-click, etc.) but nothing graphically intensive or with tons of concurrent players.
YES!
NO
I have found it to be very accurate, and it has to reviews on other sites as one of the best under $300 radar detectors.
Nailed it!
I don't think you can, unless you keep something playing. If possible, turn down volume on your device, ie; phone or tablet. The Boom needs a signal to keep power on. The automatic shutoff saves your battery in case you forget to turn off.
No, it is just a computer monitor.
Matte
2.5 inch diameter 7 inches tall
No next and previous, just volume up/down. Yes there's a mic so you can use it as a speaker phone.
Each of them is mono, if you buy two you can use the app on your phone to have stereo sound (left channel on one UEBoom right channel on the other)
It depends on the volume level. anywhere from 6 to 15 hours.
I have absolutely no idea. When we purchased ours it wasn't not that way. We didn't get that color but all colors were same price. That's odd.
Ports the PC has: 2 USB type A; 1 USB type B (printer); 1 headphones. Plus a smart card port.
Yes, with the 500GB hard drive there is room for thousands of photos.

The memory stick pro duo card that I have in my Cyber-shot DSC-W300 fits into the slot on the upper left hand corner of the computer, on the side with USB slots below. If you have an older version camera, with a full size memory stick, you can transfer the pictures via USB cable which comes with the camera. Hope that helps.
Hi Olddetailer, for re- installation of Windows 8, you can use the Vaio care software pre-installed in the computer. It will access the recovery partition of the hard drive to re-install the said OS. -Ely
Yes
Yes, it does have a digital FM tuner with pre-set station capabilities.
?? Must be an old one.........I do not know what this question is about..?? May have been for the Pioneer... I just bought one yesterday from a local guy who has about 10 of them..and a room full of speakers and receivers... Thanks..
With the Synology RAID option you can start with the 3TB drives and add larger ones later. You just can't anything of smaller size than the drives used to create the array.
I don't see it listed among the compatible sata's on www.synology.com/en-global/support/hd/model/DS1513+
Stay away from buying this,, it is junk i bought this ,aand 4month after it broke. And they would give me my money back.
I think we if you will put a sim card inside. But to be sure you can contact your network provider
No you cannot. That's why I purchased the Speck case instead, I returned this one to Amazon.
Yes, it does work. If I had it to do again, I probably would buy a cheap dvd player to go with a tv. But that's just me. So far it has worked fine and I play a lot of dvds.
Actually, I believe that Optimus Prime will deliver it for you and have Bumblebee set it up for you...
It GIVES commands in Klingon.
Find the nearest apothecary and ask him to give you a hot poultice.
When I received my recorder it came with a battery that is rechargeable if that is the battery that's in the recorder then yes you can plug it directly into your computer and charge it while moving files from it. If you put in a regular AA battery that is not rechargeable then no you cannot charge it
If the carrier uses SIM card then yes it will work.
You can mount it in a pedestal stand. Mine will focus up to 7" away from the object that you are scanning. My Celestron will not focus beyond 7" away. In your application, it will depend on how small the imperfections or bugs are.
edit: 2.4 lb. i still think this is a great (though not perfect) product.
The Brightness is adjustable from the menu, if you load the software. I have adjusted mine to full brightness
Yes I use the e1659 all the time with an old Sony VAIO that has only USB 2.0 ports and it works great. No problem with response or power.
I'm not sure. For what it's worth, we have a Panasonic Plasma with several USB ports on the back of the TV. We just plugged an SD card into the Saicoo and plugged that into one of the USB ports on the TV, pressed the "Apps" button on the remote, then selected "Media player" on the screen and it showed the photos from the SD card. We could then view them one at a time or do a slide show, etc. That probably doesn't help you at all, but we don't know how similar your LG TV is.
Sometimes sd cards need to be formatted. If this is not the case in your situation, then look up trouble shooting for the card reader. All else fails you can obviously try another card or contact customer service for the manufacturer, they should be able to walk you through trouble shooting and correcting the problem.
I could not get my rca to do it ether so i run it through the sat rec and it works great
Yes it does....
Read your Manu
The device is 2 inches wide, 1.5 inches deep and 1/2 inch thick at its thickest point.
Yes but heavy modification is necessary.
Yes, that is what I do for tail gating every Sunday morning. Surrounding cars can hear from a good 40 yards away.
I'm not to sure. But I love my Sony! It sound great! Even when u use it to watch movies!
No external power supply on this unit. Just a regular 2 prong plug straight from the unit.
None. The DZ78KLT-75K is, by definition, an "Extreme" board.
I attempted to contact Intel myself, but to no avail. I went ahead and purchased this motherboard from here on Amazon, but the expected delivery is estimated from between 1 and 4 weeks. I'll update whenever I finally do receive my motherboard and let you know what the ACTUAL waiting time is.
Dimensions are 5 1/2" x 3 1/4 x 3/4" (1/4 in the keypad area). I use it a lot. Very good.
Hi Sharon I really have no idea if that charged will work for that tablet I have had a few tablets I Boughy without chargers a few were pretty obscure brands I would search for "charger for (the tablet u have)" If that doesn't work I recommend going to radio shack or Fry's and finding a universal charger or ordering a universal say maybe a rocket fish that will come with multiple tips
On the bottom of every product page on Amazon you will find a link that reads "tell us about a lower price". If you don't see it, do a find. You'll get a pop-up that asks some basic questions. Fill it out and wait. I did this with a multi-track recorder. I expected that Amazon would email me with a price match offer. If they did, I never saw it. I happened to check back a few days later and the price was matched. Glad I checked! I don't know what the typical turn-around time is for price-matching.
I don't know the dimensuions of your tablet. I found the G7 had ample room for the iPad. It could easily accomodate a tablet larger than the iPad in my opinion.
Hello Amy, Thank you for your interest in our products. Yes, you can use this tripod stand for any camera that has 1/4-20 standard threaded hole on the bottom. All you do is attach the camera's bottom side to the ball head top side, same as where you would secure the ipad mount to. It works great for Cameras!
I believe a hood was included with my new lens. This lens is a wonder, by the way. It looks odd and it performs WAY beyond its price.
It depends on how good of a high ISO your camera can handle and how low of a light level. If you want to freeze action, in low light, you may have to go to an f1.8 or lower. If you are OK with motion blur, it will do the job. It also depends whether you have in body stabilization on your camera since this does not have lens stabilization.
No.
the needle fit my record player - but i'm not sure if i have an 'executive'. it works good.
I have taken mine off since I spent more time removing it to get various shots than keeping it on. But that's my way of taking photos. Perhaps it would be different for you. At the price, it was worth it to get the filters even if the hood didn't work out so well.
No, but it if free to download any time to upgrade from windows 8.
Yes! It's been a great computer so far.
yes it does
yes has multiple usb ports
It is not a touch screen.
Yes. But not the lcd screen. I ruined the lcd screen trying to seperate it from the old touchscreen. You should order the more expensive full kit...
I am not sure why the discrepancy. The model number on my computer was BHI7N11.
I have had mine for about month..I would say yes...... to the usb port connect,so far when I record the little battery icon shows full...cause I always play back on the puter
no batteries, charges thru usb port on your computer
Don't know for sure, but it may be possible to get a male-male cable that you could use to go from the earphone output on the recorder to the microphone input on your laptop.
Yes, has camera in the front and back
nope. sorry. have had it over two years.
As long as you stereo itself supports these features. This is basically a set of extension cords for your stereo. This is a very convenient and ascetic way to access these features.
I have used it for setting up Hotbird, Eutelsat and Astra signals. It displays all the transponders within these signals. DirecTV is US based I think so I cannot say if it will work as I'm in Europe. Chances are it will as it is designed for just about any satellite signal beamed down.
Yes - it will be a bit heavy, but works great.
I bought one with US warranty. I do not know if a gray market lens is available with international warranty. Check at large camera store web sites (like Adorama or B&H).
Now?
I have the X-T1, so not exactly what you're looking for, but at these speeds, it's probably comparable. I had the 70-200 f4L with a 40D, but that was over 4 or 5 years ago so my recollection could be off. I'm going to say the Fuji 55-200mm is for sure slower than my 70-200 40D combo and the Fuji will hunt for focus under certain conditions. However, for practical purposes, during vacation, portraits etc... it's a comparable combo in my opinion.
No, only SATA drives. Sorry...
No software was included in my purchase.
You can get a usb bluetooth. .. that should work.
Sure....the manner which you use to capture your video signal doesn't matter, since you'll be sending it to your TV and that's the signal you'll send to the sound bar. The sound bar has inputs for two auxiliary, one Bluetooth, one digital and one optical input. You're going to have at least one of those.
It can only read Blu-Ray discs and burn DVDs: Blu-ray Reader/DVD-Writer BD-ROM/DVD-RAM/R/RW
It is Android. It does not have Windows.
Ports are for FW 800. It might work if you had an adapter.
I have a MacBookPro 17" Model A1229 from late 2007 with both Firewire 800 and 400. I use Firewire 800 to my Passport 1TB purchased from Amazon several months ago. I have it set to do auto Time Machine Backups every day. Never any problems. The new USB 3.0 is 600MB/s, Firewire 800 is 75MB/s, USB 2.0 is 60MB/s, and Firewire400 is 50MB/s. Firewire 400 will work fine, and is still offered as an option on the new drives. Good luck, hope this helps. Bill Rhodes
Yes it did. Works great.
Yes - I believe it is compatible with any operating system that runs time machine.
Yes, I think it should fit.
I haven't tried but I doubt it is waterproof.
friend if you can install shock sensor
Yes, is unlock, Works with any GSM network.
Excellent product. It grips well. The sides have some flexibility like spring function. It does NOt get lose over time becaue you release the sides by pushing a button and press them together to grip the phone. You can't go wrong with Panavise.
YES!
Not sure, I have a note 10, 2014 edition
I bought it for a 10 inch Galaxy Tab 3. I really don't know about the smaller versions. I returned the item and bought direct from Samsung. Haven't received that one yet.
You will need to change it... I personally recommend the h80i from corsair if you like cold liquid system
No, processors are specialized to the motherboard (more correctly it's the other way around). Typically laptops are not capable of changing parts aside from disk drives, memory, and hard drives. Perhaps you could change the processor in your laptop but it would essentially have to match what comes with it. And I would be very certain before buying anything that the processor isn't specialized for that laptop even if it has a familiar name.
Not to the keyboard itself but you can use a Bluetooth mouse and it will work fine.
No it is not blue tooth compatible. Operates in the same frequency range as a cell phone
unfortunately no, which sucks.
I don't know. I bought it because it said for Motorola radio.
Yes Ronald you are required to use a power adapter also as the dvr is not a supply of power to cameras
According to the product description, it "Supports HDMI 2.0 Technology, which increases bandwidth from 10.2 Gbps to 18 Gbps and is 4k and Ultra HD compatible." The HDMI 2.0 spec does support 4k at 60fps. If your computer's graphics card supports that kind of output, you have a 2.0 HDMI cable, and your display supports that resolution and refresh rate, then yes, this adapter will work for 4k 60fps.
This adaptor should be able to work on any TV that has HDMI inputs. I would recommend updating your video drivers first. Then check to see if your PC even acknowledges the TV (check device manager). Then try the basic troubleshooting steps : Use another HDMI Cable that you know is working or try on another TV. Good luck.
Correct
No. 2008 MacBooks can only take 9.5mm (or thinner) 2.5" hard drives. This drive is 15mm thick. This hard drive is simply not designed to go into laptop/notebook computers. It is meant for OTHER instances when a 2.5" is useful.
No
Yes, that is the projector I have. You will only need to use the short arms, you won't need the extension pieces. The Epson 2030 is pretty awesome, you will not be disappointed!
If you want the extention on the outside you will need 1.25 id.
no
This package does not include the monitor.
Try Amazon. Just search Benq 770 lamp.
there is no evo water cooler. this case fits a seidon 120m on the rear and a seidon 240m on the front. If you were referring to hyper 212 evo, this case supports cpu coolers up to 160mm height and the evo has 159mm so it should fit.
Yes. They are very helpful.
Please check the weight and thread size for the mounting holes on your speaker, if the are in the rang of item specs, then it will work.
Not sure if this helps you, but I used two of these (with the included L-mounting bracket) to hang my center channel from the ceiling. Once you tighten the clamps holding the rubber mounting balls in place, these are quite sturdy and hold well.
Yes, but you should use the wireless USB coming with the device and download the App in your iPhone.
Yes, this is an ATX PSU and the Corsair website says an ATX PSU is what it is designed for.
I believe so as long as it's a bar looking bulb for dome light
Works on Solo Slingbox, whatever size adapter input that is.
It is not good product or at least the mine no working properly In one monitor I cannot listen to the visitor an the second monitor the clock each 12 seconds pass one minute
Honestly i dont know becausd i thought i was buying the tv but i bought the protecter but i wouldnt know how iit works yet. .
No. Just DVD.
It does not and will not have touch. There will always be a newer version, and they've already announced a Haswell laptop (UX301), which will have touch, but they haven't even announced a release date so the chances of a pre-christmas version are slim, and its announced specs are much, much lower than this one's, except of course the newer processor.
yes.. it have!
It is not like the old notebook, a click then the battery comes off. The bottom of this notebook is very smooth, you need a screw driver to take the battery out. So the answer is, NO, the battery is not easily detachable.
Came with Windows 8. When the upgrade to 8.1 came, I let it upgrade. The computer does not have a touch screen so those "features" don't work.
Yes it has a Wi-fi capability. Thanks, PCrush
Yes it does, but I would consider getting another laptop check out my review in the review section. This laptop really won't last you long.
Yes you can
Yes, a quick search in the ROG forums will give you the part numbers to Blu Ray drives that will fit this model.
The one you posted has a blu ray lector also has 16gb of ram. This one has a dvd-r lector and 12gb of ram
60
no
The laptop without battery= 7.6Lbs With battery= 9.0Lbs With charger= 10.8Lbs
Yes you can, using the function keys on the top near the screen-brightness keys you can disable the keyboard lights while continuing to use the computer like normal.
The Maximum Memory Capacity of this model is 4GB
Yes, Good choice
I would say around 6. It also depends on how hard/fast you type. The Red switches are a lot quieter than the other ones. There are lots of YouTube videos comparing the noise from different mechanical keyboards.
Can't say for sure but it fits the Note like a glove - even the camera hole - so I'm not sure you want to chance it.
Just like use the camera for phone, go to the interface- camera,then you can take a photo.
Yes, it does.
It doesn't come with it but I put it on mine. You have to buy it seperately.
There are build in speakers on the system. The Sound is great/ clear but not too loud, just enough. It is a great system, I loved it, and many of our guest compliment on it. I recommend you to get one, I am sure you'll love it. It also comes with USB cable to upload your original records into your computer... Have fun!!
Yes, there is a jack in the back that will accommodate an iPod. Also red and white RCA jacks.
No...just hopes and dreams....Just hopes...and dreams...
yes he Executive USB Portable Turntable easily takes your favorite vinyl and converts them to digital files. Simply plug in the USB cable, play your record and watch as the Executive creates digital files on your computer.
It is very poor quality. It is very much like a Dollar Store toy. I returned the one I bought within 24 hours. The tone arm is really nothing more then a thin popsicle stick with a needle on the end. No adjustments, no weight changing ability- if it doesn't work out of the box it never will. Given the number of comments on here about the tone arm skipping (mine did like crazy) I have to assume the quality control is totally absent.
Hello Sina, as per my other answer - the total wattage is 90 watts (I ordered same product from Dealfind.ca). The specs do not say if this is 90 watts per channel or 90 watts total.
Yes.
I don't know much about camera's but did you (format it) look up on (google.com) how to format the disk for your camera.
On the back of the tablet is a pinhole...Sticking a paper clip in there should reset to factory settings...You will lose all saved files and information though.
The icon for the app should either be on your desktop already or in the apps section. It should come right up when you click on it, if it works like its suppose to. I actually found another issue with my already. This thing is absolute junk.
NO, they are not two separate pieces, you could turn off the key board, but once you have the iPad in the housing they are hooked and do not become independent.
I believe that it is positively triggered so once power is taken away from AV1 and you give power to AV2 it automatically switches
Not the best in day light, but there are adjustments on the back of the unit.
my computer came with firefox. i do have problems with my internet going down and having to reset the internet.
I'm not an authority, but I think you are right. I looked at other sites that sell it. ASUS site was no help, as it does not separate the sub-models. As far as I can tell, the DS02 is just the DS03, but at a price difference. Maybe there is some small internal change that is invisible to the end user, but justifies a slightly different model number.
Depending on the size of your microchip you can store quite a bit of recording. Yes it rolls over to timed clips. 2-3-5 minute . You can adjust the timed length.
As long as it is still a Kenwood adaptor and you find the correct drivers it should work fine.
Yes
I would suggest contacting Tech Support. All the computers I have ordered from Amazon have work straight out of the box. I am sorry I cannot offer a better solution.
Hello, it is a Windows 8 machine. It doesn't come with any premium software loaded, although Windows 8 has a number of relatively simple apps built in. Consider LibreOffice, OpenOffice, and Google Docs as excellent free software add-ons. I think the machine is a great buy at the Amazon price that is being posted right now.
All computers should be, if you add an appropriate Wi Fi capable card. I do not know if the insides of this computer have any slots left open. In that case consider a USB Wi Fi adapter.
The one I purchased is wired........
It is so easy to remove it. I had the same concerns when I first purchased the keyboard. It stays in place to type but easily is pulled out. I absolutely love the keyboard though. It is just like typing on a MacBook Air plus I get several compliments on it!
Yes it does . I personally have a nikon d3200 and it works great for mine !
Happened to me also. I just pushed it back in.. Hasn't come out again.. Yet..
Sorry I don't know if it will connect with a dvr. Mine are connected via ADT pulse system, everything is then recorded on my laptop & iPhone. I'm not using a dvr with my system. You could call ADT directly and ask them. If you don't have ADT pulse system now you should consider upgrading to PULSE, I love it I can turn my lights on & off from my phone, arm or disarm alarm system from my phone & watch & record my home from my phone or laptop.
Yes.
When I turn off my XBOOM speaker the blue light goes off. The light should not stay on if you turn the switch to off.
Yes, but you may want better adhesive as the stock adhesive on the digitizer doesn't adhere well.
Yes! My 11 year old and 8 year old have these for their iPads and they are awesome! Very protective and sturdy cases.
I got my I pad last Christmas. I don't know if it is a 3 or not. But I have loved it for my I pad mini. My kids love it too.
Hmmm well, the box that mine came in was indeed griffin. I love my case. It is sturdy, good quality, and made well. You will be happy. ;)
You are good to go you can plug it straight to your mixer and boom redy to go or just your iPod and mic if you want
The projector have a hdmi input and vga outlet for dvds. If your dvds records programs - it should be able to show just fine. The projector does not record if that's what you are asking.
Yes
I don't know because this tv never worked for me despite two visits from repair men.
It comes with a DVD- Writer. DVD-RAM/R/RW. Thanks, PCrush
It has wireless capability, but it is a desktop, so you can either connect it to an ethernet or connect wirelessly.
It comes with a trial version of MS Office 2013, which expires in one month. If you wish to continue using any of the MS Office products you can purchase it on a monthly or Annual Basis, which ever method of payment that suits you.
110V only
At the most basic level, all this does is send ATA commands to the disk and reads the returned data. So if the corruption does not affect that, then yes, you can access the disk. However, if the disk has the partition tables corrupted, you will end up needing specialized software to recover things, like TestDisk (http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk). Boot viruses are not an issue.
I believe the Sabrient USB to SATA/IDE would be compatible with the older 40 pin PATA IDE interface.
I have yet to attach mine to recover files from my old Linux box, but since Sabrent lists the converter as compatible with MacOS X (which is a flavor of BSD Unix under the hood) this should work with Linux without difficulty.
no you can't, this mini have ram sold integrated, dont have slots SODIMM inside to expand memory as tipical laptops!!!!
mine works just fine, it is probably defective. I would try to exchange it for another.
I dont know it May work but it never worked for me I have an ipad
Yes, very good product great price I recommend
Yes it is
Does the normal Microsoft Surface pro tablet have a battery operated pen? If not, this is not for you. This pen has extremely limited compatibility (I bought this for my Genius tablet - it is NOT 100% compatible).
hello, I have not yet reached the product. I am from Venezuela and takes a while.
NO - 6800K is faster AMD A10-6800K advantages AMD A10-6800K In single-threaded programs, the A10-6800K has 2% better performance. The processor has 9% higher performance when running multi-threaded applications. The microprocessor is 1% faster in memory-intensive tasks. This CPU is unlocked. Therefore, the processor can be freely overclocked on most motherboards to get greater performance. Be aware that overclocking can void your warranty. The A10-6800K has 3% better price/performance ratio than the AMD A10-6700 CPU.
I ran minecraft on full settings with no issues, however if you have the open copy minecraft that allows you to enable super 3d mode, it's laggy
For starters the A10-7850K is the more recent line of their APUs. It has a better integrated gpu than the older 6600k, so you could game at a slightly higher quality than with the old integrated gpu of the 6600k. In terms of raw performance I believe the A10-7850K has a higherclock speed. But because this and the older 6600k are overckockable, you could gain higher than advertised clock speeds...granted you have proper cooling for the processor since I guarantee the stock cooler is not enough when you decide to overclock.
Yes...If it's described as a retail processor it comes with a heat sink fan.
Most, if not all, video cards (aka GPUs) should be compatible with this processor. I'd recommend either a GeForce GTX 960 or GeForce GTX 970, depending on price
16 in. X 16 in. [15 in. high ]
No, it does not include the module
I think you have to install the newest firmware.
Yes, it will fit your Nook Color, however the quality is less than stellar. It warps quite easily, making it difficult to use the stand
Speakers out to preamp only. Not speaker out to speaker.
No it doesn't - I looked into Bluetooth for my stereo so I could wear head phones, what I discovered was while I could technically use Bluetooth the sound latency (delay) inherent with Bluetooth is not a problem for music, but for movies the sound and picture will be out of sync.
This really depends the lighting conditions. I have a daylight basement (windows on on side), so there is some ambient light. I choose to use Carl's FlexiGray, Projector Screen Material, High Contrast Gray. Then I purchased some 1x3's and built a frame. The reason I choose the High Contrast Gray is that the ambient light doesn't reflect very well and the picture much better. I use to have a white material, I have found that the gray greatly improved the picture.
there is no magnet involved
Yes. As for graphics card, this model doesn't have a standalone graphics card since it has Intel HD graphics, but you can add a card if you wish.
You will not need more cords. Here is why - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmWngx0l2y8.
Yes this tablet is silent very quiet. Sound can be controlled very easily by the buttons on the side of the screen. If your question is referring to any sounds the computer make by the processor it is very silent.
My PC power is 350W. Not sure if this come originally from Lenovo, because I bought this PC from a middle man.
Yes, 802.11bgn
Hi there, I think even they have, it's only a 60-day trial. You will have to buy the license later!
Not sure about the power supply, but it does come with a pretty standard keyboard and mouse.
The video card should support dual screen. If you are asking about extending your desktop across 2 monitors, then that is video card software driven. If you are asking about showing your desktop on two monitors, again that is video card software driven. The video card that came with my system is a Nivida Gforce NTX650. If you right click on the desktop you should see Nivida Control Panel which controls the video card software. My card came with 2 video outputs, but you may have to get an adapter to get two monitors to work. Hope this helps.
Yes, just no screen and no built in wi-fi, that messed up because we didn't have a DSL line in this room.
You can, but you need to purchase an upgrade
No. I don't know what you're looking at, but this is a computer only with Windows 8.1. Incidentally, it works very well for my purposes. For less than $300.00 you can't beat it.
Hi Chris, you would need the original oem mirror to clip on to. If you still need to use the buttons of the On-Star, you could also install this device upside down. There is a function to reverse the camera as well. thanks Marie
12 months, thank you Marie
roughly about half an hour, would suggest to get a 32GB class 10, thanks Marie
Yes, you just use the usb port on the ps3 (usually on the front) and the cord is long enough for you to just sit down and play.
Searching google for the model's specs http://www.pcworld.com/product/1426219/lenovo-thinkpad-edge-e440-20c50050us-notebook.html shows: "Memory Standard DDR3L-1600/PC3-12800" which matches this memory's rating. It should work just fine as the specs match.
Hi Larissa, I'm Jewel with Kingston Technical Support, here to answer your question. KVR16LS11/4 is not compatible with your system since it is low voltage and your system requires standard voltage memory. The compatible part number is KAC-MEMKS/4G. For any further assistance, please call us at 1-800-435-0640 (USA and Canada only) M - F 6am - 6pm PT and I or another available Technician will assist you. Thank you for selecting Kingston as your upgrade partner.
Yah. Its the exact same remote. But with a key board. I love it!!
Yes it is a wireless
Yes it does.
That television uses the C13 version of The Instaoutlet.
Absolutely.
Yes.
You can use it with the charger connected, however the charger chord is very short so you can not use it comfortably that way. Not sure how long the battery lasts.
yes it does even though I don't use it a lot.
It's about an inch to an inch and half. It works find but the fan vibrates and bothers me some.
I can't say for sure, but this little amp doesn't draw that much power. In my 2006 Toyota Tacoma it is running off the stock radio wiring harness and the power wire is a tiny 18 gage wire. I was concerned about it at first because I thought the wiring weight not handle the load, but it has never blown the fuse or had any issues with the wiring and I like to crank it about as loud as it goes.
Universal versus alpine cables. Choose universal if you don't have an alpine head unit.
Dear Customer, This is a universal unit, so it should fit every can that has a single din radio. kelvin
Go out and get an Apple Camera Connector instead! I tried to go cheap and picked up this connector only to find out it recognized it once or twice and that was it! I even tried it with a lightning adapter and still no luck! I believe I spent like $17 total then another $30 for a genuine Apple Camera Connector! Lesson learned when it comes to trying to go cheap!
I never try to charge while using this device. But i believe it could. Sorry not to be so helpful.
We use it in our motor home to capture stupid people on the road. works great.
The Nex 6 has a standard hot shoe I think. This adapter is made for older Next models that used Sony's proprietary hot shoe. You shouldn't need an adapter for the Nex 6 and a standard remote trigger should work.
You probably need to unblug it and turn it back on. This might work. Good luck
Yes and yes
No, I have a motorola box. I would think if you are using the original remote that is IR, it should work. I use a universal remote with the correct code to the box and it works flawlessly, going on a year now.
With the right software, you can play Blu-ray 3D movies (I highly recommend CorelWin BD). Same thing goes for editing the home videos but I don't know the right software.
I bought one that said windows 8 I had to take windows 8 off and put on 7 do to windows 8 going out of business...it should say windows 7 but looking at photo it has the same windows I had on my 8 ....8 is ao much more complex I beleive it would b windows 7 as of april they no longer made 8
Hello Michele, Thanks for your interest in our Hp Laptop! Yes, it has wireless capabilities. We look forward to getting your business soon!
It is just a little over 37 inches wide, 3 1/2 inches tall, and about 3 inches deep.
No, too much bass. They are good bass boosted phones, but not good for sound monitoring.
No
You need to contact dell customer care for extended warrantee and international warrantee
The webcam is installed. Lenovo does not include Windows 7 recovery disks, but you can either create them yourself (there is a special program for that installed by Lenovo), or you can call Lenovo Tech Support and they will mail them to you.
no&#65292;
No. Cant be used as a web cam
It is nottouch screen...
Yep, it sure does. I just recieved mine set from ALL e RC today and it comes with the Naza-M V2, PMU V2, GPS Module, and LED Unit. They really could have done a better job with the product description.
Yes we only sell new merchandise.
With an iPad and the module for it you can. You could also fly remotely with a camera and video receiver.
No, they work only for charging the keyboard
Yes
Yes, this is actually sized for the ipad mini.
I use it to store my iPhone & Galaxy S4 cables, but can hold external hard drive and ipad mini.
Yes
The modem is factory sim free, which means never been locked for any operator. thank you
This device is 3 G only.
Yes. Perfectly.
Blue tooth
The Mobi isn't meant to transfer wirelessly to laptops (although a laptop SD card reader will let you physically insert it to transfer). Try the Eye-Fi Pro X2 line if you want laptop support.
Yes.
It has all of those things.
I've been able to get almost 5 hours with some charge remaining.
Yes, it has an HDMI port, 2 usb3 ports and 2 usb2 ports, and network port.
No, however if you want to, you can pull up the touch screen keyboard. Also the screen does a pretty good job of lighting the keyboard.
No it cannot , just the one it comes with
You are welcomed Marilyn. The power cord connects on the left side. (Left would be looking at open screen). Right side is the Optical Drive.
The best thing you could do is to call dell or go to there website
You can use HDMI cable to connect this laptop to TV screen.
Yes
No, it does not. Often the screen will provide enough light to see the keys, but if you plan on working in the dark fairly often, then you will want the backlit keys.
I've had no problems at all. I just HATE Windows 8, but that's nothing to do with this laptop.
Yes, 100V to 240V.
Nope.
I use one note all the time haha. It works well for school as I am a university student.
English
Yup. If you have no experience, it comes with some software that will automatically overclock up to 4.6GHz it for you, if you want to go higher you would have to do it manually through the software or bios.
So it claims on the ASUS page. http://www.asus.com/Motherboards/MAXIMUS_VI_EXTREME/
The first and third slot
No. This motherboard doesn't need a sound card. Why pay so much if it didn't have quality sound lol
That depends. Stock is 1600 but if the RAM will overclock you can get up to 3000 with this board. I myself bought 2400 speed Corsair and it will run the XMP profile easily with a small overclock on the processor to 4200MHz. If I go higher on the processor I have to start knocking the RAM back. If I remember correctly, my max overclock was 4400 with the RAM at 1866.
Yes, it does have a bluetooth connection.
Yes, this is an ATX size motherboard and the description of the case states that it is ATX compatible.
As far as I know only with a separate PCI E video card it supports VGA and DVI dual a link
I have the Asus B85M-G Motherboard and it does have USB 2.0 and a USB 3.0 headers.
I'm not sure about the i3, but I installed a Haswell i7 processor with no BIOS update required.
Not out of the box, but it can with updated BIOS You can find the latest BIOS version on Asus website
Yes it does.
Yes
The description of the screen says it also is for the K55N, so if it doesn't, you can return it. Really easy to replace as long as you have the right tools--mostly a small screwdriver
Yes, works great with my iMac g4...
I purchased mine to replace a pair of Bose 301's being used as rear surround speakers. I'm pleased as I think that the XLBP's sound significantly better and a good addition to my "sound room".
IT HAS FM AND A SINGLE CD PLAYER.
Mine says , assembled in china.
I wouldn't consider it easy. If there are any known vulnerabilities there will be a firmware upgrade available on the foscam site. I would be more worried about your wireless router vulnerabilities than the camera itself. In either case make sure you use wpa2 encryption and set a good user/password and check for firmware updates every month and this will nearly eliminate the possibilities of getting compromised. To note there are logs on the camera on who access it and from what ip. I hope this helps.
No it doesn't so some things will look a bit purpley. A note about security. A feature the new firmware is supposed to provide is to lock out Internet access if someone tries the wrong password 3 times I think. That's a nice feature to add to the firmware.
Two
No, unfortunately it doesn't. The description says it does which is one of the reasons why I bought it. The actual boombox doesn't.
Originally, we had our Garmin offset to the left to allow the cable to clear the base. I then purchased a left angle mini USB adapter on eBay, to allow the Garmin to be centered. The cable now goes up from the adapter, rather than down from the Garmin.
yes it will.
Yes it's good. I have one & it fits perfect.
hello! sorry, i'm not sure how to answer that.. I have the x202e and it fits perfectly. You should either contact the seller or find out if the dimensions are *exactly* the same..
Yes, you can use this or the official one. As long as it is a superslim model.
A solid state drive could be fitted to replace the existing hard drive. These are currently very expensive, particularly if you wanted to replace the existing 1 Terra-byte disc. There would not be room to fit an additional drive. Of course, you could always use an external SSD, utilising one of the many the USB ports.
It has a wireless keyboard and mouse and it has tv capabilities.the keyboard is not backlit. And the only cord that comes with it is the power cord.
Yes, no problem.
Under "What's in the Box?" I just saw "corded keyboard" and "corded mouse".
Yes you get two nvidia 750m's, one already installed in the ultrabay. The blu ray does come in a box in the packaging, all you do is slide one of the cards out, and put the blu ray in!
no
Hi, Only came with a 2013 Trial and 365 Trial
It can do both. I initially had it hard connected to my modem until I moved my desk and went with the wifi.
The system itself does not come with any type of vesa mounting built into the system. However the way that it folds down it would be fairly easy to fabricate a mounting system to facilitate mounting it on a wall.
Yes, it is a dual core.
HDMI cable is needed
No and no
Yes in the back
Yes,i installed and work fine .
No they are not.
no
No
Try changing the bios to legacy support
Yes, you just use the USB port to connect the keyboard of your choice. But remember , this does not come with a stand to hold the tablet up. You will need a case for that.
No I don't believe so. Although short on ram and disk space I have been able to do everything I have thrown at it. For light to medium duty tasks it's a great little tool. I have word and excel as well as several of my own programs on it. It still has half of its disk space left. If disk space is a problem get a large USB 3.0 drive to store your data on.
They are located underneath the monitor on the right side.
I increased the time by soldering a cap on the back side across the existing cap.. something like double or triple the value of the original. I do not have access to the board, so I cannot tell you what value I used. It was a long time ago [my fading memory]. I do not know how large a value can be used and still have the timer work reliably. Experiment!
No. This timer only gives a delay after being powered on, not when powered off.
Most Windows 7 applications will work with Windows 8. If you are upgrading from Windows 7 to 8, then you should run the upgrade assistant that will alert you of any programs you have installed that may have a problem running Windows 8.
The monitor only has two positions, open and closed. When open, it is only at that same angle that you see pictured. It seems like a good angle for general use, and all of the reviews say the viewing angles of the screen are very good, although I haven't seen it for myself. I am also wondering whether the limitation has been problematic for anyone who has used the device for a while.
I tthink so
If you are replacing your current card, any X16 GPU slot will work, you can find what your motherboard supports and base off of that. If you are trying to Crossfire this graphics card with another card, check the AMD support page to find out.
Yeah
Re: ideatab S6000. Try this site for what it's worth... Ken http://mobilesupport.lenovo.com/en-us/products/s6000_tablet?tabname=manuals
Yes
It works on my 60D so, it should be okay with the 70D
Although the overall performance of the Opteka is totally unacceptable, the motion detector is extremely sensitive. No scientific testing, but my personal experience is that the slightest motion up to 50 feet away fires the device. Note, however, that the device does NOT trigger the camera's flash nor does it offer the option of setting time delays between shots. In my case, trying for wild life shots at night, the result was almost 500 totally dark pictures. I complained to the vendor with no response and then to Amazon who gave ne a full refund for the device.
I have used this a couple of times for birds at a feeder. The distance was about 8 feet. Small birds like chickadees triggered it at that distance. I haven't used it for anything farther than that. I hope this helps.
I RETURNED IT AND NEVER GOT MY MONEY BACK
Dear Jim, Thanks for your inquiry. The Marantz SR6008 is designed to work with 120V only. Please let me know if I can be of any additional assistance. Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo
Thanks for your question. This piece isn't brought into the USA in silver. It's an amazing sounding piece
No
No security. You'll need your security/antivirus system to be configured to scan/watch a mounted/external drive (or however its defined.) The ones I got have some software on it, but it's more of a privacy/encryption scheme than keeping you protected from downloaded nasties.
to the best of my knowledge you can only use the ones you plug in. i was wondering the same thing when i got my BOSE, and i bought this because i found out most dont do that yet.
8. It doesn't get as loud.as you would think, but it sounds good
No.
Hello Joe. Yes you can use the Wi-Stor Wizard while charging and you can also use the Wi-Stor Wizard while its charging a phone, thats not a problem.
Probably not unless they have a left hand model.
Sorry not at the moment.
I don't know but I wouldn't waste your money. I was never able to use the one that I ordered. Both the right and left click button would always pop up a dialog box. That made it impossible for me to work on spreadsheets because I couldn't click on a cell without a box popping up. It was so frustrating trying to get the box to go away so I could see my screen!
Yes, that's exactly what it's made for. Worked great with my HP Stream 8 as well as my Samsung Galaxy S5. Don't see any reason why it wouldn't work with any device with this type of connection port (small 5 prong/micro).
No, but I've used it on a Dell and Lenovo tablet and it works with both of those.
? works with note 2
I was playing the battlefield hard line beta on ultra settings and was getting an average 60 FPS , hope I helped! I really am glad with my purchase of this computer!
GA-Z87_HD3
Yes it does!, it also has a display port and VGA output.
Hey...I have it linked to my blackberry and it connects to my stereo as soon as I walk into the house. It all depends on how you have it set up on your phone. I set it up so it automatically connects.
Yes you can mine even came with aux. cable
Yes you can. It has RCA inputs.
The cord length is a bit short, and the headphone tends to warm the ears really fast. If you're a runner, I'd recommend getting earphones that hook behind your ears. These are good for walking.
No I Did Not Find This On My App List, However, I would contact LG and ask to be certain. BTW the TV is awesome!!!
According to the instruction book that can with my set it would be 400 x 400 and the LG part number is LSW430B.
It is E431.
Are you flipping the cover into a triangle around the back? Or is the magnet at the hinge not holding the cover properly?
Negative
lift up on the inside of the case there is a Velcro Tab under where you put your Tablet in it, unless you didnt put it in that way of course
nope! would be nice if it did but it doesn't.
It is not waterproof, nothing covering the touchpad.
I don't have the product in front of me, but I remember it being narrow.
That is correct
i got one of these for my wife. she loves it roaming around on 4g. you CAN use this in South Korea either with a local GSM sim card or one bought from several online sources. GSM is the worldwide phone standard in most countries outside the USA. hope this helps. This is a factory unlocked 128 GB Wi-Fi and 3-g/4g ipad.
Probably, but measure the units first.
Dear sarah, This product you saw is a green case in this listing, and the black one in this listing is just to be shown the details about this product. And this keyboard has five colour with choices to be made: black&#12289;white&#12289;pink&#12289;green and red. We hope this information can help you. Thank you!
Not sure what you're asking. I bought a couple of them online because the prices were so different I thought they might also be. Bought a Nikon one, and a cheap after-market brand. Nikon's was about $7, the other was one cent. They're virtually identical, both work just fine. So I'd say, buy it online, and buy the $.01 version. Even with shipping, it should be less that $4-5.
Yes
No
see through.
No, You have to buy seperately.
Yes
Matte
Yes.
yes
Yes to the keyboard and no to ram. You're stuck with 4. Gb not mb lol
It does NOT go level with the keyboard, about 45 degrees or half way to flat.
1.96 pounds is tablet only. 3.6 pounds with keyboard.
I have a 64gig in mine and it works fine. Bruce
No
I will run apps if u get a ipod touch 3rd gen and app exstensions then it will access all apps with full touch control or newer ipod with pioneer apps hope this helped
No, this is for the iPhone 4.
Yes
Hi Barry, thank you for your question! According to Samsung, the official answer is no. However one of the ways they suggested to get around the issue was to rename the .SEC file to .AVI then use FXSplitter, a codec pack, in order to play it in windows media player. I hope this helps!
Yes
Hello Seth, Here is the gauge of the the cable you are referring to: 26AWG 7/0.16mm Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@mediabridgeproducts.com
Hello e6bwhiz, This cable is a 26-AWG cable. Thanks, Mediabridge Customer Support 856-216-8222 support@mediabridgeproducts.com
The SoundPop Bluetooth speaker has superb sound quality. The volume itself depends upon your sending device volume and the unit volume setting. Yes, the sound quality is far better that any laptop could offer, the volume seems better as well - no distortion. However, the range from the sending device is limited to about 25 feet (with no electrical interference). I use it in conjunction with my smart phone outdoors and indoors because of its portability. I recommend it for all music lovers.
No. It is only telephoto or polarized. You can put the circular polarizer part on the telephoto lens OR the other Olloclip 4 in 1 Wide angle or Fisheye lens (which is sold separately)
If you purchase the lens for the iPhone 5, it is compatible with the iPhone 5S but not the 5C.
wrong
Chances are no, I have the hd4000 pro and the stub to fit the handle was lacking girth. I used tape to increase the thickness.
I would call them if I were you. I use a canon 5D mark iii with a L series 50mm lens. This is not super light equipment. It sounds like your back would be killing you in a short period of time.
GTX 770 should be more then enough to handle 1080p on High Settings. But if you want a single GPU Card that will handle every next gen game on Ultra settings 1080p 60fps then GTX 780 is the clear choice.
Its pretty quite if you adjust the fan curve currently, If you keep the default fan curve its fairly loud, but it depends on how demanding the game is.
This unit includes a DVD-RAM/R/RW DVD-Writer.
Hi, It can run about 8 hours max. Thanks, Pcrush
Hi, It is DVI and VGA. Thanks, PCrush
The machine comes with a trial version of Office. You must buy a licence for long-term use.
This computer crashed after 2 months of owning. I caled both AOL and Acer for help and essentially got shown the door. After 2 hours of trying every restore and any other solution I could think of, miraculously the issue was resolved. Would I purchase another Acer? No. No discs come now as they used to, so you talk about planned obsolescence? All oem's now want you to keep buying cheap product. If I were to purchase another computer I would look at a HPQ.
That is a mistake in the listing. This computer does not have an Apple processor. It has an AMD C-70 1 GHz dual core processor
It comes pre-installed with Linpus Linux. However, it comes available only as a command-line prompt - not a desktop operating system. You will have to install an operating system (a Linux Distro, Windows, etc) to enable the functionality that you need. I installed the Ubuntu Linux desktop distribution on mine as an example.
Yes
It has both. The 20GB SSD is for the OS. The 500GB is for everything else.
I bought the Corsair Vengeance Blue standard profile 8GB two stick kit and it works fine even after pushing the speed up. I'm using the stock Intel cooler in a case with lots of room, so had no reason to get the low profile version. My first Gigabyte board had a bad memory channel (only the two slots furthest from the CPU worked), but Amazon replaced it quickly.
Yes. I have external speakers connected to the back of it.
I went to the gigabyte website and found This link to supported memory. Generally if the speed (DDR3 2400MHz PC3 19200 Desktop) is supported, it will work. http://download.gigabyte.us/FileList/Memory/mb_memory_ga-z87x-d3h.pdf
You won't need one unless you want to do some gaming. Onboard graphics will be enough for standard operations. If you do get a video card make sure you plug your monitor into that and not the mother board itself.
Bluetooth is not included, but there is nothing to prevent you from adding a USB Bluetooth dongle.
I have been able to it on both versions of windows 8. Currently running on windows 8.1.
If you install your CPU whatever model you have. It should allow you to at least boot into the BIOS so you can flash it then.
Yes
I'd consider doing a dual boot just in case the second OS doesn't take properly.
It's the GE750M 2GB. Bought mine a month ago-nice machine!
It has very good side viewing. It's the equivalent as viewing a decent TV screen. It's considerably better than my old AIO, a 24" MSI. That touchscreen seemed to add a fuzzy layer to the screen so it wasn't very crisp but not so on this Dell. I'd buy it again.
Look at the attachment accessories for gopro. This has the same connection.
Yes it will. I get around 30 to 45 frames on high preset settings.
Yes it does.
It will support Windows 7 if you want to install it once you get it, however per your question MSI does not offer any versions of the GT70 2OC models with 7 pre-installed by them. Windows 8 has come a long way since its release over a year ago and may people have come to really like it. Especially with the recent release of 8.1.
I have the MSI GT70. I have checked the HD model name and looked for it in the internet, and everywhere I found the concret model it comes with mine it says it is 5400rpm.

Hello, You can see it on the MSI website: http://www.msimobile.com/level3_productpage.aspx?cid=6&id=399 Best regards, Amuras, Inc.
Delta electronics model adp-180nb bc
Yes, the graphics card supports that resolution. however it will lag in games with that resolution but it sounds good for normal usage. If you want to play with x3 monitors i'd recommend a desktop instead (i bought this bcuz i travel oftenly)
I have had this one for over a year and it qualifies as the best laptop purchase I ever made. I have no reservations in wholeheartedly recommending this product. I don't feel the 4800MQ offers substantial differences to this processor. The video card however may be worth the extra couple hundred dollars. This one performs solidly with anything I have tried on it.
Once u open up the cover where the ram is located the warranty is over
I'm sorry I don't know. I have an iPad 2 and I love it.
The GE 16 Megapixel Camera accepts SD CARDS From 4 to 32 gigibytes or SDHD CARDS 4 to 32 gigibytes.
No. It has a single 2.5 inch hard drive space.
No it doesn't
hello, this unit has not SD slot. good luck.
This unit (TP-LINK SG1024DE) does not have any wireless interface built in. I have it plugged in to my Airport Extreme (the AE gives me wireless service), and the TP-LINK handles the wired traffic.
according to one of the rteviewrs, yes
why not?
I'm answering your question on 2x 1920x1080, 2x 2560x1080 monitors. It's got four display outs, two DVI, one HDMI, one MDP.
If you have the upgrade board on the phantom 1 then you do not need the PMU.
Yes, I received two (fairly short) cat-5 cables.
"Damage resulting from computer viruses" is listed as an item specifically not covered by the plan.
I really don't know.purchased mine same time than my LENOVO.SO FAR didn't have to use it.
Probably not necessary but a little extra protection was worth the piece of mind.
the computer I purchased from amazon had viruses on it and it didn't work property. Go figure a new machine. Plus there was no access code to use the microsoft office suite even though I have emailed the amazon and the company two times. This warranty didn't cover it b/c it doesn't protect against software issues. If I had to do it over again, I would not buy a computer from amazon. The price might be lower than others but I found it was not worth the aggravation and frustration.
6 7/8" wide, 17" long, 14 3/8" tall.
On the right side of the front panel, so is the usb 2 and usb 3 port, the power and rest button and the power and process indicater light
No it did not
Yes. There are two headrests, both with the 9" screens preinstalled. One headrest features a screen with a built in DVD player, while the other headrest has a monitor only. You connect the video output from the main screen to the secondary. They work great.
Depending on the vehicle it could be more or leas difficult. In my case it was a breeze. 2003 Kia Sedona.
I read the entire plan, decided it had too many loopholes, and returned it for an actual Nikon plan that Amazon offered. I am sorry, but I can't remember if shipping was part of this less-than-perfect warranty plan.
To get the correct answer I would call Smart Guard at 1-877-308-8071 and get the facts.
I do not know and based on my experience of NO RESPONSE to any requests for support - my bet is NO ...
Yep. It works nicely.
Yes, I have small, two tiered cabinet, that wouldn't hold all three units, so I Placed the Player unit on the top shelf and the speakers on the bottom shelf. Works beautifully.
Hello Lisa, Thanks for your interest! Asus X501A-SPD0503W comes with a 2.4GHZ Intel Pentium 2020M dual core processor as the heart and features a 2MB L3 cache. This machine also incorporated with a 4GB of DDR3 SDRAM that can be expanded up to 8GB of DDR3 SDRAM for faster multitasking performance, Intel UMA graphics, Intel HM70 Express Chipset and running on the 64 bit version of Microsoft Windows 8 as the operating system. We hope this helps!
Asus X501A-SPD0503W Intel Pentium 2.4GHZ 15.6-Inch Laptop - 4GB Memory - 500GB Hard Drive - White
Hello, it comes only with its small cable to enable it to connect with mobile sub charger, I hope I could answer the question, regards, I am happy with it.
Yes. It comes with the micro USB used for S4. It also comes with adapter for iPhone 4s or prior (including iPad I believe 2 and before?) it's the bigger one if that helps. Also comes with 2 other adapters that I'm not sure what phones they're associated with.
yes. It also works with Macs and in Parallels running Windows on a Mac
The strap is very secure, just did 30' free fall into a lake and it stayed on
It does fit with the waterproof case.
In Colorado, a bright day, this took with NO power reading all day from 6am-9:30pm for a full 100% charge. At 1pm I turned it to face west. Traveling though, with use on ipads and lights, it seemed to take 2 days of charging. Very good charger and unit, you can always add an extra solar cell if you need to.
This DVD Blu Ray only has HDMI connection. I wish too I could connect older Bose Surround Sound system. But it has no red or white audio connectors either.
Yes it does. I watch free, streaming Amazon Prime movies and TV shows all the time. I also watch the movies and TV shows Amazon sells. The stuff I purchase is streamed from their servers whenever I want to watch them.
Hello Ricardo, Yes, it does have the Amazon App. Thank you
Thanks for your question. These have 15" woofers. This is an awesome system. Thanks again.
Thanks for your question. This awesome system comes with the speakers. It's an amazing system
No
Nope, it's way to slim
Try holding the power button down on the headphones until the led light starts flashing 2 different colors (ie: blue & red - it will flash fast - alternating colors) - this puts the headphones in pairing mode ... then with the bluetooth device you are pairing the headphones to ... make sure bluetooth is enabled and then search for the headphones (search for devices) ... when you find them - select connect from the bluetooth device to pair with the headphones.
This model doesn't have the pen or the digitizer required to make the pen work. You can't expect to buy the pen and have it work with this model.
Purchased for our daughter for school...she has not mentioned any issues.
No, unfortunately it does not. Which makes typing actually difficult by low light.
US
Yes it is
I get about 4-6 hours. It's lasted me entire flights from NYC to LA with no issues.
I'm sure any store that sells musical instrument would have one
Thanks for your question. Please look at the Sennheiser RS160 system. The transmitter base will need to be hard-wired to the Samsung unit. The Samsung system will not work with bluetooth headphones. This is a fantastic sounding system. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Samsung dealer.
I have never gotten the sound to work on my monitor, but I am using an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660. You do need to have the USB cable coming out of the back of the monitor going into your computer to get the touchscreen feature to work. Took me a few hours to discover that.
With some form of conversion kit, but it wouldn't make sense, If you want an external DVD RW, the DVD RW drive with power adapter, etc. would probably cost less than converting this one.
Contrast is good. The color of DVD or CD used is up to user. I use the gold tone. Print is black. Pictures do lose some contrast, but type is clear. I normally use photos only when it's a wedding or special occasion, then select ao high def picture. It will lose some contrast but still looks good on the disk.
A lens is NOT included with camera. Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera lets you use the most incredible range of lenses. With the Super 16 size sensor you can use a wide range of adapters for film quality Super 16 lenses, or use commonly available low cost Micro Four Thirds lenses and more. With full electronic control of your lens, you can simply point and set iris all on command! The Micro Four Thirds lens mount also gives you the flexibility to adapt to PL or other lens mounts as required.
when I purchased the camera it did not come with any software. The latest firmware was already installed. I had to download the DaVinci software from the website
Must be plugged into a standard wall outlet.
It was given as a present so I don't know ...
No, it only goes back to where you left off if you pause it, otherwise it will bring you to the beginning.
yes!!!
no,no es necesario
Yes there is
I don,t know it does not work for tv.
All I know, I can play DVD from both US and Indonesia. I tried with some other US DVD player and I cannot play any Indonesia DVD (somebody told me, most of US DVD Player can only read NTSC, while mine most likely is PAL) So I just drew conclusion, it should be compatible with any type of DVD
No. It's only for watching dvds
it's not widescreen.
Man its jus not a good product i am totally dissatisfied with the TV function. I played my tv once got nothing its in new form i jus left it in the box in the basement i wish i vould sell it for 40 bucks jus to get half my money bac i dont like to buy and send it bac but i would d this product
No there is not. It's like a netbook
No it is not touch screen.
My experience has been that after power off this Bravolink player restarts where it left off on the DVD.
I really don't know. I don't keep my iPad in it. When I am finished at night, I put my iPad in a docking station and charge the Just-in-Case for the next day.
comes with 2 brackets in the box
Never used a blender with this but I can tell you it fried everything that I used on it. Do not buy
4GB SD cards. I had trouble with the card they included, corrupted on an accidental power cycle. Check out http://elinux.org/RPi_VerifiedPeripherals and buy one or two of those cards. That way you can install a couple distros or backup your good one on another card. Worth the five bucks they cost
I think its made for the Dell screen as it has cutouts for the camera and windows button (used when screen is flipped in tablet-mode).
Nope is doesn't come with any solution. You can apply directly but it creates bubbles. I had to make my own slolution. They give 2 screens just in case you screw first one.
Yes.
Yes, one
Processor Speed - 2.9GHz up to 3.5GHz
This is a solid personal machine, haven't tested it on high end gaming.
1/4-20 bolt hole. Standard tripod receiver, same bolt size as my Nikon and Panasonic Lumix cameras.
Sure!!!
The graphics card will work fine. The CPU will not. The i5-3570K is an LGA 1155 socket. This is an LGA 1150 socket. You want a haswell CPU, not Sandy Bridge. Example i5-4670K
We offer a few different shipping options including Standard (3-5 business days) and Two-Day (2 business days). For customers in Alaska or Hawaii, you can choose Expedited (1-3 business days).
Do you want to know if it will work with blue tooth?
Well yes it requires drivers, but it comes with them. The only point you would need to fetch new ones is if you wiped the computer with an installation of windows outside of the built in recovery. Out of the box it works flawless. Some users might experience issues with certain wireless routers, then they will use maybe an updated driver that might help the situation, and if thats the case so be it. But fresh out of the box it'll work.
About 2 1/2" or so, really small but sound pretty good.
Just one
Yes it will.
I have a D800 and Sb 900 and Yongnuo YN568EX flash , and they work al the time the SB9oo control the other flash, I had problem with the SB 800, it will not communicate in TTL and was not able to adjust.
Yeah. If the battery gets used up just plug it via usb to your computer, 115vac, car usb converter... Lights go all disco too. Pretty cool imho
Yes, you can tell the player to repeat the entire disk (Repeat) or indicate which section or list of sections you wish to have cycle repeatedly (A-B Repeat). It's on page 4 of the operating guide.
Here is a link for some comparisons of different models. I've had a note 8 for some time now and use it for everything, lots of writing, drawing, scheduling, note taking on the go, plus it syncs with my note 2 phone. I love the size and everything about it. Hope this helps. http://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-tab-vs-note-vs-pro/
The MSI Z87-G43 support standard memory only up to 1600, but it supports faster memory but that are specific for the MSI Z87-G43. Please see bellow (Taken from the Manual). The OC means Overclokiing and you will have to tweak with the BIOS to make it work. If you're not into overclocking stay with the 1333 or 1600. Supports DDR3 3000(OC)/ 2800(OC)/ 2666(OC)/ 2600(OC)/ 2400(OC)/ 2200(OC)/ 2133(OC)/ 2000(OC)/ 1866(OC)/ 1600/ 1333/ 1066 MHz
i have the same CPU that you have. I use Intel (on chip) graphics with 1 monitor thru DVI. I do not have a graphics card. I verified that if I switch my monitor over to its HDMI input, it is receiving signal from the mother board HDMI port. This would imply that you can drive 2 monitors thru onboard chipset graphics (without having any graphics card). Of course you will need minor changes in the operating system control panel screen settings.
3rd party
hello, Yes.
Yes, you will need a music player
Mine included a Bluetooth keyboard.
No, the keys are ordinary keys. Light grey silver on black. Hard to hit them in the dark.
This unit will not power the UAP AC. This AP requires 48v PoE. You will need to buy the Ubiquiti TS-8-PRO ToughSwitch 8 Port.
Hmm im not sure.. with mines to change the colour u need to use the remote
Yes
Let me clarify further. POE voltage is programmable by port so you can turn off the POE feature and power your radios with separate 18 volts and you would be OK.
Yes
The glasses are clear, the frames are black.
Yes, it requires a DVR as well to record the footage from the camera. The battery life is dependent upon the DVR's battery as well. We have a 3 or 7 hour battery FYI. We also have a few cameras that do not have any wires, but do not record for that long. Please contact us for details.
We hooked to our non-blue tooth tv with no problem.
It is 32''x5'' and it works very well.
Canon provides the following accessories with the camera: *LP-E12 Li-ion Battery Pack *LC-E12 Battery Charger *USB Cable *Wide Strap *Front & Rear Lens Caps *Eyecup *Software CD-ROM *Instruction Manual
I was wondering the same thing. The keyboard has tabs that stick into the grooves of the side seams which keeps it very snugly in place. As it is, it is a bit difficult to pry the tablet out of the keyboard and a rubber skin would probably make it more difficult, unless the tabs are filed down. Then I don't know how well the grip would function.
it can fit it with adapter ring and filter.
I just realized it DID come with a wrist strap. Not a neck strap though.
Hello man, front camera angle, I am not sure, but it's amazingly good, I would say +/- 170 degrees. Quality is amazing. The back camera I have not installed yet.
it does have a 64Gb flash drive, but on mine right out of the box yesterday only 31GB of 49GB was available...
A fold up prong plug with a detachable USB plug, like an I phone charger.
Yes
it can record on pc it also have a sd slot to record on sd card
Dear Javier, Thank you for your interest in our product. yes, this camera will come with cd software, please noted. If you have any other questions, please don't hesitate to ask me. Bestr regards, Carol Gadget zone customer support
Yes. But just Android Games
We are able to use our tablet for Facebook, xfinity to go, netflix, skype, gmail, you tube , lots of kids apps, and angry birds , uverse apps, and it still runs fast we use a micro sd card that's got 32 gb so the apps save to that
Hello, the version I received does have a dual core processor. It is very responsive and doesn't lag often. Looks like its a hit or miss on these devices.
Thanks for your inquiry, sorry to say it has no bluetooth, any question, please contact us freely.
haha no, it only gives you 1 gb you can actually use. my advice: get an sd card
only if you get an app
Would not recommend. Frame is not overly strong and once the screen stretches over it would probably bow
The first question that I would need an answer to in order to respond would be, for what camera is the Kalimar f2.8 - 200mm lens mounted? What camera does it originally fit onto? Once I know the answer to that, I can tell you if it will work for your lens and if not, I can direct you to the adapter that it will fit with.
yes and yes
The specs don't mention blue tooth. My tablet doesn't have blue tooth.
The mounting equipment that came with it.
Yes, it is a white screen and is best used in a light controlled rom if you want full contrast.
this is region free so no. Some DVDs/Blurays will still not play so I can't play my Lord of the rings box sets but I think this is some security on the DVDs/Bluray. You will need a HDMI cable and a free slot on your TV.
You should be able to change the language in the setup menu
I've had mine since early September. I use it multiple times a day and I haven't had a single issue with it so far.
Yes it works great. I am a beginner but I have a t3i and the flash is working well.
This case has a lot of inside space, you can mount it
No they won't.
Not that I know of
I honestly don't kno if the model number changed ,all I kno I love my camera..the night vision on this camera is better than any of my other cameras.. :)
These headphones are for adult size head, I would not recommend for a child.
if the device has bluetooth then yes you can use it
Yes it will fit the 7" Kindle even if you don't have camera, besides camera is front facing.
Yes it does. I bought this for my childrens 1st Gen kindle fire 7". They have had these on their kindles for about 4 months and have dropped them several times and there has been no damage to the kindle. The kickstand broke off the first day but my kids are 3 and 6.
Sorry this case does not come with screen protector.
Yes it does. It comes with multiple colors of gels as you see here in the picture
It should. From what I can tell when I use it, it'll fit on any external speedlight. I know it works great on my Neewer flashes, and a friend of mine tried it on one of his Nikon flashes as well. So yeah, it should work great for a vivitar one!
I have four of these, they all work just fine. Not sure about pressure sensitive though.
No, both are wireless. Yes, it have a receiver part
A USB dongle goes into your computer, then the dongle communicates with the keyboard using a Microsoft wireless technology (not bluetooth).
On the back of the numeric keypad, there is a screw about 2 inches from the bottom edge. Take a very thin blade type screwdriver and turn the screw 5 or 6 revolutions. Then, insert the screwdriver or your fingernail in the gap between the large panel of the back and the small panel of the back and pry open the battery cover. For best results, use the thinnest blade screwdriver you can find. The slot on the screw is very narrow, so a regular size screwdriver won't fit inside the slot. You need a very thin blade.
They feel roughly equivalent to the keyboards on macbook pros except for the function/escape keys, which are not keys, but rather buttons. If you use these (escape key / Vi), I can't recommend the keyboard.
I use it with Mavericks with no problems and Mountain Lion prior. Plug and play.
No. It requires the app which is only available for IOS or Android.
Full windows 8, not RT
The Tab 5 is both a tablet or a small laptop. The keyboard separates from the tablet by pushing a release button so it can be used either way. It can be charged either way also.
Yup it comes with an S pen
It doesn't come with a DVD drive, however i believe there is a version with dvd instead of the SSD. I hope you have a fabulous life Michael.
Yes - Here is a review of it. This is a wonderful card. http://www.legitreviews.com/nvidia-geforce-gtx-770-reviewed-in-2-way-sli-and-nvidia-surround_2210
It's one piece
I am using it in my Garmin RV 760 LMT so not sure about the 2557 sorry.
Looking at the specifications, it appears that it does not have a camera mode. To be absolutely sure I would recommend you call Garmin and ask a technican there.
I believe it is a beeping sound rather than the voice saying "you're over the speed limit!" It has happened to us a couple of times...does make the driver look at the screen and you see the speed limit flashing. Hope this helps
This device creates its own wifi network. Your phone will need to connect to this network in order to transfer photos.
This is a very secure camera. You may assign various users with separate login passwords. The main admin account does have password protection.
Connect it to wired router/switch and http to its ip address to configure it. Should be 192.168.0.1 or something.
Yes you can. I had a relatively thick case on mine and it clipped just fine
It just clips on over the phones camera lens but I'm not familiar with the 6 to say for sure if it will fit.
Works with a thin case, wouldn't recommend it if you have something like an otterbox
There are many problems connecting to internet
One can run crisis 2 on ultra and play a blue ray in a second screen. It's a beast.
The 512GB blade is sold through Amazon by a company called Techno Intelligence and is NEW...just a shame it is so damn expensive!
05a
2.5 inch radius
Yes, but drilled hole on new antenna was off hole on radio, so had to remove sm. part on radio to accommodate new atenna. Keep all old parts for any adaptation needed...
yes! but it was sent to me with a bad battery and no charger. I would suggest the Ambient Adventurer 2 more money but a lot better comes with a charger
Gee I have not used this very much, and I am not having any issues with it yet. Not sure why yours may have done that. Was it exposed to extreme heat?
You need the ZeusGard Wifi adapter to use Zeusgard wirelessly. It does not work with a regular wi fi. You can directly access Zeusgard if you are on a wired LAN. The interface for this product is not very complex so there are not many bells and whistles.
4"x4"X2"
I am not an expert. But I don't think that would work.
If Amazon ships to that country, then yes.
Yes
2tb
Yes it has.
Yes, I am connected to a brothers wireless lazer printer.
I'm not an Apple user so I'm not sure I can answer the question. But I can say I love the Galaxy. It does everything I need it to do and probably a lot more. There are tons of apps in the Play Store and the tablet, my Samsung phone and my laptop all sync nicely so I have everything at my fingertips on all 3 appliances. It's also very fast. I would say if you want to go with Apple you probably should have "I" everything. Hope this helps.
Thank you for your inquiry. Orion offers a single axis motor drive for this telescope and mount: Orion 7827 EQ-2M Electronic Telescope Drive. It is available on Amazon.

Chinese retailer geekbuying releases stock updates but much better roms are at developer website freaktab.com. New rom based on sdk2 will be out soon.
WE test with lOgitech C170, it can work great in SKYPE .
HI,Please don't worry, now all of the CX-919 which shipped from us is already android 4.2 system.
Yes.
You'd hear it hum in a small bedroom with no background noise and even then, anything other than what I mentioned you have to put your ear next to it to make sure it's functioning. It's quiet
Yes, designed to be used in the sun.
Yes, many Canada courses are included but I would advise you to spend more money and buy a different brand. Calloway is getting out of the GPS business at the end of 2014. I have already sent mine back and purchased a Golf Buddy Platinum II for $229.00. The Calloway did not function very well and their software was idiotic.
Right. You just can not update but it still works.
It is brown. A nice brown. Goes well with the camera.
you use the clips on your camera. The strap attaches to your camera not the case
That's incorrect. While taking it out takes less than a minute, you will definitely have to remove cover to attach to tripod
I washed it and let it air dry.
no unless yu buy like the hard drive and replace it but that might cost yu even more
Yes
I used them for mine
Yes, it works with an Asus N550JV.
Use OC profile 1 at your bios... it will automatically configure to use 2400 MHz Ram speed..
This motherboard has an LGA 1150 socket for the CPU. You will need to check what the socket is on the specific i7 processor is to ensure the right fit.
System FAN x 2 connectors CPU FAN x 1
i5-4440 is a LGA 1150 socket cpu, so it should fit and work in this motherboard which is for LGA 1150 cpus.
The Z87-G1 takes the i7-4770K. It needs a bios update for the newer Devil's Canyon CPUs like the 4790. You should get the MSI Z97-G41 for the i7-4790k. It's bios already supports that CPU.
Yes, it can handle both. I use 1600mhz RAM in mine.
I checked collimation when received (with enclosed cap) and it was perfect. Checked it every three months since, only needed adjustment twice. Takes about 5 minutes and is easy.
I don't know. I was very disappointed with the performance of the one I got. I tried every way possible to make it operable, but the only use I have been able to make of it is a protective case for the Nexus, and for that, it is perfect.
No, they don't come with wireless equipment.
This unit is not wireless. It comes with a bit over 19 feet of RCA shielded video feed cable and 5 feet of 12 volt DC wire. There is a wireless module available for it (available on Amazon), however. http://www.amazon.com/TaoTronics-TT-WM01-Wireless-Operating-Transmitter/dp/B00DOQAGO2/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&qid=1398720103&sr=8-12&keywords=taotronics+wireless
I have the RT Pro 2 and yes it does fit, snug with the keyboard and comfortably without it.
Nope. I used an i5-4570 with this board and it didn't have any problems with the stock Intel heatsink...
Greetings, Memory installed in this motherboard will operate at 1066MHz, so you can install a 1333MHz or 1600MHz DIMM; either will operate at 1066MHz. Best regards, MITXPC
It is designed for Beats Solo and Solo HD. Not for Wireless or Studio headphone model.
It says frustration Free...it means package is easy to open! isn't that just a stupid way to write "easy to open"??
Yes, it should work perfectly. Ours does. Good luck.
Yes
5900 RPM
A years later, but Seagate says 3 years. http://www.seagate.com/internal-hard-drives/nas-drives/nas-hdd/ --- scroll down about 2/3 of the page.
I installed two in a Synology 213j yesterday, and they're working just fine. Initiated, and setup easily.
Yes it can. It just has some extra capabilities that you won't be using, which won't impact anything. Wow, I just looked and saw why you're looking to buy this one - it's the cheapest 4TB drive available. Wow. I'd say go ahead and get it.
It depends on the type of data. For sustained reads and writes, like with files larger than a few MB, there is likely no performance difference. However the 7200RPM will have a performance advantage in response time and reads/writes with very small files. In general, the 5900 would be better for data storage and media, where the 7200RPM would be better for Operating Systems and application data.
The 32GB is a proper quad channel kit, but buying 4, 8GB sticks will probably work it is possible that errors may occur
Desktop
Yes.
Well even with eln15 sometimes dont show baterry but about your batteries is because are rechargable and the problem is the power is 1.2 so the camera is smart and things is low baterry of course with the problem that dont work properly. The only solution i found is never use rechargable AA baterries to work correct
My son uses it for that and loves it!
jake nelson, In the default configuration, it will support 2 montiors.
Yes! It works great. HDMI cable to one of your inputs on your tv and you are in business.

Extremely quiet, even with 6 fans!
Ed S. The unit ships with 2 memory slots. One contains 8GB of memory and the other is empty. While the motherboard is capable of being upgraded to 32GB of memory per manufacturer spec, until 16GB sticks are widely available, the most likely effective maximum is 16GB.
Can't answer directly, as I'm not using either of those. But I do run Nero, and it operates just fine on this system. Nero is a fairly powerful and resource intensive program, so I'd think that the pc ought to run other programs well also.
I've never had a problem with lag...but I also have the highest speed Internet available in my area
Monica W., Changing the O/S will not void your warranty. Also, while we cannot guarantee that any particular version of Linux will run without issue, we do not expect you would experience anything out of the ordinary.
Mine was, but now mine was a gift so I'm not sure.
Justmyopinion, This system ships with the following video connections: 1x DVI, 1x VGA and 1x HDMI.
Yes...there's an HDMI port
Ariel, This system is currently shipping with Windows 8.1 64-bit.
Zachary Orr, L3 cache for the AMD FX 6300 is 8 MB. L2 cache is 6 MB.

Yes and No. While the mounting accessories will (head strap/chest strap and other accessories), the batteries WILL NOT WORK.
Yes
000
Hmmm..that's a good question. Honestly I never tried but I believe you could do it. Never thought about doing it. But I will try it as soon as I can.
Yeah, we had a similar problem and had to return it. Really liked the design of this and was disappointed it didn't work longer.
All four ends to the case are exposed so you can access the pen when you need it
Sounds like possibly a faulty battery. Have you tried sticking a straight ion into the little reset hole? Sometimes that works. Also, did you charge it for the recommended time before the first use?
It does and beautifully. Lots of complimenst on it. Got it in the light pink, soooo cute. Works great.
Yea. Mine fit very well and the screen was always in place, no sliding around.
Yes
I can see two inputs at the back panel for sub woofer. However, I have added only one.
Can't speak to other models but this receiver passes through hdmi 2.0
this is 110 volts. If you want to use it as 220 then you will need a power inverter. Make sure you buy a good one with lots of power since this receiver needs lots of power. thanks
No
While using the VTuner app (Net) just now, I learned the following: the HDMI video display is needed to select a station and to display the metadata (title, performer, etc.) of the track currently playing, but not to continue listening to any already selected station.
The length the 4532 is 42" while the 4530 is 47"
We have a JVC TV and typed in the model number and this replacement lamp number came up, we bought and it worked. The last one we replaced lasted about 4-5 years. I wish I could better assist you. Good luck. The last one we bought, paid over $200.00, so now questioning the longevity on this cheaper one.
I'd email them and ask. I got a refurbished one and it's been good. For about 5 months
Approximately 18"x15"x6".
$140 but it doens't say how long they last. http://www.amazon.com/PowerLite-Cinema-projector-replacement-housing/dp/B005HB8OXW
No
I THINK IT ONLY WORKS FOR 1TV...1SHOW...
My charger is fine.
Only with an adapter which I use and works fine
It does not work with iPhone 5. I have it to a freind that has iPhone 4. It came w a cable to use with iPhone 5 but my phone would not recognize that cable as authorized or compatible.
not sure what kind otterbox/case on your iPhone 5, hopefully not too thick at the bottom, if too thick, the connection with 8Pin connector would be poor thus not working properly.
This is a good question but it is difficult to answer. The best way to get the answer is by reviewing all the reviews or listen in a show room. You can visit any radioshack.
I just tried to check it but my batteries are dead :( sorry!
No, the little square box speakers by ihome are. The dock also does not work with iPhone 5.
No, This version is not Bluetooth. That is why it is significantly discounted. However, they do have a new Bluetooth version available for a higher price. Although I'm not sure it comes in blue. Here is the link
it is a screw mounted type, it has two holes at the base that has a cover to hide the screws.
Yes that's what mine is
It does. about 1/3 is vented.
No
Not sure. But I have a pair of "beats" over-ear headphones. They are a tight fit, but they fit, "beats" dimensions are 6.9 x 9.1 x 5.3 inches. I hope this information helps.
It should be compatible, yes.
The pole is tight. If you extend it, it will stay on it's length.
The top portion of the mono pod is there a changeable you can use whatever mouth as long as it's a screw in mount on the top if it does not fit
There is an LED light. It's green when they are ready to provide charging, orange (hard to see it different than red) when the batteries are low, and red when the batteries don't have enough charge to charge something. It stops charging the batteries when they are full. The light also says when the batteries are done charging. It blinks when they are charging. What the light says is printed in the bottom of the unit.
Hi, yes it is compatible with Time Machine. Thanks!
Should be fine.
It doesn't have a fan controller so if you plug it into a 4 pin molex they will run at highest speed but you can plug it into your motherboard or a fan controller and control the speed of the fans.
Works great with the tablet cover I bought at the same time from Dell. Without the cover the mount seemed a little loose.
Yes. I have an iPad 3 in a case and it fits. It's tight, but it will hold it. The two bottom arms swing open and the top arm is adjustable up and down with a locking lever. I use it on the road to hold my iPad on my constantly vibrating drum rack. It's solid.
it has an excellent nose cancellation system. Can be used well.
Yes Use Xbox One stereo headset adapter for analog connection
Yes. Even with older bluetooth adapters.
Yes...I use mine for gaming and Skype. Should be plug and play but you may have to go into control panel and set up the microphone.
I don't own a Nikon but I do have a Canon 5D Mark III with Battery grip and it works perfect with it. This is a great accessory. I'm very happy with it.
I know of no other eyepiece. You might check with photographyandcinema.com as I believe they are the importers. Personally, I prefer this type of eyepiece. SmallHD.com offers two kinds: this wraparound style and a round accordion/bellows style. Check out PART# ACC-VF4-EYECUP-R2. Unfortunately, the SmallHD eyepiece will not fit the Carry Speed VF4. They are molded completely differently.
I have Time Warner and mine worked without a hitch. It continues to work with both hardwires and wireless without any problems. I live in Northeast Ohio if that makes a difference.
Yes but I highly recommend changing the thermal compound in it because it tends to overheat if you don't
About 4 hrs
9.5 mm as i measure it from the base of the barrel to the end of the plastic tip
As far as I know, it will not but I will check the next time I'm home to verify that. My setup does not contain any crossover connections and it works quite well. I work in IT and I'm fairly certain a crossover will fail but I will verify that.
All you need is the yellow red and white cables and an HDMI cable everything else is included
I can give you no answers. I was never able to hook up the device due to a glitch in my iPad. Sorry. I hope someone else can answer. ):
Yes
Yes this laptop is wifi capable, no it does not have bluetooth.
6GB
Yes, it does. The switch to open the player is a little tricky and takes some getting used to. It is located on the left side of the computer and you have to "feel" for the switch to open the compartment.
Yes, a cool red backlight...
Once Intel / Toshiba made available the software fix for the networking failures I had experienced, I removed my ASUS externally USB connected card and have had NO PROBLEMS with the hardware. So I can not give you a direct answer, for your purposes, change out may be mute.
It does not automatically put the iPad into sleep mode
I am not sure. Please call Toshiba technical support at 1800-631-3811
Yes it does.
If you are using it for a serious gaming machine, it may shut down from overheating itself. Otherwise it seemed to cool itself fine.
Nope mine fits pretty snug
If it can run League on high definition and still maintain 60 FPS even with a skype chat open then I can almost guarentee that it can handle Defiance.
yes you can do that its pretty simple . all you need to find out your ram model . that you can call to customer care and asked them .then by online same memory and install it.
not so well it needs more ram
Yes, absolutly. For torrent download, I recommend You adownloader, good app; And for playing videos: Mobo Player
It works for my Samsung Galaxy SIII. So i would imagine it should work for the nexus. Good luck!
Hello, We do ship internationally unfortunately it won't be free shipping, but if you would like an accurate shipping quote we would need a complete address to calculate it. Address: City/Town: State/Province: Turkey Best regards, LCD Stores
Yes.
Thinks so...do you have one?
If you have a 13" MacBook Air mid 2011 this battery should work fine. I had mine installed at a service center and it has worked perfectly.
Press star 9 star to silence alarm, to retrieve press star 9 star again
yes
There is no panic mode and no way to shorten the delay.
There is a delay of about 20 seconds on mine. And if you have it set to make phone calls, it increases the delay time until basically the first call has been attempted.
The car charger attaches to the holder for the RV 9365 LMB GPS. It is what I think they call the mini USB end. Check this website and see what the mini USB ends look like; https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#q=mini+usb . There are USB cables that on one end will plug into your computer and the other end is the mini USB end that will plug into the GPS for hooking to computer for updating. That cable also came in my pack when I bought the unit.
Yes it does. It has thousands of campgrounds listings from private - good sam's - and federal and state ones. It is a great tool to have. Program into it type and size rig. wether or not to allow u-turns (which saved us from possible problems. You won't be sorry. PJ
It work pretty good but heat up at times
1 month
No but the issue isn't the whiteboard. this product and most of the ones like it do not work with many short - throw and none of the ultra-short throw projectors
It does not use standard GMRS or FRS frequencies. Intercom communication is via bluetooth and is full duplex. It can only communicate with 2 riders at a time. You can connect 3 of them and switch between any 2, but 3 people cannot talk at the same time.
As far as the bluetooth it should work fine with any tablet or device with bluetooth. As far as fit, I would look up the dimensional specs of the Galaxy and if it is similar to yours it should fit.
yes ,and we love this for the price it has performed great! we bought the one year warranty,doesn't look like we will be using it! so far!
Works for all of the gopros
I have a 2008 Tundra double cab and it fits perfect to the dash. You WILL need the bracket from your old radio though to secure it.
Yes it does. This works with my iPad and iPhone charging them simultaneously so it will do the same with any tablet. And it takes for ever to drain it too.
They have the same power output. Just labeled one and two.
Not a good quality 0.3
Same input in so it should work, check internet for wiring diagrams
Yes, you can
Yes, it does work well in a car. I am very happy with the Bose Soundlink Mini and continue to use it daily. I'll bet I've sold at least five of them after friends family and co workers see mine.
Standard earphone jack. the cable plugs into the speaker from an ipad/ipod android phone laptop etc
You don't. If you hold the phone you can hold the battery pack part on the back. When listening w phone at my desk there is no issue. If I am mobile I have resorted to using a rubber band so I can pull it in out of pockets backpack etc. It has a no slip texture but is still awkward
It's all one piece, because of the noise-cancelling module in the cord. It looks like if they break, you're sending them in; or if out of warranty, buying an entirely new pair. Cheers.
They go into the ear canal a little but come with 3 different size tips for differing ear sizes and they are soft flexible silicone
Yes but not the docking station
I've tested this on iPhone. It works on Samsung Galaxy S II as well.
No it doesn't.
It does come with pre installed windows. Does not come with window CD.
It can be operated that way, but there are provisions for adding more fans (quiet ones), I operate mine pretty much 24/7 and have had no problems with cover on and one fan added, although ambient temp at computer location is around 72 degrees F
I do not know. It works great with the vsb 402 sound bar.
No you do not.
It doesn't work with a Mac but it should work with any windows program
I used in a cold environment. The batteries were changed every two days. We did not try to go longer, so I do not know if batteries would last for four days. I am sorry.
Currently we do not. As Dell Latitude 10.1 is 10.8" wide, even our universal is just a bit narrower at 10.75"
Yes but please do not not buy it because the keys stick. I have thrown mine away and bought an actual asus keyboard. Read other reviews about the stickiness
It is very shallow. This review states that it feels like the SD card will actually fall out. http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/20/3655532/acer-aspire-s7-and-dell-xps-12-review
nope, it uses an Intel USB 3.0 controller - driver is on Intel website
Mine did. Everything was in a factory box. ANd it works great! Love it.
This adapter is for the mSATA to 1.8in. SATA usually found in early gen ultrabooks like the Thinkpad X301. I think iPod classic video has a ZIF interface, you may want to ask the reviewers on this adapter instead - "Micro SATA Cables - mSATA SSD to 40 Pin ZIF Adapter Card" .
Yes you can. I plugged the ipad to the camera connector and then put in the SD card. The ipad will recognize the SD card. Just go to the Photos icon to open the interface screen. On the bottom of the "Photo" screen just select the "import" button to view the photos on the SD card. Hope this helps.
According to this (http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/PUSA/Home/AV-Receivers/Pioneer+Receivers/SC-1323-K), it already does.
In reference to the tuner it is pretty simple, if HDMI 2 is selected it should work. I am assuming that the video combination on HDMI 1 is working, move them to HDMI 2 and see if it appears to work. If so. then the devices connected on HDMI 2 are not pairing up for some reason. If it continues not to work, then HDMI 2 may not be functioning on the Tuner. I would then send it back for repair.
yes it fits perfect
It is more medium... It looks exactly like the picture. I got it for my son. It's not a light "girly" shade of blue. Also, the case is awesome. It snaps on easily and really protects the computer without being bulky.
I don't think so but we had a silver chrome book
Yes. That is what it is made for. I have this case, I love it.
Because it is a "newer" model and the SC-71. Basically the same thing without the 12v trigger so if you don't need that then save the money and get the 1223. I did on lightning deal over the Holiday and for most part it is nice clean amp. Volume is "touchy" vs. the Onkyo I replaced with it but Onkyo was going bad after 6 years and couldn't beat the lightning deal I got on 1223.
Yes but this should handle all of your speakers. Are you setting up more than 7?
It's extremely light. Almost like a skin but just hard. It doesn't add much bulk at all
Yes, works very well.
Yes, all Samsung series 3 chrome books.
No.
No.. It is just cover for iPad.. Nothing else will fit.
Yes
1.3M pixel
No this unit doesn't have motion detection and only takes a photo when someone presses the doorbell button or you press a button from inside. I can't recommend it and suggest you find another supplier. This unit has marginal quality, mine had dead pixels, and batteries die too frequently.
Mine will not burn anythng, will not work. Save your money, buy another product. Larry Ellis
Yes, you don't need to plug it into a wall outlet, once you have a powered usb 3.0 port, it will work.
When you hold it down,you should hear the voice in the headset say"power off" then you can take your finger off.
Luckily I had my old Bluetooth charger to use for it. Pretty much any electronic that has a usb port should be able to charge it, Not 100% sure.
I don't know... I have a Dodge Journey but it fit that just fine when I purchased it.
Sure can. You can use the auxiliary input on the top of the speaker tower, the aux. input is a standard 1/8th headphone jack. So all you would need to do is just get an RCA to 1/8th headphone jack converter and you're all set. You can pick those up at your local Radioshack or Best Buy, they're incredibly common
there are hundreds games inside,you can also download so many free games in our web...btw,its not a sony brand
Yes it is a touch screen.
Don't know broke about two days after we got it
I was afraid I would need one but I didn't. Just turn it on.
Yes
It's like it came from an angel lol
The camera ships with a 20-50mm kit lens. There are another dozen or so lenses available from Samsung directly, with more available from third parties.. I bought an adapter for mine, so that I can also use my old Nikon lenses on it.
Yes, it is working with iphone5
Battery charger is included but not the case.
I do not believe they did but, to me that is no big deal because each battery is packaged separately and you just put the battery back in the individual box. Definitely worth the price you pay.
There is no backlighting.
Yes my iPad is 16.gb
Not really
It has a 1 amp port and a 2 amp port, I charge my iPhone and iPad at the same time but you can't charge two iPads. Look at the output rating on your plugs.
Yes, but it will only work if you have a 1.21 gigawatt power supply.
No, and does not have HDMI connection.
It should be compatible with any LGA 1155 motherboard, including those made by Intel
Camera body was included
If it is the same one I bought it comes with a charger and an extra battery. ..... If I was to do it again I would buy lenses, body battery, battery charger and cards. Everything else at a local shop.
i have never had an issue with battery life.
Thanks for your question. Yes, this will handle playlists. This is an amazing sounding player. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud A&K dealer.
Yes! The Velcro is adjustable to get it around the headrest.
yes, it wraps around the entire headpiece using a velcro strap.
I don't know what it is, but on screen movement seem typical, with good accuracy. Microsoft has a driver for it Very comfortable mouse, nice button placement for back, and windows key.
To be honest I truly don't know however I've never had a manufacturer not support me on items purchased on Amazon. More importantly for me was the setup was so easy I didn't need to contact them. I just followed the directions and I've had no issues at all.
Check he website. I think I saw some programs that you could download. But the drive works like any other so you can just use your OS backup software which works like a charm. It's really plug and play, no software needed.
The warranty according to BuffaloTech is 1 year. I have never had to use it. We have had other buffalo products and only used the warranty once. That was no problem. So far so good.
It also snaps on and acts like a hard case cover when you are not using it. Fantastic design.
That is the operating system (4.4.4). Mine is 4.2.2. This is for a Lenovo s6000 tablet. Check with the maker of yours
I would think so if it were smaller than an ipad.
If your motherboard supports 240-Pin DDR3 RAM, then this memory sticks should work.
You should ask if the other hardware components, like mother board and processor, will be compatible with the memory. And then, if BIOS and processor supports these OS types. Maybe is better start by the second question.
small ssd is used for intel rapaid start technology&#65292;no for installing windows system and startup drive.it's too small.if you want do like that you should change a bigger one.now, you can install games in that ssd,it's fast.
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 765M with 2GB GDDR5
Brand New , factory sealed still. Warranty from Dell .
No bluray
Yes, it is.
I think the best answer will call Dell customer services. Before I bought one laptop from the Korea. it is include of the international warranty, but I hope you can make sure do that. Good luck!!
No. It's really hard to upgrade a GPU in a laptop. Even if you could; a more powerful GPU means you would need a new power supply as well.
Great
Well, the volume gets pretty loud, and the speakers are pretty clear. A person with no hearing impairment can hear sound better as well as more of the details you don't hear with standard speakers. Without knowing the degree of impairment, however, I can't give you a definitive answer.
Yes, according to brother who uses it. (I've never tried it). The usb connection will go to the PS4, and the earpiece jack to the CONTROLLER. You will need a USB extension cord to be able to do this. Or buy Turtle Beach PX4 (wireless). It's recommended for PS4. Hope that helps!
Most likely, I wouldn't recommend purchasing it though. Mine fell apart within the first few uses.
Not at all. The pack unraveled and fell apart within a week after buying it. I live in Alaska, and I was hoping that it would hold up better.
Yes, fits the rebel 3 nicely.
Do you have the current BIOS and have you scanned for a virus. If you have done these two then I would do a system restore to a point before your issues started. Go to the forums at Tomshardware and search for similar problems. You can post your issue but will need to give more details such as OS, CPU, Power supply, and did anything change (software update or hardware upgrade) prior to this issue.
No
Yes
My experiance light rain ithas been ok. I won't purposely let it get soaked.
They do work on the. Family radio frequencies so yes you can do that
mine has printed on it XM55 VidPro. by the way- i used it in a conference room and the audio was AMAZING. highly recommend...
Yes
Yes
Yes
Nope! Best keyboard cover I've ever had!
Water and dish soap works fine for when you get something on the cover.
No. You can use Office 365, or Google Drive.
I have Crucial M500 120gb SSD and it works fine with it.
The difference will be in the transfer speed. I don't know what the specs are for your droid. It's also supposed to fair well under extreme temperatures in contrast to lesser quality storage media. You may not need the speed for your Droid. I use it to capture high quality video so the recording rate is essential to keep it from freezing on me during the capture. If all you want it for is docs and pics and usual video you may not need to pay the extra cash for the plus.
Storage media for your camera - SD Memory Card, SDHC Memory Card, SDXC Memory Card. That's mean you can use it.
Im sorry. I don't own the camera, so I can't be of any help there.
Absolutely not. The PSVita uses a proprietary form factor, so this card won't fit or work.
There's automatic bypass relays out there that are needed for this model and they are cheap. Got mine from a local stereo shop, as for the camera not sure how it sends its feed and if it will work . Pretty sure the backup camera is triggered by the stereo, so can't answer how one will work on the av in.
The space is 4 1/4" x 7''. Can't get the depth.but it a standard double din deck.that will fit in a double din space.
Indeed it does, to perfection.
No. This particular one is for the full size IPAD.
No. The hard plastic bottom and top parts snap into each other. The hard bottom piece won't stay on without the top. And the plastic film is connected to the top plastic piece. I hope I answered your question.
Strictly based on my experience and the seller I went through, it did shop with a matte screen. Definitely buy a mouse though... Trackpad is junk.
I don't see any reason why it wouldn't
Because of the constant single distortion I would not use them. I have bought a mono wireless base extender instead which works very well for your needs. I can't say much on the subject as I did not get it from Amazon. I can say it was pretty inexpensive about $40 and much better quality. I believe the name was Daton sub transmitter, try a search engine to look for it.
Sure they could be.
They are a lighter pink than in the photo on the top and outside (metal) part of the earpieces. The inside padding of the earpieces and inside part of the headband are more of a burgundy. Pretty.
No
No. The cable does not have a remote.
yes it is a macbook pro 13,3".I bought it in 2012. this is the one with optical drive.
Whoever talked you into this because it is both a router and modem did not understand the product. It is not a modem, it is a router that works on two different bands.
I am pretty ocd about having a clean case and I had no problem making everything neat and tidy. There was a good amount of space behind the motherboard to fit cables and zip-them in place. I would recommend a psu with a modular cable pack so you only need to run the power wires that are necessary. Hope this helps.
Yes, using a mini HDMI very easy to hookup
I'm afraid that I can't help you with that answer. I, myself have been trying to get an answer. When the new tablets were first being introduced there was a keyboard/cover being marketed, but try as I may, I have not been able to run it down, not even from Toshiba Direct.
Yes it will work
Yes, it is included.
Thanks for your inquiry. I am so sorry that it can not be adjusted remotely from inside or outside the house using a pc, iphone or ipad.
No there is none. Machine works but is flakey and is cheaply built
Hello there, I have m2v files that it plays, so I have to assume it can play m4v. There are very few files that this media player cannot play. RealMedia may be the only exception, although I have played RMVB files on it. It does support resume. I have paused it on a video file and I was able to come back to it and pick up where it left off. This is all I know, I hope it was helpful. Take care.
Has hdmi, i have my conected to LG plasma via hdmi, plays file from both usb ports (hdd or flashdrive), plays from upnp/DNLA server (I tested with plex server) and from shared folder in Windows but this need some accouts configuration in Windows 7
yes!!! that's what the K stands for.
Hi, I have used this device to stream MP4 and M4V to my iPad, iPhone etc. in the interface on your computer you are able to play files from this device by streaming or just plugging it in by USB. I did have DRM issues when trying to play a video purchased outside of iTunes in another player other than iTunes, however. Those I could only get to play by transferring through the iTunes interface.
Microsoft Office is always a separate purchase. Thanks
JVC, Kenwood sony double din radios all will fit in here
Yes - I have that phone and use the DockBoss every day.
Yes it can, it has VESA holes at the back with 100 x 100 mm. Thanks, PCrush
It comes with almost every cable you can connect to the thing VGA, DVI, DP, USB 3.0.
No. Only Wahoo's BlueHR heart rate monitor will work with this watch. TomTom does not support ANT+ accessories, only Bluetooth. Fortunately, there are a lot of options appearing on the market these days as the industry moves towards Bluetooth.
Yes, you can download it on csv, kml, etc.. When you connect your watch to your laptop the app ask you where do you want to download it.
Hello Meloniey If you can swim with it then mud cannot be a problem. I am using it for running and biking on gravel and paved roads and it works well. Arne
I couldn't see why not (not a problem for cellphones). But, the only ones who could really answer this is Tom Tom. I would send them an email.
You will first need to open up the camera's glass dome; inside the dome you'll find 2 chrome knobs located right underneath the camera lens. You'll need to twist on both knobs to adjust the camera's viewing angle (40-115degrees) and viewing distance (40-120feet)
No, You take the cables out from camera and then put in to the conduit.
Yes, it plugs into the standard USB adapter that came with the tablet. I haven't tried plugging it into my PC to see if the data connection works...
3.94 ft. (1.2m)
There is an open PCI slot and an open PCI Express 2.0 slot. So as long as you don't want a graphics card in those slots; your firewire/multi-card reader should fit either a PCI or PCI Express 2.0. But it's all going to be installed in the back because the front is being used by USB/Audio ports. You might be able to jimmy those out to fit in your item but the simplest method would be to install those items in the back.
Yes it does
You will not be able to draw a continuous line because there is a small space between character plots so that letters dont run together when outputting a word, but you could do a dashed line with the small spaces between.
You will need 10 wires, and a potentiometer to make this work the way it is. http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LiquidCrystalDisplay Alternatively, you can purchase an i2c to LCD board such as this one : http://www.amazon.com/Black-Serial-Interface-Adapter-Module/dp/B00MJVLIW2/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1414588033&sr=1-1&keywords=i2c+lcd+board solder this to your LCD and read this http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/LCDI2C Then you can use only 4 wires.
Just to let u know this picture isn't what your gonna get.. this is a nicer model then what they will send you... I would buy another one if I was you.. I will never buy from this seller again.. through amazon seller HDE...they really show what your gonna get... but this seller said they would fix the picture cause I complained, but I see they haven't... what you'll get isn't even close to it, the only thing will be that it is a pink color.. sorry
Yes it will work for a 7" hp tablet
Graphics are exceptional.. Great for Gamers or Video software programs
I don't think so but then again I don't know what an ADMI port is. It does have an HDMI port.
Yes. I have been using it in a mixed environment for a few months now; I think a few of the software updated have helped the stability problems others used to have. Zero handoff and V3 are still in beta; though.
Yes, the package comes with two cameras
Yes
It did not work for my 750.
there is no software for this unit .The head band will crack and break pretty soon.It is a Chinese nock off with no support.I had a pair they did not last long.
I would think so. I bought it for someone else and I haven't heard any complaints.
yes
yes many different languages, a great tablet ,no ptoblems with it so far , my wife loves it
I can tell you. there is a Bluetooth symble. In.the Setting. But. I did. not try it. The. "builtin GPS is nothing more than Google Maps. So I. Wouldn't count on the Bluetooth being much different.
hear some low horns
Yes, it would work.
Yes.
Yes, it fit HP envy TouchSmart perfectly. If you do mind the volume/fast forward/rewind keys,you can choose this keyboard cover with ASIN:B00D8BBKAW. Thank you!
Yes, works with mine.
Yea
No
The battery lasts around 4-8 hours on full charge so you can leave it on till it dies, I don't believe it goes to sleep if inactive.
Not in my experience. The device seems to charge just fine while off or on, even while actively playing music. I have never been able to run the battery long enough to go completely dead so I don't know if that is the case with a totally dead battery.
Expresso Satellite Navigation, Inc.
I think the D7100 battery grip only holds one and you also have the battery in the body of the camera which makes it two.
Yea it comes with a regular usb cable to mini usb. The mini USb side charges the unit. You can't charge your phone on it if that's what you're asking. No 'power bank'
No
Supports flash as can do any device with Android 4.2.2
It does not, most of the PIPO tablets support external 3G, so it's listed in the specs. If you want a sim slot you're looking for the terms "built in 3G" and "WCDMA"
There is a USB transmitter but it is wireless. So, the sound comes from the USB transmitter, and it does have wireless bluetooth. You can also plug in a 3.5mm cable from your phone, ipod, mp3 player, exc.
You're really expecting leather for this price?! It's vinyl, of course, but textured to look like leather, and of good quality, in my opinion.
I dont know, because i gift it
No they don't.
Yes. Pressing the button illuminates the keys. Press it again to turn it off.
I would lean towards no, and my reasoning for that is I have a Denon receiver and I am unable to change sources i.e. SAT to DVD for the audio.
Yes I use it with one of mine
It is tucked in to the pack unless you want it. I didn't even know it was there for the first few weeks.
I bought Transit Backpack 350 AW which is good. Don't know what is Fastpack 350 AW. Recommend Lowepro website. Bhaskar Deb
no the monitors are stationary ( your question is confusing)
ASIN# B00D94XMKE belongs to Gigabyte Technology manufacturer part number GA-Z87X-UD4H which is correctly listed in the title and picture.
If you hold down ctrl and magnifying glass you can go to google
I believe it only works with android. But I returned mine because it wouldn't charge the battery.
Yes, it will work fine for the HR34, but I cannot answer about the IC31
If you are referring to the voice monitoring system where the headset plays your voice back through the speakers like on the x12, then no. This was a big disappointment, as I loved that feature on my x12's (my wife loved it more:) You can hear yourself if you talk loud enough, but that defeats the purpose. This was one huge letdown for me with this headset, as the playback feature on the x12's was perhaps the best feature of the headset.
I don't think so unless you don't mind it sticking out of the pack. You'll have to move some of the partitions in order to get it in so you'll lose some of that storage space. Right now my longer lens and camera with a shorter lens take up the whole bottom half perfectly...there is no extra room. You really can't fit one more thing in there. The top part is just enough room for my wallet, sunglasses etc.
No, it doesn't. :(
It about 22-24". It would be nice if it at least 36"
Plain black box...instruction manual indicates Law Enforcement Products Manufacturer LawMate V1.3 however, there is no address, phone, email, website or anything on it.
Yes, it works wonderfully.
We put the spec of the adapter in our description and the voltage in the title.
Because it does put out 9v. The light also takes 6 AA batteries which equals to 9V. Or did last time ichecked
No this case will not fit the Dell Venue 8 Pro. It is already a fairly tight fit with the Nexus 7 (2013).
It should without any problems. It fits my nVidia Shield tablet without any difficulty and it is bigger than the Galaxy Tab 4 7 inch. The manufacturer states that it will fit the Galaxy Tab 3 7 inch which is slighter bigger than the Tab 4 as well.
Nope. I got it for my Nexus 7 and the fit is very nice. Maybe 1/2 in. longer and 1/2 in. wider at best. I'd look for one that specifically is made for an 8 inch tablet.
did not work for me
There is space for two additional hard drives. I added one (1 TB SATA) hard drive to my system - it mounts directly below the master drive. There is space provided for a third drive, but it doesn't seem as accessible as the other two, so I won't comment on adding a third drive.
hi,dear friend, there's a manual for this camera. 1) Long press the "power" key to start, press the "power" key to save and stop recording. 2) The led is off(flashes 3 times then goes off) during recording.
Yes
Yes, we are connected to a wireless internet and a wireless printer.
have been very pleased with speed and everything about this computer..big bang for buck
I am not sure. I have never try it. But it runs Photoshop CC and AutoCAD 2013.
No the keys don't lite up
No
yes
It is the correct kit. I saw earlier reviews that mentioned missing parts. They contacted "SunFounder", who was very prompt about sending either the parts or a replacement kit. The kit in the link was sold by StreamLED, so contacting them would be your first option. You can also contact Amazon - They've got great return policies; but I'd try StreamLED first.
I had a king pad and returned it for the same problem. After I returned it someone commented that if you hold the power on key down for 30 seconds it will power back up. Good luck
Nope is very fast . I download whole bunch of different games and they pay nicely I don't have no problems with it so far . I have a Samsung note 2 and the games played just at nice and fast . the only downside is that the battery is not a really big battery but for 100 $ you can't complain !
Yes,it does. Regards, kimoutlet
We do not carry those accessory at this time for this kit. Regards, kimoutlet
Make sure that all other devices Bluetooth are off including your phone. It should connect after that
Yes, it is brand new and covered by Dell.
I haven't had that problem since I purchased it a year ago. So far so good. Sorry I couldn't be of any help.
Thanks for contacting us. Yes, it comes with google play store. Enjoy your shopping.
Yes manual and auto, but for bounce flash it doesn't zoom out to 24mm again.
Hello dear customer, the plug on the cable it is straight. And also, this is no bluetooth headphones(with no battery in), can only use the cables.
Don't know what a Jynxbox is, but if it's android, it should work.
No
No, this Inno3D video card ,as description say: 1 x VGA, 1x HDMI and 1x DVI only. Copystars Support Team
I can't answer as to what your computer supports, but the installation is simple. Take out the old card, put in the new one, install the drivers.
The docking station works great. Laptop open or closed.
The meter is compatible with USB 3.0, USB 2.0, and USB 1.1 ports and devices.
That is why I bought the wireless trigger kit "YONGNUO YN-622C-TX E-TTL Wireless Flash Controller for Canon" - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LP30OXE/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1
Make sure the diffuser is up inside the flash, not down and over the flash :)
No you have to buy an adapter such as the http://www.amazon.com/Lightning-30pin-Charning-Adapter-Iphone/dp/B00DU6UD8A/ref=pd_bxgy_e_img_z. Cost is $1.20.
No it does not.

Yes
No
It comes with the screws, very easy. Look at the pictures.
No the H820e is a USB only headset so it wont work with you Cisco IP 7941. If you have a Cisco softphone client on your computer it would work with that.
No
No. But it comes in a nice, hinged cardboard box.
Yes, it has on the left hand side of the computer.
Yes, but I'm not sure if the time capsule software works with PC's yet. The time capsule will show up as a physical drive from your PC under the network tab. There are many other programs such as integro backup pro that will let you do this though.
Yes. Time Machine can automatically back up to this, and you can use the drive as a regular network share and store files on it that you no longer want on your mac. It works well with OSX, works horribly with Windows.
Well rephrase that. You can get an Internet connection to you Apple TV from you airport time capsule. That supports the streaming very well .
Any CFL that meets manuf. recommendation
I use mine for newborns and use one with only 2 lights switch on. The actual color of the bulb is to cool for me but that's just a matter of switching them. Hope that helps !!!
Yes there is one .
Not that I can see. It seems constant. It also has no noticeable focus breathing.
Its Only a USA warranty.
Depends if you plan on ever switching to full frame. I find 17-18mm the widest I normally go since I shoot people and too wide isn't flattering. If you are shooting landscapes then any of these will do since you want to stop down the aperture anyway. I love the 18-35mm sigma, I get the isolation from the blur that I need to create my artistic images. I never take it off anymore.
you can see the whole image, but it does blow it up pretty big almost like you are sitting a little too close to a TV. You can see it all but you might have to look around a little. I like it for the stuff that I am using it for, but some people like the 2.5X. If you have never used one, I am not sure it will matter. I use a 2.5X at work, but a 3X at home.
yes
All Pentax K-Mount lenses, Though you would need Pentax K AF for auto-focus capability.
Yes the K-500 comes with advanced WiFi capabilities via its Eye-Fi SD card compatibility. An Eye-Fi SD card must be purchased separately, but allows for WI-FI upload of both pictures and video.
DA L 18-55mm WR f3.5-5.6 and 50-200mm WR Lenses. Says these are included, and they have manual modes but are autofocus lenses.
It depends on the focal length. At 18mm, you get from F3.5 to 22. At 55mm, you get F5.6 to 40.
Yes. Amazon Instant, Netflix, Redbox Instant and VUDU - But not Hulu Plus. That was the big downside for me.
1080p, no issues if you have enough bandwidth in your home network.
The K50, on a par with other 16MP digitals, will produce good quality pictures. The problem, with any digital camera, is that extreme enlargements will "pixelate"; I believe the K50 will produce what you are looking for in a 16MP camera.....JimMc
It's been almost a year since I ordered but I know that the box at least included: the camera, the body cap, a strap, instruction manual, the battery charger and one battery pack. The Wasabi brand extra battery packs and charger are worth considering, as they are cheap and work well. I think the usb cable was included but am not 100% certain. And I purchased the kit lens seperately.
The charger that came with my camera is 110 volt only
yes
Not with the default software. But the ipin-supplied software does have some features for remote control of Powerpoint or Keynote.
First you have to redeem it on Nvidia's website, than they will give you another code which you will use to redeem it instructions are included on that webpage. the webpage where you redeem the nvidia code is:http://www.geforce.com/games-applications/pc-games/borderlands-the-presequel/bundle/redeem-code
Isnt that just the same product but rebranded? I thought they changed the name to tab 7 since they're starting to have other ativ tablets, but i think it's really just the same.
You may find this link useful for addressing your question: http://forums.comcast.com/t5/XfinityTV-and-Equipment/Remote-codes-for-Samsung-Soundbar/td-p/1809134
No
Yes.
It's fit very snug and the cover puts the iPad mini to sleep. The wait for the cover does take a really long time.
It is blue, but very tiny and unobtrusive (you do not notice it unless you look for it). Everything about this monitor is great, other than not being 2560.
Make sure you let the device charge. Also, try updating the app and make sure kindle is connected to the flashdrive wifi. It might not be able to connect to 2 wifi sources at the same time.
may be something to do with the plug - mine broke off after plugging into my tablet -
No it only works with sony branded tvs
for this price, yes, but if you have a bit more many, you could find better
You would need to put some type of board to strengthen the ceiling tile.
I do not know about the Epson but the hardware that comes with it is very versatile. There are several combinations and configurations with the hardware.
it controls my vizio volumn and power on and off. we have a problem though where the tv input button does not want to work on our vizio tv so we have to use the remote for the tv to change input source like video 1 and 2 to go from tv to dvd or wii , etc.
Night vision appears to be very good under most conditions - as long as there is SOME street lighting. But on a very dark road the "range" is quite short to the rear. Front is good due to headlights.
Basic camera, small hand strap, battery, lens is fixed, you must buy shoulder strap which is essential.
Leica BP-DC8
I have not used that function. IQ is just superb on this camera. Great glass.
Hello, no, the Vario X has an integral 28-70mm equivalent lens, Leica makes many bodies allowing the use of other lenses, but that is not the design principle of the Vario X. Thanks.
Probably not. I bought it for a Macbook Pro and it protrudes a good quarter inch from it.
Just need insert it in to the SD reader in Mac then you will find a new disk in Finder. No need to format it, it's Mac format.
It should be able to. Unlike most brands which make these for specific computers, this one is simply a short SD card (can't be used in a camera though).
No soldering involved with this item, the IC chip is already soldered to the connector.
No, unfortunately it does not..Just the LCD screen which makes it hard to see in bright light. I do have the Canon sx30IS that has the viewfinder, + reticulating LCD screen. Only problem is it is a lot heavier than this xs500is.
This camera comes with a US adapter and a European adapter is included as well.
I don't know the actual output, but we have two of these and no one has had any problem charging anything with them. They are used daily for such things as phones, e-cig batteries and a Kindle reader. Hope this helps.
No, all USB ports on computers are essentially the same except for the power output. USB 2.0 ports output .5 Amps (500mA) while USB 3.0 ports output .9 Amps (900mA). USB ports that are on AC adapters and phone chargers are capable of outputting much more power.
Yeah, try googling your item number and "ONLINE MANUAL" with it. Results were good.
The NAZA flight controller module, the GPS module, the PMU, the LED unit, all required mounting hardware, 3-wire connectors, and the USB cable.
Yes, there is a mouse function that works with Android, Windows 7+, and Mac OS, just not iOS.
This can be used outdoors but you need to make sure the O-ring/ Gasket is Sealed/Seated properly. After it is seated, this is an IP66 camera rated for outdoors which is water resistant, not fully water proof. Thanks!
There are 2 hoes on bottom to mount. I have mine on the floor but I just checked and the holes are there.
It's a dim blue LED. It shines upwards, not sideways. I doubt it's a problem for you.
Just like the picture. It is designed to go inside a computer (laptop).
No it does not. But can be purchased very inexpensively.
Hello Phan, The Macbook Air 2009 model is not user upgradeable and uses an Apple proprietary connection for it's drive. The KC380 microSATA SSD is not compatible with the Macbook Air. For further questions or concerns, please call us at 1-800-435-0640 (USA and Canada only) M - F 6am - 6pm PT and I or another available Technician will assist you. Thank you for considering Kingston as your upgrade partner.
Yes you can.
Yes
I have used this with the Canon 7D with Max sync of 1/250s but still had a thin sliver of blackness so I dropped the speed down to 1/200s. So from my experience with it.... 1/200s. I don't think this trigger supports HSS mode. version 2 of this trigger should support sync speed up to 1/320s.
no, it doesn't come with any carry case. and first of all Iwouldn't recommend these headphones for carrying. their intended use is at home. they're too big and too fragile for carrying around. Adam, in-ear.com
Yes to both. Great receiver!
Yes
9mm
Depends what kind of tablet. You need to download an app like dslr pro that allows you view the photos first. I bought this to use for a kindle, but I cannot convert my kindle to an android device. Google viewing photos on tablet and there are numerous articles on the topic.
16GB in tow slots....
It's a 1 year full warranty, but I purchased a 3 year warranty from a company that Amazon offered at my checkout and it had really good reviews. I've already had to send my Asus back due to a black screen, but since that occurred within the first 30 days of purchase, it was handled by the seller. I recommend buying a separate warranty. Just make sure that the warranty company that you buy from has 4+ stars.
Not the one I purchased, but it works great.
I returned this item. It's total CRAP!!!
It does have wifi. I was able to use the preloaded Skype app with no problems when using it within the same house.
Their is only one memory slot on the laptop, and the motherboard max is 12 GB of ram. So, theoretically yes you can, however i am not aware of any 12 GB single module ram sticks. I use this laptop daily, and the 8 GB that is in it works very well even with graphic intensive applications as well as games.
Yeah
Yes you can. I put a 500gb sad in mine...it works great.
It has blu-ray player
It has no DVD drive, online download is from acer website, support
You may have missing function using XP. This laptop is made for windows 7/8. I would not recommend it.
Yes.
Probably not since tthe car's "USB outlt" is probably only connected as a power source, not as a "real USB port" capable of connecting an audio source.
Somewhere between 8-10 ounces.
Sorry, this headset never worked for me. I don't believe it will work with a cordless phone.
On the soundbar itself there are 2 one for HDMI in and one HDMI out.
it clearly shows on the picture that it is female - which is standard in 95% of LCDs for computers, Freebie VGA cords are typically male.
Yes
Yes. But don't think that this HD Clear Vision antenna is going to give you access to the internet, that a whole other ball game. this antenna picks up over the air broadcasts both in standard and HD. to access the internet you must be physically connected, meaning via cable, DSL or WIFI. the antenna does not pick up WIFI for internet.
Yes, Second person can listen to TV in normal TV speakers with his desired volume. He can mute or unmute which will not impact this head phones. The volume control on this headphone work independently from the tv volume.
I've installed it.I used the esxi cuatomized by hp. Think it's not officially supported but works ok. No hardware passthrough unless you change the cpu though. Hope this helps. Pls correct me if i'm wrong.
The server does not have any OS installed so you can install any OS you want including Debian, CentOS, FreeBSD, Windows Server and etc. Remember the server does not include ANY drives so you have to supply them yourself.
We used our light with our cameras and video recording cameras. If your camera can detect ir light most likely it will work but we don't have that type of camera so we don't know for sure but your camera specs should tell you. Thanks.

they fit my note 2. hope this helps
Yes
It connects via the miniUSB connector at the bottom.
no
I don't know about Cables to Go but my Sabrent's both work excellent. I use them for the deck, hot tub, garage and they sound great. I used to always plug them in but then just started using them on battery. They have been going strong for countless hours. I use them on average of 2-3 hours per week and have not put batteries in for over a year.
Yes it works great for that. As long as you have a USB port for power, you plug the aux cable into the back of this.
Personally I have not tried a but hooking it in any power source it would sound exactly the same in my book.
I can tell you that it fits my Macbook Air 13in perfectly. You can compare the dimensions of each laptop...
It doesn't.
I suppose that normal mice are more suitable for graphic work, for example moving pointer with very small distance. This rollermouse is perfect for Web surfing and document editing.
Not my thumb. How big is your thumb?? I think the newer version will solve that problem but it costs alot more.
It does not. It is a bit too narrow.
Through the OTG cables provided, but the brackets is a bit too big to hold the Dell Venue 8.
Yes. It depends where you are ordering from but mine came in the original box.
I recently purchased this item and it came without a screen protector
Yes, it is
Normal working applications, about 4 hours. If you run a lot of wireless - and compute intensive applications like high resolution games, then more like 3 hours.
It should fit with no problems. Although the base shown in the picture will fit Celestron's 8" through 14" SCTs, I'm not totally sure about 6" or smaller. But it does come packaged with a smaller base for smaller scopes so you should be covered.
I use it with nook hd which is the same size and it is amazing
I don't know, you might want to communicate with the seller and ask them if it will fit your truck.
Yes
No. Its only a soft plastic that protects from scratches. I would still recommend though. Just have to watch the kids with the tablet

We ship by ground it usually takes 4-5 biz days, im not sure how many days will be Prime shipping. Let us know if you need more help.

The web login usually is set on the main/central router side, so if you create a subnet under the main network, it should still take you to the login page after you open your web browser.
You could use amplified speakers as long as you get the right cord. To work in your truck you are going to need a vehicle antenna. The home antenna that comes with won't work well inside your truck.
Yes you can use this with a business or personal account
Hi, yes it has four 10Base-T/100Base-TX/1000Base-T - RJ-45 ports. Thanks, PCrush

I'm sorry, I don't know.
What is your question?
It comes with a case to store the headphones and two cords that are about two feet long. One cord has volume, pause and play buttons that work for ipods and iphones
Yes will support both. you can use the Bluetooth or direct connect with auxiliary cord. Sound Is Decent For Small rooms. Overall fairly good.
yes
Normal AAA batteries
as long as 12V output ,no problem at all .
Yes you can show the pictures without the date and time. It is in the settings to change this feature
Yes it should. It comes with adapters for the DIN style and the audio style connectors. I used it with Clearview until I moved on to Aerosimrc which has it's own dongle on but the HK 6 channel radio and a FlySky 9x with OpenTx.
Hi, yes the RK3188.
I don't believe so my was fully loaded but did not have satellite radio if I Rember right but my Kenwood I have does not either and if u buy the box for the keen wood u have to pay for it
you are right, it doesn't, need to to switch on one time
There is a technical manual available as a PDF (search "Dell XPS 8700 Desktop Manual" and you will find it). It is called an "Owner's Manual," but contains no info on using the computer's features, just on working inside it, what is where, how to remove components, etc. I know of no more "general" owner's manual.
Yes This desktop comes with 32gb Ram
Yes, via the Mac's Bluetooth feature. Good sound for such a little speaker; used in a 12x15 LR, with 3 other couples present, on the coffee table and it did fine.
I couldn't make it work. First unit works well, second unit bumps the first offline when it connected.
We have used this lens with a D90 and it works great!
I'm not sure what publication you are looking at. Yes. That's what it's printed on the box.
Yes, this will work for all Nikon DSLR cameras, except full frame units (D700, D800, D3x...)
do not need a pencil but occasionally use it, if you have gps
it does not use sim
It does not
Yes
It is very light, less than a 1/2 pound
This is a great well made attractive bag, that is approx.8.5"WideX5"deepX8.5"tall, that has nice storage in the pockets and comes with a rain cover. It may be a bit small for all that you want to carry, it will carry your camera, flash and battery just fine but with the kindle it may be a tight fit.
Yep, you'll be fine!
Yes
You can configure this without your original remote.
I am using it with my Vizio TV and apple tv and works great. I would suspect you can control your TV and ROKU but it doesn't look to control 3 devices so I would doubt it would control a receiver. Good luck.
Yes, you should have no issues.
This is a very high performance processor so it tends to run hot. I have been installing it with a Corsair water cooling system. They are not expensive, they are easy to install and are very reliable.
No, you will not, there are special motherboard for this processor, like GA-990FXA, due to the power consumption of this processor.
Not sure. Make sure that the power wire from the computer case is plugged into the motherboard. Make sure the main power and cpu power are plugged in as well. Then switch the power supply to on and press the on button on your computer case. Good luck
Yeah I play the new SimCity on max and most on high if not medium. You should be fine
Mines works great to T-Mobile 3g
I am not check till
I believe the minimum wattage as stated by manufacturer is 500. But, yes, 600 watts should work for you. I'm currently using the card with a 600 watt PSU with no problems.
Yes. It supports up to 4 monitors. But you have to use 2 DVI, 1 HDMI, and 1 Display Port. If you have 3 monitors with only DVI, one of them will need an adapter.
I didn't try it with samsung mega, but I guess it will work cuz, I tried it with three samsung devices s4, s5, and galaxy tab bro 8.0 and it works fine.
thats a different plug
Works well for me. Try sliding a bit at a time. Sam
I Have Mac osx leopard and whatever my daughter does to keep it updated. The mouse does every thing I want it to and the side buttons seem to work fine. One changes the size of your screen and I don't use them anyway. I really like the mouse. I'm just not that computer savvy so this might not help.
There must be something wrong with your unit. Mine has never ever gone to sleep, not even a nap.
It's not that load at all. Pretty typical of most mice I've used. It's a fairly small and light mouse. I use it for CAD and its very precise. I may buy a 2nd one.
The instructions were included in the package..
No it does not
about 4 inches
Nothing fancy at the top. Just a plastic cap
Yes. There are two USB 3.0 ports on the top. There are also a bunch of additional USB 2 ports.
Is fan cooling because It's graphics card don't produce too much heat
SuperMulti DVD Burner
Yes. Both Protectors are glass, and fit like they were custom made.
Yes there are two protectors, both glass and both very easy to install.
This protector will not fit Nikon DF camera. For the screen protector to fit Nikon DF camera , please see link: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JVZ8QTM
It may seem generic, but it comes from a company in China called DVC.
Yes
DVD read/write
No my minix 8h
Windows 8, yes. Touch screen, no.
It is very well made , and seems to me very sturdy and safe for a tablet, but it isn't padded.
To whom it may benefit. One needs a RG59U coaxial cable for hook up. You can get a antenna pole at Radio Shack and guy wire for tie downs. At Radio Shack get a in line ground block for a grounding pipe-copper stake. Remember, the higher the antenna obviously more stations you'll get. Yours Truly, Gary
It has an amplifier attachment that is removable.
yes, you can run the tablet and it will charge if plugged into the DC power, OR the USB cable. I often use the USB for charging, it works with tablet on of off. If you load the music player, and set the volume, then do a quick press of the power switch it goes into hibernation, but leaves the music playing. Photo slideshow is rather UN fantastic, maybe there is an app that does a full screen slideshow, but the viewer installed rather sucks. :-)
yes, not for newbie, but yes.

I must have worded it wrong. Its the contrast. You have to hold it at the right angle to see the screen just right. Other than that minor thing I love it
My daughter is on her tablet all weekend.. battery life is at least 12 hours..
Yes it does but good luck getting it to run smooth when trying to listen via bluetooth ie.. speaker.. it lags the tablet BAD..out of two of these I now have one since one went bad and other screen cracked had to piece them to make one.
It does, and it looks to be a standard 3/8" bolt.
It looks exactly the same except for the fancy colors. Looking at the basic specs: Both hold the same weight. Tripol weight: practically the same; Packed dims: practically the same; Extended dims: practically the same. It works for me. Dont use it much, but it makes me feel good that I saved a bunch!
Yes it will
Pen camera battery lasts for about 45 minutes of full HD recording.
45 minutes
That is an Amazon secret. All over Amazon you will find different colors of the same thing at different prices. This happens for things sold by Amazon direct as well as third-party sellers. I guess coolness and popularity costs more. Pretty annoying, if you as me! Not nearly as annoying as prices that change from day today.
Ohh the fans are meant for two different types of computers. The reference fan is made for computers who have limited space to cool within the computer, a small tower. What it does is basically blow the air out in through the vents where you plug in your dvi, VGA, and hdmi. On the other hand, the dual fans are meant for cases that have room around the graphics card to breathe. The dual fans also keep the graphics card much cooler. If you have a small case get this reference blower. I hope this helps.
I'm not sure what you mean when you say "reference" but if anything helps I can say yes you can put a waterblock on this GPU. I'm pretty sure frozencpu and EKWB makes them/sells them for this card and many others. I hope this helps http://www.frozencpu.com/products/21471/ex-blc-1550/HEATKILLER_GPU-X_GTX_760_Reference_Design_Full_Coverage_Water_Block_15540.html?tl=g30c311s2069#blank http://www.performance-pcs.com/catalog/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=59_971_240_578&products_id=39178
You shouldn't have to upgrade your motherboard as long as you have one PCI-E (PCI express) slot available.this is a pretty big card so I also recommend checking to make sure it will fit in your case but that has nothing to do with the question,just another precaution.
ACX is more about noise then anything else. The use of it is to keep the card cool while quiet. ACX and Non-ACX have the same cooling capacity and abilities.
I actually had a GT 9500 Nvidia and a 460GTX graphic cards. I can't even compare the GTX 760 to any of my previous cards except for the 460GTX, but with certain games. The 560ti is good, but for a couple more dollars and quality, i would go with something in the 700 series or higher. If you're into 3D rendering programs like Maya, Lightwave, 3D Maz and do not have a workstation computer, i would go with this card.
It is 256 bit. It says 256 bit for me, I'm not sure where you're seeing 384. Regardless, the card is 256.
Accessories that are extra for the G-Star edition are the carrycase, extra neck strap, and wrist strap. The image shown by Amazon is not the G-Star edition, but they are aware of it and will replace it with the correct image.
Hello, HP's specification does not show how long it would last. It only has this: Power 65W AC adapter 6-cell 47WHr 2.2 Ah lithium-ion battery http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&lc=en&dlc=en&docname=c03575383 Thank you, Fatech International
it is size specific... it fits my 7" Garmin like a glove... it will not fit a 5" screen... [perhaps they make another size specific version]... I use a beanbag mount and it works just fine and I like the product and would recommend it for the 7" application...
It worked on mine.
It's shy of 5inches
All I know is I plug the single cable end into the AVR and the double end into the sub woofer and everything works just fine. Since there is no stereo information involved I would assume that the hot lead on the single end goes to both of the hot leads on the sub end and the ground of the single lead goes to both of the ground leads on the sub end making it a splitter of sorts but don't ask me why they used a double jack to begin with on the older subs.

Hi I think the best way is a new digital tv. But you can test. I think it will work. Rgds.Alexandre.
We are using this wall mount with a Sony 65" LED HDTV and it works great. Just checked and the television stays completely level with the wall mount fully extended.
This antenna will allow you to receive LOCAL TV stations (some in high definition). It will not pick up stations that are on cable TV or Satellite TV. It will not pick up Prime or Hulu Plus.
We did. My high performance gets about 30 channels in my area. My son's (in the same house) extreme antenna gets 2-3 more channels and is more solid on some of the channels that are a little shaky on mine. Although the extreme is an improvement, I personally wouldn't pay double for it (although I probably would have been willing to pay $10 more for it), but that's up to you.
The color coding system for HDTV antennas is only for outdoor antennas. Since this is an indoor antenna it does not have a color code associated with it. If you know where the transmitters are located you can use google maps distance measurement tool to calculate the distance from your location and match that to the rating for these antennas. https://support.google.com/maps/answer/1628031?hl=en
Hello, yes. Windows 8.1 is free update
You should get a 500 watt power supply or you will cook your power supply as it will operate at its PEAK for extended period of time.
All the $250 priced GTX 760's only have 2 gig of memory, the $300+ ones typically have 4 gig of memory.
Don't know, I've never purchase the TekNmotion case. I'm really happy with the AmazonBasics case though!
I think this is a bad idea in general not just for this CD case. Extreme hot and CD's don't mix with happy endings.
It can accomodate only one CD at a time.
Check this link http://www.slatedroid.com/topic/88850-rooting-rk3188-tablets/
I have no idea what model you have. I would email WolVol for help. I had trouble downloading and app and they were very helpful.
Yes most definitely, you just need to smooth out the bubbles after you place the film on Eventually they disappear. Love it protects well and the price isn't bad either.
Yes, the new tab3
yes
Refer this youtube video- http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEl9hqZRJd4
I tried many times and the best result I got on these dry protectors was to start on one edge. Left or right, and then card it down while peeling the adhesive backing off. There's actually a good videos on YouTube.
No, the cut outs are designed for the Tab3 10.1 only. The Tab3 also has their speakers in the sides, instead of the front of the device. So, this will only work on the Tab3 10.1. Sorry.
You cant add memory to the device itself. But you can use an usb flash drive for external memory.
They're linked. Changing the volume settings on the headphones will adjust the volume of the connected device.
Try this: 1. Power off the headphones 2. On the iPad Mini, go to Settings, Bluetooth 3. Power on the headphones, continue holding the button until the light blinks red and blue (pairing mode) 4. The headphones will appear under Bluetooth as PLT_BBTGO2, tap it to pair 5. Once the pairing is complete, the status will show as "Connected" I just tried this on my iPhone running IOS7 and it worked perfectly, should work the same for an iPad. Give it a try with these instructions.
Yes it does great case to have!
Can you provide more detail of what you are wanting to do with this Antenna? I used it for an external Antenna to increase my Wireless reception.
the answer is no. you replace a battery with the same size and voltage for safety reasons and fire hazards.
Connect the preamp to the power amp with RCAs or XLRs and connect your speakers to the power amp with bananas or wire
You will need the European version running on 220V and British TV standard.
Yes you can, it uses MST, which is not dependent on os, just video card/drivers.
Typically, the audio and video transfer through a single HDMI cable. However, in some cases such as video only monitors or separate A/V components, you may want to have some extra cables handy.
It has both front and rear facing camera's. However, there is no flash.
Might be a block on Mac address? try to spoof the Mac address of the laptop on the router WAN port and see if that solves the problem.
I have no problem playing my iPod through the usb. Ela
Yes you can slip paper in there even a card or something. Nothing as big as keys or anything thick, but I have put paper in the pockets. There are 6 credit card size pockets.
Can very easily fill a large room. We use it in our living room.
I don't think so. I have one, but I don't think it came with the case.
Yes
Pairing would be used with a Bluetooth device according to the owners booklet that came with my soundbar. The RCA cable's did not work for me. I had to purchase a digital optical cable. I have not had any problems and I just love the soundbar.
If the book is in MP3 format, I don'w see why not! Enjoy your swimming routine!
The image quality it is not as you would expect from TV or even a regular projector. The closer you project the image the better the resolution. My 13 year old son gives it 6/10 rating for image quality
Thats no possible with this device.
Either a digital optical or coaxial optical cable. Your TV most certainly has an output for one or both of those, which will connect your TV to soundbar. It should also work to transmit sound to the sound bar from devices plugged into your TV via HDMI(cable box, dvd, Xbox, etc). I have my unit connected with a coaxial digital cable and t sounds great and also has the bonus of not tying up and HDMI input ont TV because I use them all already.
Hi AHA-1211, Thanks for the question. This soundbar for TV has a 8" wireless subwoofer where the 3000 has a 6.5" woofer. The soundbar in the 5000 has 2 more mid range drivers for a total of 8 speakers where the 300 has a total of 6 speakers. Total wattage is more, in the 5000 to drive the bigger sub and more speakers in the soundbar. Owners say the 5000 does outperform the 3000, especially if filling a large room or more volume and bass is desired. Contact AV-Express for more information.
As far as I know, there is no direct way to send email from the recorder. However, you can download an audio file from the recorder to your PC and then do whatever you like with the downloaded file.
Unfortunately not. It would be even more brilliant if you could!
What do you mean exactly ?
Yes! U can
i don't know. It works on my m501d but not well and it wont control any other devices. Also the keyboard function only works sometimes but if you just want to turn the TV on, change channels and volume, and use the menu key the I'd say go ahead and buy
I bought one of these remotes for my e390i-a1 that I bought at Sams club and it works great.
yes
It does not have Microsoft, but it does have another type of program that works well. I use it all the time.
Not sure about the sims 3, but you can play the android app version on it. I think it was like 6 or 7 dollars
No
Google play comes loaded Not a touch screen so limits the game apps that will work on it
yes it works fine
It did not work at all upon arrival. I wrote a review to that affect and wrote to the seller....NOTHING....I totally wasted my money and got this for my husband for his birthday...it was sooo disappointing for him...I felt really bad....maybe I just got a defective one...but you would think someone there either Amazon or the seller would have responded to my dissatisfaction with a product that does not work...sorry, I do not have good things to say....
Metra make a 2-din kit now: PN 99-3045
Depending on type and length of use, my son's stays going for days to weeks before needing charged again. I have noticed no decrease in length of life after owning it several months now. This is the best way to go in my opinion.
Yes, that is what I purchased it for and it was a *great* investment. Instead of buying batteries every 2-3 days we are re-charging! Worth every penny of the purchase price.
It is very good to pick up wi- fi signal, I bought two tabs for my kids and they can conect to internet from every place arround home
The camera does not have a regular mode. There are no options.
The one I have only has a front facing camera
Someone downloaded 8.1 for me and had no problem, but the fact remains than Windows 8 in any form sucks. I've had it for several months now and I still hate it. I've had every version of Windows since Win. 98, and this is the only one I've hated. Getting 8.1 does help some and so I'd say it's worth doing, but the OS is just in general a total mess, IMO.
It is windows 8--my father is having a very difficult time learning to use this computer because windows 8 is different from the past windows operating systems.
?
it has a max of 12gb and 1 slot according to crucials website. I believe the intergrated ram is 4gb, so an 8gb stick would max it out.
This model does not have touchscreen according to the acer.com web page.
There is a backup partition that keeps a copy of the Windows 8 disc should you ever need to reset the laptop to factory settings.
This models color has a light copper look in person.
Yes it does. I highly recommend this Model it is far Superior to any other laptop I have ever used or owned.
http://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Radeon-HD-8750M.87147.0.html here is a link that tells you about the graphic card and yes it has 2GB I can play a varity of games even some MMO as long has its not flooded with people
Yes
Not sure till I get nine but read this: In terms of system memory, our V7 review unit featured 8GB DDR3-1600 (PC3-12800) RAM. Of this total, 4 GB is soldered permanently to the system board, while the other 4 GB is a replaceable SODIMM. A grand total of 12 GB is possible if the 4 GB module is replaced with an 8 GB SODIMM.
It does not.
Don't see why not but you should probably ask acer support
Autozone you just need a relay harness they are $10.99
I used it with an Acer Iconia W3-810 and it works great.
Actually, with the latest firmware upgrade to the Pixel King receiver and the Pixel King Pro transmitter, they will work. "As of firmware version V101 there is full compatibility and control with the current King for Canon receivers. (King for Canon requires upgrade to V1040)"
I don't think these will trigger strobes. If you are using a combination of speedlites and strobes you might consider using an optical trigger on the strobes which would be triggered by the speedlites, assuming line of sight. I like these Pixel units, but switched to PocketWizards for several reasons. The PocketWizards are a much more expensive alternative, but more versatile.
I believe they had questions or problems or both and the Amped Wireless Customer service is obligated to answer all of those. I still have random signal drops and week signals needing to reset the Router with a Power off / power on cycle ever 7-10 days. This is my 2nd unit and I probably would not buy another Amped router.
It would be best to contact the manufacturer, Anker, with your make and model of computer to answer your question of compatibility.
No
As long as it's the same size as the mini 2 and you have bluetooth. It should work fine.
The keys are hard and backlit like a "mac" keyboard if you are familiar with that. If I did not know it was made by Zagg I would think it was made by Apple
Hello The keyboard works perfectly welll. The angle options, the keys, etc... If you are worried the back pf the ipad might get scratched, since it has no protection, then this is not your product. Hope this helps.
we ordered 5 cube stereo and 6 usb wall charges all at once,but, we not receive yet 6 usb wallcharges.please reply us' thank you. BN
yes
No
Yes
yes, this is made by Dell.
My laptop with a 180 watt power adaptor.
Yes
I don't remember the exact length. But I know a standard sized graphics card will not fit. It needs to be slim with a shorter bracket. I recommend the galaxy gtx 750 ti slim. It comes with a shorter bracket that fits.
I had my razor go cards standing on end for storage..and the new and older batteries both promptly died...Coincidence?
If you tell me where to look at on the battery or bike I will be able to find the info you want and tell you
Not sure, but seriously you won't need it. This thing is too loud.
Yes it is included as well as a new COA key
I don't know. I have never heard of that game. If your are downloading it it should tell you if it will work on windows 7 or if you are buying the game from a store it should tell you on the package.
I am not sure since xp is obsolete but my computer runs windows 7
No.
Yes it has all the above included.
Not really, the mount dosen't match up to the holes on the back of the sony sound bar, you will have to modify it. I drilled 2 small holes in the back of the sound bar and attached it to the Omni mount.
Pick up #10 1inch nut & bolts from the hardware store... Worked for me
yes but some need a special adapter at the dvr end
Hello - Based on the photo there is a cutout for the camera only. The protector should not affect the flash/sensor.
Yes. Happens to me every 10 seconds or so. Annoying, to say the least, and quite possibly a deal breaker. I've contacted Sharkk customer service about it - will let you know what they come back with.
We use ours installed in a box. There is no line of sight. (we can't even see it up inside the box of electronics) It works great for us like that, but we are using it from probably less than 5 ft. away.
Yes you can Bluetooth from 2 recovers at same time
Device charges off usb connection. Technically 5vdc. Unit runs while charging or on battery for most of a day
Yes it does and is great!
The one that I received is Vivitar DVR786HD.
Dear Customer, our Huion graphics tablets are all compatible with Windows 8 as we have tested the drivers since January, 2013. You may feel free to download the latest updated drivers from our official website. Thank you.
Yes, the pen is included in the original box. You don't need to buy a separate one. Thank you.
Yes this is USB 3.0 certified. It also works perfectly fine with USB 2.0 if your PC doesn't have any 3.0 ports. The indicator light on this glows blue when it's connected with USB 3.0, and it glows white when it's connected via USB 2.0.
Yes
Indeed it is USB 3.0. Very nice drive and quite fast.
I backup on demand and have used my Toshiba once since the upgrade and I had no difficulty. Fingers crossed!
yes it tilts up and down and the quality of the picture is great, we have two of these and I love them.
Yes, using the Aux. input.
Yes, but not directly. You'll need a phono preamp as well.
I think a better question would be how does the RX100M2 compare to the Panasonic LF1 upon which the Leica C is based. I do know the lens is not as fast and image back is smaller, so the RX100M2 should be better in low light for sure. The C has a built-in EVF, but not very high res. The pricey external viewfinder for the Sony has 10 times the resolution.
This is my opinion on your question. This camera is not designed to take pictures less than 18 inches from the subject so I would say it is not suitable for what you want to do. Secondly, doing what you purpose would be a very low-light situation and even if the camera would do closeup exposures there would be issues with the pictures and any movement of the subject would be blurred.
You need to buy the size that your lens is unless you use converter rings. So to know what it the best size measure your lens and buy that size or one the supports a conversion to your size.
its a 3ft long cable
these are add-on to the standard lenses so the lens to which those converters are attached will function the same as it was but shoot macro instead of normal photos
If you have this 50mm focal length f/1.8g lens: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y1AYAC/ then the correct filter thread is 58mm.
I'm not sure, but I regret buying them. They did not help at all. I need to look for ones that are powered.
Hello; No, the original ones were shorter with the same efficiency. JD
Yes it does and seems to work well!
Yes
2GB DDR3 NVIDIA GeForce GT 740M with NVIDIA Optimus technology
No it does not have mounting holes on the back. I used some 3m command strips to hold mine in place
Do Not know
16x16x23" and 30 pounds
We could definitely ship to India for you. Please give us a call at 323-730-5050. Our hours of operation is 8am-5pm Mon-Saturday. Thank you! Mike AVLGEAR
The AF is excellent in still image mode and superb in video or live view mode. About the same as a 7D in still mode since it uses the same technology. Beats anything else on the market for realtime video tracking.
Yes it will :)
In bulb mode, yes.
the one from Amazon has a USA warranty.
What is eta-p10jbegsta? Anyway, go to a store that sells the galaxy 10.1 get the name of the right charger then order it online.
yes
Yes
No, this one doesn't support that.
My scale says its about 3/4 of a pound.
It works but it charges very slow. In my opinion is better to by a regular charger.
No it won't work.
Yes, that much you can
Speaker is very good, mic is also good, I have not found the back forward buttons. Mouse responsiveness is fair, but not satisfactory. Power last about 6 hours
I got the mouse because I was able to get a great discount on it. The speaker is not bad and I don't use the forward or backward buttons. I hope this helps you. I use my mouse to mostly click on things on the page itself.
learn how to read.
Volume/Speaker control only.
If the product is Bluetooth, and you pc or laptop is Bluetooth compatible, then the dingle should work with any device requiring Bluetooth..... hope that makes sense
The screen protector does not come with the GT-190 but you can order one separately by contacting service@huiontablet.com. Hope this helps.
I have no idea, but my year old stock laptop can handle it no problem with pandora and manga studio 5 running at the same time. So it can't be too much.
We recommend the GT-190 tablet monitor. It has 5080 DPI and 2048 levels of pressure sensitivity. For $450 it is a great alternative to tablets that costs four times the price. As for software for beginners, there are free drawing programs out there, such as MyPaint, Krita, Fire Alpaca and so on. If you would like to buy a drawing program, we recommend Adobe Suites. Hope this helps.
Yes. It has a flap on the bottom for the pogo plug.
Yes usb dongle was included. just plug in in usb port on tv . was pretty simple.and works great
Hi according to LG USA it works!! Thank you for your inquiry But PLEASE read the Condition!!! SUsie AN-MR400 COMPATIBILITY The AN-MR400 is compatible with the following LG TV series. LED TVs: LA97, LA86, LA74, LA69, LA62, LN57 series Plasma TVs: PH67, PN57
when you set the different inputs for your devices it should ask you if you want to set them up via the remote control, or go through settings I believe.
Did you attach the sensor to the back of the TV that came with the magic remote?
Yes. It says so right on the box.
No you cannot, unless there is a connector with same type at both ends.
Good
Yes
Yes
This headset has "over the ear" style. They are comfortable fitting for "average" size ears or smaller. They are wearable for an extended period of time without discomfort even when wearing eye glass frames over the ear.
Yes, just plug them in with the cord that comes with it. You don't have touch controls but it still sounds just as good.
Hi any of the current cell phone chargers can work. I've been using this for a while and they work well. Hope this helps.
Yeah it will it fits mine but the problem is is that over time it will start to rip because the mac book is kind of heavy for it its not worth buying this sad to say but it is very cheap material for an expensive amount
This configuration does come with a driver for writing/reading DVDs. I recommend the purchase, it's a very nice pc.
Yes you can open it up and edit on the chromebook and then save back to the flash drive.
It can be use internationally. It can be use as a phone, but you will have to purchase a data plan. The service providers will tell you tablets cannot register as phone on their networks.
Hi: Go the Whistler website and follow the direction provided there. http://www.whistlergroup.com/updates/updates.aspx It worked for me -- good luck!
Should do the trick if the wiring plugs are the same.
No it does not have a mic. But it has sound input. For external mic.
It can be used directly to a monitor/tv/ although if you are hooking it up to a CPU you will need a video card I believe and of course software if you want to record.
In simple terms - if you request a replacement for your protective cover, they will send it to you, as long as you pay shipping and handling, it will be cheaper in the long haul, if you just buy another replacement shield.
my touch mouth is not working too
Replace? I don't know. I only know switch off the WIFI; WIDI? extra devices plug into USB port?
The laptop typically comes with Windows 8 pre-installed. So, you would need a Windows 7 installation disk.
It only arrived with a 120vac power supply.
No you can't, its just a tracing pad so you have to already have a printed picture and then use tracing paper on top of that. The drawing pad shines light through the paper and you just trace it out on the tracing paper.
This is right question. It is much more bluish than 5500K, I think it is about 7000-7500K. I hope it will help you.
Fits my apple 13.3" airbook perfectly-- not sure of Sony which I believe is thicker
it fits my macbook pro that is thicker than macbook air. So, I believe it'll fit.
Answer here...do not know.. Good luck
No. There should have been a battery
It should probably work given that your PC motherboard has a PCI-e(PCI express) slot and it's not occupied. PCI-e slots are specialized slots and smaller in size and typically come as a single slot on motherboards, the free slots you mention are probably not PCI-e slots but PCI slots.
No. Pretty obvious if you look at the pictures....
Can you answer this question
Yes
Dear. Items time of arrival in the United States is 13 to 18 days. Thank you
It does not work on mine.
It does work but if you are projecting large the qaulity is awful. I purchased so I could show slide shows when I lecture but the qaulity is just not good enough.
Yes, the flash will fire automatically when synced properly with your camera.
It's suit for 18-55mm!
the two bodies are very very similar. they are functionally the same size, but it's a risk, as I'm not 100% sure the buttons and dials are all in the same spot. I'm trying to remember (it's been a while) but I think the jump from T1i to T2i is basically a better screen, but the same size, and a slightly faster FPS. If your willing to spend this much on a dive housing, it might make more sense to sell the t1i, and buy a t2i, to be 100% sure it works well.
you mean stock keeping unit? it is black/grey color,17"notebook, i7-3630QM CPU, 12GB RAM,500 HDD,64-bit OS, windows 8 basic not pro.
remember that it was easy..... the usb cable went from my phone right to this speaker ...I returned this because of horrible sound quality....
The exact ratio for the Sony APS-C is 1.56, so the result is closer to 760mm
Completely Manual and don't even think about using without a really sturdy tripod.
Yes this will work perfectly with your current situation as long as your computer is running one of the supported Operating Systems.
my epson is vs220. is ok
No
Yes, I use the remote to place calls and answer them from my iphone. Microphone and volume controls work fine. Only thing is that the start/stop/connect button is just a tiny little bump and sometimes I miss pushing it. Could have been larger.
It is maybe a little longer but not much. Just so you know though mine stopped working correctly within a couple of weeks. They fit great but very little sound would come out of one side. I would not purchase this product.
yes it is compatible
Yes it does.
Yes, it does.
Yes. And a port for a plug in speaker.
It will not work for Minecract,,,, it's not good for anything, I bought it for my teen daughter and to play games-- what little that was compatible - she had to turn the device sideways and try to maneuver the keys
10.5" x 4.376" it's a pretty fat card. I just bought a bigger case but with the older one I kinda had to put it in at an angle to get it to fit.
I don't think so. It's either assembled in Asia, or from some place like Italy... But can't be sure
Yes
No separate receiver is reqiured. The BD 100 is a receiver and Blu-Ray combo.
I can't speak to the 70d specifically, but it works great on my Canon sl1, so still a crop sensor and digic5. I use it mostly as an astro lens and like it a lot from the couple of times I have used it.
No adapter needed. 6D takes the same lenses as my 7D, EF. Just get the EF mount lens.
I used it on the rebel T2, it might, but I suggest you call a camera store and asked them if they have that lens or called online if they do, say, I have a T3 would it fit That we do all the time to verified before I purchase
fully charged: the light will go out. Suggest that contact the seller to describe the issue in detail.
Nope
Compatible with most Canon, Nikon, Olympus, Pentax and late model Sony Alpha/NEX Digital Cameras which utilize a Hot-Shoe NOT compatible with early model Sony Alpha/NEX Digital Cameras which utilize a Multi Interface Shoe.
The Guide number is 139 ft. / 42m (ISO 200 / 50mm) It takes 4 AA batteries and there is no PC terminal.
This flash is not compatible, you will need either the DSLR300 or the DSLR400VS for your Sony A100 camera.
Thank you for contacting us. The flash is compatible with your D5000.
Its a mild wide angle. If that makes sense. Its enough to capture a wide angle without looking like an xgames fisheye.
32 gig micro sd card class 10
Yes you can. There is a USB port. I use mine with a wireless mouse that plugs into the USB port and have used a wired USB mouse as well.
I think from the pricing that the surface RT (or just plain surface) is what is for sale--not the surface 2. They are pretty much the same shape though the surface 2 is a tiny bit thinner and lighter. The specs are confusing too. The cameras listed are for the surface RT but the Surface 2 has the HD display.
It will record any sounds that you can here from inside the vehicle (You can turn the sensitivity up/down/off). The 128GB in HD gives me 2+ hours a day of recording for 3 to 4 weeks before it automatically records over the oldest.
I dont know if I have the manual but on this product I would not buy again its junk the button broke the power button it was not worth fixing it OK good luck
No dual core cpu. Can find no reference to same on line or in the (bwahahahaha) user guide that came with the device.
No..Not a adult tablet at all.
Yes
You can use any android Manual because all it talks about is basic stuff nothing indept.
Anything is removable with enough effort and the right tools, I suppose. This one is really on there, so you'd probably have to chip it off.
YES, But you have to find the same size LED light
I do not believe it is real leather.
no
The lining is a soft plastic type mesh. I like the case.
Talked to a Dell rep and they said 720p.
Yes. Very good one.
No
hi,if you purchase it from geekbuying,after you place the order,then send your choice via email for us,sorry for your inconvenience,thanks
Yes
I'm guessing no...mine was defective; I contacted the seller to exchange it and they instead gave me a refund.
Yes and iphone 4
It functions very similar to the FI8904W from Foscam except our lens has a slightly wider field of view.
The camera can be hard wired to a network via ethernet cable or connect via Wi-Fi. Power is supplied to the camera by connecting the included power supply to the power plug on the camera dongle. The third image shows where the RJ-45 ethernet, power plug, and reset button are located.
You can buy from us too, when you order you use US address on Amazon and then contact us with your currenct address in Mexico. We dispatch this tablet in express shipping.
Hey, this is PriceAngels. This tablet support 2G network by AT&T and T-mobile (data: gprs or edge), it is unlocked. For 3G network network, I am afraid it doesn't support 1900MHz, it supports just 2100MHz.
Do a Google search for "system UI/IU problem" without the quotes. That should give you lots of possible answers. It seems to be a problem encountered by many people with many different types of tablets
yes
L x W x H 27.28 x 14 x 23.37
Without any problems. Very nicely made. You would be happy with this one.
No is not..but if you want to purchase this item you need to be really careful because I bought it and that's smell was horrible and since I bought it I can't use it :'( horrible smell
The cable is about 3'.
If the kindle is blue tooth compatible..... then yes
They do offer the Flip 2. Colors are red, blue, white , and black.
It works like any other HDTV. It has a digital tuner already installed, so all you would need is an antenna (for about $10). Reception will be based on factors such as distance from the transmission source and the terrain surrounding you, but you should see a nice HD picture.
Yes, they are.
Yes
I have the same issue too. I tried to update the sound drivers to see if that would help. It didn't.
My Mother has a rebel and uses the Canon EF 50mm. I believe all Rebels will use the same specific type of lens though.
I ordered this card from Newegg.com and installed it by watching a youtube video. 1 x Intel 7260HMW IEEE 802.11AC, dual-band, 2x2 Wi-Fi plus Bluetooth 4.0 Mini PCI Express combo Adapter - 867 . It solved the problem.
No, it does not.
Maybe I'm misunderstanding your question... All laptops come with their own battery(?) This Toshiba model, like most laptops in its class, has a removal 6-cell battery and the official battery life is 5.5 hours. Real world usage will vary, but from personal experience, 50% brightness, web browsing with constant WiFi connection, I would say that's pretty accurate.
Yes
I am not familiar with the 2 year protection plan but if it follows standard procedures, your protection ends when you drop it and that is if you are paying installments. Your original logic for taking the plan was faulty or good? Review that . If good, continue. Once committed to these things I have found it better to stick with it. Sure as heck, you drop it and you will need it . funny how those things work.
I believe square trade will allow you to purchase through them within 30 days of purchase date.
no
You have 30 days from the date of your purchase to add the warranty to your device. This is for both Kindles purchased directly from Amazon, or even through an offline retailer like Radio Shack.
Nope. Have to buy warranty within 30 days of original purchase. Only available on "used" kindle if sold by Amazon as a refurbished kindle.
According to lg.com/us/tvs/lg-42ln5200-led-tv there is not an optical audio out port.
On it's own, this TV does not play Netflix. You need an external device like a PS3, Roku or Apple TV which has Netflix capabilities.
Absolutely. They make a great team. Very nice flash.
I wondered the same thing but honestly I cannot tell a difference. I have enjoyed every second of using this tv whether I am watching football or a movie. My friends are envious!
Try WiFi direct instead.
Apparently is available again. I just noticed it myself. Today's date is February 5th, 2014.
No, please refrain from using SuperCharger on 220v outlets.
Yes, it works perfectly with my galaxy tab 2 7.0.
Yes - there is no need for any other cable. Just be sure to get the preamp as close to the antenna as possible. Be sure to use a top quality coaxial cable, and keep its length under 100 ft. If you are going to use a splitter, for more than 1 TV, that can be in the house.
the Otter box is very worth it I've tried many cases out there but none come close to a Otter box from dropping your phone to accidentally getting it wet and I am rough on my phone and my Otter box has taken everything I've thrown at it to say the least. ..you will not regret it I assure you
They only made 2 for the active because it wasn't a heavily mass produced phone. I would have loved to see more color combinations but sadly otterbox only offered 2.
as far as I know, that is impossible. Depending on your case, you might have a main power switch on the back that completely cuts all power, you could use that, but otherwise, I know of no way to do so
Mine are on a Tahoe and only shows one distance i guess the closets one, i tried not to put them to far in the corner because they are sensitive and would give you readings from the objets on the side too
Yes
There has been zero latency for me, live TV, DVDs, Netflix, old video games and new ones.
Yes. It should
yes it does. it's located on the top of the camera next to the hot shoe. You can also plug in an external mic into the terminal on the side of the camera. Great camera. Takes great pictures. I'm very happy with mine.
Very useful. You can download your pics wireless to your smartphone and remote control the camera with your smartphone. You can delete pics from the camera with your phone as well. You can save and print pics wireless also. It can be a little tricky to get connected to your phone but once it's done it's a very useful feature. I was on a line at Disney viewing and deleting pics with my phone while the camera was in it's bag.
It has no S-video input. It has (2) HDMI inputs, (1) component video input, (1) composite video input, (1) VGA input and (1) antenna input. Hope this helps.
Sorry, my QFX came with a DOA dvd, so it was returned. Some times your cable/satellite remote can be programmed for the TV. Otherwise an internet search. HTH
I'm not familiar with the Yamaha. I have been using Pioneer Elite receivers for my home theater set up since I switched from separate amps and processors many years ago. Never had a problem with any of them. Some of the old units I gave to family members are still going strong.
Yes they are, I have three of these cameras.
Not sure. but it fits in my OlympusSP720UZ
It's made in Malaysia.
All it should take is a firmware update to make the receiver atmos compliant
That's the way I received mine.
The Pioneer Elite and Pioneer receivers are rock solid. I have a Pioneer receiver that's 21 or 22 years old and still works great. Though it's now in my office for music only, it still preforms great. I tried switching to an Onkyo 875 about 5 years ago, and did not care for it. Too bright. Pioneer receivers, both Elite and non Elite have a nice warm sound.
no
Nope. The power button/end sleep mode is easy to access. Just press that to turn it on or power up screen.
Yes also earphones too
I have used versions of both. There is no problem extracting a stubborn disc via software commands or a re-boot.
No, to connect a monitor you would use a 15 pin VGA cable, or a DVI cable, or an HDMI cable.
This card is for a desktop PC. It is not designed to be installed in a laptop. If you even have to ask this question you should not be attempting to upgrade your laptops video yourself. Take it to a professional. Most laptops are not able to have their video systems upgraded anyway.
it should work fine as long as your motherboard has a pci express graphics card slot.
Yes, you need to install the Logitech Manager. If you don't you will miss out on all swipe features, center taps and shortcuts. You will only have left, right click and scroll.
Yes. If you download the Setpoint software from Logitech's site (it's free), it will let you reassign the buttons however you like. There will be a diagram of your mouse on screen where you can click on those buttons to set what they do when pressed.
yes, it's called logitech setpoint
Yes. I do this often.
Yes they can, take care not let conect to wall contact energy all the time
No Jon it is some kind of plastic or acrylic. It works great, does a lot of different tasks.
dear customer, is your headunit rns510, rns315 or rcd510 with 26pin rgb port? if so, it works. but you must use vcds tool to activate its rear view function.
No monitor, no network card.
A. Customer, the Gigabit networking reference is in regards to the wired networking capabilities of the system. This system can connect to 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps or 1000 Mbps networks and devices.
All on the back. The selection buttons are in the front. The picture Amazon shows in the photo is actually two units stacked, to provide a view of both the front and the back. Ive had this for a while now. It works well and is solidly built.
it is better to type without resting your palms anyway. My wife plays the hardest piano pieces ever written and understands very well what gives tendinitis and carpool tunnel. She says your knuckles shouldn't be down, your fingers should stay in a curve while you are typing, and your wrists should also be part of that curve. When you rest your palms, your wrists curve the opposite way. She says you're not supposed to type like that.
Not sure, but the 305w supply is full size and I doubt that is will fit in a slim line case.
This Power supply unit will work for OptiPlex 320,360 & 700 series Wouldn't advise putting it in anything higher end like the 990, etc.
I bought this to replace the original psu and it was exactly the same. Plugged it right in and worked perfectly.
The CS series is vehicle specific. For instance the CS- GM1210 is for specific GM vehicles but there are other CS series for other vehicle makes.
Yes, all harnesses come with it. Some you may not use depending on your original options. Plug and play except for moving the backup camera to the Rosen unit.
No, mine didn't have any drivers or tv tuner. My system using Windows 7 had no problems recognizing the card though. I downloaded one of the free tuner packages from the Internet. Everything worked fine.
I replaced mine with tungsol 6SLGT and EL34B so those are compatable.
It depends. All the inventory we keep in Amazon warehouse is 110V, hence if you place a FBA order, you'll get an amp for 110V; However, if you need one for 220V, you can order a FBM order, and email us specifying that you need to use 220v, then we can send you a 220V amp. But if what you want is one capable for both 110V and 220V, I am sorry that we don't have an amp like that yet. Hope this answers your question!
Dear customer, thank you for your suggestion! As requested, I've uploaded the front image of the amp. As for the inside image, could you please allow me some time to communicated with the manufactry to get one. Hopefully I can post it before the coming Tuesday. Thank you!
Yes they can. butyou do have som obstruction by distnace a concrete walls, w use thm for at purposean it works well forus.
I maintain around 40 of these radios. They seem to be good for that distance outside with minimal obstruction. But once you have them in a building or a car the range is reduced. I think you would have better performance with the Baofeng BF-A5 model. It has more than twice the output power of the BF-666. I have been able to find the BF-A5 for around $30 on Amazon and Ebay.
Hi, I like to use the tuner, because you can store your prefer radio station
Marantz does not show the maker of the DAC in its specs. Eric C
Yes, it does. On the side of the camera where the lens connects to the camera, there is an AF to MF lever that allows you to auto focus or manually focus your camera. I am a newbie to this setup (the REBEL 3 with EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS lens), so that is the extent of my experience with this camera. I have taken a few pictures and they are quite nice. I refer you to your instruction manual for further details...
Nothing, same lens, same quality and you get extras to boot. I was Leary when ordering due to the big difference in price, but it's the same lens.
Yes it is compatible with your computer. Please keep in mind this type of ram is meant to be used in a computer with a more powerful processor. Before you spend your money be aware that this will not speed up your computer. If you just need more ram a less expensive ram will suffice. Your celeton processor simply does not have enough power to make use of this type of ram.
It will be more than enough RAM to run After Effects. You just need to make sure your laptop uses the particular RAM. This is low voltage RAM that goes in newer model computers. Also depending on the version of After Effects you will need a 64 bit OS.
I don't recall if I received one either, I would recommend contacting the seller
No, it works on 120 volt only
Yes it's works. 3G or 4G LTE NETWORKS.
Nope. The HP you are referring to only has 1 2.5 inch bay, so unless you modded that case there no place for another drive. a 1TB drive would double your capacity though. So I'd check that out.
SATA drive, not SSD.
Honestly i had the original hard drive in and played the ps4 for 3 days probably 3-4 hr sessions and it did get warm when i put in the western hard drive i really could not tell the difference it gets warm but never anything past what the orginal did
Yes, it's a 2.5" so it will fit. You won't get Sata 3 6 Gbit/s speeds though since the Dell is old. It will drop down to either 1.5 or 3 Gbit/s depending on if the Dell can handle Sata 1 or Sata 2.
yes
Sorry. No
No, the right hand grip gets in the way, if I put the grip attachment on my DSC RX 100 it won't fit either
Hello. Yes this includes NP-BX1 rechargeable battery pack. I found this information under product description on the detail page. I hope this helps!
It's a single stick of RAM.
Basic windows version. Windows 8.1
Speakers do not come with this kit.
I don't unplug mine when i cover it, except during lightning storms.
Everything you need to set up a system. My only complaint is that the cables are limited to 50 ft. each. If you need to put one or more cameras farther away from the base unit, you'll need to by longer cables.
Its alright. You get at least 2-3 hours of full recording. This is a rough guesstimate from trying to think back on back experiences. Heads up: the screen shuts off and it seems like it automatically shuts off when you're on standby off but it really isn't. If you didn't turn off the camera then its not off. I initially thought the battery sucked because of this.
I wouldn't recommend it
Yea mine came with the plate
CPU&#65306;A31S GPU&#65306;SGX544MP2
Yes, it will work with your Mac.
Sure
NO. The interface SATA is incompatible with ATA in your desktop. I suggest you to buy a new computer, don't waste the money on this part.
It should, it even comes with a spacer that is needed for some installs. Most SSDs are pretty standard but there is a new thinner type out these days hence it comes with a spacer should it be needed. I would call HP just in case you had an serious doubts, but I can't really see a reason why not.
1. Do you perform exactly the same steps as at first migration? 2. Do you use the same/similar hardware and BIOS settings? 3. What software do you use for migration? You provided no much info to help you.
Only one AAA battery
I used this to with the plug that came with my iphone. I was told by APPLE, if you use the plug that comes with the phone you don't need a converter.
Not sure but we didn't have much luck with the card. It was for my daughter so I can't answer if it was human error or just a bad product. Sorry.
Not sure. But they are made bad. They don't last. Do not purchase.
The same was for me. I tried to re-install it and it worked. But even this helps do not be happy:) - it worked only about 40 hours for me
Aftermarker
Yes, it has a VGA port to connect a monitor.
Depends on the size of the micro card in the glasses. The glasses have a battery life of 2 hours. You can record roughly 90 minutes of 1080 video with 32gb card.
No remote for this model. The glasses toggle between video and still and any video editing software can pull stills off the video.
U have to put the ball on. It does not come with it.
Hello Gregg and thank you for your interest in our product. The Compatible Devices listed for this item are the iPad 4th Gen., iPad Air, and iPad Air 2. The Maximum Device dimensions are as listed, Width 7.4" x Height 9.5" x Depth 0.33". Please feel free to contact me for further assistance. Thanks again Andrea
Might just be your router. Try using a new or different one to see if that solves your problem.
Yes.
Press and hold the center button on the headset until you hear a beep tone.
Yes you can. The only dissadvantage is you are tied down for 2 hours by the cord to the charger. Happy headphone get away.
I wear glasses and I don't notice any pressure - the padding is pretty good. - I hope that helps.
Yes it does, it pops up when needed.
Your outlet should be right next to a wall stud. You could mount this onto the stud and could position it so that it is in front of the outlet. I don't think there is a secure way to mount it over the outlet itself though.
There are 4 screws holding arm on. I removed the whole mounting arm and put on an adjustable easel type stand for sitting on a table. It is a standard 4 screw mount.
Absolutely not. I have a note 3. Did not fit. Also did not charge my phone. Remote does not work. And it only lasted 3 weeks before it simply stopped working. Do not buy!
It's just a hit shoe mount need to get something like a cold shoe adapter hope this helps
I have found that it doesn't charge on all 30 pin connections, it's hit and miss. for example, I have a JBL speaker where the bluetooth functionality works great, but it doesn't charge, while both charging and bluetooth works fine on my iHome alarm clock. Same goes with 30 pin charging cords, it's hit and miss. When it is charging, you will see a small red flashing light in the upper left top corner. Hope this helps.
No
I can't see why not. I've paired it to my HP laptop, iPad and iPhone. Should work with MacBook or anything else with Bluetooth capability.
Yes, it works with all iPads and iPhones assuming you have Bluetooth turned on.
yes, the speaker can work well while it is charging.There is only one A/C cord, but also has one piece USB-Micro Cord
Yes, it has googel playstore and it could work.
bulls-i Vehicle Drive Recorders is a manufacturer from South Korea. BlackVue is a competitor.
no no problem
No it does not. I bought it for my series 2 and it did not fit
Hi, Thank you for your message. And the car charger is included in the package. About the battery. Sorry that i am not sure about how long it will last . But it normally need to plug the power supply to use. Hope that will help.
in the left pan of the camera display web page, to select the following function options 1. Alarm Setting -&gt; Motion Detect, 2. In the right pan of web page to check the "Enable motion detect" box to enable motion detect setting, 3. Find the "Sensitivity" item and click the pull-down list button (the inverst triangle mark) at the right side of "Sensitivity" value field 4. From the pull-down list try to select a proper sensitivity value (the range: 1 (high) - 100 (low))
IT already has parental control on it. Mrs. Fay
Yes you can skype with this table. I also skype with my sons on it.
I am using the HDMI side port on my VIZIO TV to connect with the DVD player.I am using a mediabridge high speed HDMI cable for the connection. Hope this helps.
I bought it as a gift. I'm sorry I do not know the answer to this.
No it doesnt work it will break if u put it on an ipad and its made out of plastic not rubber. The ipad is much more thick than the ipad 2
It will record both directions to two separate files at the same time. You can change this in the settings to either record just the front, or just the back, and both at the same time.
I did have a bit of trouble with mine at first but after I went into sound settings in my OS and updated the settings for the headset to be default and so on and did a reboot, it worked perfect, just make sure you always keep it in the same USB port or you will have to go through it all over again. My sys OS Is Win 7 Pro. Hope this helps.
It came w/ 1 sony genuine battery and 2 wasabi batteries. Ironically wasabi battery has a larger capacity.
Yes. That has nothing to do with the devise. As long as you pair it once with your iPhone it should always reconnect. You may have to go into your Bluetooth settings to connect to it but you won't have to enter the pin again. But you have to be careful about when you're both in the car. It can only connect to ONE at a time.
Yes
Yes. It is HW14WX101.
Yes...
Not positive but I don't think so, it only works for certain 5500's (not all)
I had a professional come and install in my absence, he had to cut a box behind the TV in the wall for $K converter and he fixed it with a mount he suggested, also I had a sound bar installed just below the screen. I wish I had run an Ethernet wire from my router, even though I mage to trouble shoot wireless connection by using the Media part the WIFI spectrum at 5K htz.
Yes it does have the one connect box. However the current one connect box does not have HDMI 2.0, the that box has not been released yet, but you will be able to upgrade to it when it is.
I bought two of these about a month ago. They worked for a day or two, then starting making the noise you speak of and won't play my iPod, etc. Very disappointed in this product!
Yes I view it on my samsung Galaxy 3. I think the app is called isecurity+. There is a monthly charge. If I add more cameras I will probably go with foscam brand, my brother says he uses a free app with that cam. I can see the live feed on the app, and it is supposed to record tiny snippets when motion activated. I don't think it is recording every time at my father's house, there is gaps in time when I know it should have been recording him.
Not sure about the first question but they will work when plugged in to charge
The second camera is a remote camera that can be mounted any where in the vehicle, it plugs in to the left of the screen top port
They will. I wouldn't recommend purchase of these headphones because they are a little too safe. My daughter has great hearing and she can barely hear through these pair at times. I checked them myself and I have great hearing...they are terrible.
My son's was exactly as shown
No, unfortunately it is not back-lit.
You can use the system with 220v without transformer like I do in Vietnam
Hello, Yes, it will work with 2G, 3G, or 4G. Thanks. www.FortressSecurityStore.com
Yes, It is.
I use this laptop continuously 8+ hours a day, sometimes plugged in, most of the time on battery, and it has never gotten hot, not even with relatively heavy use (and I don't have mine set to eco mode or anything). It never even feels warm -- it remains cool to the touch -- and I can count the number of times the fan has turned on (3-4 times in the 4+ months I've had it, and only for a couple of seconds, a gentle swish, like a sigh). It's a great laptop!
All SD cards are the same size and stick out a bit in this computer. Its not much of a problem when using the computer but you wouldn't want to store it with an SD card in the slot.
I had about 70gb free out of the box. Haven't uninstalled the bloatware yet.
yes it has a dvd drive which plays dvd's
Yes
I pulled the power from my hub and had to press the button to restore power to the device.
If you looking to pull off just Ethernet it needs to be powered. Some directv boxes power the device via the coax so the ac adapter is not required
If it has Bluetooth, you are good to go
It does...when i leave the office, the bluetooth disconnects and i noticed when im back the box is off....nice feature.
It remembers ... It can pair with 2 audio sources.
I really don't think so- sorry:(
It does come with a wire to play with a iPod.
It does have an audio input from a headphone jack so that would function. Also, I suppose it would depend on the volume of your bike. I have noticed a few iPhone users complaining about lower than desired volume, but on my Samsung Galaxy S4 the volume is very loud for such a small device. Hope that helps.
I purchased it for our IPad mini Im sure you can also purchase it for you IPad 4 too
Yes
System uses the Android Operating System, which has many online guides. See Android site: www.android.com/&#8206; Official site provides information for users, developers and partners. Includes press releases, videos, screenshots and downloads.
My acted up & I returned it! I got a Nexus 7 and I love it!
Yes, you can. That is how it is designed. If you are not picking up WIFI, then either the tablet itself could have a problem. Once you turn on WIFI, it should automatically search any open networks. When yours is displayed, then click it and enter the information. Same as if you were trying to connect to a hotspot, except you may or may not have to enter a password.
Not quite sure what size that is bug it fits the iPad 1/2 generation. The notches fit the cord etc. if the air is the same size but thinner than perhaps. The iPad mini is definitely too small
The pole secures into a rotary motor base that swivel the antenna.
No. It uses normal power outlets (110).
8" long x 4" wide x 5.5" high
we ship within 24 hours - usually same day!
No, it doesn't but that wasn't a deciding factor on my decision to purchase. The features and performance (were more important and they) are simply amazing! The seller, Eluktronics, made my transaction a very pleasant one as well. Everything was shipped and received on time as expected! I highly recommend this model! :)
The manual says it is. btw do get this! Literally doubles battery life and doesn't weigh much
Sorry we haven't.
Not sure know it fits my galaxy tab 3 7 inch but it a good product if it work on yours have it and otterbox defender series lot of protection sorry cant help much
They are bright enough. However, I've been having problems with visible pulsating when the lights are dimmed below 60%. Not totally noticeable with the naked eye, but the pulsating appears on the video in post production.
log in to magic jack and set up your account n it will ask if you want automatic payment set up
I don't know for a fact but I assume not. They would be calling a local number. I believe it works the same as a cell phone would.
Just follow the instructions. You have to plug the unit to the PC USB port first to do the configuration, there are diff to run the Jack with or without the PC, in my case I use one of the Ethernet port on my router as a stand alone without a PC. If addition help is needed search for Magicjack 2014 plus installation on U tube.
6gb
Frequency Response (www.energy-speakers.com) 65Hz to 20KHz +/-3dB
Yes, visit our store at
you need a heat gun for the glue, you will need some tools to pry the glass, scrapper works good. then a fine Philips screw driver.
It's been a while since I installed it for a client but I know you do not need any accessories, boxes. It is a complete package when you purchase the unit. I just had to get the hard drives.
I have not had an issue with the IX4-300d using iSCSI connected to my ESX Host, but good luck with tech support....I have called them on my IX4-200d and it is still sitting as a boat anchor and a $2000.00 offer to recover my data
I have a large golden retriever and never sets the alarm off! So should be fine, IMO.
Hello, The motion sensor will pick up on a 20ft range, and 120 degree coverage. Thanks! www.FortressSecurityStore.com
Hello Mark, Yes, the pet weight limit on these Pet Immune Motion sensors is 50lbs and less will not be detected. Thanks! www.FortressSecurityStore.com
Hello, I am not sure. You can try it, and if not, you can always return it. Thanks. www.FortressSecurityStore.com
Did you switch the power on? Only thought I have.
No advantage as it's an internal drive, better to use the internal SATA connectors. You would not be able to plug an external drive in later.
They are T10/100.
They are removable, in case you do not need the extra range simply pop them off.
It did for me.
No it doesn't. you will have to use external CD/DVD. it is ultra slim (almost 1 inch or less), and there is no space within the laptop to add cd/dvd
It will connect to a device with the EOS app chin via wifi so that you can control it through the app
50 or 99.
The dimensions: closed: approx. 6 x 3.25 x 0.5 open: 11.5 x 3.25 x 0.25 It really is a great keyboard. It works great. Highly rcommended
It folds into a 5.7 x 3.4 x 0.7-inch body and when it's open, the length of the keyboard doubles into 11.4 inches.
Yes you can
No-it has the mouse plus a little USB device you have to leave in your USB port. It's hard to move and point - I don't recommend this device.
Ok after emailing amazon regarding the codes they emailed me promo keys and I now have them installed :D
Tek syndicate has a good review of this card and one of the scenarios is with triple display, go check it out.
The lens comes with a 90 day warranty from Nikon and if the lens is purchased through Cameta Camera than we extend the warranty to a total of one year.
LCD
Stand is not adjustable, however can purchase adjustable stand to mount it on.
No
Only fits the laptops listed
Yes, this AC Adapter will work with HP Spectre XT TouchSmart 15-4000 series, including 15-4013 model.
This machine only has one memory slot and Samsung indicated 4GB is it's maximum supported capacity. The laptop would have to be disassembled to access the slot so it's not intended to be user upgraded.
Yes, it should be 4GB. "4 MB" that is a typo. Thanks alerting us to this you have sharp eyes.
No, but if your looking to stream video you can. For the website that I use to stream movies called "Superchillin", I had to use a browser called "Puffin". After I downloaded it and went to their site, then I had to click on the Flash icon and pay $0.99 for the year to use the Flalsh player. After I installed that the video ran perfectly. If yo have any other questions, let me know.
Yes it has one Ethernet port on the left side
Sorry I don't know. But, if an answer comes in on how and cost, I would definitely be interested.
do you have the the micro sd card in the ASUS? Tap "External storage inserted" &gt; select the file you want to copy &gt; Tap the "copy" icon on left down or right upper corner &gt; File Manager &gt; choose a folder &gt; tap the "paste" icon on left down or right upper corner.
The iPad Air is too small
Yes we can
This computer does not have a graphical card dedicated to games, would not recommend for games
Yes, top of display frame.
Yes. I don't do gaming personally but my husband has the same laptop and he definitely does gaming on it. He loves it except for some games, it seems to be a bit confusing to download some games.
there is enough room to have a logo put on them, but i don't know if the seller offers that service
Like a glove
If you are referring to infrared, no, it doesn't.
If you have the speed transducer it does
That is correct, 8 ports built in
Yes, with FTP you can push video to a remote location. Please refer to the Remote Monitoring Guide here for available recording options: http://www.q-see.com/content/files/guides/QC%20NVR%20Remote%20Monitoring%20Guide%20v1_web.pdf
The FZ70 has a fixed LCD screen with less resolution, The lens has a variable aperture and not just F 2.8, No Remote control options, EVF is less capable, Fewer controls on lens and body, less capable sensor, fewer Movie options, does not come with lens hood, not as good in low light, and much more. The FZ70 will takea wider angle and longer telephoto images than FZ200. Under most circumstances the images taken outdoor will be hard to distinguish the difference.
Depends on your definition of work? Will it wrap around the tablet? Probably. Would it fit perfectly and give you proper access to the port? No. I'm not sure if Asus/Google makes an OEM case for the 2012 model.
yes
Yes it does
The official case does not turn off/on the N7.
The FHD is the new 2013 model and the Nexus 7 is the old 2012 model.
Yes
1/8"
YES , CAN YOU BUY IT , THANKS........................
Yes you can take your airbrush apart put the parts into the ultrasonic machine submerge the parts with windex and start the machine you can use any amount of time it should clean it I hope that answers your question good luck
Yes It works with any Canon dslr or slr Camera
We ship to Europe, not to Asia, Africa or South America though.
Mine didn't come with Microsoft Office pre-installed. It wasn't important to me since I can get the software through work for fairly cheap. Thanks!
heavy due to the size
Yep!
yes there is a lens lock on it but I have not had issues with it sliding without using the lock while taking pictures in a downward angle.
Yes
Quite frankly I do not know since I always keep my O2 plugged in except when I am using it. Try leaving it plugged in for about four hours and then try to use it. If you still only get a few seconds use you should contact the seller and tell them that your unit is not holding it's charge. They are quite helpful and willing to work with you.
should go thru a 3/4" fine not sure about 1/2" may be to big for that
Yes
Yes
No
No, it must be plugged into a power outlet.
Decent range although you need to consider walls and other obstructions between wherever you have the dongle plugged in and where you want to go. I was able to go to the kitchen and outside and the patio to a point. Just be gentle with the frame :) I was relatively happy with it.
It does come with software, that seems to be up to date. I did look online for updates from the manufacturer website and could not find anything I didn't already have. As far as photo sop is concerned I'm not sure. I use Manga Studio EX and it was pretty much plug and play. I would think this would be good for PSE11 since its design is to be a mouse alternative and basically allow you to use the stylus for everything.
From the manufacturer - yes, it will fit. The platform is actually 13" x 10.25", but the entire surface is not covered with the holes needed to secure the bungee cords around the corner. But, you are only slightly over the suggested size so it will still work for your size tablet.
From the Bookholder Company - yes, some people simply use 1 or 2 bands and position them so as to not interfere with their small screen.
That is the new one. Much better than the old one.
It is very sturdy, yes, the joints do have some plastic on them, but not cheap plastic. It does have weight to it, which I am grateful for, as I wheel it from room to room sometimes. Great for lying down and reading either on bed or couch, also sitting in chair and having at my fingertips. Pricey, but for me it was certainly worth it.
I'm sorry, but we don't currently manufacture the Book Platform Kit in clear. It is only manufactured in black.
yes,,, if you get a multi-port hub... or just get a bluetooth keyboard and that will work also...
I believe so. I have the 5113 model and it fits perfect.
Yes, it's Bluetooth activated
Yes it is adjustable
I have connected this computer to my large HD TV, via HDMI and it works great to watch streaming video. It switched automatically to display whats on the computer screen to display it via the HDMI port.
It does not.
No, the PMX95 does not have a mic or remote.
Not exactly but it is pretty average 25 to 30cm
Sure u need to protect it from weather ,u can wrap it with duct tape.
It includes both, but it is not proper POE. You plug the device's power source into one of the 'Y's, and plug the other end's 'Y' into your device. I use them to power Raspberry Pi computers, but there is too much resistance in a 50' CAT5 cable to provide enough power.
It works, however as USB 2.0 speeds and because of Microsoft limitations, up to a single 32Gb partition. So don't even bother purchasing the 64Gb version of this thumb drive as XBox will only use 32Gb.
Both the ones I bought are mounting as Hard disks.
Comes as fat32 but you can format it any way you want.
I never used it but I do believe it has the function
Sound comes from the computer, not the monitor. Plug your speakers into your computer.
You might have to remove your Ipad from your skin (cover) because the Ipad fits in a slot on the key pad and it's a snug fit. I have to remove my Ipad from the skin cover but the keyboard is great, good luck
I suspect that it would because the keyboard uses bluetooth and would connect to the bluetooth on the phone. I have not tried it, but I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work.
I'm not sure because it's at my daughters. I will tell you the tv doesn't sit too high-6-8" from the base to bottom of TV. They sat it on a table. Hope that helps. The tv was a 26" I think.
Yes you can ignore the surr back channel or u can connect a seperate stereo amp for the surr back enjoy
Yes, that is what it is for. However, you have to download the driver from a computer with internet connectivity FIRST for it to work. You can find the driver on Netgears website. Download the driver onto a SD card or USB stick. The simply install it on the computer you need wifi on, then hook up the netgear unit. Driver can be found here. http://support.netgear.com/product/WNA3100. Its easy breezy.
Yes it will,, but WEP is easy to hack. All systems I set up and use are WPA-PSK.
Unfortunately, This most likely will not work with a wii. This device needs drivers to operate, which can be found on the NetGear website. A wii has an OS that can not be modified as easily as Windows, Mac OS and Linux. I'd recommend getting an insanely cheap Media PC, unless you are really attached to the wii mote.
Hey, it's aluminum very nice quick laptop
This does not have a touch screen. I bought one from Sam's Club. It is a great laptop though. I prefer no touch screen as its just another thing that could break. Also usability isn't really there since you have the keyboard and mouse. Hope this helps
Yes, mine works perfectly. It comes with a small cable that connects the battery pack to the body of the camera. No problems.
You could attach to the regular light stand with a 5/8" stud.
Yes, I bought it for that same purpose. It works great.
Dear Customer: Thank for your intersted in our product.We shipping from HongKong.Thanks, Best regards Sincerely THG Limited
TF card is also known as micro SD card. So it uses a micro SD card or TF card.
The best options in the market in my humble opinion would be the following: Lanparte Battery Back Pack Plate Adapter Power Supply Pinch With Internal HDMI Splitter for Sony V-shoe V-Mount V-Lock Battery External / for DSLR Camera Video Light:- http://www.amazon.com/Lanparte-Battery-Internal-Splitter-External/dp/B00ARABA9I/ref=pd_sim_sbs_p_2?ie=UTF8&refRID=07DJMF5FF4TCXW360Y64 Tilta DSLR 15mm Rod BP V Mount Battery Plate Power Supply For Canon 5D2 5D3 C300:- http://www.amazon.com/Tilta-Mount-Battery-Plate-Supply/dp/B00FTUTRD2/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1405554263&sr=1-1&keywords=tilta+plate
The part number listed, when purchased from an authorized retailer, is a genuine Lenovo product.
No, you will still need to connect a remote wire. You can use the same remote wire but the pre out doesn't control on/off.
Yes you need to used hi low adaptor to hook up to your factory radio
it anchors to the board with metal brackets that are provided. as long as the device is anchored to board and the board is connected well to the chassis this works well. if still feel like could be issue. you could always use black tie wraps attach to the plastic housing and anchor to a side wall of the chassis to release load on motherboard.
Yes, perfectly!
My Husband said yes. Its what he has. Very happy with the Cooler Master V8.(Staying cool) He built a high end desk top with the i7- 4770k. (LOADED)
I don't think you'd have a problem size wise.
This was a Christmas gift to our 10-year old grandson in another city. He uses it every day, but I have no idea how to answer your question as I have never owned a Memo Pad. Perhaps Google the answers or contact Netflix - they can answer you directly.
In theory it can be used for whatever. I used it for one night to run a CPAP machine, but then it broke. I wouldn't recommend it.
It fits on my ipad 4 perfectly!
pls make sure your tablet is Bluetooth enabled and the size is 7.0-8.0 inch, then it should be fine.
If his tablet has Bluetooth then yes. But the size of the tablet may not fit the case. Mine is 8.9 inches and it's a tight fit.
Yes you can. Mine is paired with my computer, tablet and phone!
Ok. My english is bad too. Mine it's 315 MHz. Perhaps you could ask for one in 433mhz.
No, but the Bacpac comes with four different housings, including waterproof touch.
Yes it does
Looks like Canon PowerShot SX50 has a standard hot shoe so it should work with LumoPro (this is manual flash so no TTL.) I don't know about Cactus Wireless V5, I looked at the picture of it and I believe it should work. I am using http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002W3IXZW/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and it works flawless with my studio strobes and LumoPro LP180.
I have the OMD EM5 and I can fit it in the bag with a similar lens attached, but after that I can only fit one other lens & a few spare batteries & some SD cards. I have a large hot-shoe flash as well, and I cannot fit both my flash & my 50 mm 1.4 lens in this bag; it's either an extra lens or the external flash, but not both - certainly not.
The Evga spec sheet indicates this card is only 9.5 inches or 241mm in length. How did you come up with 13 inches? http://www.evga.com/products/pdf/04G-P4-3768.pdf
I bought the 8.0 version case, and the camera was at the top left of the backside. But I believe if you have the 10.0 tab then the camera will be in the middle.
It clicks and locks into place, but the mesh screen is glued to the plastic sliding panel.
Yes, it is one of the "Apps" that you can load. It also supports Hulu, Netflix, Amazon streaming and several others. It is a fine product.
Absolutely!! Enjoy
Yes you can. The batteries "talk" to the camcorder and you get a very accurate reading of the time remaining.
I would not recommend purchasing this GPS..the gmu and game tracking functions are wonderful, but compared to others, it is very difficult to navigate the typical functions. The joystick moves the cursor around, but is also the enter button when pushed. So many times you will accidentally select an unintended option by simply trying to move the cursor.
3 meters
No - all ports are accessible with the case on
I have a 120 inch screen and I'm 10 12 feet back...it has a border of 8 inches all the way around doesn't fill my screen....whenever I move out I should have more space.....I bought the bigger screen for this.... the 3d rocks ...if you have any questions email me.....Google spencer clough and you can find me
20,000 to 1
No, the working voltage is 12v. But plenty of similar devices that run on house hold current.. I have several and they work fine.
No
Any standard antenna with a din connector. I would consult the antenna company as they will explain the properties of their antennas. You may want to optimize the location of your device first away from other wireless devices, metal, glass with reflective tape etc as they affect wireless propagation.

It's solid state so I don't see why you couldn't leave on. I would just be sure it can get some air circulation for cooling. I believe all it does when you pair it is it will recognize your Bluetooth device. I don't see why it wouldn't work with your phone. It has a remote control, but I'm not sure if it uses the Bluetooth or is infrared. If you hide it, the remote may not work.
No. Camera has to be always connected with flat cable to the RPI.
Window 8 then there is a free 3 hour upgrade to Win 8.1. It works way better and has better shortcuts to apps and system functions. Hope that helped.
Nope, it didn't fit on mine
Hi. I have never run it out fully but it is more than double the original factory battery. That original was quite short. Thanks
You mean if you can mount it in side ways?? yes.. you can mount either L or R on the windshield and rotate the cameras one for the front and one for the back.
Yes Gordon, it has a loop record function. So when memory is full the old one is deleted automatically to make room for new video. Any Save ON Storage (SOS) video will not be deleted automatically (this happens when you press the SOS button).
As long as you Have D-Link but some projectors need a 3D converter box.
Nope
Comes with everthing you need
The distance in height between the inner rails is approximately 9 inches. It should definitely fit around a standard electrical plate.
It will work. I have a 50 inch working without any problems. Extend nicely. Great product.
No it does not.
downloadable at the Fuji site under support ~~ http://www.fujifilm.com/support/digital_cameras/manuals/a/
Yes

This microSDHC card is just a storage device. It will happily accept any file formats you write to it. It is your player (cell phone or tablet) that needs to know how to decode the video file format and display it on the screen.
yes you can
A lot of older computers could not accept the micro SDHC cards. You could put the card in the adapter and plug that into a USB port to download, or upload, photos, documents, etc. Most newer computers have a slot for these micro cards. Hope that answers your question.
I don't own a Samsung Galaxy.
No
The speed would be one speed, but it'd defiantly cool your pc.
Yes, it comes with two padded partitions with velcro that can be moved around as you like.
I believe that it will. It holds my Nikon D60 w/and 18-300 lens attached and there is still room for a second lens, charger and my iPad.
No
This seller has misstated 90% of the description, this is a barebones laptop. Meaning, there is no CPU, RAM, HDD, Optical Drive or OS as stated.
Sorry, I don't understand. Regards
Hello, No, it comes with USB Keyboard and Mouse. Best regards, Amuras
It shouldn't, I have an N5110 and it just makes it sit on a slant. I actually prefer the slant rather than it laying flat.
Working perfectly, fits and keep the charge for long time...
You can use the same one you have.
It' s just like a cassette on the car cassette player. You still can control the volume with the car volume knob.
The enclosed drive should appear as a usual storage device, allowing access to any or all of its contents.
I'm going to say probably not. :( It fits perfectly on my ASUS MeMo Tablet which is 10 1/2" across. The description of yours says 10", so the case may be too large.
No, there is no way. This doesn't even fit a 7 inch tablet. 7 1/2 is way too much.
Windows 8.1 upgrade is free. You will be asked to upgrade once you get your laptop up and running. You CAN upgrade to Win 8.1 Pro if you want...that will cost you on the upgrade fee through Microsoft thou.
Yes 410 and 430 as well
All new Lenovo square plugs are the same size. I have a Yoga and have proven this by swapping around adapters from Yoga 13s, Yoga 2 Pros, and Carbons. Even the low-end models still have the square adapter and it works.
It comes with a power adapter and mounting bracket.
If for internet connection you mean visible on web, the answer is yes. You just have to assign a dedicated ip address and port on your network and open the port thru the firewall (es. 192.168.1.10:100). Form the web you can access at the camera from your IP address (es http://75.80.148.97:100). Than you need a droid app (I use IP Cam Viewer) and configure as ip and port same as your web access (IP: 75.80.148.97 Port:100)
I don t know if its down firing but you can definitely hear the bass very good no matter what position you re in.
Hi! This Sony Soundbar Sytem do have a bundled remote control: model number: RMANU164. -Ely
Nope the main portion isn't wide enough for the 30 pin connector
yes
I didn't get it
I think they have the product description incorrect. I bought it for my 7" tablet and fits perfect. I also looked under the product model number before buying and it brought up the 7" Samsung Galaxy 3. Hope this helps.
Cameras get their power from the DVR recorder, there are two wires run between each camera to DVR, one is power, one is video.
I think u can add it,cause I see they have audio connect on the back of the dvr
Should play it if you have the correct app if running windows 8
It is the Focus multi memory card reader.
Greetings, Thank you for your interest in our products here at MITXPC. A WiFi adapter is indeed included and is rated for 802.11b/g/n (single-band @ 2.4GHz). Best regards, MITXPC
yes this works as a power supply just like a laptop supply would work.
Yes it comes with a wall charger, a usb cord to transfer photos and ear buds.
No, it is a plug-in-the-wall charger that steps down voltage to 5 V.
The revised firmware version does work, according to New Harbor. The first firmware version, of which I am a recipient, does not. New Harbor contacted me directly and immediately when they discovered the problem and offered to swap out my flash for one that works with the T3 series. Should you receive one that doesn't work, I believe that New Harbor will work diligently to rectify it. However, I'm also satisfied that they'll have the issue fixed on any flash you order from them. Hope this helps, Robert~
This flash does not have ability to be used off the camera (triggered wirelessly), but supports PC link (wired connection).
no--you need to buy an attachable DVD RW drive. We bought this one http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009QBIZ60/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and it works great
The closed umbrella is much shorter than 43", I would estimate approximately 24" long and 6-8" in diameter. I'm very pleased with mine! It's perfect for location work!
The carrying case is very nice. No worries there. It's a drawstring case .
Yes with a software package
3 AA batteries. It comes with an AC power adapter/charger and it will work with the adapter/charger providing the power, thereby saving the batteries. However, it will not charge unless the scanner is turned off. It's best to use rechargeable batteries, and to buy an extra set and a separate battery charger. That way, when the batteries get low, you can swap them out and charge the ones that had been in the scanner.
Both ac and USB cords required
It goes to sleep when the computer does and wakes up when the computer does. There is no on/off switch.
No the HDD is a Seagate thin notebook Hybrid Drive that is a portion of the drive is Solid State which may improve performance on repetitive access be careful about the Brands of external Hard Drives you attach because some of the supplied software may cause the PC to respond very slowly
most certainly does
it comes with a regular wired keyboard and wired mouse
Yes it does and works great. A very good product.
Thay do work with cell phones
No, usually something as important as surround sound would be put in the description. I believe only 1 afterglow headset has surround sound, and it's settled at like, $240 or something
Works with any just plugs into headphones jack doesn't charge it
Great question! There is a firmware update that just came out for this. Also make sure you never defrag an SSD it will turn it into a paper weight.
think it's the same size as 840 PRO
of course, work with the same SATA 2 connector.
daddy
Yes
It uses 1"AA" standard battery.
It is possible to remove the shade yourself (see Youtube videos), but looks very risky. I returned the original one I purchased and instead bought the version that already has the lens shade removed - I use mine underwater with a full frame camera. So, if you have not already done so, this is my recommendation! I have been very happy with the lens.
I think so, but am not 100% sure. Go to kenRockwell.com - he will know. It is an awesome lens, especially for underwater close focus :)
I watch a TV station in Sneedville TN. WETP-TV is a full service television station in Sneedville, Tennessee, broadcasting on local digital UHF channel 41 and virtual channel 2. all the time and the distance away is 74 miles
To answer your question I will need the full dimensions of the monitors plus the dimensional location of the mounting holes.
I believe it will. I'm not in my office to measure, but the depth of mine was not big.
From the number of complaints, it is a design flaw. Some percentage of Max units will have the case split and the LED cover pop off due to the vibration and stress. If you send it in to Escort, they will fix everything for free and give you a new mount, but it is annoying. Better bet is a Valentine V1 with the YaV1 smartphone app. You can find more info and HONEST reviews here: http://www.rdforum.org/forum.php
Dimensions: 12-1/2" x 13 inches - from the sleevecity website
It is very similar. As for having an application like word, yes it does. You can also download new applications that are or can be free.
The third party stylus made for androids will work. But you need to make sure its says for use with android.
Yes put a PL-259 connector on the end of the cable that will screw on the back of radio. Check Youtube for INSTALLING A PL-259 connector.
Yes, it will hold any type of file so long as it is not larger than 4gb.
no its a fake card its only a half a gb don't buy
Fairly rigid, not the most rigid I've used. But I've only done phone screen protectors before this, so the increased size made it a little more difficult than I was used to but worked well and I got the couple little bubbles out easily.
I think they will fit fine. The kids galaxy tab seems to be the same as the regular
I'm not sure check the number on your battery if it matches the product then it's the right one
Yes, perfect fit and capability is as expected..
First battery I received didn't work. Seller was GREAT about sending a replacement, including sending a prepaid shipping label and sending out a replacement battery before receiving back the defective one! Replacement was perfect.
It can but I wouldn't unless you know what you are doing. I.e. use a diode to prevent current from flowing back into the port and frying the usb port or motherboard. But I still wouldn't and I know quite a bit about engineering.
Absolutely! Download iSpy video surveillance software (free - google it), Set up your camera on your computer or home network. No need to be on line unless you want to remote view (offsite) your camera. I have six cameras set up this way with no internet access.
NO! You have to buy a mic. & speaker separately and good luck with that!!!
Yes, the ones we purchased had two headsets. They are terrific!!!
Yes, and I notice some difference in adjusting the tone but not as extensive as on a stereo or something of that nature. We love them, though---particularly the adjustable earpieces which helps if they start to get uncomfortable after wearing for an extended period of time.
Absolutely.
Absolutely! I love my Panasonic RPs. I use them with my hp laptop and they're wonderful. The sound is beautiful, smooth; and they're super comfy.
With my old pair they lasted me 6 months but that was with very heavy use (running everyday with them, and basically having them in a majority of the day).
No but u only can turn it up or down when using am apple product
I bought an adapter like: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008OB2NHA/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and it works perfectly.
Yes
It allows you to orient the device landscape and portrait
Yes, if you have the SYNC with My Ford Touch. The one with the bigger screen, not the smaller one.
It enables the factory GPS to run while in motion. It will also allow an external video input be run when the truck is in motion (factory or aftermarket backup camera, aftermarket front or side cameras, or external DVD player run thru the hard wiring on video 2 or 3 or plugged into the RCA connections in the top dash console). The factory CD player does NOT play DVDs. Hope that helps.
Laptop Battery Life Up to 3.77 hours.
yes
Factory seal One year warranty
No, it's not included with the DAC. But you can use any standard computer USB type 2 cable (same one you'd use if you were connecting your computer to a printer). Or use a specialized audio USB from Audioquest etc.
I think so.
There is a memory access door on the bottom of the laptop with two memory slots. You can go to any computer store in your area; Or, you can go to your local Best Buy store and buy (2) 8GB Sticks of DDR3 Memory.
yes, This is a very good product. You will get powerful LIGHT with LOW Electric use and less heat! because of the low power bulbs. It lights the room like a studio.
I use the card reader on the PC to transfer. No problems.
Yes and no. Once you install this device it essentially covers your existing mirror with a mirror of its own. So you will no longer have the mirror you have now, but the new one that is essentially a part of this device, think of it as a rear-view mirror with cameras attached.
120 per camera

If you're looking for something like that this is not the one. I've tried to use this Mike in that way and it picks up sounds great but you need to be in a controlled environment.
I got clear signal at about 120ft, started to sputter at about 135ft, gave out entirely at 150ft.
I haven't tried a battery pack, but I've plugged it into my laptop (via USB) and a wall outlet (via USB / wall adapter) and it charges just fine. I'm sure a battery pack will work too.
I had the same question. I emailed E-PRANCE and you have to leave it on 1 minute and it will turn the E-PRANCE off after 1 minute and not run down your car battery
Si, si jala en Mxico
I didn't check the amps but I hooked it up and it got pretty hot so I assume it pulls a lot. I never used it because I thought it would kill my battery.
Asked and answered.
A little stubborn to connect. They do work with a mac
No its bad bad bad
laptop..if only has a svga output... ipad if you own the adapter that converts to red white yellow connectors... it connected to my zune and tablet with no problems and laptop.
Mine came only with AV cord no way to hook to laptop
No. See details on other question about using this device (which is excellent) and iOS devices...
This has no battery... it is powered by the AC adaptor only...
Yes. I bought the same one to replace on a first generation ipad mini
Don't use it, my tablet has the zagg screen protector, took it off
Mine operates on 120. Don't know if it also operates on or is adjustable to 220.
The base cannot be removed Matthew
The key code should be on the envelope your disc or cd was in. You had to tear the sticker that has your key code on it in order to get the cd out. Good luck
No. It does not support that option.
Can this forward to outside cell numbers? Yes, using a VoIP app in your smartphone, I can recommend this: Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zoiper.android.app&hl=es-419 Iphone: https://itunes.apple.com/do/app/zoiper-sip-softphone-for-voip/id438949960?mt=8 Windows phone: http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/zoiper/9cc16f11-b78b-437d-87ec-578fa1660737 I assume 2 trunk lines are needed? For model UCM6102 you need 2 trunk lines to interconnects calls from your PBX extensions to the external telephone network the telephone company in your city. Other model having 4/8/16 trunk lines.

Full voice-mail support, it will even email you a wave file.
yes it does, I love this product!
I'm not sure...I had to end up getting a different case with Bluetooth capability as an end result.
the cord is about 36" (3feet)
Well I have it at work. No problem here. I wanted it for the usb outlets more than the surge protection.
Disk has to be nearly completely pushed in. Disk drive is Panasonic UJ265
It has a standard 1/4"20 screw mount on the bottom. If you have a bike mount already, it would work.

No. This particular model that I got only had the sli graphic card. I bought an external blu ray drive separately.
It isn't SSD, it's a SSHDD, a combination of a SSD and a HDD. faster than a HDD
I don't know, sorry.
The 150 can connect up to 1 ipad while the 160 can connect up to 5 ipads. While both are great, I have owned both, the 160 is the one to get if you are going to have multiple users in you aircraft or vessel.. Both 150 GPS units are the same. The XGPS 150A is the new model with the 12V-30V VDC Charger. The XGPS 150 is the old model with only a 12V charger. The XGPS 150A is the only one currently stocked and sold as an upgraded substitute for the XGPS 150. Hope this helps.
It's made of a material more like a laptop--I imagine it might be a plastic. It doesn't scratch but that's because I put a thin clear, film-type screen saver (bought on amazon) on the screen--it's just like the type one puts on a smart phone. The keys are large but they feel more crowded together than a on lap top. I find myself "typing" sometimes using the keyboard and sometimes using the "keyboard" on the tablet. Hope this helps.
Sorry, I don't remember. But I don't recommend it. I returned it after a keyboard key broke off the first day.
No it is fixed
I've bought this specifically for the surface pro 3. After tinkering around a bit I've set it up like this. What you need to do is plug the power cable into the powered USB port on the surface pro 3 charger and then plug the data transfer cable into the USB port on the surface pro 3. To play blu ray disc I've used Mac Blu-Ray player, to play DVDs I found out you only need to use the data transfer cable to the surface pro 3. Hope this helps.
My experience was that with windows 8, you need additional software to play blue rays. It did play CD and DVD though.
I have Mediacom and it works perfect with them
yes it is, I use it everyday
I haven't measured it but it is pretty low profile as far as cases go. It's not going to be as thin as those little plastic covers obviously but it will be still very thin and not over bearing at all. If it is a 2nd Gen Nexus 7 I liked this other case much better. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EZL63QA/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
You only need to hard wire this router to your computer during the setup process.
Yes, ethernet is usually faster than WiFi
No
For every license you purchase you can load it onto a desktop and a laptop
First, make sure you choose the "PC" edition, not "PC Download." Under the "More Buying Choices" box, click on the link that says "38 new" (the number may change). Ability Business has a listing stating "Brand New with license in the box" -- this will be a CD with the license.
I have no idea. I have not used mobile galaxy lll
I don't think so unless they make the app for the Mac Pro as well
I was told over the phone by QB this past Thursday that EACH paycheck has a fee of $2.14 and EACH direct deposit has a fee of $1.50 UNLESS you get the download directly from them. Obsurd!
This drive is not wireless! As the description states, it uses USB 3.0 to connect.
To be honest I dont know about this drives wifi capabilities. I am pretty sure it doesn't support wifi syncing.
That seems strange. The only thing that I suggest is to go to Finder, go to Finder Preferences, go to General and make sure that "External Disks" box is checked in the "Show these items on the desktop".
Yes it does.
Thanks for contacting us. It could work with your Pyle Astro tablet as long as this tablet supports external TF card. Thanks Best regards,
Yes.
Yes. There's an m-disc logo on the front.
No team all channels for bein sport stopped working I don't why
This is the 780 AMP! Edition ( http://goo.gl/UZovPM ) there are others( http://goo.gl/9jE6c2 ) but only one 780 AMP. The other AMP I saw is the 780Ti AMP which is faster but USD 200 more...
The difference is the lens: HCV822: 2.8mm HCV802: 6mm
It will send to anything with a video and audio input
Hi ,I really dont know how is work on Skoda because I used on a volkswagen jetta from2008.You can contact the seller and see.
I'm pretty sure it will but unless you have an AC router it won't hit the max throughput.
Sorry i dont know

I have used many protectors over the years. The wet application makes it easier and I wouldn't fear that. I did find the Skinomi greatly degraded the responsiveness and removed it. I will likely order a Zagg because I've always liked them. I tried the Skinomi just for kicks and wish I had stuck with the proven Zagg.
It is Cat-5e since the Foscam cameras operate at 100mb max.
Totally fits.
It will be available 6pm ET today
Actually it does include a USB cable.
I have not used this card in my Canon camera because the camera cannot handle anything bigger than 32GB. Perhaps this is your problem. I use this card to move files back and forth between Windows computers. I have reformatted it many times using the Windows File Manager with no problems.
No. Hero 4 uses micro sd, this is a regular sd.. Google "recommended sd cards hero 4" first, not all class 10 cards work
No you can't. I made this mistake. It fits but it will not charge it.
The software is not, it will work for normal display stuff, but some special features done with XP in the past do not work, and there is no update for W7. I reviewed this several months ago, so that may have changed if Epson has updated their software. I recommend you check their website to confirm.
I've had this projector for three months and I would have to say the picture quality depends on the media quality. Blu-ray and HDDVD's are spectacular, bright colors and a very clear picture. The image projected is processed through the HDMI output on my surround system. HDTV images are very good, clear pictures, although not as good as a plasma or LCD TV. Any other input besides HDMI are acceptable but not as good as HDMI or Blu-ray. Hope this helps.
Yes it does. It has several including chinese
Sorry, have No idea. We never needed it to do that.
buenas tablas
I have just whipped out my trusty ruler and can tell you it's 9 Inches... (24cm) high, 8 inches (20cm) wide and 2 inches (6 cm) deep. It has a nice curve to the top edge and corners. It isn't significantly bigger than the headphones, it's a snug fit, no wasted space and very sleek design - Enjoy
Hi Heidi, nice name, I could not tell, the parrot zik is large and heavy. In the technical specifications Might be an example, greetings from Peru. PD. if the headphones are folded hand I think there will be problems, both models are similar.
LEE I bought this device ,but it would not work ,where you are to enter the figure prints for the admin ,it would not accept or register anything so I am in the process in sending it back .
I do not know. My battery has always worked.
I can't respond to that as I have only done images. It does them very well.
I can't offer a response as I have no experience with Android devices.
Sort of: The included cover can be placed on the front or the back. When the cover is on the front, the erase button is physically obstructed so the board will not be erased. And because the writing surface is also covered, it won't pick up extra marks either. However since the cover is frosted plastic rather than fully clear and has a logo obscuring the bottom 20% of the screen, it's a bit difficult to read your note through the cover.
I only have grey.
I am not shore what to do. Mine is slow to boot up but has not gotten stuck. Ideas to try charging it all the way up even with a struck it should charge. Try holding down the power button and turning it off. Let it have time to charge and reset. Then see if you still have the problem. Maybe you could try this, unknown if it well work for curtain.
Sadly not. It would need a second step that it doesn't have. Kind of disappointing.
This is made for the galaxy tab 3 10.1, fits perfectly
Yes unless you have a TiVo box from your tv provider. Only Netflix and YouTube work on tv provider TiVos
I used it for iPad 2 & 4 & iPhone 4s and it's greet so I thing it's work also well for iPad Air
Be carefuly, that cable is for sound only. Not working for proyetion or presentation.
It works well with my N7100 phone, use it I can connect my phone with my tv,or some other items, which have VGA inputs, like this MHL Micro USB to VGA cable audio
I just followed the instructions, and recall that it was fairly easy - but as far as I can remember, it can only be paired with one device at a time, so it will be either your tablet or your computer. If you want to use it with both, you will have to re-pair it every time you switch.
Hello! As long as your TV has bluetooth functionality, the headphones will work with your TV. Thank you!
Yes, It has good Viet TV app pre-installed with many many Viet TV channels and Viet Radio channels too! The interface and manual are in English.
I use mine without audio source all the time, use them for when I go to shooting range, and they are great for that.
They are pretty good when it comes to this as long he has hearing aid setup in his settings
No this ones the wired set man
I have been told by people I have spoken with that they have very good noise reduction filters when using the phone.
hi, yes siri will work. Press and hold the phone button for 2-3 seconds on your left ear, until you hear voice dial
Answer from Titantech: Yes, we can preload the EUROPE Navigation for you before shipping out. Any problem, please let us know it. Thanks.
The $40 ones have an inline microphone; the $25 ones are buds only
They do cancel out external noise but in a passive way, this means that the earbuds and sound together provide isolation from exterior noise, they are however, not active, this means that there is no microprocessor that "listens" to exterior noise and then creates white noise to cancel it out. Regarding the microphone i cant be sure because i have not opened it up so im not sure if it contains an active noise cancelation system, but i can tell the call quality is great.
It has a standard headphone jack. I use them with an iPhone 4s. Should fit all standard headphone ports.
No! just the zipper
No, sorry, they do not.
Yes it is. I bought and I am using in Brazil 220V.
Yes but remember the distance will be a factor.
Sure; the device is rated at 120/240 V. Have the correct adapter and your all set. The only issue could be your device if it isn't happy with the slightly different output wattage. But, not too likely to be an issue with modern devices.
Yes
I have a macbook pro computer with minidisplayport on computer and use cable to attach to any hdmi tv with no problems. Make sure in preferences you select to turn audio on because it also comes out of the cable. :)
Hi Steven. Yes it does. You may check this link: http://www.belkin.com/us/F2CD044/p/P-F2CD044/
The device is small. Its about 2" x 1.5" x .5" with clip.
You can ignore it
no, it's not. I have one.
Be very careful when you buy it. Look at all the conditions of return. My purchase was a disaster for me as this was not appropriate for my use and I could not return so I am stuck.
It comes with Win 7.
Yes. Works better vertically, but will work horizontally too. Quality of signal will depend on distance from the transmission tower.
I live only a few miles from O'hare airport with constant air traffic and it does not affect the signal at all.
Yes, you can mount the Cable Cutter in the attic. Although, in general this is not the best location for any antenna so mileage may vary. The Cable Cutter can be mounted outdoors as well as indoors. You can use any standard RG6 coaxial cable and yes you can split the signal. We usually recommend a drop amp if you are going to split the signal to boost the signal strength before you split the signal.
Yes, I wouldn't recommend doing it regularly. I have taken it off a few times when I didn't have my headphone jack and it sealed again without a problem.
I don't think so
That's more than enough watts. It should work with your power supply too. However, I would check any specifics on both manufacturers websites.
I believe it's 10.5 inches.
nope but i still like it
I'm not sure. You should call the manufacture. Here is the Vivitar support hotline 1-800-592-9541. They should be able to help you. I called them when I purchased my exact lens. They were able to clear up all my questions. The lens is amazing quality for the price. The only bad thing about this lens is it makes my DSLR a little top heavy. So you really should have a tripod if your going to use this lens for long periods of time. Hope that helps.
Yes, you have to plug both cords in to make them work
You use the surface with the adhesive. You just got stuff mixed up. Sorry if I'm wrong you question was worded oddly.
Only change them when they get scratched.
I don't know, I wish it did. I purchased mine in May and I'm experiencing the same trouble I had with my old battery. Running hot, kicking off the laptop, and it's barely 3 months old! It was great in the beginning, arrived very fast, fit perfectly and worked great, but it's terrible it's acting up already. If you purchase one, withhold your fb cause they hound you to leave it as quickly as possible.
Yes and working good
It's not what I espected
One possibility is, if you've previously paired it with other Bluetooth devices, it may be trying to pair with something else if Bluetooth is still active on those devices. Try turning Bluetooth off on any other nearby device(s).
is excellent, conference like quality
Yes, as long as the phone that you want to record is connected to it, if u have cordless it won't record multiple phone, like one corded and one cordless.
yes, it works well. I use it in my office [chiropractor] and every patient I see signs in using it. I have 2 and work well, constructed well and no problems.
No, it did not come with speakers.
No audio out on the TV so so how does Phil and Rodney overcome that?
There is no audio out on this television. You would have to connect the HDMI chord to a receiver and then the receiver to the tv.
Yes, it fits perfectly. It will fit most cameras because of the vertical adjustments, horizontal adjustments, and forward/backward adjustments that can be made.
They stay put inside quite comfortably
Yes there much smaller and fit in the ear better and pack a solid punch
Not sure, it is of lesser quality than I expected. Sound system wouldn't be very good for recording if it did have the option. It is more for juvenile use where they don't care how it sounds.
It is always red
Haven't experienced this. Sounds like an issue with the battery. Have you checked/reseated it inside the controller? Does this happen with both batteries? Beyond that, contact the manufacturer (Energizer).
I have a 5D so I'm not sure, but the Fotga is adjustable. You can slide the focus ring to suit the lens, then lock it in place. I can't see why it wouldn't work.
You do get a gear ring. It's similar to or the same as the FOTGA DP-500 II Flexible Gear Belt Ring.
1st question: I paired it with it plugged in, so I think it is fine when plugged in. 2nd question: I don't know. I didn't keep it long enough to find out. 3rd question: it did not automatically re-pair when I turned on my computer. I had to manually re-pair it each time. I returned it. 4th question: I would. Having to manually re-pair the Bluetooth connection each time I turned on my computer was very troublesome to me.
I am using mine (the orange version) with Windows 8.1 and it works very well. Instantly found it when paring and connects right away when turned on. No noticeable lag after it sitting for a while either.
This mouse has a battery so no problems
I am using mine (the orange version) with Windows 8.1 and it works very well. Instantly found it when paring and connects right away when turned on. No noticeable lag after it sitting for a while either.
Yes, it should work. Make sure you have at least a 500w power supply and the room for it.
Yes it will work But it doesn't display in MPH only KPH everything comes out in metric
Hi, Thanks for your inquiry. Yes we do. Please click on the link for that. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ECHPWBE Fraidy
It's a bluetooth adapter for your cellphone. Basically, you snap this adapter in, turn your bluetooth option "on" in your cell. There's a code that comes with this adapter and a short set of instructions. Very easy to install. Once completed it allows you to talk on your phone through the car's stereo system. The microphone is on the dash to the right of the steering wheel in my car.
No
Hi, Sorry that right now we don't ship to international address but we estimate the shipping will be $120- $150 by UPS. The maximum GPU spec for MSI GE Series is GTX765M. If you need GTX770M, you have to choose GT Series.
Yup! Exactly why I bought this laptop
This a 3G, you have to program it to pickup the 3G.
It appears that the $159.99 is the MSRP (manufacturer's suggested retail price) and that Newegg was running a promotion at the time that you asked the question.
Yes
I would think they can be charged together. The mAh value simply is an indication of the length of time the battery will operate. It has nothing to do with out put current or voltage. The 2300 may take a bit longer to charge than the 2000, but I cannot say for sure that would be the case. I would put the 2000's together and the 2300's together. Don't put one size next to the other size.
They will only draw what is needed to run the computer and because they are 80+ gold rated they are extremely efficient compared to other power supplies. I have an RM850 in my system that it hooked up to watt meter on the wall outlet and at idle the computer only uses 45watts from the wall outlet.
It will fit with no issues. as a matter of fact, it should fit in most mid towers with no iissues.
This PSU has the standard bolt pattern, so if your case supports mounting either way then yes. You should consider that the fan is on the top, so if you are going to mount upside down then your case should have proper ventilation for the fan.
There shouldn't be any reason why not...that's a pretty hefty PS, no matter what you're running...your motherboard and video card are going to have more impact on which PS you get than your processor though...
Yes, it comes with 4 pin molex.
I use the R7 260, and I'm in the acceptable range of power. I don't know much about the R9 295X2, but after looking at the specs for it, this PSU can require 500 W. Depending on the other elements of your computer and their power requirement, you will want to make sure that you are within a plus/minus 70-80% range of the 1000 W this PSU can supply. In other words, make sure your total power requirement from all of your devices is within 700-800 W.
No, these transformers are not designed to work with American 220V products.
NO, same as other lens.
Dual and it sucks dont buy it
I Do Know No
These will work with your IPod without issue.
Yes, it will. This has a single 45-Degree, Gold-Plated 3.5-mm Jack just like the Kindle Fire. So, it should work fine.
15 degrees Fahrenheit to 150 degrees Fahrenheit. Since you are using this in your car you shouldn't have a problem operating this camera, since I'm sure your A|C will be on if the temp is 120 outside. Hope that helps
You have to purchase a separate SDHC memory card to insert into the device in order to record. Once footage is recorded, you then insert the same card into your computer to import the files created.
WIN 8.
No i doesnt
there is one plug in and then two USB ports. So I pulled in my laptop and used my USB to charge my cell phone and my ipod at the same time.
We are lying Were not the same goods that you sent me And I want to communicate with you
From my experience, yes.
If it's an android capable app, I am sure it would. BUT, mine arrived DOA, so I couldn't say for sure.
I have used this with a Nikon D-200. Do not know if it is compatible with the Sony.
This camera does not have detachable lens, as far as I can tell the lens is fixed, sorry.
I own both. Bought one of first 18-200s made in Japan to go with my first dslr: D50 that I got for a trip to the Bahamas. Have wonderful images I still enjoy. Now have lightweight D5000 and super D7000. Bought 18-140 for light weight to hike w/D5000. Use 28-200 w/D7000 otherwise. Both focus quickly, iq is similar. Both have VR but 200 has active mode for shooting while moving, which I love. So 140 wins on weight, price, while 200 adds focal length and versatile VR.
Yes. I recently purchased this flash for my d40 and it works quite well. Far superior to the stock camera flash. Cheers
Yes, according to the manufacturers information there are different speeds. 1/1600-1 sec. (when ISO sensitivity set to Auto). 1/4000 sec. (maximum speed during high-speed continuous shooting). 4 sec. (when scene mode is set to Fireworks show).
I charge mine with the USB cable supplied with it connected to my computer. I haven't had a chance to use it more than 30 minutes so far in short films of 3-10 minutes apiece. I also have a car charger with two USB plugs that I used once and it takes a while to charge either way.
Yes
it is only wireless. but it is a great deal
Go back to sellers ..,
Head phones work great. I bought a pair from dollar general for ten dollars and they work great.
When you press the power on button, you should see a blue light on the front. If not, the unit is either not charged or dead. Make sure when charging that all the plugs are in tight and in all the way. Then you need to connect using the included audio cable or pair with blue tooth. Follow the directions for pairing.
Mine broken always and I found a cheap 9v charger at Walmart in electronics and it works fine
I'm sorry but I can't answer. This speaker is the only one I have. :-)
it came with a power cord to charge it, that's all.
Hello. View of the camera is a multi-language support. Manual is Japanese. Manual can be replaced. &#65321; need to ask a Nikon there is a stock of English. In that case, it is necessary to send to Nikon a Japanese manual. So, the shipment of the product is delayed. Or, you can download from the website. It seems there is still no current S6600. https://support.nikonusa.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/13948 Thank you.
Yes it's full 4k. They have a formula they base these numbers off of. Here is what I got off wiki. 2160p is an alternative name for 4K UHD, a resolution supported by UHDTV products and which offers four times the definition of 1080p.[1] The number 2160 stands for 2,160 lines of vertical display resolution, while the letter p stands for progressive scan or non-interlaced. In a progressive image, the lines of resolution of the image go from the top of the screen to the bottom.[2] The only planned higher definition format for television is 8K UHD.[3]
The main reason I got this is because I didn't want to have to deal with Apple and their 'exclusive' itunes. I had my library set up in Windows Media Player, so it is nice this device works with it. I'd say it is a great alternative to the ipod. Only problem I've ever had was after 6 years the headphone jack wore out.
If you can get the music into windows media player then yes it will work.
You are correct, there most definitely is a volume control. On the center dial, there are up and down arrows, they control the volume.
absolutely you can. I plug it into our 2011 fx-35 w/the red/yellow/white audio cable. consult your owners manual for the proper hookup tho.
There built in buddy
Yes it does
No case too big
All radios have a removable belt clip.
They will work out of the box. But for full functionality you would need a programming cable and relevant software. Well worth getting if only for the voice scrambling facility. Great Radios
There is a small piece of plastic across the power input terminals under the battery. This must be removed for operation.
Hi ,please let me inform you that it doesn't include the programming cable.If you need it,here below is the link for your reference http://www.amazon.com/Christmas-Original-Programming-BAOFENG-QUANSHENG/dp/B00FS8SSPS/ref=sr_1_1?m=AJFR970E0U757&s=merchant-items&ie=UTF8&qid=1388727489&sr=1-1&keywords=B00FS8SSPS Then,if you need the software,please contact us freely,we will email the software to you.
Before you buy this remote read careful the support in your TV , go to setup and read for remote control because every LG smart TV model differe
Yes, you can do that
Try restarting your computer with the usb plugged in. And if it does not work check your desktop for an icon of the keychain and double click on that. However if it doesn't work don't just unplug your device from the computer it could damage it. Go to "File" and look for an option that says "eject" and click that. I apologize if that is obvious to you but, I mention it just in case
Only if your model came with a Blu-ray player, most only come with a DVD/CD player. If you look at the player itself, if there is a Blu-ray symbol there, than it does Blu-ray movies, otherwise it does not.
My experience is that the USB is only used to POWER the device, not to actually transfer music data. To hear the music you have to use the headphone port on the opposite side and plug THAT into a "line in" on the car stereo. If you don't have a "line in" on your stereo, this product is probably not for you. Cheers.
No it doesn't, but turns off with car is off and on when u turn it the car on. Best thing is auto connects to ur device
It does auto connect each time I turn the truck on. My truck can handle phone audio already, so that's already paired up. I only see media audio as an option in the settings.
Yes any of the go pros will mount
Yes as long as you have a way to fly up there and adjust it manually. Lol No, this dji doesn't have an automated camera rig. Buy the new version or buy a rig.
I have not. I think it would be a great option.
I purchased a 120 inch portable screen for 200 bucks! It folds up into a travel case that is about 3ft. long and weighs about 30 lbs. I love it! Bought it here on Amazon as well. It does work fairly well on a wall or a sheet. But the screen is Much better! Well worth the money!
Well, I tried it out in my bedroom but had to turn the lights off to see it clearly. And we have to wait until the sun goes down to use it outside. So I would say no.
I read a review where it said the S1 did not come with voice . The R1 I have, it will say bluetooth pairing pairing complete etc I love this device it works great with my note 2, my kids iPods, my wife's iPhone and my sons surface 2 tablet. only negative is everything on the vice says phone . I wish it would pair up as multiple devices with different names
I suspect not: nowhere does it list this as a feature - so I would be almost certain that it's for charging only. The USB port is noted as INPUT - and probably for power only. The rest of the input is just the A2DP Bluetooth stream.
No, it doesn't. It has the very basics. The headphone jack doesn't even work on mine...
It is the 4th, easy way to tell is the 4 in 4700MQ
It's Bluetooth, and has Mac keys, so I don't see why it wouldn't work.
It sure will. I've got this in mine right now, and it works very well. There's a video online on how to change out the HD: basically you just pop off the shiny black part of the PS4 cover, remove the playstation screw, slide the old drive out and remove the tray, then put it back together with the new drive. You need to reinstall the OS, which can be done by downloading the 1.5 update from playstation's website and placing it on a thumb USB drive. Use the instructions from here: http://us.playstation.com/support/systemupdates/ps4/pc_update/index.htm#installationSteps
Yes
He it is great
Couple of inches roughly
No, it's only designed for computers.
Hi Joe. Yes, this should work with any AC router even if it's from a different brand.
It start at the same spot you leave off at
It was in original packaging but I didn't pay enough attention to warranty. Didn't cost that much. It's a year old in the hands of a 6 yr old and still works.
Hi Thank you for your interest. Please check official specifications. I'm attaching the link. http://www.lg.com/us/commercial/lcd-computer-monitors/lg-29EB73-P/technical-specifications
There is no laptop slip. It does have a pouch for pencils. I have to put an organizer (pouch) inside to keep things in order.
We recommend installing on two studs for added safety. Depending on the weight of the TV, a single stud installation can provide adequate support.
HI, I used it on a 55" . If the rear mounts match it will work. With the question of weight ,there would be no problem. LEN
It depends on what you buy. You can buy 8.1 Pro in the first place, or you can buy upgrades. If you have Windows 8 already installed, you'll want to do the free Windows 8.1 update. Then you can go to the Microsoft store and do the Professional upgrade. You have two choices there. Buy the upgrade online, or if you've bought it elsewhere, you can just put in the license code.
if you bought it from a third party vendor and not from Microsoft Store , you can forget about it . I had a similar experience , I got the key from 3rd party Microsoft partner . They don't respond to mails or have any help desk , after MS r contacting MS , they said they cant do anything either and suck it up ! MS can only track if it was purchased from their store .
Only if you have three different activation codes
Lights just go straight to a battery but you will want to have them on a switch so you can turn them off
Well, If you would like to blow it up, then sure, but that might be the better choice anyway. I returned this item because it was hideously outdated, low resolution, and tragically slow. But plug it in, could be fun. Kaboom.
The case does not cover any useable portion of the screen. There is enough of a lip that it stays on. The case won't stand up on its own but it can be leaned against something. The case material is not slippery so it won't slide.
Honestly dont take my advice because this is my experience , i like the screen and ever since i bought it i havent had any problems ive dropped my phone multiple times even in the bathroom i still use it my phones not dead . so i say its great
Yes, there's a flash included. :)
I don't know about L855, but it works in a Satellite C855.
Yes
This camera will work with Windows and USB 3.0 ports.
Yes
Yes...standard coaxal type cable/antenna input
I'm not sure if it's same problem I have. It drops off if on "mute" so I just turn the sound way down instead. I have to shut down the TV and the DishTV receiver for a few seconds then turn both back on. otherwise. The sound comes back on. I have been able to just power on the sound using the included remote.
No this is an active sound bar...you need no A/V receiver.
yes
Yes, it does. The qwerty keyboard is fully detachable blue tooth deal that can be charged. The buttons are a little 'punchy' (that's actually a good thing...), but some folks might be turned off by that. The case is all leather, too!!! Hope that helps, sweetie!!! ;-)
No it does not.
No it doesn't, it's sadly cheap. It probably was originally supposed to, but the magnets are so weak they don't really go anything. Sorry
on the top.
No, just one position. Sometimes I just prop something behind the screen if I need to adjust my view
Yes, perfectly.
No the iPad will not fit inside this case with another case on. When place in this case it slides in and is snug. I hope this helps.
Hello,the GPS is pre-installed US Maps well when we sell it on Amazon.com. If you want other countries' maps,we will send you links to update it,thanks for your attention.
Yes you can if your pc monitor has Hdmi input
It plays game apps very well. You can also buy a Bluetooth game controller for it. As for game emulators is concerned, I don't know. I haven't used any on this device
No
Yes it does fit a mac book pro with the charger it will just be a little bulky
No, it will run xbmc out of the box.
You usually have an option for streaming, on TV and movies there are SD and HD (720) and some HD (1080) streams to pick from, If your TV will upscale SD and HD (720) to 1080p your good to go.
yes! I have an acer that size and it fits perfectly
Any camera with rca connection
I suppose it could depend on the airplane, but mine was full on a trip to Florida and back, and it fit under the seat in front of me without any problem.
Not easily, but possible if not too full
Yes it offers a system boost on it I recommend "Not" using it the boost reserves almost half the memory on flash drive. It does have 257gb out of boc
Open your battery compartment and on the inside it has your specs. If not go on apple.com support type in your serial number and it will give you the right specs.
it have 4BG memory
Yes, there is an HDMI port as well as VGA for connecting to another display
i have used up to a 32 gb in mine
I have installed the unit in my 1992 GMC Sierra an I have absolutely no problem controlling my steering wheel. The only problem I have is that the remote is not working.
A bunch of typical bloatware I removed in the first 10 minutes of using the laptop.
No you beed word/office 2013 package 219.95
No, that is only with their online subscription.
Yeah, the stereo face detaches.
I have been using ota with my Tivo units for several years. The reception is incredible! Living the the Dallas area, I get approximately 80 channels. And just like cable, we only watch 10 or so. However, my free HD programming looks as good, if not better than my old Directv.
if there is a hole in the side, the only thing that I can think of is that that space is intended for one of the buttons to control the camera and it possibly broke in transit or prior to shipment? If it is in fact the waterproof housing that your link which you provided in your question pointed to, there's definitely something wrong.
Only hero 3 and hero 3+
Yes, it is a protective case.
No
Please read the EXACT description for this monitor it answers your question.
I'm not sure when I tried to use it on my phone it made my phone freeze I couldn't even get into my setting on my phone it deleted everything on my sd card also
I had the same concern when I bought the case. It exceeded my expectations on cable management. There are definitely better cases if that's what you're concerned about, but there is plenty of room for wiring if you take the time to make sure everything is organized.
Any motherboard that is an ATX or Micro ATX will fit. The motherboard you are looking at should say what its "form factor" is. If its one of those two it will fit just fine. If you can't find the form factor for the board send me a link to it and I'll find out.
yes http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c03830368&cc=us&dlc=en&lc=en
Yes... And, this is easily accessible, all you have to do is unscrew one screw at the bottom of your laptop and, vola, every component that you can change is there, including the 2 full size hard disk bays.
No, you need the YWA-10 Wi-Fi adapter, and if you want Bluetooth connection you need the YBA-11 Bluetooth wireless adapter.
Thanks for your question. We currently do not ship internationally. The manufacturers that we represent only allow us to sell their products within the continental USA. I'm very sorry.
Is very good. Nice...
I have this port and is working fine. Try doing what this website https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200553 That will help you
From the ball
It's difficult. You must exit the game. The clock will appear. Then you start playing again. When the NEO finds the course, you must manually move up to the hole you are on.
Yes, it comes with a battery charger.
Hello, the optical design has been improved, as well as the coatings. The STM focusing motor, primarily an advantage for video, can also result in more accurate focus for still images, so I would say yes, but not a huge improvement. Thanks, and let us know if you have any other questions.
The STM is more of a quit zoom. Good on video. Both aren't bad.
Yes...it works on several models of Samsung Televisions...it will work on your model also.
It's just a remote... You can watch Netflix on your tv or streaming device.
I don't have the same model number TV that you do. However if I was betting on it, I would say it works. They probably don't change the codes that much except when adding new features. It works fine on my TV. Price was right. Only complaint and it is a small one is that the buttons could be a little better
The camera comes with NO memory card, and nothing on the webpage indicates that (unlike other online retail sites).
No, they would turn out very blurry. That's one of the big reasons why I returned it the next day! I have a very active 4 yr old and it couldn't capture his spontaneous movements. So I went back to the Casio Exilim which can!
This lens is compatible with the Canon EOS Rebel T5i.
No. No image stabilization.
Thank you for your inquiry. In regards to your question, yes, this is compatible with the Canon EOS 70D. If you have any additional questions or concerns please feel free to contact us directly at 800-991-3350.
3w.You needn't need any licence .Because that the frequency is legal
no clue
You'll need a Spanish keyboard. They key caps are just that, the keys you press, not the switch or the coding that registers the correct accent. If your looking for Spanish/accented key caps, you may want to look for a custom key cap set. WASD keyboards is one such company.
Contents include: a3000 camera with 18mm-55mm lens with cover, fisheye lens attachment, shoulder strap, battery and charger(usb cord & charge block), and documents.
Yes and iPhone as well.
Yes! But this is the old model. You want the new one. This only does 10 pics. New model claims to do 30. (A little less actually). They're not that much different in price so don't buy this one unless you get a deep discount. Edit: It's actually about 30-40 dollars cheaper than the new model with larger capacity now. So just decide which one you want.
Small they are 2x3
I do not know, I have a 4! I do know that I like mine a lot. The battery lasts a long time and although it makes the whole thing a bit heavy, it works great. The keyboard is very tactile and you can type quickly with out getting off track.
Sorry I have never tried.
the keyboard has to be turned on and connected to your tablet with Bluetooth. This is an indication that your hooked up. It must be ready to go, when you start typing the backlight comes on the top of the keys when you stop typing the light goes off in about 2 sec. If your not connected with Bluetooth,the keyboard doesn't light up at all.
It does not have a delete key. I just use the backspace key for typing errors. for my use of email and net surfing I haven't needed anything else. I did read somewhere there was a function but i dont know how to access it
Yes you can. I am currently using it with a MAC and a KINDLE FIRE HDX. You just pair it with the device before use using he Bluetooth utility. Takes about a minute or so
I returned this unit because it did not work properly. So, I cannot answer your question.
No, for charging only.
yes. I have used it in this fashion to recharge a LED light display.
mine came with a charger when I bought it and it also charges USB. mine had constant issues and I couldn't get firmware updates. hope yours does it better
512 MB RAM. Internal storage is 4GB
Yes. The power adaptor input voltage range is 100-240V.
I have this on a Mac Mini running Mavericks and it works great. You definitely need a powered USB hub with the Mac. I have three USB hubs on my Mac Mini and this one works the best by far.
Different design, different size and different sensor and chips. Please contact our customer services team with your require, we will recommend one for you.
Approximately 3"X2"X1". And it is powered so add another 1/4" for the plug sticking out of the side, then the wire.
Don't know why. I bought 2, both work with CF cards for me.
Really, any of the current internal offerings by Seagate that are heavily discounted both on here and new egg would be more than suitable. I would suggest a model with at least 7,200 rpm disc speed for a smoother transfer experience. This docking station is amazing for the record. It's been my fave gadget buy of the year so far. Hope this helps, Robert
My AC adapter says "INPUT: 100V-240V~". "50/60hz 0.8A Max" "OUTPUT:12V---2A". Hope that helps.
You should be able to.
Y would u ask that question???!! To waste people's time?
yes, It has AirPin service that supports AirPlay.
Yes,it comes with US plug.
This for over air digital converter only and will not work with scrambled cable signals
if you put the TW cable to the in of dig. Tuner box and the out of this to the tv this should play and record what goes in it
Dear friend, Thank you for your questions. Please note that the camera is wireless, there is a External antenna along with the camera. Any questions, please feel free to contact with me. Best regards!
Not sure of exact measurement - got it for the iPhone with a heavier case and it fits perfectly. hope this helps
it does have a anti glare. It also has air bubbles that are hard to get rid of but that is a minor problem. I like it because it leaves no finger prints on touch screen.
No it does not block emf radiation. You can cut it and you can remove it for another laptop. I would not recommend cutting it. The edges will no longer be flat enough for you after cutting it and it will tend to peel from the cut/altered edges.
there was a T mount camera adapter
No you need the adapter for the lens to the camera
I dont know. It does not work with my D600.
Yes it has the same mount as those tripod The other part is jus a go pro attachment
You will need an external cd/dvd drive. There is not an internal one in this model.
No. You have to buy Microsoft Office2013 or you can buy Word and Excel individually, I think.
I've used it exactly that way and it was terrific. The microphone picked up everyone around a table set for eight.
Yes
Bose Mini by far. Amazon one is not nearly as loud and does not have half the bass. It's also more than 1/2 the price so you get what you pay for. It's great for audiobooks.
no, it doesnt. comes in a box
Eyez on has the envisalink3 and u hook it up to your router then u can monitor your system and turn it on and off from anywhere in the world setup is pretty basic
It is calculated by weight, instead of the number of shipment.
I'm not really sure. But my HD 500gb, it's working very well + slim + nice design. I Recommend!!!
Yes you can by both. But you don't need to connect Minix with computer if you have home wifi.
32G
Yes and no. There are leg "extenders" which increase the height of the unit. They were in place when my unit was received. If they are removed, the bottom of the unit sits about ' above whatever surface it is placed upon. Also, there are two down-firing subwoofers in the bottom of this unit, so placing it flat on top of anything would (my opinion) attenuate the bass severely.
If you go to this link. http://www.evga.com/Products/ProductList.aspx?type=0&family=GeForce+700+Series+Family&chipset=GTX+770 it lists all the 770's in order of speed & memory, starting with their water cooled Classified Hydro Copper. Then the regular Classified. Then FTW. The EVGA GTX Dual SC is the best of the 2 GB Cards, but is slower than the FTW out of the box.
I use the Seasonic Power Supply M12II 850AM ATX12V 850W
I think like 6-8 hours
I contacted them and they sent me out another pair
I think I have a backup, but I have to find it.
More storage is always preferred so I'd go with both drives (SSD with the OS so everything is faster and hybrid as a secondary for downloads). An SSD will usually cost more per GB than a hybrid drive but SSD is faster, quiter, more reliable, and less susceptible to damage since there's no moving parts. You can check reviews for the different drives on sites like www.cnet.com to get in-depth information including pros/cons. I have Windows 7 running on the 1GB hybrid drive and it's great!
You can download the spec sheet for this drive from Seagate at http://www.seagate.com/www-content/product-content/barracuda-fam/desktop-sshd/en-us/docs/desktop-sshd-data-sheet-ds1788-2-1308us.pdf PDF details show NAND Type/Size: MLC/8GB; DRAM Cache (MB): 64.
The D2 definitely gives you the bang for the absolute best price. It sounds clean and Im completely satisfied with mine thus far.
Yes, this player is region free and plays both DVDs and Blu-ray discs from any country. You don't have to make or change any settings. You simply insert the disc from any country and it will play the dvds or discs from any country on any TV.
I do not think so. I think this is for DVDs only.
No I did not received a HDMI cable with my order.
Yes I really like the speakers great quality and no wires going to the back of the room is nice
Model#: HT-9730W Model Code: HT-9730WZA Info taken off the back of the 3D Blu Ray Player.
The Ipad mini fits exactly in the sleeve of the device with a magnetic latch. It holds it very securely
Yes, the HR1 Hub can be used with the 256GB storage drive. There are several articles online about this and the two are also sold as a kit online.
It's fine on its own.
Yes.
When you close the case it goes to sleep and wakes up when opened.
Not on Belkin's website.
It just depends on what you're shooting. You tube has some great explainer videos.
it is the same size as the 5100 full kit. but as you know it only contains the 5100 body. ; (
They work VERY well with the BenQ W1070 - and it has nearly identical optical engines - so I do not see why not.
These glasses can work with any display that can use the DLP Link syncing protocol. The page for that projector does say it can use DLP link it may be a menu setting to turn it on or to select that option.
Gateway NE52207u, has Wi-Fi Enabled. *Wireless Technology: Wi-Fi Enabled, Bluetooth 4.0. *Wireless Standard: IEEE 802.11b/g/n.
It doesn't play cassettes in the unit, but it has an input jack and a short connection cable. That can be hooked up to any device with a headphone output. So it can act as a portable speaker for cell phones, MP3 players, laptops etc. That works very well.
This radio take micro SD card , if you have a micro SD card, insert it to your computer, you may need a adaptor to do it , and then, copy music to the card. Then insert the card to your M8 radio, then set the mode to MP3 player on the radio, it will automatically find the music and play it.
Sorry that it only has white color Kind Regards
Camera comes with a pigtail with ethernet port and DC connection
I am not sure what an iPad mini 2 is. But this fits the new iPad mini. It fits models: A1489, A1490, A1432, A1454, & A1455. Just look at the back of your iPad and look at the model. or check apples website http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5452
Yes you can charge it while playing music
Its removable and Bluetooth so no need for wires
Tried my 4.0 usb on my Canon 5Dmkii and it didn't fit. This leads me to believe that the harinezumi 4.0 uses either a five or seven pin micro usb to four pin standard. Something an older cell phone would use for charging. SuperHeadz has always been great to me with customer support. Shoot 'em an email. headzshop@powershovel.co.jp
It does not have camera inputs on the back , you will need to get a separate PoE network switch to connect the cameras to it, once the cameras are up, you can do a camera scan on the NVR menu to find and add the cameras
Yes it is Pair of Speakers.
Yes. They are big speakers but that weight is for the pair so it really isn't that outlandish when you consider what you're getting.
The one I received did include a case but I returned the product because it was defective. It was a reconditioned unit.
I have a slightly different model laptop. Here's how you can get the info you want. Download Speccy from www.piriform.com. It's free. Just watch your installation and make sure you don't accept the Google toolbar side load. It will tell you what your drive model and mfg. are. (And a whole lot more)
Yes, they are see-thru. On another note, you are not able to remove or add pages to the binder. They are permanently attached to the binder. I have another one that is a 3-ring binder style in which you can add more pages, but this one is not like that. But still, it is a good product and I am happy with mine. Not sure what Olde Timer is referring to about removing a small piece at top of each pocket. Mine was not like that.
I dnt no but I can tell u if show damn good better den most indash DVD players I seen dat 200 to 300 dollars more den da boss indash DVD
It should work on most modern AMD motherboards, provided that the motherboard has a free PCI express x1 slot. Note that this card will work on PCI express x4 / x8 / x16 slots as well. Plugging this into an x16 slot that is meant for a second graphics card may interfere with a primary graphics card connected to PCI express, as it may take lanes away from it (i.e. most motherboards will operate both x16 slots at x8 speed if they're both populated).
Yes. See for instance http://normcf.net/~john/chromebook/Acer/acerC7ChromebookUpgrade.html . I'll note that the Acer C710 is getting a bit old. Consider the C720 or CB3, which are other inexpensive Acer Chromebooks which may have better specs.
Yes it does.
This does not have bluetooth.
This laptop does not include an optical drive.
really... the item is a ipad cover.
screen icons yes also easy +/- buttons on keyboard and a mute button.
Yes, you can dual boot with almost any system. I currently do this very same thing.
It has a power cord that's plugged into the wall.
You are correct - it goes into Sleep Mode when closed and wakes up when opened.
No. The case is fine, except for being a bit flimsy but most importantly for me the stand part does not allow the iPad to actually stand. If you move just a bit while holding it the iPad flops down. I hope that helps. There is not much out there right now for the iPad air. I am not sure why but it is most frustrating.
works perfect with windows 8.1
Yes it can. It is rather sturdy. I hope my answer was helpful.
It uses batteries, so there is no wait time.
The keyboard take two 3A batteries. Change them out as needed.
Yes, it has an internal web server. There is an app available to access it, just scan the QR code on the box and access it from anywhere. Poor documentation, since it is made in china. Had to do my own research to figure it out.
Yes
Yes you can
Yes it is for Windows 8. It has a Windows 8 button. Works perfect.
Yes it does.
I think it should cause it fits most s8555
It can only be used over the ear, the buds are heavy you can not use it any other way, it will fall off, it is very comfortable over the ears and stays there during workout activities.
China
This is a personal preference, but I like the memory foam tip.
I do not know... I bought two pairs and they both lost volume on side in just a few months. So forget about what the ohms are ... Save your money ..
This does not have battery backup and there is no way to hook it up as this unit has an AC motor. If you want battery backup then you want to look at the 8550 belt drive or an 8360 chain drive. The chamberlain WD962KEV is the full equivalent to the 8550 and comes with a replacement rail assembly. None of the LiftMaster units on Amazon come with the rail assembly.
The old belt drive rail will work ANC it doesn't come with a new belt it comes with replacement safety sensors, door bracket, curved door arm, user guide, motor unit, (1) 3-button remote, and one wall control (it must be used as the old wall controls and remotes won't work with the newer unit)
No,u have type in exactly ur model computer!!
I don't know
gostei do produto muito bom, recomendo, de bom acabamento e vale o preco que paguei
It is my understanding that all the Canon lenses for the DSLR cameras are interchangeable. I would contact Canon to make sure.
No its just a headset but I'm sure you can use it on a plane that requires only one input
Yes
4ft
They have a decent mic but not the best for chat
They are compatable using the auxillary cable provided. And they sound great!
The case can fit on the tablet backwards to cover the screen when it's not in use.
Yes
Yes it works with any phone just down load the app From from your smart phone and you pair it like a bluetooth
Did you go to the play store and down load the shutter ball AB you mite have to register your name ones is down load all you do is hit the ab and use your butter ball on the side booton
Save your money! Smart phone cycling maps are far superior in quality!
Hey. As per specification each of these beauties has a 250W power consumption. So it recommendable to get a 1200w or more PSU for three of this kind. You'll be more than well served with a 1600w PSU for a 3 WAY SLI. Cheers!. http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-780/specifications
Yes! Look this site; http://www.asus.com/ROG_ROG/Motherboards_Products/
Iphones are not compatible to use on obd2 Elm327.
Is there a specific reason you are asking? I'm sure as you know that each device has a unique MAC address and therefore sharing this information out (which i wouldn't recommend for any device) would be a possible security risk.
Yes it does it works on every model I've tried it on includding 1996 all the way to 2014 and the software that's included on the disk has way more than advertised its awesome
Neither the monitor bezel or the screen are glossy.
Yes
Yes, it supports VESA 100mm spaced mounting
Yes
Mine does but its not as bad as my old LCD was. Its mostly in the bottom corners and almost nonexistence at the top
looks like they're abt 6'
yes
ac511 soundbar i think. clips into botton of screen. it looks nice. i set up a bunch
It does. You will need an adapter. I have a MacBook Pro. Because the MacBook Pro has a thunderbolt input, I bought a mini-display port to display port adapter. The monitor plugs into the display port end, the mini-display port end plugs into the thunderbolt 2 input on the mac.
No, it does not come with a CPU fan and heat sink. When you're going to spend around $1K for this CPU, it's kind of expected that you'll be acquiring your own cooling solution to suit your needs. I recommend liquid cooling. I'm using a Corsair H110i, which is more than adequate for my needs. Then again, I do not overclock. I can't tell you if a closed loop liquid cooling system, which the H100i is, can get the job done if you plan to overclock a Intel i7-4960X. By the way, this Intel i7-4960X is a sweet CPU.
Only if you turn and hold the case sideways, which I do not recommend as the iPad will fall out.
Yes...with multiple color choices (and a choice of level and off). Shows in the actual keys too when it's dark (not just around them),
Hi Charles it fits iPad air perfectly
Yes
I cannot answer, I returned it.
Yes
I have the WiFi version & it's a perfect fit. If it is bigger than I wouldn't take the chance.... But it's a great case...
Yes much more protection
Hello Gina, no it is only one piece. Only the rubber part. Please note that this cover is thick around the edges to act as a bump for falls. It is not so convenient if your tab is not so prone to falls, or mishandling.
I honestly don't know for sure, as I have never seen a Polaroid 8 inch tablet, but I doubt it. I can definitely say it will fits the 8 inch Galaxy Tab3, and that is what it is specifying.
Yes, you can remotely access the recording on Micro SD card via your smartphone. The prerecord time is 3-10 seconds. You can download the recording to your PC
Yes they alla turn the same color
I have a 13 inch, and there's plenty of room for another couple of inches of laptop.
No special or padded laptop sleeve, just one big compartment. Yes, its big enough for 14" laptop, but no protection.
With the new GUI, it is now required. You can access it with FF, but the streams don't work right- or at all depending on settings and version. Chrome, on the hand, works perfectly. I wouldn't let the need for chrome deter your interest in this NVR- they really work awesome!
Yes, you can set it up in either orientation.
I can't speak to what your preferences are with a tablet but I work on very large artwork myself and even so, the small tablet is what I prefer, anything larger would be cumbersome.
It will definitely project on the computer in real time, meaning what you draw on the tablet will appear on the computer at the same time, but all you see on the tablet is you holding a pen scribbling on a black pad. The one where you can see your drawing on the computer AND the tablet AT THE SAME TIME, is the Wacom Cintiq (sorry for the inappropriate CAPS LOCK, it's just for emphasizing)
The cable for charging my wireless headphones can also be used for this product, so there is hope. Also, it is possible to buy a "USB extender" that couples one USB to another. This is probably a better bet, as you could use it to extend a different cable. For example, for five dollar's there's an Amazon Basics USB male-to-female 3-feet extender. For another dollar or two, you can extend 9 feet.
well my last tablet, a bamboo didn't have a eraser either and I've gotten use to programming one of the buttons on the pen to erase. I've had CTL480 for about a week now and it's working great for me. I use it for drawing and animation.
Yes to all. It's got everything you need to start using immediately. It's an excellent product which I've used over many years.
I chose to get the smallest size because of desk space in my cramped office and limited budget. I'm actually using it right now. I found I adapted to the smaller pad size really well and can draw freely. So I don't find it an issue at all.
Thanks for contacting us, the original launch IV is wire connectivity. thanks.
YES, IT WORKS WITH YOUR WIFI.
Don't know much about it ,bought my sister one.buy it.
No
The refresh rate is 60Hz.
one AA battery
My answer is yes. This case fits my AKG 551's with room to spare! This case is perfect for your 7XX. I say, go for it.
Both charging plugs charges batterys perfectly
I can't remember. If there were games, they're gone now. Try some wheezy/squeeze forums.
I don't think so.
We use it on our iPad mini.
I bieve do. Aren't they the same size ? It's a really good strap. If it doesn't fit you can return it no problem. I have a handicap brother who uses his iPad for speech and the strap allows him to go thru his day and not lay it down. He has the griffin survivor on his iPad.
The 18-105 is definitely the sharper lens. In my opinion, even at F4 throughout the entire range, you get amazing results. The 18-200, like most zooms, you have to really stop it down some to get the best results and the telephoto ends tends to get soft focus. It's a good all-in-one but definitely can notice the difference in performance and image quality especially in lower light situations.
Yes
No, we cannot fit legal pad and standard file into it. Outside, the bag looks big, but inside the pocket pinched at both ends is tiny. The legal pad length is 29.7 cm,the Width is 22 cm. The file is 9x11.5 inches. far exceed the Length and width of this bag. Inside the mouth is very small. The height is also shrinks by the cover and the up bottom./.
Bag has 4 inside pockets including phone pocket. Great bag.
Yes
It's a Mans saddle bag.
yes
Yes, it comes with a lens cap.
The "Dual" has a dual BIOS setup so that you may have one BIOS with regular GPU settings and can afford to overclock your 2nd BIOS without fear of "bricking" the GPU. Can alternate between both BIOS with a switch located on the card itself.
Hi there, You can definitely play Netflix without upgrade. Haven't tried the Amazon Prime video though. To upgrade it, you will have to download the new firmware at the Tronsmart official website (http://www.tronsmart.com/download - you can find instruction on how to do that here as well). Hope that helps.
No, it is not what I would call a TV set-top box. It's about half the size of an Apple TV box and very plain looking.
Nope. It needs 5V 2000mA. TV USB ports are just mean for powering USB sticks. So it will not support the power rating required. Same is true for self powered USB drive of large size (1TB). They do not work on USB port. But you can connect them to a powered USB hub and connect that to TV. That should probably work.
Western Digital claims the only difference between the Slim and the Ultra is the outer case shape/size and the capacity options (the Ultra being available in everything from 500 GB to 2 TB while the Slim only comes in 1 TB and 2 TB).
no
It should. It being USB, it should pick up it's own sound. Just like my USB monitors.
Great! I was afraid it was gonna be bad during the day but let me tell you is great!
The 3 colors are Tan, Grey and Black
Black, beige and grey
bulbs for the epson are only 100$ and no rainbow effect with lcd BAM
Yes you can, the installation file is available at http://download.cnet.com/Bitdefender-Antivirus-Plus-2015/3000-2239_4-10537298.html
You can activate it anywhere, No CD needed, just the code. And it will update until the subscription expires.
Mine did. You would need to contact individual sellers to find out if they have the original packaging.
Needs blue tooth and a usb port.
Look at the third bay from the top... Anything in there? Look at the Amazon pictures #2 and 5... the last one now deleted by amazon. Did you search google? Every review says the USM, and UPS battery is a great feature. I think I figured this is ASUS trying to set their product aside with a graet invention... And then pulling the plug to trim cost. If you don't know what a USM is, or have no idea what the battery thing is... Go back to sleep and enjoy your computer.
There is HDMI amd DVI
It's got a 500W power supply, and yes, it does have an internal wireless adapter.
It does give you the option to install the software on a usb jump drive. I do not know if you can install it on an android tablet.
No Majid. The license " in the small print states that three individual license all starting from the time you activate the first product key". You can not bank the individual to one product key.
yes. A wired keyboard and wired mouse
350W peak. Source: http://www.asus.com/Desktops/M11BB/#specifications
There is a switch on the back of the power supply for either 115 or 230. The power supply lists 110-120V and 220-240V
IT COMES WITH KEYBOARD AND MOUSE - NO MONITER
300 W. don't know if upgradeable.
http://www.asus.com/my/Desktops/M11AD#specifications
It should work.
It should, if you scroll down on the info page on Amazon for this product states it does not work on Kindle, Nook, Motorola Xoom and the Blackberry Playbook.
Any part in the world
The ports are in the back covered by a snap-on rubber cover. This is some protection from reasonable water/rain exposure. However I would not consider it water-proof and could be breached in excessive conditions. I advise the water-proof dive case and remote for extreme wet conditions.
Not well. The camera seems to be ideal for bright environments. I tried to capture some low-light under-water scenes and the camera recorded just black.
Yes. I recorded time lapse video with the Virb plugged in for almost 24 hours. It will work, but the waterproof cover over the USB plug will be open.
absolutely ... you can create any documents, graphics, fliers, brochures, posters, etc using any graphics as well as alphanumeric text from many formats (psp, psd, png, jpg, etc) and save the same. Suggestion: Save in 2 formats: (1) Save as .psd or .pspimage as your MASTER copy so that you are able to edit/revise if necessary. (2) For the copy that you are going to print, save as jpeg (jpg) or png. I usually save in png because the graphics/overall resolution is much crisper. End product is very professional! Good Luck! Hope this helps you! Gladi
I have used clips from youtube and unprotected homemade DVD's
I use it for a gopro hero3, I wouldn't recommend anything much heavier than that.
The product page here on amazon for a comparable unit by Newmowa DMW-BGGH3 Battery Grip Replacement claims it works for both GH3 & GH4.
Yes but opening it up breaks it. Stop you can't change anything in the inside without breaking the warranty
Absolutely. If I'm not mistaken, the stock psu is only 300 watts in the HP. Although, you may want to check to make sure it has the proper cables.
Yes, that is way too big - not sure where they are getting those specs even if they are including the cables? Anyway, I would look here for the actual size of the supply: http://www.evga.com/products/pdf/100-B1-0500-KR.pdf
RAM - yes CPU/GPU - no i7 - no 8g ram - yes wireless card? it already has one...
angela, i had the same problem. after two days the screen cracked. because i got an assurance when i purchased the item, i sent it to them. now they offer to pay me back so ... the item moved from 69 to 99, no more bluetooth, few gadgets purchased around, ... waste of money
No. They are spring loaded
Yes, it does, the speakers are really good also, and it DOES have a DVD ROM.
Yes this have a DVD & CD reader and burner!
I wish I could tell you more about those games specific BUT I can tell you it runs Sims 3, 7 Days to Die and WoW seamlessly. WoW can be played on Ultra with about 15 FPS outside of raid like settings. In raid you'd be looking at 3 - 6 FPS. Hope this helps.
Excellent.
The ether port the device is for online registration for the device. However, you still need the "air-port" app or the device you are trying to connect to can't see the usb hdd but will see the sd card only. There is are push-button power switch to power up your new device. There will one green and one blue led lights when powered up. Green is power and blue is for wireless transmitting. Please check out my other comments on this device and what it can do.
NO! Because the device is its own ADHOC Transmitter. With the "air-port" app on your chosen device and the wireless section enabled or turned on and your device set to scan for local wi-fi signal connect to it. However, you need to configure the wireless device first. I can see from the other comments that people do not understand how this device functions! I may have to make a how to video for this device..
No, we have not had any issues with our battery at all!
Technically yes it allows you to have the warmer on while charging but following best practices to extend the life of your battery it is not recommended to do so. Hope this helps =) ~Team Idylc Homes
I'm not sure, I'd say at most a pound or so, it's not a heavy bag by any means. Is totally worth it, I use it all the time to hold my laptop and gadgets when I travel.
no way...that is not true....this back back is light and very comfortable.
You cannot plug it into a wall outlet. It gets its power from a USB port. It should plug into an MP3 player though, as it has the same hook-up as speakers for your computer would have. The anwser from Renee says you can plug it into a wall outlet. I never received anything that would permit me to do that. ANYWAYS, I highly recommend these. They are pretty cool to show off to people who have never heard of them before.
No
Yes...a very small one
Take the batteries out of the receiver and sensor. Put the batteries back in the sensor, and face it away so it doesn't pick up anything, put the batteries in the receiver, then within 20 seconds, wave something in front of the sensor to trip it.
Yes
Yes, you can but you would have to keep the flap down.
I have the Surface RT, and it fits perfectly. Hope that helps
Bare wire, spade lugs [Vampire Wire makes a wide spectrum] or banana plugs [Monster makes a good heavy duty pair $20]. Wire? Go to REDCO.COM. You want oxygen free copper multi-strand cable. Mogami makes a great multi-strand cable 11/12 guage. In general, 10-16 guage multi strand oxygen free copper speaker wire will do the job.
Didn't try but the LS50 are 8 ohm, but Stereophile because of dips in the curve said 4 ohms would work good.
The device is not shipped with the leather case as show, however they do give you a free protective cover made out of silicone.
No I don't think it will. I had difficulty getting it to extend my Wifi. It's only as good as the signal it gets from the other router. I sent it back.
Correct. In combination with ASUS RT-AC66U (and other Asus routers I would suppose), the setup can be done wirelessly, too.
I plugged The Asus N600 into my oulet, pressed the wi-fi button on my router then pressed the wi-fi button on the nN600 an waited untill it found my home wi-fi. When it asked for my password (same as your home wi-fi password) I entered it and I was set. After that you cam move the N600 anywhere in your home. Hope this works for you.

The color accuracy seems good to me and it appears to have a similar viewing angle to my other IPS displays.
windows 8 but you get the option of upgrading it to 8.1 for free online
Bluetooth hasn't worked for me, and the brightness keys don't work. Everything else has been pretty solid.
The machine I received shipped with 8 and you then run the upgrade to 8.1 locally. Its a significant improvement. I can't say if the later released machines will ship with 8 or 8.1, but if you have a decent broadband connection you're fine.
This particular case is for the iPad 2 and up (larger models) - I would do a search and see if they make a separate model for the mini.
No it's does not. It only fits the ipad 1,2, and 3
Yes sound is good
No
If the antenna is outside the tin roof should have absolutely no effect on its operation. I'm fairly certain that it would work inside as well
The monitor is 14-3/4 inches wide.
This unit is built for output impedance 4-8 Ohm. By using 2 Ohm speakers you are risking to burn unit amplifier; this is not really high end equipment. This unit has RCA output and option to attach an amplifier; that would be better way to go.
Yes it changes most smart phones including Tablet PC, iPhone, Smartphone, USB Device
Thanks for your question. That's one of the ways it's designed to be used. It should sound marvelous that way.
Yes I am
Thanks for your question. The speaker comes with cables that are about 6' long. There is a device from Mass Fidelity called the Relay that will allow audio from your TV to be transmitted visa bluetooth to devices that can receive bluetooth audio signals. There isn't anything that will allow audio to be transmitted TO your TV via bluetooth. The Bostom soundbar is a wonderful sounding bar!
yes, 1.
Anti-glare
You can use "Fujifilm Instax Mini Instant Film" for this camera. Picture size: 62mm x 46mm Film size: 86mm x 54mm
I successfully upgraded mine with 2 x 8GB DDR3 PC3-12800 1600MHz 240 pin UDIMM (16gb total memory showing both in the BIOS and Windows 8.1). I believe the G3220 supports up to 32GB but it is likely with 4 x 8GB RAM and this desktop only has 2 slots.
Hi Trenton, The video is built onto the Intel motherboard. It is an Intel HD Graphics 4400.
WIFI worked seamlessly for me. I did nothing and it was running. But it is in the same room as the router.
included build in wireless
The Lenovo website says that this model ships with a wireless keyboard and mouse.
379.99 - 348 = 31.99. Not even close! You can't get better deals than Black Friday, next time go for it. Newegg has the same but with a keyboad and a mouse for 389.99 - 5% = 370.49 when using Coupon Code MBLCM10 from the mobile app. Hurry the deal ends tonight. -tBStar
The Generic DC Always will energize at least Two Times, Sometimes Three. I have been working on a project for almost 6 month's Getting the bugs out. I have also found that it will also pick up Heat Waves. I use mine out in the elements, in fields, & woods. On the edge of a field you can look across it in the hot part of the day & see Heat waves across the field. It will pick those up. Other than that, it works very well & have had no problems. Thanks Danny
I have no idea if you can! The one I order wasn't good after 15 mins. It would shut off. Picture is way to blurry I wished I would of just paid a couple of hundreds for better to best quality!
I purchased this and still cannot get it to work. It does not show up clear even at close range. The menu won't change even with the remote. I do not advise purchasing.
No, you can't. Sorry.
It should work, it says it works for both Mac and PC.So it should be universal for both machines.
I do believe it has a 90 day warranty, I looked for the paperwork on the purchase, but could not find it, hope this helps
I don't think so. It's only good for certain Turcom/Huion products
I don't think so - unless you can download compatible software to your kindle that the turcom uses to communicate with its pad.
No it won't. 2 different type of stylus technology.
zfs ecc ram 8 core avoton processor Just to name a few
On the side of the USB connector there is a dial which controls the intensity of the LEDs.
I have found that only the unit mounted on top of the camera will emit the af assist beam.
This is not the place to ask this - you should contact the seller instead.
You can hear the call fine but need to use the microphone on your phone. You dont have to the phone to your mouth.
Yes, it has the standard connector for PC or MP3 players.
one cord
No it doesn't. But it is a great laptop.
No it charges with a micro usb connection.
No.
It is great for travel but may be a bit bulky for school. I think you could find one better suited for that situation. That being said, I LOVE this backpack!
I have the laptop, did you get this backpack? if not what did you get and are you happy with it?
No. Max theoretical rate of HDMI 1.4 is 30Hz. Best most of us have seen is 18Hz. DVI & HDMI are interchangeable; I use a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI active adapter from my Macbook Air to the TCL 4K.
Unfortunately, this HDTV does not have H.265/HEVC decoder found on newer sets. However, you can pair XBR65/55x850A with Sony's new 4K Ultra HD Media Player (FMP-X10) which is compatible with Netflix 4K and will allow you to view same on your XBR55x850A. Note: FMP-X10 replaces Sony's first UHD media player (FMP-X1).
No. It's only 110 volts.
The curve doesn't really change things, but the S990a and the W850a are both excellent for gaming in terms of low-input lag.
Yes, I've had no issues with it since I installed.
Yes, work very good.
idk i use a software but i dont remember becuase its drained my cpu in my pc but i bought the elgato game capture device HD because i bought the easycap for gameplay but its a waste of time to buy the easycap for a gaming channel like me
it has hd intel graphic card
Yes perfect fit!!!
Average gaming mouse size. A tad on the larger size, but not overly large. works quite well with my large man hands.
short answer is no, not without modifying it.
Remove lens cover, it snaps off and you will find the clips for the batteries.
Yes
Yes, there is one PCIe-x16 slot available, which is what is recommended for the GTX 960.
Yes
Your best bet to determine compatibility is to disassemble your existing projector and confirm the DMD chip number. I did this, compared it to those listed on the DMD chip seller's Amazon page, and confirmed that it was an appropriate chip for my projector (Optoma HD66).
There are three Canon lenses that came with the kit ...75-300, 55-250 and the 50M are all Canon lenses....the telephoto and wide angle lenses are not Canon....the one lenses that you really need of the camera is the Canon 18-135M STM lense...I bought the 19-135M STM lense from another source for about $325.00 and ordered better filter made from glass and not plastic. Glass filters are much better in my opinion as you have good lenses with the camera....
Yes Diana. I have been using one now on my Pro 8 for several weeks. No problems. I am also using a Bluetooth 3 keyboard that also works fine with the HDE. I am sure the HDE will work well for you as well.
No it does not. I've never heard of that type of problem with any case. Bluetooth is a wireless signal,however some cases may interfere with the ability to plug something into the phone through openings in the case. However, on this particular case and phone no problems.
Yes, it will.
Yes. It came with its standard mini flash that is good for normal point and shoot. If you want more advance/professional flash, you have to purchase that separately. Hope the answer helps.
It's good for reading the devices plugged in - will not charge the tablet. Can charge a phone if plugged into this device and then into the tablet. (at least in my case, it charged a nexus 4 while plugged into the tablet). I wouldn't recommend unless your last resort, otherwise your tablet is then dead.
they are not Canon products. They are made by third party manufacturers.
It came with a 64GB card. When I get home from work I will check the speed rating of the card. I bought a 32GB card as a backup incase I needed more memory and I did not need it as the 64GB card did not fill up at 1400 images taken with the camera in RAW+ JPEGL format which is a real memory hog at ~40MB per image.
If it uses a usb port No the tablet doesn't have one!
no it does not fit
This does not work with the MacBook Pro. It was pretty laggy on Miracast capable devices as well when I tested it. I find it very deceptive when they say that it supports Airplay devices, when in actuality, it does not. In order for Airplay to work, you need a jailbroken iOS device. You'll be better off just paying a little more money and getting an Apple TV (around $99), which is what I'm going to do now. This product was a waste of money.
Yes it will.
No, the charger is included and charges the internal batteries by pressing the charge switch on the keypad. Manual does a good job describing this.
When the green flashing light is solid it is fully charged. It takes roughly 15-20 min for a full charge from 0 - 100, at least from my experience.
Please perform a soft reset without the microSD card in side. 1- Press and hold the power button for 20 seconds, then release. 2- Press power for 2 seconds to turn on. Nook Manual: http://img1.imagesbn.com/pimages/nook/nook07/mediakit/User_Guide_NOOK_HD_Plus_v7.pdf Also you can try, pressing power + "n" at the same time for 5 sec which should enable you to do a factory reset.
Yes.
Great Question! The phone and case have become warm when the phone is in heavy use. When I notice this, I close all the apps I'm not using but are still running in the background. And this begins to cool it down. Personally, I also use this as a sign that I've been on my phone for a bit too long, so I set it down. The phone and case cool down quite quickly when I take these steps.
shipping with amazon prime,the products are in US,no need so long time shipping.
your device need support 2.4GHz wireless,you can check it
no
There is no difference. For otterbox cases (for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2's) ... there are two truly different styles of protection ... the Defender (which you are interested in--and gives the most protection) and the Commuter series (which has a different case make up and does not include the holster). I actually have the Glacier (white/gray), the black/gray and the black/black .. they are all the same defenders.
Dust proof under normal conditions. No waterproof ... it has breather holes..
If you get the one for 5 Mini it will fit
I had the same issue
Avi
No
Yes
windows RT
No. I got this same tablet and the only thing that it came with was the tablet, a charger, and a few unhelpful booklets. Also the pictures show the tablet in a plastic bag (when it was in the box) and it does not come like that. It is just in the box with a piece of plastic (like a screen protector) on it.
yes
Yes it does full hdmi
Mine did not
Not sure on the warranty, but I have a 300W and It only need 50W.
HI - yes you can
Yes it should. I have tested it with Nexus 7 Android 4.3 Jellybean and Motorola Droid Ultra Android 4.4 Kitkat. If there is a wireless display option in your settings menu, it will most likely work.
No firmware update. No traceable company for support.
Have to be with in 12 feet and in clear view of the modem to use it. Periodically I have to restart wireless on the device to get reconnected. No issue's with generic laptop, galaxy tab or iPad.
A little, but it has great graphics and does not feel cheap like most tablets
Yes. When the two are together it works like a book and the iPad can flip around 180 degrees and lay on the keyboard. When you no longer want to use the keyboard it can be removed (just turn Bluetooth off - switch is on the keyboard) and you're ready to go. Just remember when you do this the front of your iPad is no longer protected. It's still in the top case but the bottom (keyboard) has been removed. Hope this answers your question. :-)
Camera really sucks! Don't buy it!!!!
No but it does have a timer and a mini tripod. Works just as well.
The camera cones with its own neck strap and the kit does come with a charger.
Yes it has a tripod hole. The unit is a limited run so the retail price is lower, the image quality is better than the P4x (SVGA VS WVGA).
I don't know what to tell you. This one is relatively easy to use but none of them seem to be simple anymore. They put more and more on these cameras because they can, not because it's needed. Then they tell you how fantastic it is when most of the features are things you'll never use. I don't think they make a simple point and shoot camera. You can use this one as such, but you're paying for all the whistles and bells anyway. Good luck.
Yes, and I have first hand experience. A week after I got the camera I dropped it in the water. NOT covered under the warranty. I got a rebuilt camera from Canon at a slight discount. While I love this camera and Canon products in general, the Canon organization is awkward and frustrating to deal with.
At least it has english, i am pretty sure it has a good amount of different languages
This worked great till this week when it started glitching and only works partially.
No
I think the link is right one.http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00ETB0DRQ?cache=4dc9825aa5ae3b161ef501443b878a8c&pi=AC_SX110_SY165_QL70&qid=1404960678&sr=8-5#ref=mp_s_a_1_5
Hello Phillip. Yes I can ship with Mountain Lion if you desire that OSX. Please feel to place your Order and I will make sure your Purchase is Customized to your needs. Kenneth - The Finest Macs
I wear glasses and haven't had any issues of discomfort from the fit.
Just order one from amazon but they don't have replacement cords in color. It'll be just the original black and red cord
1 yr manufacturer's
It sure does, or I wouldn't have bought them. That is my entire source of music listening on the go! :)
not quite like google maps' traffic layer on android/iphone, but yes there is traffic info. the navigation recommends alternate routes that you can preview & accept, or ignore at times traffic gets heavy
Yes
I have never tried. I don't think the 8 gigs will support a movie
No, but Corsair is coming out with a mechanical keyboard that has RGB LEDs later this year. That one will allow you to customize the color of the LEDs whenever you want.
There is a night mode and also a 50 or 60hz light frequency. Try alternating those?
The silver parts are metal. The handle and plastic tube that connects the tip to the handle are plastic, as well as the blue dome. The black end cap is also plastic, but removes to reveal a mini usb port.
I own two of them and yes it's normal, hope it helps
Well they're pretty much the same volume level. The remote sounds better though, replicating the sfx on the show. The remote's emitter needs to be extended to achieve that same volume level too. When it's retracted it sounds even quieter. But i wouldn't get it if you're planning on going mobile with it. Its a good chunk of change to risk breaking on the move or cosplaying , etc.
It is controlled by 12 different movements plus the button. A quick search on YouTube will give you a better idea than any explanation I can offer.
HI, you need to download "EZ view" app from Apple store, after successful download it, search "Projector****" on wifi, connect by input code"11112222", then enter wifi mode by remote control and set it.
the lumens was the only diff i was able to see. so i went ahead and purchased the 725hd. it's great, you don't any more brightness than what the 725hd has. nice clear picture in day or night.
Not terribly long - maybe 5 feetish. I have pretty much always had to use an extension cord or plan my set up around an outlet.
Do you mean always used in 16:9? Also you can configure for 4:3 apect ratio
According to the manual, the minimum throw distance is 3.9 feet. You might lose some clarity at that distance though. I have mine installed at 12.9 feet, bringing it closer was possible. Best bet is to try it and if it doesn't work, buy a short throw distance projector. Good luck.
If a Dell E521 has SATA, it should be compatible. Dell should be able to tell you for sure, using the Dell Service Tag on the computer itself.
If you're asking about the thickness of the "glass" covering the actual display surface, I measured it at 1/16 inch (approximately 1.6 mm). If you're asking about the width of the black border surrounding the display area, I measured it at 1.25 inch (3.17 mm) on the right/left side borders, and ~1.5 inch (3.81 mm) on the top/bottom borders.
Sure can. I am using 2 wireless sirens in addition to the wired one in my application and it works flawlessly. You can add as many as you'd like.
It works with a patented, tension clip. No screws. No drilling. Easy on and easy off in seconds. Here is a video from the manufacturer. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3DfAbh2opM
not sure if it can be ordered, contact the manufacture, thats always the best thing to do.
Yes it will
No sorry only factory match silver
Hi, Yes it is. Thanks, PCrush
Yes, with bios update
Yes, on the soundcard daughter board.
This MagTek card reader uses a USB cable for a laptop. So you would need a laptop for your transactions. We also had a merchant account set up to process our transactions for us so you will need that as well unless your bank can handle these. Good luck!
If the monitor is a flat screen that is thin, I don't think you would be able to attach it to the side. The MagTek is at least an inch wide.
Yes
I bought one, works fine for me with exact same chipset.
Yes it does. I just purchased and you can do dual monitors one VGA and one HDMI.
You should be able to just go to a third party ram manufacturer. I recommend crucial. They have fair prices and they also have a good memory analysis program you can download for free. Everything you need to buy good ram is pretty easy to use on their website.
The specs state that on one charge the Rechargeable lithium-ion battery will last for 10 hours of play time, and 280 hours of standby.
Yes
Yeah it's new in the box.
If the description states "BOX" or "BX" for the cpu, then it means it comes with heatsink and fan. One can always choose to purchase custom heatsink and fan, depending on case size or pc use.
This laptop is not that heavy (still heavy, but how heavy do you expect a 14.0" HD Display screen laptop would be :-D) This laptop's setting is awesome and I actually can plug in my headphone after pushing it harder XD wish you will like it.
No ports or card slots in mine.
I use a sound card. They do not have audio driver.
The headband fots the head great. I was looking long time for really good gaming headset.The platronics RIG doing extremlley great job.
Yes yes it does
The front two orange fans are included and installed. Not sure what you mean in 'open or closed corner'.
the case measures 17 inches = 431 mm
Battery is not included
Yes. Both amp and speaker.
There are replacement headsets available for purchase that will work with this system however you will not be able to charge both headsets simultaneously as there is only one charging slot. If you are in need of a different slution so that two users can enjoy the TrueDio Ears at the same time, please call our offices at 800-991-6207 to discuss exchange options.
it does mine!
Not built-in, but it does come with screen protector.
It should look at the bottom of your camera, if there is a small hole yes, if its a 2 inch square lock or Oregon scientific mount no. Its a great pod I've had mine and been using it regularly for about a year works like new after some pretty severe beatings including submerging it a bunch of times. Still can't beat the price.
I have the HDR-AS15 and it works perfectly. The AS10 is the same form-factor as the AS15, so it will work too.
Yes. This mount works well without a helmet. I have worn it while working on a railroad car and it worked well over a period of about an hour. Sony's instructions for assembly are not real clear so be prepared to fiddle around with it a bit.
I am not sure what peace you are talking about. I think you are referring to the yellow mount peace? and that piece comes with the camera. I comes with everything that's shown on the picture. That is all you need to use it.
Go to Sony website, see what accessories compatible with your Camera. Good luck.
Yes.. is the only way ... the chest harness is attached to the camera with the case
(1) Around 15 feet (2) 220 Shots and unsure about the battery.
sorry, i bought it for a gift for someone.
Hi Mark, Sony RMLVR1 Wifi Remote will work on the Sony HDRAS15 Action Camcorder. But you need to update the firmware of the Action Cam to the latest version before you can use the wifi remote. -Vincent
No, only with the Sony action cam.
Yes I believe you can just make sure you have an in line fuse.
Hello, I cant tell if its better with Iphone 5 or 5S, but I use mine with my 4S and it works as expected. No issues when installing app or operational.
No. The camera can be a few feet from the iPhone/pad. They don't need to be touching. The camera is entirely contained in the Sony unit, the iPhone/pad functions only as a viewfinder/controller.
No flash
Yes
At the moment, there is not which is disappointing since it may be a cause of not only draining the battery slowly but also a little annoying when using it at night and day. I will look into this more and report back to you when I find a solution, well if I do.
It has adjustments that should fit most vehicles. My wife and I bought two of them and love them. They seem to work well and do what they say it should do. I'm happy with mine.
Yes, indeed it does have a VGA port. In addition, this unit also provides Component Video ports. Great set! Walley B
I don't know. I'm only using it to hold my Samsung Galaxy Note 3.
Yes
According to information I have , yes it is compatible
I really do not know I modifity it fit an iphone and it worked great for that
When I'm within my network it looks like it is listed as a drive. When I click it it brings up the folders so you can modify the files within windows explorer.
I have the floor stand version, which should hold a tablet with a 10in diagonal. I can't speak for the others. The cup holder version has a different configuration. I would not recommend the stand unless you or someone you know can solder the part at the bottom of the pole which attaches the pole to the floor base.
It has a button to turn the Bluetooth on. But once BT is on you can not turn it off using the same button, you will have to turn the speakers off/on to turn off BT.
Speakers DO NOT stay powered on despite what bluguitarman says. They have a "power save" mode that shuts them off after 15 minutes of inactivity. Pretty lousy if you ask me, but the killer sound these puppies put out MORE than makes up for that minor annoyance.
Yes, they are easily. They will even plug into most current model TV's for that theather type sound
It appears to be an automatic thing. I have played UK and US region DVDs with no effort on my part.
Yes
The BR51 has NFC initial pairing capability. That's about the only difference.
Simply turn off bluetooth of one and turn on bt of the other one.
Hello Andre The difference between the BR50 (Songo HiFi) and the BR51 (Songo Tap) is that the BR50 has auto pairing which is exclusive to any current Bluetooth receiver, and the BR51 has NFC (near field communication). Both models include a 3.5mm AUX cable with adapter. Both models include aptX. Optical cable can be purchased separately. Nyrius Customer Experience
Not at all. Thanks
No
6 inches is about right never used it
Highly doubtful
I use it to charge my Verizon LG G2. It even works with my TPU case on.
I run windows 8.1 without issue just pop in the driver disk and do the automated install.
I don't have a problem but the ear covers definitely fit better when I take my glasses off. I haven't noticed a difference in noise-cancelling quality with my glasses on vs. with them off.
No these are not bluetooth capable
I'm not sure but it doesn't come with power sources.
When I want to carry my G16 in a pocket, I take the case off. Usually I have a gear bag or back pack the camera goes into along with a travel tripod. You cant beat the case for ultimate protection!
No I dont think you can detach the backcover from the case, unless you want to break it. I won't suggest you do that.
Hi,the 3rd gereration works with the RX of the first generation. BUT the first generatioon can not be compatible with the 3rd RX.thanks
Hello. It is two 4GB modules 2x4GB.
According to the instructions, don't be afraid to use force since it is made from polycarbonate. I just tried and it is truly hard. Let us know if force works without breaking.
I would say it would do a good job of hiding scratches. The cover is black except for where the Apple logo shines through and then the openings for ports on the side and vents on the bottom.
Sorry not sure, but when i need to order something for our laptops i put the number in my search & it will usually tell you whether it is compatable or not.
No
Pictures in folio mode is a no go, but I don't have any problem with taking pictures with the keyboard out or just flapping down. Dropped it once, caught in mid air and folio popped oped and Ipad flew out onto the floor. Folio just protects from every day use but not hard use.
Yes
Yes, it's included soft rubber protective&#65292;red case.
USB transceiver connected to computer. Like a wireless mouse.
I don't have a screen protecter, but my only complain is that my Ipad Air does not have a snug fit in the slot. It slides out way to easy. I am very midnfull to carry it horizonal, because otherwise if you hold it vertical the Ipad can slip out of the hinge slot. So my guess is having a screenprocter would if anything beifit the snugness of the fit.
Weight is about 24 lbs.; box was approx.. 3' x 1.5' x 1.5'
It gets dirty. I haven't tried to clean mine. The protection it offers the ipad is great. The time it holds a charge though is way below my last Zagg keyboard.
I've used the ZAGGkeys Cover Keyboard with the Minisuit Buddy Skin Case Back Cover for Apple iPad and Mini Tablets (Smart Cover Compatible). Once you put the ipad into the Keyboard, add the Minisuit after. It will lip slightly over the edge of the hinge, but it works great! I don't use a front skin, so I'm not sure about that.
DDR3L is low voltage. DDR3L runs at 1.35V and DDR3 runs at 1.5V. Intel i5/i7 Gen 3 and above support DDR3L. Lower voltages mean less heat, which will in turn increase the life of your RAM. All parts marked as DDR3L or DDR3L-RS are backward compatible to parts marked as DDR3, and meet the JEDEC 1.5V voltage level operation specifications.
yes
Yes, it is possible. You should press "Option", then select "All zones stereo", then "Start" plus Enter y you will see that zone 2 input (I mean the source zone 2 is paying) will change to the same input zone 1 is playing. The only consideracin you have to keep in mundo is that you can not use some
Yes
I know several options: 1.You need to purchase a SIMcard from T-Mobile or AT&T, and get a plan for about $30/mth for 2-5MGbs. 2. You can use the HOT SPOT of your smart phone (again, you will pay your provider for using MGBs) via WiFi. I learnt it form guys at T-Mobile store.
It's about 14-oz.
you're right, same thing happened to me, unfortunately one of the feet is now missing, so even if we found an answer it wouldn't help me, good luck
Yes, it is.
My Mac is a late 2013 MacBook Pro with Retina. I know this cover will fit model numbers A1502 / A1425 models without CD-ROM drives.
I bought one for my son for Christmas and none of the inputs work. quality is awful. Company hasn't responded. Don't waste your money on this.
Yes it works on both. All u need is the Vga cord
The cord is very long 148 in
Only the top/screen portion is aluminum. The bottom half is plastic.
yes sir everything works, have not had a problem with it.
No
No
No, it does not.
I assume you're referring to RAM, and the maximum capacity for this machine is 32 GB. I believe it has 4 slots each capable of holding an 8 GB card. If you're referring to HDD, that, too can be upgraded to whatever you see fit. I believe it can also support a secondary (or primary) SSD.
Yeah of course it does
Yes, there is always a charger included. Since this is a netbook, it's just a small simple one. 19V 2.6 Amps.
It has Microsoft words, powerpoint, one note & other awesome apps.
Correct
WiFi means it can only be used where there is a wireless internet connection (such as your house or coffeeshop, if available). You cannot connect to a cellular data plan such as Verizon. This is the WiFi only version
I have a N router and it streams movies from netflix and movies from the HTPC. However, if the unit is a substantial distance from the router, you may need a wireless repeater.
No
yes if your laptop size is 13". if it is bigger i am not sure.
The area in which you are using your phone will determine which carrier will be utilized. In my case, it's AT&T, so I presume I have an AT&T Simm card.
Hi Erin, The webcam is very good. It works well in low light and there are 22 filters to create funny or interesting pictures. I am only using the camara feature to check the resolution, because I use an Ipad for video chatting with friends. Even though I have an Ipad, I find myself using this chromebook a lot. Hope this helps. Thanks, Stephen
It will. A bit disappointed in the quality.
Yes, it has one
No
No
AC Adapter: Model:BSF-008 Input: 100-240V-50/60Hz 0.6A Output: DC5V-2000mA No specific name. Just model number, input and output numbers.
I have no idea. This is the first case I have bought for it. But I think this is perfect. I don't even notice it anymore. :)
No, it has a darker blue color -I can take a picture if you like
yes. i have had no problem with that.
I think800
Yes you can make it happen. It's a great little system for it's intended purpose. I use it with my HD computer. For a main surround system, get something better suited for that purpose.
Yes they have key holes and I believe they are under 8 lb I never weight them
mp5 is a format, it does not need to be programed; It simply means that if you upload something on the device that's mp5, the device will read.
It does not have a camera.
This drive replaces whatever is currently in your y510p's M.2 NGFF slot (usually an 8 to 32GB OEM SSD cache drive, but check: some y510ps were manufactured without this M.2 slot). The installation is not difficult if you carefully follow good instructions, as I did here:
yes it will
Yes. It's a regular Windows 8 computer with USB ports and WiFi, so any computer that supports either of those methods can be used (which is to say, pretty much any computer made in the last 15 years).
Play with normal settings
This remote will not work with that tv
Yes, it will work with this model.
Hey, the focus is very fast and absolutely noticeable compared to the 18-55mm. Hope that helps. Kind regards
It really depends on what sub woofer you have, but I don't think you can
Did you check the wiring in the back? Maybe the input cable came loose.
I've been happy with them for a couple months. Powerful for little speakers. Depends on what you are expecting. For the price I'm pleased.
No
It has a built-in rechargeable battery. The battery plugs in via a micro-USB charger (included).
Yes it do
I assume you mean the time from pressing the button to the time of getting the shot. As long as you have a focus, the shot is pretty instantaneous. I keep the camera set for -1, 0, +1 exposure to capture 3 different lighting for each shot, and the only delay is the image actually appearing after the button is pressed. There is about 1/2 second after you press the shutter button and see the image displayed that you have just captured.
Yes, there is a diopter adjustment on the eyepiece
We haven't heard from customers that it does. You can in fact straighten the flap, and it stays flat, out of your way. - CrazyOnDigital.
Sorry. Don't know.
Yes that is correct .
Hi Mark: RCA cables are included, but an optical cable is not included in this soundbar. To get the best digital sound we recommend an optical cable. If you are wanting to mount this to your tv, make sure to check out this great soundbar mount :http://www.amazon.com/Soundbar-Mount-Depth-Adjustments-Brackets/dp/B00LPUWKR0/ref=sr_1_16?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1408288741&sr=1-16 Thanks,
Yes.
yes
TDP, this isn't a boom box, but a Shelf type system. It's not that big but does carry enough sound. It's about 20 pounds and 22 x 21 x 16 inches total. I think it's a really nice system, so much so, my friend bought the same unit after seeing mine. I would think you could keep it in the box or place it in a tote to carry it in for your class. It really is a decent system. Take good care!
No, you can only play one CD at a time. You can however, play music from a stick using the USB port. You can also connect your computer and play from your entire music library (I-tunes etc.).
Yes, it does and its located in the electorics "middle" console about 4 inches from the bottom. Eject button is on the control center
just one
It most definitely will. it is very adjustable and very sturdy as well. I have had mine for half a year now and still no problems
It should work with a Galaxy tab. I use it with my Android Tablet Asus TF300 and it works fine. I think the TF300 is about the same size as the Galaxy tab 12.2.
Yes
yes. the tablet only rests in a slot on the keyboard, and you can operate the tablet from the keyboard lying nearby.
No
It has a aux. out and I use a aux/headset to RCA to plug into my big stereo so you should be fine. Best christmas gift I have ever gotten from anyone.
No, only cds
No issues. I bought this for my apartment in lieu of an expensive Bose system. ;)
Yes, I bought it for my father and he loves it. He plays 33's, 45's, and even 78's.
Yes it will work. I tried it and its smooth.
Yes
Yes, it can be used while charging. Charges fairly quickly and seems to hold a charge for quite a while....I've used it off an on for the past month and haven't had to charge it, yet.
Yes you can.
made in China,I promise this camera is very good very high quality ,
no. you have to use headphones
Yes
No
its supply and demand. The blue one is more popular then the red so some try to sell the blue for more. Most stores sell them both for the same price.
The box dimensions were 1 cubit long X 1 cubit wide X 1 cubit tall. It weighed in at a whopping 2 uncias. In case you are wondering I have no Idea! who weighs and measures packages they get in the mail?
No
Yes. It has the three ring TRS plug that answers calls and controls an mp3 player or phone. The mic is on the back of it. People can hear you with greater clarity than with the computer speakers. I used this a lot while deployed...
I have no idea, they were a gift for ny grandson. Sorry I couldn't help. I know he never took them off when he was here. He loved them.
These are lighter than the combats. Sound quality is about the same I bought these over the combat and have been very happy
I can measure latter but I'm 6.8 (203cm) and it works fine for me.
by charge, you mean if these have a USB charger. if it is, these don't have a usb charger
No lag, just make sure you don't run your audio cables near magnetic/electrical interference or there will be constant hum, sometimes popping noises. It's a been a great external card so far. Basically turned my laptop into a 5.1 entertainment system. Combine it with some decent Logitech 5.1 speakers and you're all set. Also, I would recommend K-Lite Codec pack on your system to get the most out of this.
Yes, it comes with Genuine Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit
No. Audio only. Please take a look at the FAQ - http://airenabler.qnology.com/faq
I'm traveling, and directions are not at hand, but I think that you need to connect to the AirEnabler network, and then Telnet in to 192.168.1.1, per the directions. Did you go to www.airenabler.com for excellent illustrated directions?
The speakers are not the best, but adequate.
You do not want this equipment. It is very cheap, has no radio dial indicator no volume control on the remote and is over all poor quality.
It has full HD 1080p the 3 has 720p , it also has a low light sensor. I don't have a Looxie 3 so I can't really compare them side by side.
This style Looxcie needs to be attached with some type of clip, whether it's the ball cap, bicycle, helmet, etc. You can try using the ball cap clip on your sunglasses but it would probably be too heavy. Maybe you can add a sports strap to your sunglasses so they don't fall off.
The one I have did not, but I bought mine 6 months ago so I believe the newer ones do.
Works only with new 2013 nexus 7. The older one does not support any external displays.
It works on a g2. The plug in SHOULD fit the G3 just like the G2. I'm fairly certain all the adapters are the same for android so this will more than likely work.
Hi, actually I bought it for my nexus 7 2013 and it worked really good, it transfers both audio and video and also it works for mirroring, this adapter was a good and cheap option for me.
It's sales lingo, basically meaning that no extra software or steps are needed for it to function with the computer.
I believe VGA.
According to description 72 is not listed
Yes, it fits perfectly.
It worked fine for me. Maybe you should check your connection.
No but it does have a mechanical feel. The keys have a slightly longer travel time.
Not by the looks of it.
No, it's a wired system. Need to pay attention to wireless systems as they all seem to be transmitting on 2.4Ghz, same as some routers and phones.
Yes, according to the HP Website, your specs match this motherboard. Once you install this motherboard, you will want to start from scratch on your OS as you will have a bunch of old motherboard drivers that can cause conflicts. You can give it a shot with your current OS and see if you run into any issues with drivers. Sometimes you may just get lucky and they will not interfere with eachother. But as far as hardware goes, this matches.
A lot of programs offer DLNA streaming control, Windows Media Player is one of them. I never set up the DLNA streaming myself but it should be automatically recognized by your computer, but following these instructions should get you there. http://www.pcworld.com/article/2360448/how-to-stream-media-from-your-pc-to-your-hdtv-over-wifi.html
The World of Warcraft Web Site only shows support for Windows and Mac - no Android.
yes
The machine is equipped with: AMD Radeon HD 7640G with 512 MB Graphics System Memory. Hope this helps
A Maximum of 8 Gigs can be installed. DDR3 PC3-12800, DDR3 PC3-14900, DDR3 (non-ECC) Recommended is 8 Gigs of PC3-12800. Just because it is a faster bus does not mean it is stable.
Yes, only 1 slot is used. Another one is available.
I used it for office work, and did not use this function so I cannot answer this question with confidence since the laptop is at Amazon warehouse. However, I went online and this is what I found. https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-U-and-S-Series-Notebooks/Ideapad-S510p-Audio-Jack/td-p/1401053 Per Lenovo Community, this one has combo audio Jack. https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/T400-T500-and-newer-T-series/Audio-combo-jack-vs-headphone-earphone-with-mic-and-speaker/ta-p/240186 If you decide to buy this, you may have to buy a different audio cable. Hope it helps.
Yes
Yes, it does. Under 'other technical details', ' Optical drive type refers to the cd/dvd drive. DVD Super Multi refers to a drive that reads and writes CD-R/RW, DVD-R/RW, DVD+R/RW and DVD-RAM.
fn+space key
You can swap it out for a SSD, but just make sure you have a copy of all the drivers and some back-up discs of the OS.
from left to right, the light indicators are ac power, battery and caps lock
Processor Number i7-4700MQ 4th generation # of Cores 4 # of Threads 8 .....Hyperthreading Clock Speed 2.4 GHz Max Turbo Frequency 3.4 GHz Cache 6 MB
Yes, I use the HDMI port to add a 2nd monitor so I can use the dual monitor feature of Windows.
No bluetooth.
It was the 2013 model. Bought this last year and it came with windows 8.0 not the 8.1 but its free to upgrade to 8.1
I have the Envy 2310 but never open it so I don't know, maybe someone else can answer the question
Yes it has an hdmi out. I can't get the sound to work on the tv yet but the video will play. I think I just need to download the proper driver for it.
yes
I only own Skyrim, but the answer is a resounding yes. It runs it on ultra at over 50 fps easy, with only minor frame drops here and there. However, this computer does have issues. I recommend it to techies who don't mind solving a few problems for excellent performance.
From what I read, yes to both questions.
I have mine set to record only when motion is detected and I just looked at the DVR. It has 60 days of recordings on it and that is only how far I looked back, there could be more...At night a spider puts out its web in the view of one of the cameras and the web moves in the wind, it records solid throughout the night. Then in the morning it takes the web up and it goes back to only recording motion.
Can't think of a reason it wouldn't?! It's running off the standard Windows 8 upgradable to 8.1 im quite sure you could run Illustrator listen to music and skype all at the same time if you got the notion haha....Enjoy!
Yes it does!
Nope
Most new and updated programs can be downloaded from the internet. We also have a protable cd/dvd drive that connects to laptop via usb cable. Works great.
I own a HP Pavilion. I consider Lenovo keyboard solid and comfortable. Read my review for other possible answers.
This laptop was a gift to my mother. I had to read the product description on bhphotovideo.com to confirm that, YES, this laptop has Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity.
Yes, yes it does
I'm not sure, however there are videos that would show you how to insert an mSATA SSD to any ASUS laptop and also I believe that most ASUS laptops can be customized.
These headphones don't have active noise canceling; however they do have noise isolation, or "passive" noise canceling. It's like when you cup your hands over your ears. They're actually not that bad at it either. I've had to use the MDR10R for in-ear monitors on stage before and I couldn't intelligibly hear anything that wasn't coming from them.
When I tested it out, I don't remember the pan base having that much friction. Part of that is because even with a fluid head, when you are turning a 4ft jib, the leverage is a lot more than if you were just turning a camera on it. I would say that the smoothness will mostly be based on how steady your hand is and how balanced you have it.
Yes It is available from Apple or any distribution We do not carry this product Thank you
Yes, ps has the 12v cpu cable
You could make iT but it is much cheaper to buy a 220 or so
No
I believe its a year. Not certain though, sorry.
Yes
Yes
The Owners manual will state 110V
Works great with PS4 and XBOX One and Comcast. Its so bright, just make sure to set to Dynamic mode and Economy mode (to keep fans quite).
Yes! And maybe this is the best option. The wireless HDMI sometimes loses his signal for a few seconds. Anyways this projector is great
No camera is sold separately
Yes, it comes with replacement backdoors for both the Original Hero, and the new Hero 3+ housings. Just attach the float to whichever one fits your housing, swap out your current backdoor, and you're on your way.
Yes it does. The pad itself can be stuck on any door you choose.
Yes the LCD screen will fit in the old housing with the LCD attachment for the old housing. But people were buying the new hero 3+ and there was no back door for the LCD screen, GoPro's answer to this was to take your new Hero 3+ and put it in the old Hero 3 housing with the the old LCD screen attachment. Now GoPro has designed these attachments which only fit the Hero 3+ case it came with when you bought it. I hope this helps!
it comes with three but you can add as much as you like
Yes, the GoPro 3, 3+ and 4 cameras are all the same size. I believe that this housing comes with the Hero 4 cameras.
Yes
Motherboard mounting points are standardized for each type/size of board. I've never heard or experienced such a thing as you are claiming. EVER. Few reviews have complained about it? Have any? This just doesn't seem likely in the least. EVGA doesn't have boards with special mounting points and every case I've ever seen has mounting points configurable to whatever type of motherboard is designed to fit the case. Maybe you need to check just what it is you're doing.
I purchased an EVGA Slim Slot-Load Internal 8X DVDRW SATA Drive (for EVGA Hadron Chassis) (OEM-UJ8C5) 100-OD-S101-BR cost was $47.00. Can you get a cheaper one? I am sure you can. But because the EVGA case slot is very thin, I thought it best to get an EVGA dvd to match. By the way, the combo works perfect together.
No. My friends note did not fit.
Yes, the LED will flash red on start-up. If you charge it the recommended once a month, you should never see the red indicator. I have never seen mine turn red in the year I've had mine. In that year I have only charged it twice.
Yes we have been shipping any of our 1200 ads worldwide anywhere and we are currently the only ones on the net with constant stock of used and new open box glasses at reduced prices.
I believe all the HP Envy laptops have the radeon chips and so do not use nvidia hardware or software or glasses, so for them you need one of our glasses that has cinema mode such as our universal model UM or our UK for children, or our cinema only model CF1.
Yes
I used the "LiBvlc" option under source type and then used "rtsp://XXX.camera.IP.XXX:554/ch0_0.h264" for source path. Works great. I should add I'm using Zoneminder v1.27 on a debian system. Defaults for pretty much everything else. Cheers.
Thats a question about your camcorder, most camcorders charge most batteries, including this one.
Hello, You can see the display in English. Thank you for your question.
I think is the same with the white one
Yes, they work with tt680 speedlites perfectly. Those are exactly the speedlites I have for these triggers.
Yes they can, it comes with a usb to plug into a computer, you can buy a wall plug one, it also comes with an aux cable to connect to any media device including the iPhone and iPods. I currently use mine with my iMac and iPhone 5s and it works like a charm! Hope you get them, 4 days later and I still think these are great and unique.
No
Mine didn't sound static at all. If you're using the cord, make sure it's plugged in good
The same thing happened to me. So I sent it back for a replacement. The same thing happened to that one! So I sent it back for a refund & just gave up on the speakers. I'll save up my money for a brand with higher quality standards!
Yes. I got this for my kids for Christmas and it is pretty much the same thing as a regular wii but can not connect to wifi. It is also just different color. Plays all the wii games but not wii u games. Hope this helps.
Sure you can. It actually depends on the game you want to play that allows 2 players. This particular item comes with only one controller, so you will have to buy the wiimote and nunchuck (if needed). That was my case.
It is not capable of any form of HD as it only ouputs 480i via a RCA cable.
About 8GB.
This Lenovo model does have a GPS chip. There isn't a model with 3G at this time.
Yes it does.
Hey, -A1000:Processor DualCore and microSD, up to 32 GB. -A3000:Processor QuadCore and microSD, up to 64 GB but, look at this and compare yourself. http://www.phonebunch.com/compare-phones/lenovo_ideatab_a3000-812-vs-lenovo_ideatab_a1000-813/
It supports most of the popular formats; Aldiko, Google Books, Kindle, Nook, PDF AND EPUB. Some of the rading apps have page turner and text adjustments. Others just use a swipe gesture.
its .03 mega pixel not much. good for skype, but to take pictures of your self ok
It has a mini USB jack. I don't remember seeing a HDMI jack but the specs are online.
Only do this with a DC-DC converter (12 to 5V) as the power cord that comes with this decreased the input voltage to this (via a voltage divider inside of the plug). It will run with 12V but this will decrease the life of the unit. A DC-DC converter can be purchased on Amazon for around $6.
After charging and pressing the power button, you should see and able to record. Try the car D/C adapter. If that doesn't work, then there is something wrong with the unit. One more thing, these cams are very sensitive to extreme temperature, cold or hot. Also, do you have a micro memory card in? If not, the unit won't work. Hope this help.
Yes but I would not recommend if hardwiring the unit to the car. It could give false readings all day like when a bird lands on your car or someone just walks near it. This will drain the life out of your battery. I disabled that feature on mine. Good luck
I have used it to talk to someone but personally the audio for phone calls isnt the best, i would use this strictly for a portable music player thats mega tiny.
It has fair sound outside the car, in a car would be pretty poor sound!
Yes most androids you can do they with I have a icecream sandwich but for the most part yes it shhould be able to play them netflix , red Box and a lot more movie on line streeming hope this helps you
These headphones will charge in about an hour. You must use the supplied Usb charger or one with a similar small plug to ensure electrical contact. Charge light on phones should glow when charging. Hope this helps. Nice headphones
I have a Dell Studio and this power supply wored great. It appears to be the sadme as the original that cam with it
Yes; it has a pretty sensitive microphone, you can hear sound on the live video feed, and it records both sound and video when motion is detected.
It does. You just have to endure the update to Win 8.1. Its an incredible laptop
Yes
It's very quiet and does not generate much heat at all.
This model has twice the RAM (4GB vs 2GB) and battery looks to be 1.5 hours better than the one on clearance at Best Buy.
nope works good here tested with a signal generator
it fits all keyboards
They do not come off easily, but they do not seem like they would come off in pieces. If they do leave residue, I think it would just be sticky (not paper). Alcohol would take the stickiness away. They are fun, but I do not highly recommend them.
It will probally fit, but the decal may look bigger or smaller depending on how big your screen is
It's the tree as seen but the cUT out is close to the outsides of the shape it doesn't cover the whole surface
Yes
I drilled two hole in my license plate and put it on with metal screws and it is holding up fine. I hope this helps.
No, it's not wireless.
I wired mine through my backup lights only comes on when vehicle is in reverse. Originally I had it wired directly was able to turn on and off Whenever I wanted but it would automatically come on every time I started the vehicle got tired of shutting it off so I rewired it to come on only when I put The vehicle in reverse.
Yes
It is very hard to say how this will respond to a Surface Pro 3 w/ case. The Surface is already a relatively heavy tablet; adding the additional weight of the case may make this awfully bouncy. Good luck in your search. Michael @ hold Your Tablet
it depends on the memory card that you buy. it can hold as high as 64gb 64 gets 4:30 32gb gets 2:10 16 gets 1:05 8 gets :30-35 keep in mind that the camera battery only last 2:10 so if you don't buy an extra battery there is no point in getting more than 32gb
This can help http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+get+started+using+a+gopro+hero+3%2B
The camera is the same as the Hero3 so if you use the old case your camera can go just as deep as the original. the new case is smaller and not as strong as the original..
Yes it does.
About three feet.
Yes you can pause SD card & skip fwd/bck. Won't show track & I think it will start again at track you stopped it at.
If it is an MP3 disc it should just play.
i think it supports 16 gb but i am not sure i would just go with the 8 gb it is really enought to pretty much play anything, what do you think about doing with it ?
Yes, it Will play an audio mp3 disc.
Came with ear-plug (small size listening device). Problem was not the ear-plug. Installed disc into the place, and closed lid, then making a scretching noise. Evidently the disc is hitting to body of the unit. I have tried several other discs and makes no difference. By the way, I have returned the unit and no replacement unit come to me yet.
My hand fits easily in a medium-to-large glove, which is not necessarily very large, but the mouse still feels plenty "big" in the sense that I don't have to cramp my hand and fingers up at all around the mouse. If anything, for me there is enough of the mouse to allow me to spread my hand and fingers over it in a relaxed fashion.
You can download the drivers from the user's manual located in the Support section of our website. http://www.etekcity.com/t-how-to-manual.aspx
I have the Tmobile version. Yes it fits, but it will cause it to get dramatically warmer from the unnecessary heat that the G2 emanates
This case should work with any provider's LG G2 but Verizon's LG G2 according to Otterbox's website.
Yes, this case is a good fit for AT&T LG2
No, unfortunately it's not. I figured that out the hard way
The white part is hard plastic and the soft is black so no it won't.
Actually there are no covered buttons. The port for charging must be uncovered, but that's not a problem. I really like this cover!
Yes
It is pretty slim, not at all like the Armor series from Otter Box for the iPhone. As far as screen protection, it is just a thin clear screen protector, again, not like the waterproof Armor case.
I think you can. Its great for note taking, and you can download the officesuite pro app and create word, excel, and powerpoint. I use this at work and I find it much easier than carrying a laptop around.
Regular USB on one end then MICRO USB on the other.
Mine was new, although I think that you have the option to get one refurbished for a few bucks less. Great computer, only reason I didn't keep it was because it didn't have a backlit keyboard.
I couldn't get it to connect to mine. It never worked no matter how many times I tried. I hope this helps.
Sorry, it has not USB connection, it is powered by 2pcs AAA Batteries.
Unfortunately not, or at least at the one I bought the only available are: english, spanish, french and some assian languages.
yes but you need the room to be pitch black nd picture looks blurry
I believe you can .. Check this link and follow the instructions https://support.apple.com/en-nz/HT201457
designed mostly for a reseller of computers. they provide the computer with Win8.1 pre-installed from the system builder version. this os stays with the hardware and is not transferrable to another computer like the comercial version is. this one costs less and if you do not plan to get rid of your computer for a while it is an excellent option.
3.3 pounds
No there isn't. You'd have to purchase an external drive, but those aren't expensive these days.
Mohu recommends a 'non-amplfied' antenna to be used with their Jolt 4-way splitter. You can use it with traditional splitters, but may run into signal loss issues so I recommend getting triple or quad shielded coaxial cable to use with it. I love Mohu so much, my Leaf 50 is a great device that pushed me to write: Simple Guide to Over the Air Free TV, which is available on Amazon. I use Mohu antennas every day, and love the technology!
Yes it will play CDs! When inserted, the laptop will choose the default player like Windows Media Player or iTunes.
NO
No, you cannot use a bluray player with this item
This model came with a trial version of Microsoft Office - expires one month from date of purchase.
no clue where you got that number, it's 19" high
yes
Yes you can watch free TV but for any cable or satellite stations you must have a plan with that station. Example, i have Uverse TV at home and i can watch channels on line at my shop with internet by logging on with At&t.
Yes both
It's Intel HD graphics 4400 WDDM1.1. Very happy with this Dell. good luck.
I dont see any port that looks like it has fifteen pin. several usb, an hdmi, a small square, and a card slot. Sorry!
I have not had to do that yet. But my other fellow computer geeks assure me that if you go through the process with a Microsoft tech., you can. Be warned that it is a lengthy and tedious process.
Hi Wendy, What you are looking for is actually the NetGear N450 *Cable Modem*, which is different than this product. The product is available on Amazon here: http://www.amazon.com/Netgear-Wi-Fi-Cable-Router-N450-100NAS/dp/B00HC0ZDOE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1390691485&sr=8-1&keywords=Netgear+N450+CG3000Dv2. This product is just a router, and does not have the necessary ports to connect to your cable internet service. The N450 in both product names refers to the max wifi connection speed (450 Mbps).
Yup - setting up wifi was a cinch.
no, it is not
Not it does not , however we can add it upon request for an extra fee.
It depends on what kind of waterproof bag you have. The earphone itself is waterproof.
YES. I have it running in a 3.0 PCI slot right now.
The Asus is going to be a better performing card if you have a router that supports AC1700 or AC1900 speeds. If you have an older router that supports N300-N450, it won't matter which card you use. If you have an N router that supports N900 speeds, be sure they are using compatible chipsets, otherwise you will only achieve 450Mbps max possible speeds.
Yes, works great.
Think it's a 50 cm.
To protect your screen from your phone but mine phone and the screen broke
That is more of a cotact otterbox question.
Hello buyer, this means that we will ship it October 24th. I hope that helps. Best, Tech Armor
Best I've ever gotten was about 150 feet in open space but that's still better range than most speakers. Motorola has years of experience making radios so it's no surprise that their speaker has such a long range. They're not telling how but in that department they really know what they're doing.
Yes. Have to turn it off heist mode. Can't be on heist mode. Mic works good for Bluetooth calls
absolutely easy
I don't think so, they are actual buttons. a plus and minus sign.
The device has an internal battery and can be charged and used without being plugged in. That said if your battery runs low you do have the option of plugging the unit in to play music.
The one I got from this company was made on 14 Nov 1988. It was on a sticker on the back of the keyboard. I got the IBM Model M 1391401
on the very short time i had it, i only played music i had on a usb drive, and it did not show song titles
The only charger I've found to work with the nook is a nook specific charger with the nook symbol
Not that I can see.
Not that I am aware of
I do not knows if it is using a battery . i always plug the cables all the time .
It has HDMI input.
GTX770M
for gaming i really like the alien ,longer battery life, quick response does not get to hot, just happy with it big screen as well plus you can try it out for thirty days and if you are not happy with it you can get something else. i kept mine
No
Yep, right side.
Not possible, molded case and stand.
yes
yes ac
Yes.
Yes. It is in the specs. 802.11bgn
yes. It a Great computer. I would recommend it for anyone
Great resolutions!! The camera is amazing. You can zoom in on images and change the lighting on the background. Also, you can snap picture and edit image.
It does have an HDMI port. It has two USB 2.0 ports, and two USB 3.0 ports. It also does support Bluetooth.
Go to the home page and on the right hand corner search and there is where you can download it.
No it does not. You have to purchase that separately.
Check the website. They provide a list of cameras that Can and Cannot use the attachment.
Yes
Yes, it comes with wired mouse and keyboard.
The OS is ready out of the box but it only has a trial of Office. I purchased Office 365 for $99 it works on 5 devices and includes everything. Great pc so far!
actually, the description says "wireless keyboard & mouse included." It's up in the first description at the top of the webpage. So yes,they are included.
Mine did. I love this camera, btw. Incredible images, a snap to use. Best I've ever owned.
Yes, it does! I have a cable in my car, in my house and at work. They all work!
Hi, The DVD player Support just support the Analog TV, but not digital TV. Hope you can install the antenna and the channel search. Hope this helps.
I think there is compatible case leather case for it, you may try ProntoTec tablet case on Amazon.
It does come with two batteries. Everything in the pictures is there in this kit.
No ,the anti -flicker has the adapter on it
It is 1.
Yes, they do connect to the PS3 Console
It's not a modern marvel, but it gets the job done.
Yes it is
I'm using it with the S4 mini.
Yes it is.
Yes it does
It does not come standars on the HD DI model. They do have one with side imaging so you have to make sure that it specifies that it is there. Most likely the model you are inquiring about is just the high definition model and possibly not even has the down imaging either. It is the base unit. Hope it helps.
899 ci has 7" screen 998 c has a 8" screen. 899 has built in GPS with the 998 it uses an external antenna for GPS. There may some other differences but these two were the main ones that i can remember.
Yes, it does. One of the great features I like.
Beats me. I'm just trying to figure out how to stop Amazon sending me these damn queries!
Yes
You can connect more that one device (up to 6) but you cannot play more than 1 at the same time. You tube has videos that explain more thoroughly. Do a search for "How to pair and connect the Bose Soundlink Mini Bluetooth" (I used Google).
I was thinking it was something else which was a rip-0ff.. The FotoTech worked fine right out of the package on my Nikon D3200. Check to make sure the battery is good. I did not have to do any setup. I have not tried it from the front;;I used it from behind the camera.
Video cables are a seperate purchase. Youll want to pick up an hdmi cable. Power cable is included of course.
Not sure about Hula Plus but you need to have a Netflix account to access it thru the Roku.
Yes, it does have the PLEX app. I don't have a PLEX account so I don't know how well it works.
As far as hz for US (standardized at 59-60 Hz) it's 120 Hz for UK and International most places are standardized at 50 Hz so I assume it would run at 100 Hz.
I dual boot win 7 and 8.1 and haven't experienced any issues. I find 8.1 to boot up fastest and overall better performance. Win 7 works great though!
Yes the padded liner can be removed slips right in and out ... and in removing the liner I also found an inside zipper pocket :)
This computer has USB ports for mouse, keyboard and printer, and VGA and HDMI ports for monitor. You can use your existing ones as long as they are compatible with the above mentioned ports. It also comes with keyboard and mouse.
Just received. It does come with keyboard and mouse. Sadly I now have two of both since it wasn't stated.
Yes, two monitors can be connected.
Yes
I bought this early december 2013 and yes it came with windows 8
This computer has Windows 8.
Yes. And it is the closest thing to a silent computer as I have ever heard. Instant on. I push the button to turn it on and immediately get a log in.
That's exactly what it's suitable for. Flat, even, clinical light.
Yes this is a 64bit Operating System
Yes, and you are going to need it. This PC has issues connecting via wireless to the internet.
Not sure. Email the buyer she can tell you
I live in south Florida, and I remove the camera from the windscreen every time I leave the car so it does not sit exposed to the sun in the closed car. I have had no issues at all with the camera's operation .
YES the computer I order did have wireless connections.
As long as your printer can interface with Windows 7, this computer is compatible with all printers.
I really dont know,Sorry!! Jacob!!
If u have money to give away FREE.
Detailed dimensions are shown on image 5. The width of the wall plate is about 2", the height is about 6.1".
No, only side to side, and tilt
The Belkin F5L161ttC00 is designed to work with the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1. It is not guaranteed to work with Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 10.1.
Since it's bluetooth it can be used with any phone that has bluetooth. I'd you don't want to connect it through that it comes with an aux cord! :)
You need the pci slot which is 75 watts a 6 pin for another 75 and the 8 pin for 150 - max is 300 watts for the card alone
None of the specification indicate that OSX is supported. The lack of drivers for OSX would be the primary problem.
Dear Don P. If you are asking about the model NP940X3G-K04US, then this is the 4th Generation I7 Processor for sure. It is clocked at 1.8 MHz However if you are interested in the 4th generation Intel processor make sure that you order this particular model as they are still selling some older 3rd generation based laptops although at much reduced price. Hope this helps.
No but I installed the Corsair H80i Hydro Cooler & I had to remove the heatsink casing from the memory in the first socket.
You will need a SATA hard drive and OS install disk/usb stick. Plus a keyboard / mouse and monitor
In terms of noise cancelling, its a little bit better but personally i would stick with the PXC 450 there much more comfortable then these
it's i7-4770
Macs by default use low bit pool setting on mavericks and older run this in terminal: defaults write com.apple.BluetoothAudioAgent "Apple Bitpool Min (editable)" 40 source: http://danwarne.com/fix-bluetooth-a2dp-audio-quality-mac-os/
While it would probably make it sound better it is not required and sounds fantastic without
Hello , these fans are about 25 dBa , it is not completely silent but a very faint air flow sound , I haven't come across a 120mm quieter than this , I like them the led lights give a nice white glow.
Yes
I wouldn't at the top of a case. They're fine on the sides. But if you blow them out the top the bearings are terrible and the fans will vibrate immensely.
No. I don't know of any LED fans on the market that allow for the separate control of the lights. The light isn't overpowering and shouldn't affect the image created by the projector unless it's sitting in close proximity to the projected image.
They are 120mm fans which will fit most all case fans. Usually if the fan is an abnormal size, the fan comes with the case. Your case has about 5 spots for a 120mm or 12cm fan. So, yes, they will fit your case.
yes it comes with the connection wires
Depends on what you mean by "turn the alarm off". I have only used the radio, so when it comes on you press the power button to turn it off. To not have it go off, press the Alarm 1 (or Alarm 2, if that's the one) button repeatedly until the little pictograph for alarm and sound are both off on the display.
No it has a regular wall plug. Not good quality wouldn't recommend
Yes
I would trust the information from Arduino.cc about the board specs. The board is compatible with PoE but does not come with the PoE adapter. You will need to purchase the proper PoE adapter separately. The PoE adapter goes in the diagonal pads between the Ethernet port and the USB port.
No it will not fit the sony hdr-xr260v. It has a 37mm filter size and the smallest this set fits is 46mm
I had nothing but trouble with it and could never get it to work correctly. I would suggest staying away from this one.
It has a 30 day free trial of Microsoft Office 2013. After the 30 days, unless you pay, you will have to use wordpad or notepad.
It is a bit tricky but can be done if you are very careful. Using a micro screw driver (jeweler's screwdriver) carefull pry up one side (usually side with the screw works best). Carefully slide screwdriver along side just prayed up to release retaining clips on the cover. The cover is flexible and can be bowed slightly to allow other sides to pop free. Just be careful not to use too much force or you can break the tabs off
Yes, Full right on the speed control will cut all power.
It does not and I believe there is always a minute pulse-signal sent to whatever is being controlled.
No speakers and no antenna jack. This is computer monitor, not a TV. There is no tuner. There are displayport and hdmi jacks.
touch is touch it's like a mouse plug it in and it works but is it ceritified it should say that if it is. But it works flawlessly with windows 8.1
Yes
It will record your friends voices. If you changed your settings. But to record your voice you need another microphone to plug into the unit it's self.
Yes
sim http://www.tecmundo.com.br/refrigeracao-liquida/
No. It is not.
I use it for this exact purpose as well. I paired it w a 4130 i3 proc which has a gpu on the proc. Killed two birds w one stone!
No. this laptop is windows 8.
A 30 day free trial. Then you can either buy office or sign up up for office 365 at $10 a month. You could also get openoffice at openoffice.org, which is free.
No it does not. However it does posses all required slots/ports to install one yourself.
Hey Joey I don't think that it matters since you can change all the voltage for the RAM in the BIOS or the application AMD Overdrive. Also when i first booted up my computer after the build with this board it auto clocked my ram at 1.35v so i think your golden for this M.B
I didn't have any issue with a bad smell or odor.
The camera prints them Immediately after you take the picture
i dont think so its just clear transparent :)
Charger is not included with Battery. A Battery and Charger come with the Blower.
According to the 'Snow Joe' web site, one of their cordless mowers is 24 volt. The other, the iON16LM, mower does use the same battery as the snow blower.
Hello Anthony and thank you for your interest in our product, this specific unit has a back Mounting Bracket (Footprint size 4-1/2" w x 1-1/2" h) and mounts with anchors and screws (included in shipment) to the wall. Please feel free to contact me for further assistance. Thanks again Andrea
Hello Angie and thank you for your interest in our products, unfortunately all of our tablet holders are manufactured for Apple IPads. I do apologize for any inconvenience and as always do feel free to contact me with questions. Thank you Andrea
They do not have a mic
I used them on their sides for a day and liked it. I stood them up because of desk space. Other than that, I see no reason not to use them I their sides. The instructions suggest that you can use them on their sides. Like any electronics, I would give them some air space around them so they don't get too hot.
YES ......... It can be used without lights. It is a GREAT product!!!
Put it in a bobcat bucket, lift it up n down 11 times, remove it from the bucket, it still should look the same, now take a 22oz. Hammer n smash it to pieces.
Yes it does ;)
A uv or polarizing filter. But to be honest with you, you don't need one for the gopro. Only if you r scuba diving or snorkeling
You must remove the grip to change out cards. No card slot in the grip
IT IS A SMART CHARGER
No. It is not a Dell battery!! No Dell warranty! I will not get it from this seller and the battery is not what it claimed to be. I requested a return/refund, but no response from the seller! The bettery didn't last 2 hours when I first got it, and it reduced to only a few mins of use without charging in a month.
This Tablet can only fit 1 micro SD card up to 32GB. Any higher than that and the tablet doe's not recognize it.
The head does screw off
Your Battery Life Extender setting might be on. If it is, the battery charges only to 80%. You can check that by going to start menu--&gt;all programs---&gt;samsung---&gt;easy settings---&gt;general
Yes, it is. However, I am not sure that the battery is good for your laptop because of the running time of the battery for your laptop after 100% charging. For me, this battery only last less than 2 hours compared with the original battery, which was used for more than 3 hours, from my samsung NP-Q430 laptop.
It sounds as if the install program cannot use Java. I suggest perhaps installing the latest version of Java (32 bit) may solve your problem. If you have done so verify the version of the driver you are attempting to install is compatible with the version of Windows you have. If these suggestions do not help, sorry I have nothing else to offer given the information provided. The comment about completely deleting driver files after uninstalling a driver is valid.
Yes it does, however I recommend you wait a hair, EVGA just released newer verisions of the SLI Bridge, which will work even fast on our GTX 900 series graphics cards! Go to www.evga.com for more info
Audiovox just announced that the Audiovox mobiletv receiver is now compatible with the Kindle Fire HD/HDX tablets!
You can use the SiriusXM app on your iPhone or IPad and set the clock to wake to that. You cannot use just the clock/radio for SiriusXM as it has no internet connectivity on it's own.
Yes, it is Multi-touch screen.
Yes it does. Overall a nice looking case but the plastic frame that holds the device has already chipped away in some areas. This is only after very mild use.
Gray. Overall, it's not a good mouse. The side buttons will click on their own eventually, and it's not actually "wireless" it has to either be wired in, or you have to use the incredibly long wire in conjunction with a chunky wireless hub/charging station.
the mouse works wirelessly only if the charging dock is connected to the pc. the charging dock is not small, and it's a shame that this mouse does not have a nano transceiver.
Indeed the 65w will work fine.
All we see on a Dell 97 is 8.5Ah
No, I purchased it for my apple mini iPad. And the fit was very snug. I returned it.
exact size of the mini ipad like 8 inches long
It's too bad you can't record to a computer or DVR of your own. This is the best camera I've seen, but not being able to record my own video to my own device is a deal breaker.
This model has the keyboard
Yes. It's one way of transferring data from a PC. You can also transfer data via the included mini usb cable.
1024 x 768
Contrary to what Nextbook says, there isn't one.
Thanks for your question. The manufacturers we represent provide us 110V product with serial numbers and warranties for USA use. This is a fantastic sounding system. World Wide Stereo is 35 years old and a very proud Harman Kardon dealer.
Great read and yes, it does have the kindle app! It works fast depending on the signal. The only thing that's kind of irritating is it slides off your lap. Still a great item though.
Defender is thicker w/ built in screen protector. Hard plastic on the inside silicon on the outer layer. And it comes with a belt clip / phone stand. Commuter has no built in screen protector silicon is on the inside hard plastic outer layer. And no clip I have cracked my screen (not severly) even w/ the commuter
Yes
Can't answer that but I find it works great in s Florida on the intrecoastal
It is about 12" dia. and 6" from mounting boss to top
Unless you know something I don't, this antenna doesn't receive radio signals.
Where you normally plug your cable or antenna.
The ones in my area appear to be about 30-35 miles away. Not sure how far away it will pull in signals.
Yes, If have an HDTV, there is no need of STB because STB is inbuilt in the TV set.
Just a trial version of Office 365. However, please read the reviews. I returned mine. I couldn't even get office to load, you can't multi task on it....it can't handle it! Save yourself the hassle and look for another laptop.
On the Acer, the command to disable the touch pad is Function key(FN) in blue color and the F7 key. On the Lenovo it is a special function you turn off in Control Panel. Windows 8.1 also has a couple of add-on software apps that perform this function. Hope this helps you. On laptops the touch pad is a pain for those of us who have big thumbs.
There's a dial you can turn it to whichever length you want from 30sec to 10min I think. Also another dial for sensitivity of light for how bright the around it to trigger the motion. If there's enough light motion will not turn your light on
Just download it from the market app.
I wouldn't recommend it for gaming.
To answer your question ... It depends. I purchased this laptop for my nephew who is a student and using the internet for online class activity. It is not a very fast machine and I would not recommend it for gaming. But for internet usage which depends more on your connection speed, it meets his needs.
Save your or someone else's life and just drive.
I play skyrim on high details with a resolution of 1600 x 900 and get 60fps.
It has Netflix, but it rarely works. It constantly gives an error message. I now have a Samsung and I highly recommend that brand. LG's customer service is terrible too. I basically have a brand new, useless LG player.
No only Netflix and Vudu. But the LG BP330 (without 3D) has Premium Content, Netflix, YouTube, Hulu Plus, Vudu, CinemaNow, Pandora, Picasa and AccuWeather.
Hi Julio, Well I live in Australia, and have a holiday home in the USA, in Oz the best players for DVD Multi-Zone are Panasonic Blu-Ray Recorders and Players, have not test this out on the LG yet?...so this is an unknown so far..will be test an Australian zone DVD when I get back to US in July....
I am having the same issue. I check the network connection and it is fine. I can pick a movie in the Netflix app so I am connected to Netflix. I contacted Netflix and they gave me a list of lg blu ray players that they said LG provided them and this is not one of them. I've also contacted LG to see what their response is but I haven't gotten a response yet. Has anyone used Netflix with this blu ray player? If so, how did you activate it?
no it doesn't but still great tv for the price ...
I've never used that function but if the files appear to be unique/proprietary, my best guess is that they'd be compatible with another version. Depending on your ultimate goal (stick with Roxio or not) it might be best to save the files, back-up the files, possibly explore conversion software options.
After you order it.
Only after it updates. I'm always changing the settings between movies, TV, and gaming it doesn't bother me as much
Though never tried to completely remove the cushion, it appears to be removable. I just tried and was able to separate the leather cushion though it might be difficult to replace. I would not believe that there is any user "removable ability" to the outside plastic casing. Hope this answers your question. One fine set of headphones which seems to deliver on all counts and bits. Regards, Short term listener.
Yes they are.
It took 2 days via amazon prime.
There are only two kinds, if you have an older version it will have a larger connector that is 1 inch wide called a 30 pin. The newest iPads have a lightning 8 pin connector, they are approximately 1/3 of an inch... Be careful when ordering a connector the cheap ones don't always last very long. Read the reviews!
Yes it is difficult, and not any easier under water I'm afraid. And, without the audible feedback you're not sure if you are focusing or taking a picture. You end up just shooting from the hip so to speak and hoping you bring up something memorable. I was unsuccessful both in the pool and surf despite having used the auto color correction. The only real benefit of this camera is not having to worry about it getting wet, which is a judge plus in inclement weather street photography.
No. But you can add an external one via USB. This unit is not much bigger than the hard drive itself. There would be no room.
Hello, No, it does not have Touch Screen. Best regards, Amuras
Unfortunately the CF-53SJCZYLM is End-of-Life and out of production. While you may be able to find a few around they will no longer be manufactured by Panasonic. The current model available is CF-532JCZYCM which ToughRuggedLaptops has in stock and can custom configure to your needs (extra RAM, SSD drive, 4G LTE, Windows 7/8 64-bit). Feel free to message us directly and we'd be more than happy to help you out! Thank you!
No. The warranty only covers manufacturer's defects. The seller may offer an additional insurance / warranty against accidental damage.
Processor is I7-4790 3.6 GHz up to 4.0 Thank you
I have not found a traditional stand type case to fit this device. But I bought a beautifully printed laptop sleeve on EBay that fits like it was made for it (search for "Laptop Sleeve Bag Soft Case Cover") and this stand, which although it seems unlikely, does a great job of holding it vertical or horizontal in various upright and tilt positions: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D856NOG/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1. These two items together cost less than the case I bought for my previous tablet and fulfill the same needs.
You need a separate power source . 4 wires total into each speaker.
IPad Air 2. However Blason also marks one for the air pad.
No only the air
Insert a butter knife and it will loosen and pop out, it will become easier! Mine was stiff at first, but now works perfectly with my fingernail .
If you're referring to the end that goes into the phone, mine measures 7mm. It works great with my iPhone 5.
No. This is the direct connect to the later generation iPhone/iPad.
It needs to be sent to the company to be fixed or taken to a local repair person
It does not unfortunately.
Yes, it has three, read the specs
Yes it does.
4/5 hours if you use power saver mode, or low brightness. Its a little on the short side bc of the touch screen.
Hi Jeannie, The PlayMG offers everything a smartphone offers, it is just not a phone. The PlayMG is the first hand held entertainment system for Android. You can download thousands of apps from Google Play (most are free), play music, watch videos, youtube, Netflix...the list goes on and on. You will LOVE the PlayMG!
sorry no
Yes
Does not seem to work w/ digitizer pen (eg. on onenote). Tried on my Lenovo x230t... works on laptop, but not on external monitor (doesn't recognize eraser tip or pen button). screen is very sensitive though... can use anything to write on it.
No, you can not.
It's not a "selfie" stick, it's a monopod.
yes, I can Skype!
Yes I do for sure as long as the printer and lab top are on the same wire less network even remotely with an app from my printers manufacturer
The only thing I have usrd it for is transmitting from one tv to another in the bedroom. Picture quaity is ok but not excellent.
Yes, the PIR Motion Detector comes with a mounting bracket that can be used either flat to the wall or in the 90 degree corner. It also includes 3 tape strips and 4 screws for your choice of mounting. I used a couple of command strips to mount mine in case I wanted to relocate it after using it for a while. The command strips worked great as the unit is pretty light.
The other answer is just wrong. He only has the illusion of it working some of the time. The fact is motion sensors (of this type) do not function through glass. (First paragraph on placement) http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_infrared_sensor (See last paragraph) http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/household-safety/security/question238.htm
Yes it is. Works great with the phone.
Don't know.
Yes, I think so. It's a beast. It doesn't leave the house much. Desk, couch, bedroom is about all the carrying around it gets. I will never take it on a plane.
Yes. I'm currently using Win 8.1 with all updates and everything is fine on 2.4 and 5 Ghz. Personal note...Don't forget to use the "WLAN" control center software that came with the dongle. It simplifies things. Also, my router is the Asus AC1900. Pricey but, worth every penny. It's a home network beast. It is able to broadcast on both bands at the same time. I had another router that said it worked on both bands. Sadly, not at the same time. Make sure your router can deliver whatever your looking for.
Yes. After a myriad of attempts, I gave up and purchased a Netgear A6210, which does not use a Realtek chipset. I never looked back since.
Yes and a nice case too
All the fans are 3 pin, and come with molex pass through (male/female) adapters which allow for daisy chaining to a single PSU hookup. This applies to all HAF Stacker products currently. I own the 935 and two 915F modules in a single stack.
I actually have the same issue. I have to power cycle it twice a month at least. I had a previous model (not the AC model) that worked for over a year without a power cycle. I was thinking of making use of the ability to schedule a reboot weekly...but I don't think it should be happening this often.
Yes it can handle all voltages (it is just a standard switchmode power adapter which you can substitute for an aftermarket one if you don't have american power sockets). Yes it works with G & N.
Extender amplifies a wi-fi network. Access point creates a wi-fi network from a wired network, meaning you need an ethernet cable in, to get wi fi out. The biggest pros is that it starts from a perfect signal, and also there's less interference and lost packages than an extender wi fi -&gt; wi fi. The con is you need an Ethernet cable at the point you plan to put the access point at. If you can get the cables there, I definitely recommend the access point instead of the Extender.
Computer has a stylus, does not scratch the screen. I use a mat screen protector for better care even.
Yes and no. Steelseries claimed it was fixed but sent me an RMA with the same issue. They recently announced a new Siberia Elite headset line (you can find it on their website), which one would assume, has fixed the old Siberia Elite issue, along with better microphones and whatnot. It appears like they might be abandoning the obviously defunct SE and moving on with the newer model. However, that doesn't mean there aren't decent pairs of SE still out there. I'd buy at your own risk.
It is not double-din (100 mm high) - the Sony specs list the height as single-din (50 mm) and that describes my unit.
It depends on the size of your old radio. It is a single din stereo so it will fit as long as you are willing to do all the wiring and getting a bracket to fill in and/or attach the radio to. It also does not have a CD player.
well, i'm using the Samsung 9, so as a preference you know what the answer is.
The screen is always connected to the keyboard. when it is "open," the screen merely slides up at an angle and is held in place a that angle. This is not a typical laptop in that the screen is always exposed. It does not fold over onto the keyboard.
It came with the battery and charger. I returned it however because it wouldn't power my Canon Speedlite 550EX as advertised. It tried a 24hour charge, two different flash units and cables without success. I didn't have time to continue experimenting and went back to the Quantum QB1+ event though the ProPac was lighter and more ergonomic. I may try again hoping it was just a bad unit.
no
Yes
Hi, Yes, you can.
The pan and tilt is built in.
Yes. It fits perfectly!
I have a samsung ativ 9 plus. my friend has a macpro 13" and it wworksreally well. A great case.
Width: 13.5" Height: 9.5"
This isn't a CD player. It connects to phones, digital music devices and computers.
I don't think it sleeps (ie: the display turning off), though I haven't really paid much attention to it since it is used as a kitchen stereo. Pretty sure it does always stay lit up. It isn't very bright, but if you are using it near your bed and are sensitive to any form of light while sleeping it could be an issue.
the case only has room for two 3.5 drives and has one 5.25 drive way normally for a optical drive. i wouldn't use this to create a NAS device i think it's overpriced and limited to the number of disks you can have. if your in this price range why not get a qnapp turbonas ? there atom powered have decent amount of memory and you can still run basic daemons since it has a linux kernel like bitorrents etc.
Yes it does. The "REST" is build into the on-off switch.
I have not found that functionality and have been using the device for a few months now.
Very easy to connect and it holds tight. This guy has a great review and shows how it connects: http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/11/garmin-forerunner-depth-review.html. I love my new 220, I had a 405 for years and the 220 is a wonderful upgrade!!
The HRM is a Garmin HRM3-SS.
It was a gift and the recipient has yet to swim with it, but that was a big selling point for me since it would be used in triathlon. According to all of the specs it is rated for water, I just wouldn't use it is you're a scuba diver.
I suppose you can pair a foot pod to the 620 but I'd say it's unnecessary. The new 620 and its hr monitor are capable of calculating steps, cadence, speed, average ground contact and average stride lenght accurately without the need of a foot pod. Pretty cool!!!
The watch can track and show both. The watch only shows 3 items on a screen at once, so I set it to scroll through the screens while I run. That way, I can see more data. Hope that helps.
yes you can
The keyboard is not backlit
There are 4 3.0 ports
I don't think so. It's a good product.
Yes it does.
Sorry, don't know.
The v1 and v2 are very different, V1 = 600mhz single core CPU, V2 has 800Mhz dual core, the v1 has 2 USB 2.0 , v2 has 1 usb 3.0 and 1 usb 2.0 The v1 has 128mb memory whilst V2 has 256mb. So theres a big difference between the 2, hence the question.
It worked fine in that regard but most of the keys stopped working after 6 months. I would not buy again.
I have to unplug the device and plug it back in every single time I turn on my TV. I assumed it was something with our old Hitachi TV. The TV would display "invalid sync signal". After plugging back in, the TV will flash, but come on in about 2-3 seconds. It works - it's just a bit of a hassle to start it each time. Better than not having it though.
We have used about 40 at all times in construction for over 4 years and have had no breakage except the belt clip which you can buy for about $5 from Amazon. The other problem is sometimes the rubber gasket will get loose but that is after couple of years or if you take it in and out of the hard cover a lot
No you can't .It won't fit on an iPad air 2
Yes, the cord come in two parts so you can use a regular electrical outlet or USB.
I would imagine the reason is because the black case is more unisex then the pink one. My wife loves the pink case cause she likes girly stuff. But I'm sure a lot more people like the black one because it's more discreet. Quality wise they are identical. Excellent case. Very durable.
Hello Victor, No it does not. But the larger strobe siren does. Thanks! www.FortressSecurityStore.com
Whatever you plug 10 external USB drives or just a single , performance is always the best
The cable provided will work fine, just not as rapidly.
I'm assuming they're just stickers to place over all if the keys individually and a backing sticker, however, it wasn't what I was looking for so I gave it away and never actually got the chance to install it! Sorry I couldn't be much help
You can run any kind of game from it.
Yes absolutely
It does not.
Yes. That was my reason for purchasing this item.
it exactly fits my lenovo yoga 2 pro LAPTOP (the one that can tilt it's screen back and becomes a tablet).
Yes
It doesn't have a sticker for the home button.
Yes, it will fit the new iPad mini with retina display.
I did not pay for shipping with Prime. Sorry I couldn't help.
A tab/strap to remove the battery if you need to take it out once it's installed. You can cut it off but you may have a heck of a time trying to remove it from the modem if it's cut off. I left mine on and would suggest you do the same.
On my unit, when I unplug the 120v cord, only the phone portions continues to work. The ethernet and wireless shut down.
Yes it does
It is a very good quality synthetic leather
1600x900 yes it is touch. I love this laptop
Yes, I just did it a few minutes ago. The file was 7.67gb, took about 2 minutes and 40 seconds to copy. I got mine for $39.99 before Christmas, wish I had bought a couple more! Great and fast drive!
Yes - there is a HDMI port

Blue tooth allows you use a blue tooth device like wireless/blue tooth speakers which are great... We use it to play Pandora Radio and listen while the tablet is 10ft or more away from the speakers.
download the GPS app and use that, no problem
its a great board, has everything you want in a motherboard and then some. Im OC everything CPU, Memory and GPU.
This comes with built in wireless.
According to the Dell manual at ftp://ftp.dell.com/manuals/all-products/esuprt_display_projector/esuprt_Display/dell-e2414h_User's%20Guide_en-us.pdf, the E2414H comes with a DVI cable while this one does not.
5 ms - adequate for most gaming.
Yes, I am currently using one on my Raspberry Pi... touch requires a USB connection also, but the monitor has two USB ports to make up for the one it uses. However, I am a little disappointed with touch on Rasp Pi though. I'm currently using Raspbian, it is taking some tweaking to get things like double-tap to work reliably. It works, just don't expect it to be as simple as a tablet to use.
Just plug and play.
not at all it is strictly indoor use.
Hi Larry, It does have zoom, but be aware that many of the functions can not be utilized by your Iphone or android, only your home computer. It is a software problem that they have yet to fix. Also, you have no support in the US and all communications and instructions are I Chinglish, so your on your own.
Yes
My Dell computer came with the NVIDIA GTX 660 PCI Express with 1.5 gb of memory. Hope it helps you!
RCA banana plug.
No
I used 1.35v Crucial 8GB RAM, I've heard that it this laptop is hit or miss with 1.5v RAM.
Just bought this ....it has windows 7
About 6 inches
Very smooth.. The lowest I can get from shaders mod is 58 FPS. Highest 450FPS maybe higher if low settings.
No. Those would be a separate purchase.
no ssd
No, it doesnt. This is a great monitor system though. We previously had a different system and this moves better and shows so much detail on the monitor.
Yes with the DJI Ground Station: http://www.dji.com/product/ipad-ground-station/spec
The card reader is used to read (playback) music you have recorded on a card using your computer or other recording device.
you dont dl anything it just plays mp3
No .
I got a different case form my D7000, the Case Logic SLRC-201 SLR Zoom Holster (Black) because it has a sling in it that suspends the camera so it doesn't beat itself on the bottom of the case, plus I can put my battery charger in it and it has a bunch of outside zipper pockets. It fits fine withthe 70-300 lens. The Evercase Grey case fits my D3200 with the 18-105 lens on it and the 70-300 next to it because the body is smaller. I preferred a beefier case for the D7000.
It's red.
You have to hold shift.
128GB is built-in or internal installed inside the player. Also, you can't swap it out for bigger one.
I can't find a Sony product that is a 64GB N17, so can't answer your question.
It does and does not. It will work for chat audio but you will get no game audio through it. As they are over-ear headphones, it kind of nullifies the point.
Inquiry Thank you. SONY F series Walkman NW-F886 (B) 32GB Black (Japan Import) You there does not appear to be extended a mini SD card. Please consider.
5V, Ground and Data are the only three pins used on each one and they are clearly marked on each piece. You'll have to contact the manufacturer for schematics.
hi friend, many customers use this item as fill light. Maybe it's not enough bright as a key light.
We're writing to inform you that this keyboard case is fit for NEXUS 7.
its fast - I would think yes with no issue.
I'd have to guess that the older and newer versions ship under the same SKU. If you happen to get older stock, you'll probably get the slightly faster CPU. I'm really doubt a .3 GHz bump would really make a difference in the real world. http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/2/5266988/surface-pro-2-intel-i5-processor-updated-specifications
Yes it does
The $150 kit includes 1 ethernet over coax adapter (model ECB2500C) in addition to the wireless network extender (model WCB3000N). The kit is aimed at those who do not already have a MoCA network set up. You would connect the smaller device to the home router and to the home coax wiring, then connect the wireless network extender wherever you want in the house where there is a coax outlet.
My co-worker just tested with his Galaxy S3 - running Jellybean 4.3. It works - both volume adjustments and pause/play. The headphones come with 2 headphone cables with 3.5 mm jacks on each end - the S700a (for android phones - it has black insulators between the tip/ring/sleeve on the connectors) - and an S700i (for iPhones/iPads/iPods - it has white insulators between the tip/ring/sleeve on the connectors). There's also a USB charging cable. Oh - and there is also a VERY nice case included. Hope this helps.
The VS980 is thicker because of the wireless charging feature and the buttons are slightly different. I called the Case-Mate customer service to verify that they make a case for the Verizon model of the G2. They do NOT. Despite what some websites are indicating, there is not a case available for the VS980 at this time. Too bad - it looks like a great case.
The back is hard plastic with texture. It doesn't catch on pockets.it's a great case.
It swivels aproximately 30-35 degrees from center.
This stand is very sturdy -- no wobble at all! -- and it supports my 60" Sharp Aquos TV with no problems.
It seems like there is just one speaker located on the back right side. The sound is insufficient for myself and it can get fairly high. The battery life will last many hours with continuous use especially if you have the dock attached. Battery was no issue at all. Hope this helps and Good luck!
No, the only thing that lights up is the caps lock key. Also, the edges of each key remain sticky and attract lots of dust and hair.
Yes. The dock will not interfere with using Bluetooth devices, like the adapter.
Yes
This is my first set and I'm very happy with it... And yes for your question!
No it does not.
No it will not work on 220V
There isn't a pre-designed way to mount it on a wall. It only has 4 rubber stoppers on the bottom to help prevent sliding on a flat surface. If you had a strong mounting strip, like the sticky type, perhaps you could wall mount it. Not sure how good it would hold.
I charge my iPhone, iPad at the same time and have never received a slow charge warning. I have not tried 3 devices at once, though. Hope that helps.
No
It is standard focus. I have a 120 inch screen and the projector is mounted about 11 feet away. You can go to the Optoma website, put in the model number, and pull up specs for throw distance and offset. It is very helpful.
Mine Just Got Updated To Kitt Katt On 5/14/2014 Looking Good
19 7/8"
Yes.
Yes it is basically a computer so you can install anything that you can install on a real computer on it.

The Dell Venue Pro 11 on this edition uses the Intel HD integrated graphics based on the processor.
tablet. power cord, and usb cable. no manual. all dell items do not come with manual. you can download from their website. http://ftp.dell.com/Manuals/all-products/esuprt_tab_mob/esuprt_tablets/dell-venue-11-pro_User's%20Guide_en-us.pdf
You connect the Sony HAP to your network and transfer the files over the network it will work with wireless or wired.
Try a new male to male 3.5 cable, also make sure your connections are tightly fitted as no one enjoys a really loose hole. If all else fails you can simply launch the Apple product into the Sun and get something that supports Bluetooth =]
There is a new Type Cover keyboard designed specifically for the Surface 3 that would also be sized to fit the Surface 3 when closed together. That is what you would want, the Type Cover for Surface 3 (Not Surface Pro 3 Type Cover)
I can confirm that it is identical to the pen/stylus that came with the surface. It has the magnetic connection.
Yes, Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse works with Mac OS X Lion. For more information I would suggest you to contact Microsoft hardware support. It is a great mouse, I use one with my Surface RT
These are Bluetooth devices - no USB
Surface pro 2 is a fully functional windows 8.1 laptop / ultrabook in a tablet! It is just slightly heavier than the previous iPad (not the air, which is 300g lighter), but it is no comparison regarding features and capability. So it depends what you want. I have obviously opted for the surface. As I travel a lot for work , now I do not need to carry with me both a tablet and a laptop. I only need now surface pro 2!
I don't know about the origami case I have one that has a auto sleep and wake up function and it does not bother it as all I love mine it's better that any other screen protector I have used
Hello, to be honest I don't think this case work with that model. The fitting it's very tide. I'm sorry I don't have a better answer for you.
15-15.6
Sure, looks like a pump but it fit good and can put more thing like note paper and pens
Yes it is. I just bought the system and it's awesome. Delivered to Australia where we use 230V. The AC power adaptor is dual voltage. 110Vac/60Hz 230Vac/50HZ.
The floor stand has a heavy base and should work on a carpeted floor, unless it has a very deep pile. You need four. Two for the front channel, and two for the rear channel. The front center speaker should sit directly in front of and below the TV.
Hello Brijesh: The Lifestyle Media center comes with a power supply in the box that is rated at: 100-240v, 50/60Hz - Output: 12vDC, 2.92A . The bass module itself has a built in power supply that is rated at: 100-240 Volts, 50/60 Hz. Yes, you can buy a system in the USA and safely use it in India.
No
I am pretty sure you can, but since I gave this as a gift I will forward this question to the recipient.
Yes. Use Chrome Remote Desktop, available for free in the Chrome web store.
There is an FN key, but it does not look like function keys. I don't know if there is a way to use other keys for this purpose, but it it is not indicated on the keyboard.
Nope, not at all. I setup my mother with her existing gmail account, which connects to her free Google Drive. The only reason you would need to pay for any of that free storage is if you need more. Even Skydrive and Dropbox have web interfaces, so you can still access those from Chromebook as well.
It's a bit more orange than displayed.
Hi: No it is not wife capable but it is wifi capable.
Yes. Essentially, the main purpose of the Chrome OS is to access the internet which includes e-mail. I use mine to access Yahoo mail, Outlook mail, Juno mail, Gmail and others.
My kids have them, as of the last couple of weeks no they have not.
I formatted a thumb-drive as Linux EXT4 format and copied a 500MB Mpeg-4 video to the drive. I unmounted it from my Linux system and plugged the drive into my Chromebook 14-Q USB3 port (on the left edge). When I did that a "file browser" opened up and it showed the file listing of my video. When I double-clicked on the MP4 file the video played with audio. I was very pleasantly surprised. Depending on your storage media format and your video recording format, your mileage may vary. Good luck!
It does support Amazon Prime videos. I've logged into my Amazon account and watched a movie as I would on any other computer with a browser.
yes but they are stupid ones
Please contact us for a specific one or we can guide you on how to use the functions step by step.
The item has an alarm clock and hourly chime functions, and also can act as a stopwatch for use.
Dear friend Package size &#65306;20cm long,10cm wide,5cm high Coolpanda
Dear friend it's not a water resistant Coolpanda
I don't use the pedometer very much but I think you can set it to run all the time until you "erase" and return to zero. Suggest you contact Pixnor and ask.
No. It is just a wrist watch.
Yes
As long as iPad 1 has Bluetooth yes.
I have not tried it with the Kindle Fire Phone, but it works via bluetooth - I use it with iPhone, iPad and iPod. So if your phone has bluetooth, it should work. Hope my answer helps you
Key stroke sound is there. Unfortunately your keystrokes are not always as intended however..touch fidelity not 100% . Missed strokes and unwante multiple strokes
No, they do not.
Thank you so much for contacting us. The Komando Dash Cam runs about 30 to 60 minutes when not plugged in, depending upon use. As far as camera orientation, that's all up to you. Many people like to use the wide angle lens to the rear of the vehicle, however while the other camera faces front. I hope that information is helpful. Thanks again for contacting us!
I have not had this problem.
Hello, These are the stats for the graphic card. NVIDIA GTX650 1GB graphics card
Yes it is. I use it on my wife's Galaxy 3 and my 5
the case is insulated very well.
For my asus x550L 15.6 inch I got the 15-15.6 bag and it fits more than comfortably.
This comes with a usb cable and a wall plug adapter.
No
No it doesn't.
Not sure. I don't use the built-in speakers. I just connect the external speakers to the source (laptops, tablets, DVD players, TV cables etc...). I have various Bluetooth speakers that also have an RCA input connector so they work with just about all devices.
I should work just fine. The new lights on it work amazingly well even during daytime. I do recommend it. The fan is a bit noisy though at full power but most projectors are noisy as well. I really discourage you to consider any brookstone mini projectors. They are expensive and have less power.
55 inches or about 4.5 feet
Yes
Not exactly what you are asking. Are you assuming that since there are two in the picture, they are selling two cases? The reason for the two images is so that they can show you what it will look like with the recorder inside the case. So for $12.99 you only get one case. Or are you assuming that since one of the photos shows the recorder inside the case that the recorder comes with the case? If so, then no the recorder is sold separately (for $149.99). Hope this helps :)
I don't know, I'm sorry, since I do not have a Model ICD-SX733, and I don't know what its dimensions are. But I can tell you that it fits the model that I have like a "glove," the Sony ICD-PX312. I hope this helps some---Jerry.
Your right men, this are like inch smaller and the holes are not accurately place. Beat advise , and what I did . I check where I bought my Beats and ask them if they know where could I order that specific replacement.
Yes, I use the NP-970 and the NP-550.
It will work on any camera that has a hot shoe. This is a self powered light and not powered from the camera battery. I use it on my tripod to project light on my subject to create shadows or even fill light.
Yes it does, but you may want to know that will block the front camera, that doesn't bother me since I don't use it but thought may be good to know.
Yes, if you have the latest iteration. Frankly don't like it as well as others I've used in the past: no instructions: smudges easily.
We have a lot of Nixeus monitors, and none have integrated webcams.
That won't work. This monitor has neither an HDMI input (needed for Chromecast) nor an audio out. It has one port only: a DisplayPort input. That port carries a video signal only. If you still wish to use this as a monitor, make sure your computer has a DisplayPort output. For audio, you will need to use separate speakers connected to your computer, not the monitor.
No
That's true of all tablets because they have LCD screens and the backlight can't compete with the sun. Actually this one is better than a lot of them outdoors but it's still not that good. Barry
No
I've had mine for a few weeks and it seems to be working fine
Yes. The processor fits in a FM2 socket. This motherboard has a FM2+ socket which is compatible with both FM2 and FM2+.
I used 5/8 outer diameter and have it cooling a intel xeon and an r9 290. The card never reaches over 35 celsius! Its a great pump/res. Very quiet. Hard to fill, be patient and slow when filling or it will run out due to air blocking the fill port. Also look around for the xspc d5 pump ring (google it). Makes the pump look so much better without pump modding know-how.
None. YouTube and web videos are fine.
May be Japan made it.
Yes. I have had a computer had a 500GB plus a 1.5TB. And another with 2 SSDs which are relatively small volume and a 2TB HD. As long as you have the power and connectors you are free to add in as many of any size as you want.
Just make sure that you aren't going to use it as master boot, windows won't use more then to 2tb and the other 2tb are unusable.

It shouldn't matter... Is it mounted? If not it may be vibrating the case... If it's temporary insulate the case with a folded up paper towel or something soft and see. If it's mounted you got me. Mine is in a power rig for animation... My case has a pump cooler and like 6 fans when it's cranked up.
SSD's are basicaly for fast booting of your OS system. For storage go to your Hard drives! That is my recomendation
It all depends on your equipment and how much space you take up. Personally I don't recommend mixing water and food with expensive Camera's. It might be wiser to take a proper hiking back pack and a smaller bag for your camera and lens that will fit in that bag verus taking this one.
No, this amp receives a Bluetooth signal and amplifies it, outputting it to a pair of speakers
I don't think so. The light stays on for sure. It might have some energy saving mode, but it's not clear.
no idea
No. The only ports are two USB 2.0. However, you can buy an adapter for your memory card that plugs into a USB port for a few bucks. Alternatively, you can pick one of the Acer Chromebooks, which all have SD card slots included, though their overall build quality, screens, keyboards, speakers, etc are inferior to the HP 11, so it is a trade off.
I'm a graduate student and have a Macbook Pro 15" at home as my primary computer. This computer, for the last 6 weeks, has been the computer I carry with my to campus and use in school for note-taking, and other tasks. It's the best thing that's happened to me in terms of classroom efficiency.
They connect to a mobile device like an iphone or iPad. If you are listening to AM/FM why would you buy these? You should probably buy a Walkman or Transistor radio. That was the worst quedtion I have ever answered. In my life. Ever.
Mine has no problems with yellow. And by the way this is the best keyboard I've ever used.
Technically LEDs are one type of LCD, but generally "LCD" refers to CCFL-based LCD displays (that are disappearing from the market). The Samsung spec says this model is LED, which is good.
No. Vga hdmi power. No dvi no usb no audio.
No it doesn't, you'll have to buy an external drive
Nope. The version that comes with the digitizer had a different screen for that specific purpose and other digitizer s work with that model also. The none digitizer version works only with your finger touch.
If it doesn't come with a pen (they put a plug in the hole) then it doesn't come with a digitizer either and there's no way to install a digitizer after you get it. I assume if it does have a digitizer that it will work with any standard pen, but I'm not sure since I've only actually used the pen that was included.
The one i got has no digitizer pen option. The lower resolution one cannot be used with a digitizer pen. But you can use the touchscreen with your fingers or 3rd party capacitive pens.
you only need to determine the 1) number of devices and the 2) types of connectors (HDMI, component) you have. I'm not sure if the range would be a factor for the different models - do you need more range (my components were &lt; 15 feet away)? I can't advise re this. good luck.
It runs off the 18 volt battery pack which does not come with it. You'll have to buy that separate.
My battery lasted about for over 14 hours (staining deck). It recharges using a standard ridgid 18v lithium charger.
Depends how many pictures you take but it definitely seems to last more than twice as long as one battery. Maybe my imagination, but I'm very pleased with battery life using this grip
I have shot two weddings with this camera now. There have been no problems. the camera is fantastic and the images are amazing. Even my DA lenses focus better at low light. The 50-135mm f2.8 is a great wedding lens with the K3 body.
Yes. You can find details about the warranty at: http://www.us.ricoh-imaging.com/support/customer-care/#!warranty-information
Yes
Chris, I do not believe that this is a upgrade for Ultimate. Question, why would your license have expired? You can now download VS 2013 community edition.
No. It is only an upgrade from VS2012.
yes
Yes, you can.
Yes it is
Vehicle Auto Car Fleet GPS Tracker OBD Ii Plug & Track GPS Tracking System Sold by: Spy Spot Investigations I have 2 of these for $89/each, they are great and provide lots of data. No idea what more you can receive for the additional $100.... I recommend saving the money.
They work in my 204 sub
Did you go to advanced settings from the program remote option in the settings menu? Menu, Settings & Help, Settings, Remote Control, Program Remote, Advanced, IR/RF Setup, Remote Type
Yes includes the remote and a warranty card.
You can use a wireless bridge adapter. The cost would likely make this impractical unless you have one lying around or need it for something else. You can also use the ethernet port on a laptop to bridge the wifi internet signal, but this probably isn't practical for extended use from an environmental standpoint. http://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-WNCE2001-Universal-Internet-Adapter/dp/B007CO5DZ4/
There is a tiny reset button that can be pushed with a paper clip. It is located by the power button on top of the camera.
Absolutely Oprah !
Yes of coarse. I love the headphones they sound great and I own more speakers then you can imagine. Also that simple plug together at ear bud feature is awesome cause it helps them not get tangled in my gym bag. Its a standard 3.5 plug I think which plugs in all ipods and phones
This one will pretty much play any game out there on the highest settings as long as you have a modern processor and probably 8gb memory. In my opinion, if you're on a budget to where ~$100 matters, yes, this would be a better buy for now.
Mr. Berwick, Thank you for your question. The max supported resolution for this card according to manufacture spec are : DVI port is 2560x1600, Dsiplay port is 4096x2160, HDMI is 4096x3112. Please feel free to contact if you have any other question.
Yes, no issue with processor compatibility. Check your motherboard and power supply to ensure they are capable. You need PCI Express and at least 400 Watt power supply.
Yes. It will work on any k-mount Pentax camera. One the great strengths (one of many) of the Pentax system, in my opinion, is it's compatibility between lenses and bodies, both new and old.
Some games do like Assassins Creed 4 for example. My friend with a GTX 760 2gb (Which these cards are VERY equivalent you could say they are twins seperated at birth) can run AC 4 on high with a little lag I can run mine on Ultra with a little Anti Aliasing and I can hit 50fps no issue
4 monitors.
I see the current ad states Z3770. When I bought it, it was Intel i3 processor. I can't say which is really current. Just looked it up. The one I bought was 11-6363BLK @ $799.99. Also it had 128 GB SSD, not 64 GB
english only
There are two ends, one end has the mini usb that plugs into the bottom of your phone. The other end is a removable memory stick, either 16 gb or 32 gb... you can plug it into any usb 2.0 slot...
U can copy to smartphones tabs which have OTG facility thru micro usb
I have mine mounted above my head under my plastic roof on my Ranger XP 900. They don't get too wet there, but when washing my ranger the speakers be soaked from rinsing inside the cab with a pressure washer and I've never had any problems with them. I've got 1030 miles on the ranger, have had them installed for every mile and have only blown one fuse. I've helped 3 other buddies of mine install this system on Rangers and haven't had any complaints yet.
There is no Ethernet port. However, there are two USB ports, so you could purchase a USB Ethernet adapter for $15-$30 in order to use a wired Ethernet connection.
No
The frame/edges around the keyboard does not obstruct typing on the keyboard. I believe there are several keyboards from Logitech, but none that allows the ipad to be removed quickly. I am happy with this product.
standard USB to micro-USB cable ...it's included in box.
Yes, this is a Bluetooth keyboard that works with any Bluetooth device.
No. This does not transmit a picture to a TV. It is made to use on a computer that has no monitor attached (headless), which you are driving remotely from another computer. You attach this to the headless computer to make the graphics card on it work properly.
Yes, there is a mode which you can record when there is movement. No movement, it would stop recording.
It is in stock now.
The system can send you the screenshot to you when motion detection is triggered
Not the gopro style ones no. This has a normal tripod mount on the bottom of the waterproof case.
Loosen the battery,Remove the plastic,Installed battery,done!
no
Yes you can download free games and it came with serval preloaded games and has a parent control
No, I only purchased a battery from Amazon!
Had a mms onto or so and its working perfectly
HI THANK YOU --yes --3-years Parts & Labor Warranty and 1 Year Or 2,000 Hours Of Lamp Life---Terry
Depends on the car - or more specifically, the power outlet - on my Tahoe, the outlets are always hot so the GPS would be always on unless I unplug it. Many cars have outlets that are hot only when the ignition key is on, so then the GPS will start up with the car key and shutdown with the car key. The camera is controlled by the GPS unit so I don't think it can turn the unit on.
18489 is the Mfg number for the dark-red Leica
It does NOT have a backplate...
Yes u must have gotten a diffrent model the one I recieved is lightning 5pin charger it fits our iPhone 5 and 6plus phones
You'll need the output to HDMI connector then it should work, though I see many bad reviews for those products. You will need to look around for what works best for you. Alternatively if you have a Google Chromecast should work as well, but that limits you to a few select apps at this time.
Yes. We plug the Garmin into the usb port on a cell phone wall charger.
I did just that and it worked just fine.
You will need: RAM + SSD Drive + Monitor + Mouse + Keyboard + Headphones that's all ;)
As long as you have at 8 gb of memory. I went with 16 gb.
The official website says that it does fit a 2.5" SATA drive. It also shows the bracket mount. Is the model number wrong here?
Possibly, hard to tell from picture. Best to send email to gigabyte tech to know for sure.
Yup
check www.lattezone.com
Sorry to inform you that 64GB micro sd card will not work. Device is only support upto 32GB
Yes, the charger is included
why did you even by from latte. they are the worst online purchase i made.
the system I received came with 7 downgrade but licensed for windows 8.
I believe the computer only had Display Port out and you'll need an adapter. did you use an adapter? http://www.amazon.com/Startech-DP2HDMI-DisplayPort-Adapter-Converter/dp/B0017K6BDW
I purchased a second KTL-TC316S/4G. Kingston Technology 4GB 1600MHz PC3-12800 240-Pin Single Rank DIMM
No
My first reaction is that it is not tough enough. However, a short time ago, I was on a 5 hr. flight and sitting next to me was a four year old with a small tablet. It kept her occupied for the entire flight. For the price, it is a great learning tool, just teach them to take care of it. And don't expect much support because there isn't any.
Luv mine
Yes, it is Bluetooth capable but since I don't have any Bluetooth devices, I have not tried that feature out. I don't plan on using that feature at this time but may in the future. You will love everything else though, I can live without that, for this price.
Yes. Easy to replace too.
This unit has a 1TB HDD. The 1GB listed is an error. A request has been made to have it corrected.
It has four.
no, there is no configuration for this.
No this is not the reference design as it has a custom cooling system, reference designs only point to the cards directly from AMD
No. Sorry. THe radeon 7800 series is a faster unit with better memory bus. It is 256bit instead of the r7's 126bit. This gives the 7800 series twice the memory throughput, the r7 also has less ROPs than 7800. ( ROP = Render Output Processor ) It isnt a huge speed difference, but it will be a noticeable step down. The r7 series is the everyday user series as the r9 are the performance and gamer series.
The card supports three options of input HDMI Dvi d dual link (might be dvi i dual link. Whatever dual link belongs to) And standard rgb input. So there is a possibility for the card to support a 3 monitor input.
Yes, it should work perfectly. The CM1740 got a very recent chipset, so you shouldn't have any problem. I use this VGA in Asus Maximus III Formula with a P55 chipset and no problem so far.
Nope its definitely not possible.
Yes you can turn audio off and will probably consume less data that way. However, I like making random noises so I keep it on so I can laugh at myself later. Another benefit is since the video quality can be lacking, it's helpful to say the license plate out loud if ever in a situation.
It would be perfect for a cruise!
I have not tested that out, and so far neither has my kids. I would think not. But I discarded the packaging.
Better than others.
Yes these are two speakers. I have it hooked up to my tv trough an optical cable .
We also live in the city, and the converter box with antenna work very well, but you have to rotate antenna to get best signal strength, just like any other antenna.
It will pick up all the local available around your area.
yes, Composite Cables (Red and white for left audio and right audio, Yellow for video) and/your regular antenna, it comes with everything you need. I liked it and it worked better than the $70 antenna i bought at best buy!
Yes
It does have a flash it pops up. Takes great pis easy to use as well
Onboard graphics shares memory with RAM. I suppose you could get by with an external HDD (or even a flash drive), but it won't nearly be as fast as mSATA. Consider booting from USB when installing the OS, and imagine doing it everyday.
I just contacted Capstone and they say YES power failure feature will work if unit set to night light low or high setting.
I did not have to - mine is setup in an office with business class routing.
Yes I'm almost positive
I fish shallow lakes, less than 20 ft deep. The smaller screen may be confusing at first, but I think you'd adjust with use.
No tilting monitor.
Not in the camera body. The zoom lenses provided by Fuji have image stabilization, prime lenses do not.
The FN button, function button, will change several functions but under sensitivity would control ISO

There is no internal batter in this unit. It does have to be plugged in to receive power.
Very nice black vinyl..looks like leather. Very nice for the price. Has magnetic closure.
I don't know--I specifically asked for a keyboard to work with a Samsung tablet.
Make sure TV sound is disabled. All sound will come through SoundPlate. It has much better sound than the TV.
it should.. it is a bluetooth keyboard so you just pair it to your tab... the company Newstyle is awesome, and their customer service rocks.. it comes with instructions and was very very easy to figure out. once you get it, if you have questions you can always email me and I will help in anyway that I can :)
No. each camera only able to synchronize with one monitor. Once you sync with another monitor the previous one will lose the signal of this particular camera. From my experience, it appears that each camera is only able to accept one monitor at a time.
I don't think so. There aren't any other ports and the network cable
In my experience, it did not automatically pair with the phone. I have an iPhone 5s. I returned this product and got a similar one from Elgato.
This is a terrible item it does not work.I was also dum enough to buy an Apple product it doesn't work .
Hi, thanks for contacting us. This will work in your system. Unfortunately there is not a 512 mb version. I am sorry and if there is anything else I can do for you or if you have any other questions please let me know. Sincerely, Chris Nickels Red Planet Trading
Hi, thanks for contacting us. This card will work with the Dell Vostro 270. If there is anything else I can do for you or if you have any other questions please let me know. Sincerely, Chris Nickels Red Planet Trading
1 gb.
My own too stopped working . Can someone replace it or refund me my money.
Yes it is compatible with Mac. I had the same question but once assued it works with Mac and Linux, I installed one in my Mac and run Linux on the other. Great drive for the money.
Yes, it takes a 6pin from the PSU.
On the box, it says 500W is the minimum for this video card.
This card uses 2-6 pin for power connection.
I did quite a bit of Googling before I tackled the SSD installation and settled on using EaseUS Todo Backup Free to get Windows, etc., cloned to the new drive. As far as I recall, I had no problems with the installation and cloning process, and I've not had any problems with the PC in the six months or so since I installed the SSD drive.
Yes
At the back of the camera there are 4 mode buttons. Push the second one from the left. This for adjusting brightness. ( L ) is to lighten the picture. ( L+ ) is to make the picture even lighter. ( D ) is to darken the photo. NO icon is default. Hope this helps. STM
Take battery out charge even though it's fully charged but charge again for a few minutes then put battery back in and that should fix the problem. It shouldn't happen again that's what happened the first time I used my camera
Thanks for your question, yes, this product could work with XP desktop. Thank you.
I have no idea if it actually has the chipset you're referring to. Is there a way for me to tell via my printer, which is what I'm using it for?
No it does not have a Web browser.
Sorry, the other answer is wrong. The current e-mount lenses will work on this camera, however they will be in crop mode. This means the camera will detect that it is not a full frame lens and only use part of the sensor. In reverse, the full frame lenses will work on the current NEX line up. In that situation it will just waste the capability of the lens.
It hasn't been field tested to know for sure but it is weathersealed and it should withstand light moisture with normal care.
Hi, Sony Alpha A7K is a derivative from the base model A7. "K" stands for kit lens for which the included kit lens is the SEL2870. As for A7R, its newer version of A7 which gives you 36.8 MP resolution. -Ely
I'm not sure, but I will say I'm not happy with my purchase.
Hello, it will take 2-3 hours to fully charge the battery for the keyboard, and about 36 hours continual working time after full charge.
No... They all come with a mini display port
gave 4 of them to kids for Christmas and all are still working. I think it's great for kids....very short battery life so they aren't on it constantly. Good for ages up to 12 or so.
It is definitely a stand-alone computer. Awesome machine. I have the entire Adobe creative suite 6 on it with Manga Studio 5 on it and it runs very smooth. No lag what so ever. This a spectacular machine and I love it. The only issue I had was my first one the power supply went out on it and they had to send me a new one. I had it back in three days. Other than that it is great, definitely worth the money and you will love it.
I haven't seen any stand or desk mounts for the unit available aside from a custom offering on ebay and the aforementioned junk stand provided by Wacom. Sorry.
If you order from wacoms website directly they offer cintiq setups with the appropriate adapter for your country. Dont know about ordering on amazon though.
Connects through antenna or aux input.
Try the learning mode first, Check the antenna connections. Mine came loose and it made static.
Yes, we bought one as gift for family member in Zimbabwe, they love it.
Yes, you can use it in new jersey
A charger and a micro to usb converter come with the tablet
It does have wifi built in, which means in order to connect it to the internet you have to have access to a wifi connection somewhere! Now if you were asking if it is capable of having its own mobile data plan like the I pad or the Galaxy tablet then NO it doesn't! In order to put it on the internet you have to be somewhere where the internet is available like your home network or coffee shop or McDonalds etc. Hope that helps you out!
I don't think so. Such garbage. Can't even really use mine. GARBAGE!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE!!!
Yes
110 only
Yes you can.
Both the A7 and the A6000 have 3" screens. I have the A7, and know it fits, so I would guess it would fit on the A6000.
Hi M.D., On/Off is to turn on the batteries from the vertical grip. Turn it off when camera is not in use. -Vincent
Hi, this Sony Vertical Grip works only for Sony Alpha A7 and A7R. It is not compatible with your Sony A6000. -Ely
yes, you will need this adapter. you will still have AF and auto exposure.
You want the la-ea2 for the Nex 6. The 4 is for full frame cameras. The focus for my sigma 12-24 is perfect and fast. These units have there own electronics for exposure and focus. The la-ea1 does not and is very slow. So if your sticking with the nex6 go for the 2. If your planning on getting the A7, then go with the 4. Hope that helps.
The f-stop is f/2.8. It's not a wide f-stop, but that allows it to be smaller, lighter, and less expensive given the Zeiss design.
I didn't measure but the glass part is about .5 inches. The lens is very small and very sharp.
It comes with a petal lens hood and soft draw string lens case.
Mine is made in Thailand. It is written on the back of the lenses. Look at the ring where the pin contacts are. Just to make you feel better, I do not think you can ever overpay for Zeiss glass. The 55/1.8 is the best glass I've ever owned. :)
1 USB 2 and 1 USB 3 port. Yes it does have a SD card reader.
Yes, and this is one of the reasons I chose this model since few do anymore.
No, I purchased Microsoft Home and Student for mine.
I think that should be fine e if it's 600 Watts
Disconnect power disconnect lnb, disconnect display. Power back up see if remote works. If so power off hook up display. If that works hook up lnb . These steps will give more information
You should had read my review! The customer Support is Inexistente!!! Do not expect any help!
It didn't work for me at all. The great thing about Amazon, though, is that if you order from them and it doesn't work, return shipping is free.
I have used it for about 2 months and I has worked perfect so far so good.
Do you know which one is the first version, I'm a bit confused for what I have read online. /:
http://www.soulelectronics.com/
One is USB 3.0 (for fast data transfer) and one USB 2.0 Port.
I can't say that the plug would not work up to 36 volts. It really depends on how much current you want to draw through the extension. The difference between your linked cable and this one, if any, is wire size. The wire thickness in this pretty small, I could not tell you exactly. It seems to do fine with a camera amount of current draw, but I'm not sure how much more it could take than that.
35lbs. Is max. Weight
I was starting to see slight wear so I use a fine Baby diaper between when traveling, hope this helps
Yes. It can trigger it. Mochalight
The largest screen I have projected on is a 10' x 20' white tarp hung on a baseball backstop for an outside movie night. Projected in HD 1080p. Image looked great. A 12' x 21' screen with the projector set back 37' in a dark room will still look good. Check out this site for detailed info on screen size. http://www.projectorcentral.com/Optoma-EH500-projection-calculator-pro.htm
Call optoma customer services
regular table should be fine. khl
Yes, but remember each will get a piece of the processing power from the GPU. It is better to run a video card for the these purposes. You can get a decent mid range card for under a hundred bucks. Another consideration is that unless you lower the resolution on HDMI and DVI to that of VGA, your resolution will be inconsistent. This is very annoying when trying to work with multiple screens.
I talked my sister through installing Linux Mint (a branch of Ubuntu) onto hers. She loves it. We used the 64 bit version and upgraded the memory to the entire 16 GB that it holds.
If it has a pci-express slot and power/supply has 6 pin pci plug you should be good to go.Make sure you download drivers and AMD applicable performance programs i.e. AMD catalyst. Good Luck.... Rudy
Yes, it has a port for an auxiliary cable
This means that the monitor is not included in this offer Thank you
Greetings. Could you please help to contact us @ betterstuff.amazon@gmail.com and inform us your order details? So we can ship you a replacement charger.
The drives come exactly like the picture. There is no packaging.
Yes. They are separate.
Yes it should, I would suggest that you pull old screen out to make sure connectors are the same location to plug in to. As well search the model number for the screen that is on the back of the lcd screen when u remove it. Hope that helps.
I have the R9-270 setup in crossfire. When I checked out the other R9 cards, I found this to be a very good deal considering the cost. So far they are solid performers and I am able to play all my games with max settings. Haven't tried some of the newer titles but I am confident in saying you will not be disappointed.
It has a HDMI, DVI and VGA output. This is a VERY nice video card as I have had it for about a month now, and it upgraded a decent card as well. I use it for EQ2 and the graphics are smooth sailing.
Hi, The standard 802.11ac defines max Wi-Fi speed 433.67Mbps per single stream at 5GHz, not 867Mbps. Edimax EW-7811UTC supports 1 stream of 802.11ac ( 5GHz ) with Wi-Fi speed is 433Mbps and 1 stream of 802.11n ( 2.4GHz ) with Wi-Fi speed is 150Mbps. So we call it AC600. And Edimax has the 867Mbps USB adapter as well on Amazon. Edimax EW-7822UAC USB adapter supports two stream of 802.11ac ( 867Mbps ) and two stream of 802.11n ( 300Mpbs ). So it was called AC1200.
Didn't try it but this requires the drivers for RTL8812AU/RTL8821AU chipset. Searching for "raspberry pi rtl8812AU rtl8821AU" leads to "ASUS USB-AC56 (RTL8812AU/RTL8821AU) Driver compile fails" under Raspberry Pi forums and it looks like they were successful in compiling the drivers.
Yes yes and yes.
yes it did, even tho I ordered one. If you ever need it let me know
Yes but not sure the receiver will move a large dish.You also have really limited programming .
Inside the battery cover underneath the mouse. It's tucked in there sideways- very easy to miss!
Nope it was smoothe but good grip. But my mouse didnt work when i got it.
It's pretty durable and feels smooth. I have dropped it on several occasions without leaving a scratch
its actually a decent size BUT it is a palm grip mouse so if you are a claw or fingertip mouse kind of guy DONT GET IT
Yes

Thanks for you interest in our product. Regarding HDD, an internal SATA 3.5" Consumer Electronics Grade one would be compatible with our system. We recommend that you only purchase Consumer Electronics Grade Hard Drives such as: Western Digital Audio Video Green Power (AV-GP), Seagate SV35 Series, Hitachi Cinema Star Series. You may go Amazon, search for "Western Digital AV-GP".
I tried several format videos, but failed. Sorry I don't know which format can work.
Yes, it will work with (at least) .mp3 files. Depends on the car OS and hardware, but it does work on the 2015 Outback.
Its ok lol, the wifi adapter comes pre-installed on the motherboard. All you need to do is run the included wires from the WiFi adapter to the antennas (also included). It has everything you need to make the computer wirelessly compatible. Of course you'll need your home wifi network to connect to, but that's it! Both the Wifi and the motherboard work wonderfully. I've been very happy with mine.
I have tried to find one for HTPC case, but failed. Tried to use Noctua LH-L12 and Cooler Master Gemini II, but neither of them fits - memory on this motherboard is located too close to the CPU. Such as I failed to find a proper low noise cooler for low profile case, I replaced it with small enough Cooler Master N200 case, using Seasonic Fanless 400W PS in it and Cooler Master Hyper TX3 cooler - now everything is absolutely silent. Don't forget to use DDR3-2400 to max out the video performance for APU.
built in wifi. as it states in the description
No, mine is running Ubuntu and driving a touch screen
Yes
no
yes you can, it's peer to peer. but for updating the firmware you need a WiFi which connected to the internet
Yes!
No, sadly it is for the Tab 2 style only and is not compatible with the new version. I ended up getting a Tab 3 and returning this item. It was great though....for the old style tablet.
no
Based on what I'm reading here: http://support.p3proswing.com/support/articles/27594-p3proswing-virtual-golf-courses-system-requirements You might be better advised to get our AAC-X4S, found here: http://www.amazon.com/AAC-X4S-Gaming-Computer-Processor-Bulldozer/dp/B0087IMDP2. Intel chips have an issue with the software and this particular system wouldn't be powerful enough to run it cleanly. Our AAC-iXS would, but that has not been released yet.
Hello, It does not have Blue-Ray reader. No MS Office. Best regards, Amuras
I have the Envy TouchSmart 17 and it is 17 inches. It's an excellent screen for videos and in my case, spreadsheets. The 10 key is excellent for my work. Enjoy.
I use Chirp, in my opinion, it is better than the software from Baofeng. The radio is not listed, but use the UV-5R as the radio type. since they are basically the same radio. http://chirp.danplanet.com/projects/chirp/wiki/Home
I just got mine, and I couldn't make that work, so I'll have to say no.
Yes it does!
yes
According to the Acer website it does not.
idont understand you. are you asking me if i know about warranty or if i use warranty?
No
No, it is a great product! I have one on my iphone also.
This unit uses version 3.0.
It didn't hold a charge unless it was plugged in. But once he sent me a new one that fixed it

It will depend on the size snd quality of your SD card. I have a 64 GB and I have plenty of room for photos and video
Sorry but I have a D3200. Unable to answer that question. Works great with mine.
I believe so, it looked very authentic and had the proper papers and such.
this is specific to the DV8. this is not a universal fit.
In practice, it means your ISO needs to be a bit higher than it would with a stabilized lens in some cases. It's certainly not a deal breaker for me. I find that the stabilization with the EM5 is helpful at times, but it doesn't do anything to help with motion blur from moving subjects for example. The gm1 is the camera I reach for most often and the lack of stabilization isn't really even a consideration for me.
Yes
Battery operated but don't leave batteries in it or they will drain overnight. I've lost a ton of batteries because of these lights!
No it doesn't swivel it stay in one position
Yes, the HDMI transmits video and the USB transmits touch. If you don't care about touch, you don't need to attach the USB cable.
I have not had an issue with moving video in HD, but to be honest, I have not played any blu-ray discs on this monitor. HD with You-tube and other online sources has been fine.
In the current version of Skydog, we do not distinguish between different users on a shared PC. However, we understand the need for this and are looking at solutions for one of our next releases. The great thing about Skydog is that we can add features and make updates in the cloud and you will get those new features without having to replace the hardware.
There is no mount attached with projector.
That sounds about right. Mine is 16' away for a 100" diagonal screen. If you need something shorter I'd strongly suggest a short throw projector.
Depending on whether the CPU is unlocked, yes
i apologize I do not know I have not tried it but it is the same slot I don't see why not.
Yes I could. But it would do me no good with the Yoga Pro.
Yes, it has only 2 power supply but include an adapter to can to use one power supply with 4 cama.
The cable for each camera is about 60ft, if you purchase system with hard drive from us, hard drive already installed, thanks.
PS Not sure but I believe the lens which came with this camera was conceived for the GM-1.
The one I bought from China did not. The seller retained the warranty, and offered to have the camera repaired there if I need it. So there would be a double shipping involved, if they are still in business. I'm hoping not to need it. A friend later bought an all black one from Henry's in Toronto with North American warranty. Henry's is a solid, reliable retailer in Toronto. Whether they have them in stock now, I don't know. I am quite enjoying the camera.
Dear friend, no , it doesn't , thanks for your attention !
I use it with excede satellite internet
I think it's very good as long as it is not facing a window. Sunlight coming in distorts the picture but the outside camera works great, I don't really understand that but over all I think the image is good.
We are offering free shipping to all US states at this time.
These are 60Hz Hope this info helps you Joe
No. Designed for shower
less than a pound ok unit not great
I don't know anything about an ILO TV. However, the mount will work with any tv that has the 4 bracket screw holes in the back. Hope that is helpful
I found it listed in the details section on Amazon. I believe it is 110 lbs
I put my mount up myself. It was easier than I thought. Make sure you locate your studs the mount is vary safe if mounted to studs.
I believe you can type into anything you want. What's important is that you need the appropriate transcription software.
Yes. I have downloaded it to both my laptop and desktop. You will need your registration info to activate it.
I think you'll not have any troubles with sound.
It could but it would not be stable. Do not buy.
2.5 inches
Yes it works really well with it.
Olympus suggests one that does just that. Olympus Nylon Camera Case for OM-D E-M10 and Stylus 1 Cameras, Black $10 on Amazon.
Sounds like a problem with the computer, not the camera. Some computers have problems playing full HD video. I would suggest trying to play the videos on different computers, to help determine if the issue lies with your specific computer.
Yes it does. The play/pause button works but it does not have a volume control, but still can be controlled from the iPad Air.
Straight
Yes, comes as a sealed system, no way to top up, flush, refill etc. Does limit its application for example you can not just drill two small holes and feed the plumbing through, as they are permanently connected to the big bits.
Yes. From http://www.corsair.com/en-us/blog/2013/october/corsair-hydro-series-h75-installation-guide: If your system uses any modern AMD socket (AM2, AM3, AM3+, FM1, FM2, FM2+), you'll want to consult the included instruction manual for more detailed instructions.
No hdmi
you can't play anything with this crappy tablet...forget bluetooth.
I bought for my sonand and work lest than one year only 6 months I don't like
Sorry, i have not had a chance to pick up the Pyle tablet so I cannot give you an answer.
Yes; keyboard, mouse, external DVD/optical drive. Just about anything via USB.
I have owned this computer for about one year now and keep it plugged in MOST of the time. When I unplug it I do not notice any reduction in battery life.
This thing doesn't work. It has poor to no documentation and is terribly simple to brick. If you're buying a controller to use with a Windows based PC of any stripe, just get a regular xbox controller. Don't screw with knockoffs. These things aren't for PCs anyway.
I have used mine skiing, swimming underwater, and kayaking without any issues with the camera moving out of place. Of course, I am only one user so I can't speak for all, but that has been my experience. A great little compliment to my GoPro kit.
Sorry&#65292; it doesn't support.
I only have 1 monitor attached - I can't find any reference that says that more can be connected.
no monitor included
No will have no significant difference
Yes, all USB is backwards compatible.
It says it can. I bought one from Amazon to be all wireless
It has an HDMI so if your TV has HDMI input then yes the HP could hook up to your tv
I'm sorry, but I cannot answer your questions. I would get in touch with HP and ask your question.
Dear friend, no , it doesn't , thanks for your attention !
The keyboard connects to the tablet via Bluetooth, and is recharged with Micro USB cable.
Please launch the product return request form to return this case for a full refund.
To get a new pass code, you need to unpair the case from the tablet. In reference to the case, there should be a feature on the tablet that prompts you to "forget this device". Once the case no longer recognized by the tablet, then start the process all over again and a new pass code should appear. This should do the trick.
The only HP we have tested this with is the HP Slate 7, which is not compatible. Please check your user manual to see if it accommodates a USB keyboard.
Hello, yes it comes with the manufactured supplied items AND the external slave flash pictures in the listing.
yep
No. This occupies the space where the CD would normally go.
It will hold the Galaxy S5. The S5 measures 5.85" tall and 2.85" wide. .32 deep. If your Garmin measures less that that you are good to go.
No but Netflix has a setting that turns that on.
Yes
The first time I took it out of the bag the creases were noticeable, but after about an hour or so they went away. I use it quite a bit and packing it and unpacking it is pretty easy but it does leave a crease but are normally gone within about a half hour. It stretches pretty tight to the frame so I think that helps. Hope this answered your question. Let me know if i can help with anything else.
Yes, please place your order directly through Amazon for pricing.
it connects to your phone like bluetooth, it has about a 15 to 20 feet range. You can record or just live stream. there is a 1/2 second delay from real time
It doesn't have Bluetooth, it has WiFi. So if your tablet has WiFi (don't they all?), and the Looxcie app is available for your device (it is available for iOS and Android) then you can connect. However, the signal has pretty limited range and does not go through walls well, so if the baby is more than one wall away from you and/or more than 10-15' away with even one wall between, you may completely loose connection with the camera, or not get continuous video.
returned 2 of them couldn't get them to work reliably.
It doesn't bounce at all in my Audi Q5. It fits snugly in the cd holder when you insert it, then you can tighten it even more with the adjustable knob. I love it! Finally a good use for my CD player :-)
I would buy this fan, it works great on my Yamaha receiver. I have it set on top so it can pull the heat out, and it stays cool. Bought two but only had to use one. Joe Wray
I'm using it for basically the same thing, blowing down into the top of a power amp to cool the main heatsink. Works great and it's silent. Based on my experience with other similar fans and all the servers/workstations I've serviced I expect many years of use.
Good question! Yes, there is....but I usually slip it out when I am taking pics because it is easier to use by itself...
You know... I have not had this problem. I removed my screen protector from my "Note II" no problem when I had sold it. Have you tried contacting the company for support or checked their website for an FAQ? Maybe I'll try to remove the one from my "Nexus 5" just to make sure and just reapply the second one. I'll respond back if I do it this weekend, if it works no problem, you might have a defective one?
Yes these are VERY clear! You can obviously tell that they are on the device, but not as prominently as others... This is the only brand of screen protectors that I will ever buy again! They are HD quality and easy to install. They even include Dust Removal Tape that you can use if you accidentally get dust under it during install.
According to several people on forums and the video seen at the address below, the AAGN (AAHC for Europe) the AAGN is a 1000x better than the AADH. Much more sensitive, doesn't have the skipping problem, and just in general works better. However, it loses the interchangeable tip. http://tabtec.com/hardware/new-dell-active-stylus-750-aahc-gets-demoed-video/
Yes there is, on the right side next to the power connector. The opening may appear small but it has a spring loaded latch to opens then the RJ45 connector is inserted.
it needs to be plugged in to power outlet
No tax in Delaware.
5inx5in
That depends on the setting you choose. It's mechanical, but adjustable - that is, if you set it to where you WANT to hear the clicks (which I like) you set the sensitivity DOWN, but if you like a quiet, easy response (where you don't need to depress the key entirely) you set it UP and the keys respond without having to 'click'
No you cannot. The surface (Non-pro) powers on a mobile SoC chip which unifies a CPU, GPU, and all other hardware components on a single platform. It is all soldered on together and the parts are not consumer upgradeable. Furthermore, even though the Pro model is powered by Intel Core i3/i5 like the desktops, it is also not consumer upgradable as well due to it's enclosed and compact design made possible through it's soldered hardware (think MacBook Air) Despite the ram size appearing insufficient, the windows surface (non-pro) is optimized to run extremely smooth and efficiently on the tablets
Not on Windows 8.1 RT at this time. However, if you have another laptop or desktop computer in the house, you can easily access it from this Surface tablet.
I did not know what Proptropica was so I did a research on it. As far as I can tell, you should be able to play it. However, I would recommend that you contact Acer Support directly for a more accurate answer. I looked up the Sales Support Number for you. It is 1-800-910-2237. Hope this helps. Good Luck.
Yes, the HDMI port works fine. The only problem most people are reporting with the HDMI functionality is that the driver, as shipped, does not allow the tablet display to be duplicated on the monitor/TV; you can only select "extend" mode or just the monitor/TV screen. A newer driver, available from the Toshiba support site, fixes that. Perhaps you have a defective cable?
Mine makes a small noise, too, when I push down the corners. I don't think anything is "cracking," per se; I think there's just a small amount of flex in the screen/circuit board assembly, and it's moving slightly in the more-rigid back case. I think the only way to avoid that would have been to glue the screen solidly into the back case, which would have made it completely unrepairable. (I'm not sure that it can be repaired as it is, but a bead of glue around the whole screen would certainly have foreclosed any such possibility.)
Yes, both Bluetooth and WiFi. I use this daily for work. The WiFi is dual band and works very well. The only issue I experienced (and it is rare) was that I was at a customer site the other day and they wanted me to use an RJ-45 plug for Network connectivity. This Notebook does not have an RJ-45 Jack so you need a Wireless connection for the Network.
No, it's not a good gaming laptop
This is a very limited computer, it has a web cam with less than average quality. Of course you can record videos with it and upload them to youtube, but again they are low quality. More advanced video processing, editing, may be out of the league of this laptop.
Height 0.4" width 5.3" depth 8.6" weight 14.64oz. Great Tablet.
It is integrated, you cannot replace it. If you need to upgrade cpu, replace the whole thing...
Yes it does. It can not be removed or upgraded/overclocked.
He probably synchronized with a computer that was setup to synchronize with the transporter. Once the device comes back onto the network then the computer would try to sync with the device but the device would be blank so all the files from the computer would be sent back to the transporter.
My GoPro had a float and I posted up a video to show exactly how it fit:
That is full height including the "domed" lid. The bottom "tray" is about 1.5" deep to the top edge of the zipper. The picture is accurate in that a Hero3 is just a touch bigger than the bottom tray is deep. The speaker itself should fit @ 4.4"L x 2.6"W x 2.4"H. Not sure about the AC adapter. The case is hard sided so being above the foam isn't a huge deal.
I'm pretty sure you can, the keyboard takes up a lot of space which would now be free if you don't need a keyboard.
It does work for wifi only devices, however the app must download the maps ahead of time (which apps like waze and google maps do NOT). You would just need to verify that the apps you plan on using support downloaded maps or not.
Yes, I have mixed several different types of camera's in with this system and haven't had any problems.
It does allow JBOD but I wouldn't recommend it. You should really use RAID 5 to take advantage of this unit.
Yes. Just keep the render distance around normal
I DO NOT KNOW, CALL TOSHIBA SUPPORT.
Yes
The inside snaps stretch to 10.1, I can only speak for 10.1 but when I got it the snaps are suppose to fit smaller tablets as well
Yes but it didn't hold the tablet very good the corners kept slipping off and the tablet wanted to fall out. Find something else I did.
The screen is divided into four squares. Click on one square to make it full screen. It connects to whatever you want.
for vertical image the pen must be standing up. laying on its side will get you an image rotated 90 degrees.
If you're asking about Adobe flash then the answer is no. iOS devices are still not compatible with adobe flash. Although Adobe does offer a range of professional apps in the apple store. Many want to see flash phased out, many others do not - regardless it's still prominent and hopefully iOS will one day be compatible.
Yes, it does. they are sold by Kayond Factory and Fulfilled by Amazon. We upgraded this brand with small accessory bag which can put the mouse,IPHONE or small goods inside from MAR,2014. If don't include, the product is anti fake goods without good quality.Pls recognize KAYOND trademark.
Yes!
I would NOT recommend the product as it has a zipper pull that has gotten the zipper off track on one side. The other zipper pull is on track and zips properly, however. If that doesn't bother you...there is surely enough room for an 11" device.
For my 13" MacBook air, I purchased the 13" case. Fits perfectly.
absolutely!! I have other tablets and another Ipad and trust me, the difference is Huge, Ipad air has a much faster processor and HD retina display that makes images very clear and the colors very bright.
That is what I used. Mine is and XPS 13 so I made sure I ordered something over 13. I'm not familiar with the Asus but you'll want to pay attention to the depth of what you order too. The XPS is super thin so here is plenty of room with this case.
The iPad is iPad Air 2 64 gb
Idk maybe if your phone has Bluetooth, but if you do you use it, I say keep it synced at all times or it might never, NEVER connect again. That's what happened with my iPod 4th gen
press and hold the play button for 7 secs. The lights will blink and then stay off
As long as you have connectivity, I am sure it will work. You can't beat these headphones for the price
Yes, you can as long as you have WiFi.
I don't believe so. My teenagers have watched movies without a problem. I myself haven't tried it but have no complaints. I hope it helps.
All iPad Air comes unlocked, they are locked or subsidized by any company.
You are probably connected to your laptop or other "Mass Storage" device. Simply install unit in your vehicle with 12 volt plug and you will be fine.
That's what I got from the item that I've received. I don't know with the other items. It may be my item only. but i am totally disappointed as if I cannot review the videos alone. I need to plug it on the USB or hook it up on the car.
The iPad I have listed includes the 8-pin Lightning cable and a wall adapter, but each seller will be different.
Yes
There are free apple apps that do relatively the same thing as office apps - in a slightly different format. Overall they're fairly effecient and can be transferred to microsoft prograns relatively seamlessly from my experience. Not sure about logmein though.
If the description is just Wi-fi, then no, you can't hook it to a cellular provider. If it's Wi-fi + Cellular, yes, it's "ready" for your cell plan. My advice is, if you can afford it get the Cellular version even if you don't plan to use that right away. You can't add cellular capability to the device after the fact if you change your mind, as I did after a few months: for $10 /mo. on Verizon it turned out to be worth it after all.
5th generation
Yes. You only have to set up the configuration
Yes, shortly after purchasing this iPad there was a notification to update, it's currently at 8.1.2.
It does not.
Yes.
Hello Williow, thank you for your request. No, that`s not possible. This "feature" only offers the "London". Best, Tom KAVAJ GmbH
Laura, I have not seen the Berlin, only the Hamburg, which is the one I have. I can tell you that I absolutely love my cover. It is substantial, yet thin. It fits in my purse nicely, so I can take it with me and not have to carry it separately. Thanks hope that helps. Susan S.
yes, I do it all the time. Suggest leather conditioner so it doesn't crack along that edge 3yrs from now. I use Lexol.
Yes it fit.
The Kavaj Cognac case does have the wake/sleep function.
This is an impressive tailor-made suit for the iPad Air. I have the black one. It fits like a fine tuxedo. No loose-ends & no reason why you can't use your Bluetooth.
I have the same case for my iPad Air, and it fits very tight. I don't remember exactly how it fit when new, it may have been a bit of work to get it to fit. I do remember working hard, with some effort, to stuff the overlap portion behind the back of the iPad to maintain a tight fit across the screen. It has held up well, and doesn't slip in the case.
I have done a build with the msi brand motherboard h81m-p33 micr. And it works just fine. No issues with anything in the way or not being able to connect anything.
I do not think there are other colors. However, the gray/black color is a great match with the gray/black iPadAir.
Nothing, just the power cord.
Yes it does. Thanks
If it's interference you might be just far enough from the TV to notice that this device works best at certain distance. Am towers interfere with it too. Vizio smart tv may just be too "smart" requiring a settings change. Try going reversing the cables where red and white plug into the TV and moving the recover away from the TV'a controller reciever (or I r blaster).
Well I bought this and it worked great for a few weeks, then the internet stopped working altogether &#128078; and ofcourse I threw away the box so couldn't return it. Highly do not recommend this product.
I returned mine, but I do not believe the is any way of connecting it to a computer.
No, the dimensions are different on the surface 2 and this case has a tight fit made specifically for the 1st gen.
The one we have makes the kickstand inaccessible. ..and the case doesn't come with a kickstand
Yes but only through bluetooth not attached.
I dont know they sent the wrong one and I'm still waiting to recieve the correct one
Not well, the case is very light and I personally would not place the tablet anywhere roughly with this case a better option might be the heavier duty incipio
No it doesnt and I wouldnt recommemd buying I bought my ucan daughter this and she played three times and the button u use to turn itnon broke so Inc it was a waste
If it allows you..Everytime I was on it it either froze up or cut off...so nerve wrecking
I don't know Jill. I was not happy with the device. Took pictures and they were dark and blurry . I sent the device back.
the USB port is not working.
I'm pretty sure any Android cannot run any Microsoft software. It's kinda like apple with its product. But I wouldn't recommend this for anything except a second clash of clans account. It buffers on my 60 gig wi fi to watch YouTube. I got this product thinking that the tf card could hold apps an it only holds pictures an music. It don't have blue tooth. An only has a standby life of 16 hours. (Me not using it) honestly get a surface well worth it. FYI apples lame. Just like this dragon touch
The bike mount is just a holder for the speaker, nothing to recharge. However, the beats pill is USB rechargeable.
Hi, For this Beats Bike mount, it only holds the Pill and nothing else. You might have to get a separate clip or holder for your Ipod Nano. Hope that answered your question. Thanks
I use it on my motorcycle as well as my bicycle, I even use it on my cleaning cart for my summer Sat job. I absolutely love it :)
As per the manufacturers specs: 265mm(W) x 411.3mm(H) x 381mm(D)
Only speaker wire. It is not very long and not an adequate length. The gage in my opinion is too thin. There are no audio cables.
No
I don't know, sorry I wish I could help, but I can't.
Home
No . It is not very bright at all. Hardly usable in a pitch black Rom.
Yes it does. Also has internal speaker that works well. I haven't had it on for long periods of time 3-4 hours max.
Not that I know of. I could not easily find a copy on the internet. however it could be there somewhere I haven't searched.
Yes but the quality isn't great whatsoever as well as the room needing to be pitch black
The PC I purchased came without a phone modem/card so dial up not available on mine. Would need to install a card. Check the rear of the PC to see if there is a phone jack.
sorry, I don't have an answer for you!!
It is a feature that enables you to see things closer and farther without moving from your spot.
No you need the 3D player and a 3D t.v.
Yes, the Honeywell 6162 keypad will work with the Ademco VIA 30PSE control panel.
The 6162 does have backlit keys that are always illunimated with the Vista 20P. The backlight for the LCD screen does time out. The 6165EX keys can be programmed to stay lighted, or turn off after 45 seconds.
Yes. Specs here: https://www.synology.com/en-us/products/DS114#spec Demo here: https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/5.1/live_demo
Yes I do please see the following link and select Noble Tech. We have 230 in stock.
I have the at100 and I'm not familiar with the 300. The universal clips attach at the corners via an elastic band with a clip. This does not affect my tablet at all.
Yes, This is a universal case which will work with the Pure AT15 with dimensions of 7 x 10.30 x 0.40 inches. Note there is no hole in the rear to expose the rear camera. but the tablet can easily be taken out of the case to take photos with the rear camera.
We have the same problem with sound, even with earplugs. We had to get cheap powered speakers to plug into the tablet to be able to hear well.
I don't think the other answer about daisy chaining is correct although I have not explored every option in the drop down. The real answer is redundancy and binding. Its default setting is to provide fail-over in case the first port fails. Its secondary purpose is enhanced capacity/bandwidth by enabling with a link aggregation capable switch to provide capacity for extra concurrent connections.
Yes
No, i have tried to remove it but i was unable too.
Absolutely. However I would recommend populating with WD Red hard drives which are preferred for NAS RAID use and using the 4TB size hard drives since you are limited to only 4 bays. In a pinch however, you can use any four SATA hard drives of any capacity and /or manufacture and it will work just fine.
No, WD just removed NFS support.
Yes, it would.
Prop 'n Go Slim works with all tablets including the iPad Air, iPad mini, etc.
No you don't, there is parts cut out for the front and back cameras.
Honestly, I would think that they would be the same build as the wifi edition. Only thing I can think that would be different from the wifi and Verizon edition tablet, is the sim card slot added to the Verizon edition.
it records from audio cd to usb in real time or in multiple speeds with different conversions of recording speed.the speed may effect the quality of the recording.the manual is not much help with the detail of recording of the speed.to determine the quality of the recording.its mp3 or cd quality recording.very unique in blu ray player to record to usb.with basic visual navigation of the recording to usb.hope this answer helps.sorry that's all i know.try lg.
These would not comfortable to fall asleep in unless the person sleeps on their back. They are top notch ear buds in regard to sound quality and noise blocking.
All boxes inside one big box. no one will recognize what is it unless you open it or tell what is inside .
I don't think your Ipad air has a USB port. Most Mac books do and will work with those two hard drives.
It works as pictured with my tab 3 8.0 perfectly fine. It is a lightweight keyboard but good value for the price.
That's correct. Same unit just with car charger. And the nfc sticky pad
The actual device is NFC enabled, but the NFC is only use for pairing. Once it is paired NFC isn't used any more. The mat is just a piece of sticky rubber.
No, but it does have 3.5mm male to 3.5mm male. But a 3.5mm to RCA is not too expensive, and you can convert it with a tiny adapter.
I have an Antec Sonata I, which uses the same kind of drive trays as the 3. The bracket doesn't have the right screw holes on the bottom side to allow it to mount on the case's tray. I got creative with some twist ties to hold the bracket into the tray, since I'm using it to mount SSDs, and for that reason, a little movement doesn't matter so much.
It should fit that thicker drive...as long as there is room in your box. There is not anything on the adapter itself that would limit thickness.
Yes. Second one must be mounted from the sides , first also has holes for bottom mounting, which don't work for a Crucial M500. I have no idea what model SSD they line up to.
Ssd's have no moving parts.
It will work with any PC that has an open 3.5 internal drive bay. I did a little research and it appears that the 7020 has one, but none of the specs I found say for sure.
The format of this case is exactly the same as a 3.5 inch hard drive. So the bottom line is... if a 3.5 inch drive will fit, then this adapter case will fit.
I've replaced hard drives with SSDs in 7 iMacs spanning from late 2010 to 2012 and this worked in all... should be fine.
they do come in other colors, its plastic painting it may cause the paint to chip.
Nikon includes the following items with the camera: *EN-EL14 Li-ion Battery *Battery Charger *Audio/Video Cable *USB Cable *Rubber Eyecup *Strap *Eyepiece Shield *Body Cap *Hot-Shoe Cover *Nikon View NX2 Software CD-ROM
Yes
An 18-140mm lens is included with the kit.
No, only Ipad can be used with Square. There are other devices that are similar but you will need to verify if they work with your tablet.
Yes, I believe it does as it's brand new.
The lens have image stabilization, not the camera.
The fix to the yellow that Lenovo released is software and not hardware. If it doesn't come with it out of the box then you can just download it from the drivers site and apply. That being said I have heard a number of people saying that it doesn't fix the yellow issue but my yellows look fine to me after I applied the fix.
Every USB 3.0 device is 2.0 compatible... you just loose speed/throughput and extremely high resolution, multi-monitor setups with GbE all running at the same time would likely suffer.
No. Has insert jack for only the two speakers that are supplied with the unit.
The speakers can be separated from the stereo - I don't know if any others can be used. I sent the whole thing back, for credit, because it didn't work at all!
The HDMI port is for HDMI out only. Thus it would not do what you are asking. You need a device that will convert HDMI to a signal that your TV can understand.
no
It's noticeable but not extremely loud. It's a great mouse!
Yeah
No but what you need to do its to activated the sensor by cranking the sprocket wheel counter clockwise and that should pair the device of course if you all ready paired before. I'd use Garmin 510 and works great every time I just do that simple procedure in case my Garmin 510 does not detected, remember that it's a motion sensor require to be move to activate it self . Best regafds
At this time we do not have such a bundle available. The items would have to be purchased individually.
Yes the previous off state is remembered when you plug it in again
Hahaha! Too funny. No, it does not eject feminine napkins. Yes, men should be able to physically use this speaker. However, I would not suggest it for outdoor use unless you plan to be near to it in close proximity while listening, as it's loudest volume is barely loud enough to hear outdoors. It is solar, but I wouldn't suggest it for outdoor use based on lack of volume.
I took mine straight out of the package and started using it immediately. I never put a battery in it, I just make sure the solar indicator is on when using outside. I have yet to try to charge it by any other means but it holds a charge for a very long time after being outside. It wouldn't suprise me if that's a typo honestly. I don't even see a spot on it to put a battery.
Hi, it requieres 10.8.4 for USB 3 ports to work. For Ethernet, to work with 10.8.x, you also need to download and Install a driver form Caldigit web site. Better install Maverik (10.9.x) as it includes all drivers. The wife is using this device with a Macbook Pro 2011 (it has all firmware upgrades) with 10.9.1 and it is working just fine. I'm using a Belkin dock, but this is much more stable.
This is a thunderbolt 1 device.
Yes work for hdmi or video.
Yes it will. You can surf the web as soon as you hook it up
Their Version 12 was phenomenal. But from what I understand, the company was sold and is under new ownership, so product isn't quite what it used to be. Good luck!
Try powering down your I Pad. I have the same case and it's working fine. I hope this works
No, that is the pivot so you can turn your iPad and stand it up.
Yes, I've tried it myself.
The headphones work great with the XB1. Run through the optical port and set XB1 to bitstream out and dolby digital. Also, yes there is a 3.5mm jack which will receive music from phone/ mp3. Hope that helps.
A ps3 gets 30fps. You're better off getting any cheap monitor for that, this one is beyond overkill and you won't get the full benefits of a 1ms 144hz (144fps) monitor.
They are both the same, both effective in reducing camera shake however the Sigma is cheaper.
It has built in battery but it designed to safe shut-off. It will stay for 10-20secs. If you want to use w/o cable connected, you can purchase external battery bank.
Yes
Yes, but it is a simple picture frame style stand with minimal adjustment.
You have to hook up the video cord for video then another cord that is usb goes from your pc to the monitor for the touchscreen function if that doesn't work make sure your system including video drivers is fully updated if it still doesn't work its broken
I personally do not know for sure; however, I found this online from another person commenting on a similar question: "Touchscreen reminds me of first using an iPad responsive as it should be... No lag. Using it with TouchBase drivers on a Mac." Poseted February 23, 2014 Hope this helps!
If you turn off the loop, the camera would stop recording once the micro sd card is the full. The reason that the camera does short video clips is because, once the camera is full, the camera delete the oldest video clip first, then 'overwrite' the video. This is the reason that the camera only creates short video clips. Hope the info helps. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach us.

Hello it is a daylight/white light.
I'm not sure how much it weighs.I bought it as a gift.it is a little bulky. But the quality seems good
This bag is made with a high quality synthetic leather.
This item is good we love it especially if we watching movies or singing. Benq521 projector .
yes it does...
I have no fan noise. My old HP fan sounded like a dying hard drive. The laptop heated up to painful levels. The biggest thing I notice about this is there is no sound, no heat. I wouldn't mind some heat this winter. :) Perhaps you can return that one and get a new one. I think you have a dud.
the keyboard keys are hard ABS keys NOT silicone rubberized.
No it does not. It needs a class 6 card. Ones that go into a phone would work fine. Up to 64Gb.
The viewing angle is about 35
No, it has just a plain Pentium. But I can tell you this, between the SSD hard drive and 4gb of memory, it gets around very quickly on day to day operation.
yes it has two of them one SD card slot on the keyboard/base and one micro SD card slot on the tablet plus it has a full HDMI port on the base as well...Nice
Multiple hits. As long as it doesn't hit the same spot twice.
these were for a canon 5ti. look on amazon for your type camera if the lens size is the same then yes they will fit..
yes , works great and sound is terrific.
Yes it is, that's why I got it and it works perfectly.
I'm sorry but I have no idea, the one that I have seems to work great or my needs
Yes you can just make sure your computer is Bluetooth compatible, mine is not so it doesn't work via Bluetooth with my computer but excellent with my phone via Bluetooth and pandora
No. The Bluetooth feature is an input, not an output. You can output from your smartphone (if it has Bluetooth) and play through the speakers.
No.
The radius is to far from the phone or the Battery maybe lo
Yes
The IPAD MINI SMART CASE RED is priced at $16.59 plus $4.99 S&H. We look forward to your order. Thanks Tammy
Yes...it was made specifically for it!
It comes with both 18" thunder bolt and usb 3 cables.
As far as i'm aware, it makes a little sound, but its not too obnoxious
If it has a USB port then yes it will
Yes it does.
No ,I had bought a new mouse already
Is not flimsy, totally the opposite, is pretty stiff. I havent tried to put keys but imho should work without any problem. Something to mention is the usb cap fits on the backside when opened, I mean on the ring; so if you put the keys there, then you shall have to place the cap somewhere else when using the usb.
Yes it is. It's compatible with any operating system. Plug and go!
No they one I bought was for the WiFi version.
Estimated shipping cost with USPS, $40 dollars
It uses a 6 and an 8.
it seems to be about double the standard view, I'd guess about 40 degrees.
only on Mac
I just connected a 500GB (WD500AADS, ASIN: B002P3KO4C search it on Amazon) drive using a sata to USB connector (ASIN: B000J01I1G search it on Amazon). I had to use the tuner to format (fat32), and it shows up as a 465GB drive. I hit the PVR button, and recorded a sample, no problem. I imagine the pre-packaged drives would work the same.
YES!
Yes, 1-2 physical processors is fine.
Yes, it can be used plugged in while charging.
Yes, that's one of the great advantages of the Flip 2 over the original Flip. It charges via a standard mini USB plug (same cord that Kindles use) from a wall adapter or a computer, rather than using a proprietary power cord.
Unfortunately, no
Home premium
I enclosed them in a dual gang outdoor "in use" type power receptacle box. The short term simple approach would be to wrap in electricians tape.
That is what I am trying to find out
Not that I am aware of
Yes you can reset it and no you wont lose all apps
No it didn't have a flash
Yes you can
Manually copy lcd to the correct directory from a windows machine just insert the sd to the windows machine and it's much easier. The command it said to use didn't work me for either
It says in the description not detachable and all these answers say detachable? -mine doesn't seem to be detachable.
Dimension are 5" x 3.25"
It should screw to wall, you could send email to salessannce08@gmail.com, we could send instruction to you directly, thank you!
I have this system but I do not understand your question. Are you looking for add-ons for the product? If so, you can use practically any hard drive you wish as well as different cameras. The cameras that come with it work very well. Hope this helps.
all i can tell you is that it fits md785ll/a 16gb wifi (ipad air). not sure about the model number you mentioned.
The lip is a shade under 5/8 wide, 3/4 is much to wide, sorry.
No, it does not come with Touch Screen. Best regards, Amuras, Inc.
Yes, but its a pain. Need to use chrome on your computer and load the plair extension. Then go to amazon, play the video and it will have a selection to send to plair. It works well once you get it going. just a pain in the setup.
You can.. Just a little lag on the stream..but I have been able to watch some games..
I was lucky enough to get my money back few days after I got it. Was always laggy Chrome stick and amazon stick killed them
It is not load you should be fine
No idea. But I'm pretty sure you can. I would post this question on reddit.com/r/vmware I'm sure someone will be able to help you out.
yes, it does.
Hello Jill, Thank you for your question. No, it does not have optional AC power. However, in our test, the battery indicator showed 79% battery life remaining after taking about 935 pictures. It is highly energy efficient. Kind Regards, Ross Kelson GadgetsGo.com 305-791-1101
No, I bought one for my 9 year old and it came in a language we don't understand and it shuts off with out any notice. I'm trying to return it with no luck yet.... :-(
Yes they are included. Easy to install.
Thank you for contacting us. The 18-55mm lens will have "VR" or vibration reduction but the 55-200mm lens does not have this feature.
do u mean by saying uploading the taken pictures to ur tab? well if u use Wu-1a with this connected to ur dslr u can instantly upload the pictures taken. u can learn using it online.. very easy
Yes!
Yes
Android 4.2 can handle it and the ASUS specs for the ME102 list Miracast. Your tv will still have to have Miracast built-in. If not ASUS sells a "Miracast Dongle" receiver that plugs into an empty HDIM port on your tv.
Yes, I read pdf adobe files all the time on it. I believe it did come with adobe reader pre-installed.
Yes you can.
So far I have down loaded directv and amazon and Netflix and I've been happy with streaming
YES
No interesting
Well, the one I bought came with a AC Power meant to be used in US. By the way, both AC Adapters, the notebook and the tablet one.
It should, it worked with my Samsung S4, and my Kindle so It seems to be universal for charging.
No. As long as you hold the case open with the flap hanging down, the camera works fine.
No and they do not work and the will not refund your money
Not this unit. 1 HDMI port, and a Micro SD. It does come with an adapter that terminates in USB female port, however I could not get it to work.
One year
Not sure why people answer question they no X about! The packaging clearly states that it works with both Mac and PC!
That's a good question. I did some research and the best answer I came up with is that the bluray drive basically just reads the data. It doesn't really differentiate between 2-D and 3-D. The ability to interpret 3-D data and translate that to a 3-D image depends more on the software to interpret the data, the graphics processing capabilities of the PC, having a supported 3-D display and even having the correct version of HDMI cable. That's the best I came up with during my exploration of the question.
"Is the drive M-Disc compatible?" My short answer is yes, I believe it is, as long as your firmware is 1.10 or newer. While I have not tried the new M-disc standard, it looks worth a try if it really does have an archival period of 1000 years. The nice thing about Pioneer is they seem to stay either with or ahead of the trend curve.
60 ft. Thank you!
From what I found you will need a separate monitor to watch the cameras
I don't know the specifics, but my charger stopped working and I e-mailed Pwr+'s customer support. They happily shipped a new charger quickly.
The screen is glossy as it is a capacitive touch screen. The glare can be pretty bad, but on full brightness the screen should always be seeable. Just don't sit with the sun over your shoulder.
I have read that the 780 ti is not supported by any kind of Mac OS or any kind of Maverick.
Requirements may be found here: http://www.evga.com/Products/Product.aspx?pn=03G-P4-2881-KR But suffice to say you need: minimum 600W power supply with 1 6-pin PCI-E and 1 8 pin PCI-E power connectors, and a motherboard that supports pci-e. The pci-e motherboard slot looks like this one (blue vertical slot on the far left of this board) : http://www.amazon.com/Gigabyte-Intel-Micro-Motherboards-GA-B75M-D3H/dp/B007R9CRGW/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&qid=1405359463&sr=8-9&keywords=motherboard
in my opinion both are same but vk 750 have more feature then nw 565 . I like vk 750 because it's really awesome flashlight
I know of no differences. The look exactly a like and are the same dimension as the ones from Cubie. I bought two from Sunfounder and they both are running software from Cubie.org
They work, but are they good? Depends on your definition of good, I guess. IMO, they are not as good as other HP laptops I've owned, but they work. Use external speakers if you want to listen to music.
Yes, it will fold over and protect the screen.
Yes, I ordered from Amazon and received it on 8/12/2014, the revision number is A02, Dell starts from A00 so this is third revision. So far so good, no problems yet with charging or connectivity.
it is 2 usb 3.0 and 2 thunderbolts
This is max configuration. 1tb PCIe
Search ebay.These 82 HTs may not have the extended battery out yet. Amazon and ebay both carry replacement and up-graded HT antennas. Remember you need a dual band. MFJ is a very good HAM radio supplier so is R&L electronics. They both carry the HT antennas you need. 73s
It comes with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB Solid State Drive.
It has 3 USB3 Ports
Yes it's the i7-4500U
HI, We Sell the US Version - SafeGaurd Designs
Although I don't have an iPad Mini with Retina Display, I did receive an email from Amazon that stated it might not be compatible with the Retina version of the Mini. My best guess is that if it does, the fit will not be as snug as the original iPad Mini.
Yes, I got a strap with mine
Don't know about the Crossblade Ranger. I use it in a Crosshair V Formula Z, no problems at all so far
Yes
Yes, you can. I have two of these units on my Airplay set up, one in the living room and one on my back porch. I also have my Apple TV on the same network. They work great for me. The wireless receiver range on these units is somewhat limited. My house is large, so I use wireless extenders for proper network signal strength (Netgear sells units for &lt;$50).
Yes, this device can be used worldwide.
If the vehicle stops for more than one minute it shows each stop and the duration of the stop. Spyville
yes, you can use the 90ex as a replacement flash and mount it in the hot shoe
Yes, it does. But, you don't need it for t1i, as you have a build in one for the camera.
No the tablet can't be hooked up by cord but it can with blue tooth
I don't think that this model has 3G/4G capabilities.
Mine is a Coolpix S6500. When searching for a new charger, I searched what would be compatible, and this item popped up so I took the chance.
I talked to Gigabyte customer service, they're hoping to have some in stock in time for black friday
Yes
Go to your settings icon. Then scroll to about tablet (it is at the bottom left of the screen). Updates should be at the top. My tablet updates itself automatically. I hope this helps! :-)
I'm going to assume a replacement for the hard disk is what your looking for... I would say yes but after having this particular computer myself for barely a month and having the ethernet fail after only two weeks, I couldn't recommend spending any further money on it. Acer has become worse than the old Packard Bell in the quality arena. And the support people are pretty useless. Use it until it dies and buy something else made by almost anyone else. Forget Acer!
This video glasses not support the AV input, Not for the DJI Phantom 2. Please refer to the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DAWNMX2
yes there is travel distance and I find the keys a bit stiff, take a bit of pressure.
Yes they will work fine together. But don't bother. Unless you REALLY want the Mirasol screen & don't mind it faulting within a week.
Yes, there is a micro SD slot.
Yes, 1 year covering any manufacturing defects.
Google play is pre-installed
4.67" x 2.37" x 0.75"
The video resolution is defaulted at 1280x720. You can also use the setup software to change this in the custom settings to 640x360.
Try Spy Tec Inc. They have a 1-800 phone # you can call They sell this camera.
It doesnt come with any onboard memory for recording. You have to supply the memory with a a USB drive. The HD quality is excellent as long as it receives a good signal. For the best results you will want a thumb drive that has fast write speeds for smooth & seamless recording qaulity. Also, you need roughly 6 to 8 gigabytes of storage space per hour of recording, it varies greatly depending on the quality. It is recommended that you use a at the least a 16 gigabyte thumb drive for your own convenience.
I'm not sure about the macbook air, but it closes just fine for my macbook pro. The corners of the keys are rounded. Hope this helps.
When the Mini is closed it protects both sides. When it is open it looks like a regular notebook. The cool thing is you can twist the display 180 degrees and fold over and use it just like a tablet to view or read a book.
I don't know. Might be a better aquarium for the seller. Good luck!
No
I'm pretty sure that a 128GB would be fine to use, although I only have a 32GB and it's plenty of memory space for me. And I'm currently running 5 different emulators with an average of 10 ROM's on each
Yes ... Windows 8 comes pre-installed ... I purchased mine a few months ago and was set up and ready to go in minutes...
No
I simply ran the HP update software, and Windows 8.1 loaded without any additional problem (there was no need for the "key"). Have you tried going to the Microsoft Windows update page and see if you can do it directly from there?
Yes. I bought this in order to have surround sound for a media player (in my case, a projector) that did not have audio outputs. This let me convert HDMI to AV without any issue. Then I was able to route the AV cable to an amplifier.
Black and white picture may mean you're outputting in the wrong format. Make sure you've set the switch to PAL or NTSC (depending on the HDMI source)
If your audio/video source is HDMI and you want to play and listen to it on your Sony TV, this should work for you.
No, the fan stays on at all times. It is not a loud fan. If you have other fans in your computer, it won't be any louder than them.
Same problem in this household. The answer is not enough for him to let me cut the cord. UFC, MLB, NBA or MLS can watch live games and matches in HD with an additional subscription to a paid channel. http://www.roku.com/channels/#!browse/sports/by-popular
Depends on what you are looking for. There are a few Live broadcasts from independant networks such as TheBlaze. You can watch live or on demand. MSNBC, Fox, and others have highlights on their channels. I think there is a push to be able to do live tunning in like with a cable box, but the cable companies have a vested interest in not letting you.
It should. If the radio in question has an SMA connector such as GreeNwood or Wouxun radios.
4 1/4 inches
Unfortunately, the case itself will stand in 2 positions. As pictured and on its side. Other than that I am not sure if that answers your question. Inside the case the answer would be no. Hope that helps.
Yes, the CoolStream Duo will work with your 2015 Victory Cross Country motorcycle. In fact Road Iron magazine recently did a product review of the CoolStream Duo with the Victory Cross Country. They found that the CoolStream Duo was an easy answer for iPhone 5, iPhone 6 and Droid users to stream their music to the bike's stereo. You can check out the review here: http://coolstreamrocks.com/victory-cross-country-bluetooth-solution/
No, this is not an issue. The CoolStream Duo works on the earlier docks (with 12V charging) and later 30 pin docks.
I use a $200 elite 1.1 screen. 110 inches. Works fantastic
Yes with a Mini USB end. Cig to Mini USB cord.
DVR+32Gb sd card for storage. You might want to consider other product if you want to save yourself from defective products, crappy support . Just sharing my experience on two cameras I purchased.
A Youtube review of the G1W notes that this is a very good camera for price, but cannot support class 10 properly- it does fine with a class 4 or 6, so in this case cheaper is better.
the cord is USB to microUSB, and the other is 12V to microUSB. Both of these are common cables.
Yes, it works fine. Tinted windows are not a problem.
The 5 minute recording session length is set by default. If your Menu navigation is working then on one of the screens you'll see an option to choose 5 min or 10 min. But if you are using this dash cam for evidence purposes wouldn't a shorter session (smaller file size) be better if you have to submit something in it for evidence. My preference would have been a 3-minute file size which still comes close to 300 Megs.
Hi. I have 17 - j130ea and it works perfect. However, I would advise to do some more research about connections of the 17 - j180ca laptop before purchasing it. Regards
The E6410 has 3 USB ports.
SanDisk is a good brand! Either a 32 GB or a 64 GB is good. Just made sure it is a Class 10 card. You need that speed. I think the SanDisk number is SDSDQXL-032 or 064. Lexar is also good and Delkin is OK. Practically any card will work provided it is rated Class 10.
It does have WiFi and Bluetooth
Yes
No it does not.
It does.
Should fit just fine, your model number is different because its a Tmobile subsidized tablet.
It has a CD player, an fm radio, and a line in port to connect other devices, so no...not necessarily, but I purchasers it primarily for the internet radio feature, which does require one.
Son, *you* make *this motherboard* breakfast. ;)
Yes, the ASUS OC Panel is included with this motherboard.
Thomas is correct. I'm running that very processor in my build right now.
I cleaned my Hard drive and did a clean install of windows 7. For me, compared to Windows 8; Windows 7 is great. It was worth purchasing the win 7 OS from tiger direct for around $100.00. Doing the clean install was a little tricky but I will be glad to send you a copy of the procedure it you decide to go that route.
Why would you want to? XP being phased out by MS in April. Thereafter, no security; no drivers; no updates.
Thank you for shopping with Hans-USA, This case not fit a Nextbook 7" Thank you and looking forward to serving you again. Best regards, Hans-USA
Yes the 2013 is for the 2nd version. The first one came out in 2012
Yes
4.5-hour battery
It is a laptop.
There are a number of big differences in the models. The SBG6782-AC supports the 802.11ac Wi-Fi specifications as well as 802.11b/g/n. The SBG6782-AC is also a dual-concurrent Wi-Fi access point where the 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wireless Radios are both enabled at the same time. The SBG6580 is a dual-radio / non-concurrent Wi-Fi AP. The SBG6782-AC also has a faster processor and is built on the next generation Cable Modem Chipset.
Yes, the SBG6782-AC does have a Firewall built in to it. It allows settings of "Low, Medium, High, and Off" to suit your needs.
I do not believe so as it is not notated in the descriptions.
In order to use the microphone, it has pick up noise ... If you want to use the phone connection, then you don't want to keep it in the console
They told me to push the "volume up button", but that didn't work. I sent it back and they replaced it. This one works.
I don't know if this is true for all cars, but in my case, no. However, pushing the button really isn't a big deal: just push the center once and you're instantly connected (after you've already connected Himbox with your device for the first time of course).
It takes a 1/4x20 mounting screw (just like your standard tripod plate screw) so whatever you use to mount it will determine that, be it an action arm or just a hot shoe adapter
I used it with a Nikon D3300 for video. The menu provides a lot of adjustment options and the picture is pretty good.
Yes, it does.
This flash can be fired in slave mode via pop-up or other flash, yes. The flash doesn't use IR and is fully manual, no TTL supported. There is a trigger available for the units that mounts into your hotshoe and fires remotely via radio frequency. The transmitter also allows you to remotely adjust the flash output power from 1/128 to 1/1 in 1/3 stop increments.
No. But if you want a touch screen, check out the 23tm model.
Good day, Yes this truly windows 7 home 64 as in the description. Let us know if we can answer any more questions you may have. Have a great day!
Yeah cuz dats what mines is. That joker will work
Helmet mount or shoulder strap mount
Yes it came with everything in the photo. There is a strap and storage bag as well.
Yes, it is.
Hi , all Sony filp models are without Optical Drive and you should use external ODD
Do you mean CD ROM installation disc? If so, you would need to use an external optical drive which you would connect to standard usb connector at the top left of the tablet (there is a small cover you must pry open to access the usb port).
It works with Bluetooth.
I used a Lanzar heritage 157 model and it was really loud!
Hello Blake, While there is a slot available for both a mSATA and a regular SSD, the 120GB Samsung 840 EVO installed on the Galago UltraPro is a regular laptop SSD. Thank you for your interest in the Galago UltraPro ad please let us know if you have any other questions.
DOTA 2 runs on Ubuntu however for Guildwars and WoW you will need to use Wine. helpubuntu.com has more specific information, for example the community information page for WoW at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WorldofWarcraft.
no - it isn't bluetooth if it is disconnected the input changes to onscreen keyboard
Yes, on the back along with a mini display port
If you use a new smartphone hand free style 3.5mm earbud+microphone (TRRS plug), the answer is YES. But, if a dedicated microphone plug, the answer is NO.
1 year.
Yes. It should transmit from the headphone jack. I personally plug this device in my TV audio out jack and connect it to my Bose ae2w. It works great!
From the Product Description: Folded Length: 350mm (~13.7 inches) Max Height: 1560mm (~61.4 inches)
Only if there is no water in the hot tub
I live in Virginia so earthquakes aren't a problem (but on the other hand, I have a five year old). The stand holds the set just fine without falling over. I was concerned when I read the "wobbly and not very secure" review but when the Vizio arrived I found the stand to be quite satisfactory although I wouldn't swing on it like Tarzan.
Yes - it runs Microsoft Office like any other laptop. You just have to purchase Office, but that's standard for any computer.
I don't have a warranty
No, Pure1 connects with ONE device at a time. But you can switch between different devices. I alwasy switch between my cell phone and tablet. When driving, i connect it with my cell phone. At home, i connect it with my tablet.
I believe it does. I actually bought it for my husband to use with his iphone but it should be compatible with any phone that has bluetooth capabilities.
I am not sure what you are asking but if by "mobile" you mean "laptop computer" then yes you can transfer files between the "SD" card and the external hard drive via the "laptop computer".
Yes you can because you just have to face it in the other direction and it works do it all the time.
No
Sure, if the raspberry pi is connected to internet, and your gps (Adafruit Ultimate GPS) is constantly reporting the location to somewhere (like a server). Now the solution you gotta come up is how you're going to connect the raspberry pi to internet, and keep the raspberry PI powered up.
Hi, That is actually going to vary depending on the seller you choose to purchase from. Atoms Industries ships from Dallas, Texas. Other sellers may be located outside of the US so they would be shipping it from another country. I hope that helps! Kind Regards, Ben
I don't have the larger one, but this is perfect for travel. Major pain to fill up.
Yes
I suppose that depends upon which way round your devices connector is. If I hold the cable with the micro usb connecter facing to the right and the usb adapter towards me then the micro adapter is facing up (the smaller curved part is to the top). hope this helps
The manufacturer will send you a micro SD card with the firmware on it upon request.
Never had this problem.
Now it is Leapord Snow but I haven't used it since I bought it due to it not working ...
Early 2008, thank you
It cannot be configured, but I have two dogs (under 20lbs) and they do not set off the sensors. However, my sensors are put at about shoulder height and the sensors may be more sensitive to animals if they are positioned lower.
Yes
Yes all my songs from memory chip are playing on the tablet sound is not super loud though
Its great! My 3 yr old has dropped his tablet numerous times and no cracks to the tablet.
8mp
I haven't got that far yet. It was too complicated to understand how to get it to work.I went out and bought a flash drive recorder.
Yes it is replaceable
Yes, it works great. I use the device on my pc and connect to a Bose bluetooth speaker.
hi, friend, you can try again.thanks
They don't beep or anything, but they do make a nominal clicking sound.
I have exactly the same problem with my radio, which basically renders it USELESS in my area. They should warn customers before hand that this is the situation. Send it back for a refund if you can.
yes all PCIe technology is forward and backward compatible to the least common denominator if you put a 3.0 card in a 2.0 slot ir will run as 2.0 if you put a 2.0 card in a 2.0 slot ir will run as 2.0 if you put a 3.0 card in a 3.0 slot ir will run as 2.0 if you put a 3.0 card in a 3.0 slot ir will run as 3.0 same true with 2.1, 1.0, and 1.1 cards
Yesss it linge are the same and compattle 16x but yea i have minr in a rampage iv gene and is great card for buck
Yes
Which Asus Transformer model? Do you have root permissions? If not, then you won't be able to copy files from the tablet to the usb drive. NOTE: Unless your Asus Transformer supports USB OTG out of the box.
This projector comes with a VGA cable-commonly known as a DE-15. (Go to Wikipedia/VGA Connector for a picture). If your laptop has one of those plugs in the back, you are all set. It also has an HDMI connector, but does not ship with an HDMI cable. (Wikipedia/HDMI for a picture). If you laptop only has an HDMI connector, you will need your own cable.
at 90" from the 'screen' to the front of the projector, it throws an image with 58" diagonal on 'tele' and 80" diagonal on 'wide' zoom setting. this model has a digital zoom, not the physical zoom ring that some models have. hth. -doug
I usually use it for writing and it is not good. I went back to my adonit stylus. Was trying to return it but I live outside US so it's kinda cumbersome to return it. Shipping charges from my country is half of the cost of the stylus so I'm kinda stuck with it now.
6.6x2.75x1.5 inches
It can be connected to a computer with the auxiliary cable, or via bluetooth. It comes with a microusb cable that can either be used for charging through a computer or by using any other micro usb charger from a cellphone.
I run two of these and my computer is actually very quiet unless I'm running triple screen high Def gaming. Even then it is not loud, and no coil whine whatsoever. The temperature is also not an issue. The fans are robust and not loud.
Mine did
I believe they are 6 watt speakers
Yes, we do.
Yes. You can use a zacuto or whatever. I think the clearance would not be an issue
It is about 6lbs
panasonic ag-dvx100b is too big, you need a bigger rig.
You have to buy a female to male 30 pin adapter. But it has to be for the lightning connector amazon does not have one I have purchased 3 so far and none are correct
There is not an HDMI port on this computer.
yes
Yes
Yes, I convert them to xvid using DVDfab and they play just fine.
No problem. Simply turn all units into the same channel (i.e. same frequency).
Yes ,it come with a remote.
Yes it does...and a fairly long cord.
If there is an adapter kit for it then yes
Yes I have, it's safe as far as I know from the last time I downloaded it. You can also just search the web for the manual and find the PDF directly if you want.
Yes, one button allow you to start/stop the recording. About the ten minutes I think It can, depends on the battery.
If the battery is completely empty, it may need a few minutes to get enough of a charge to start recording. It does, however, record normally when hooked up for charging.
Yes this is normal. Like all portable electronics, battery life depends on applications, and video recording consumes battery faster than some other functions such as radio or audio playback. The battery pack is used as a backup. For best results, please always connect the camera to its wall charger (with USB cord). Please let us know if you have other questions. Thanks.
No.
The record function only works when a microSD card is inserted. Thanks!
720P looks great. At the higher resolution the playback stutters and the frame rate drops to 24 fps.
Yes
Yes it is, it have rain ice, snow and rain for many days and the system is still working great
Ipad mini, cable, charger, instructions, stickers.....just as the one at an apple store.
Well the iPad Mini 1 has a lower screen resolution, the iPad Mini 2 has a better and the latest screen resolution which means the screen is much clearer and crisper, the iPad Mini 3 has everything the iPad Mini 2 has except the mini 3 has a fingerprint sensor. So in my opinion the iPad Mini 2 is the best deal in my opinion because the fingerprint sensor on the mini 3 is just not worth the upgrade for the higher price. I hope this kind of helps. :-)
I got it with my Kindle Fire and had to have it replaced to to a drop. Smooth process all the way around! Plus, they are so much cheaper than Apple's coverage and it is accidental coverage as well!
Yes you can use other OEM devices. I have charged a Sony device and a iPhone at the same time.
Muy buen producto realmente me siento complacido! Gracias
Feels solid and is similar shape to Chromecast.
It does not good verymuch
It will work as a keyboard, but it will not fit evenly on your iPad, since the iPad Air has narrow bezels (sides)
No you can't. The case is designed for the tablet only.
It is powered through the radio's harness u have to tap into the positive wire yellow
YES!!
Yes X 2 !!
No did not work with go pro hero 4 black
It doesn't.
Yes Jessica the quality is very good
I'm not sure what you mean by comply tip but I assume it has to to with the ability to change ear tips. As far as I can tell they will accept most standard tips. I have used the largest bud style tips as my ears are on the larger side.
Hi, Yes, it can be upgraded. 8GB max / PC3-12800 1600MHz DDR3L, non-parity, two 204-pin SODIMM sockets It comes with: 11b/g/n, PCIe Half Mini Card, ThinkPad 11b/g/n, 1x1, Wi-Fi + Bluetooth combo adapter
No
Yes it does.
Honestly man I thought they were nice at first they sounded great outta the box. But I dropped them off my desk ONCE at about a 3 foot drop onto tile and one of the speakers stopped working. Then they went through the x-ray at the airport and just broke completely. Idk why.. I was using them put it through the x-ray and then they never worked again...
The hardware is not compatible, I think the phone is to advance for the headphone
It works well. We have used it in an office under fluorescent lights and at home. The keyboard is bright and crisp.
Yes u can hook it up via component, composite, and av
yes , if your tablet is GT-P5113S, the item will fit you
I have a Toshiba satellite c55D-B5310 and it would not fit. I ended up returning it.
Yes
Manufacturer will have soon (in 6-8 weeks) mounting accessories, so easy to mount on kayak, boat, yacht or similar.
Why would you want to attach it to your dashboard?
Up to 4 hours
You have choices. You can use audio cables (red and white), coaxial (black), fiber optic cable (red laser), and a regular stereo jack
Yes.
If you spend a little extra cash you can find a much better quality product. This unit sucks. It makes it seem like it can do many things including a gps function whixh it doesnt. It can do 3 things radio, dvd player, and cd player.
Yes
well, the description must state that it is 32 bit. And if your system can run windows 7 it should work. That is what I did and now I am running windows 7 on my desktop that came with windows vista...hope that helps
From Vista (32 bit) you should be able to upgrade and everything will transfer over. Your system should meet all the minimum requirements for Win 7 if it was running Vista, check this page http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/system-requirements to make sure. If you buy this and find it won't upgrade, you won't totally lose the value of buying Windows 7 as you can also do a 'clean' install that would require you to reinstall Office and others. However, you should backup your important files before you upgrade, just to be safe.
Yes, it will be a little large but with the adjustable strap it will be fine
There is no height for the Garmin Friction Mount (ball arm) as the divider between screen area and the little storage area for cable, etc can only accommodate up to that amount not the (ball arm folded apparatus).
no, this one worked fine. I also have gotten that with the cheap extensions. This one is not cheap.
It shouldn't be a problem. The pads are Velcro and very strong (so they are easy to adjust the sizes. Works with my iPad, mini and kindle!!!
According to this link that seems to be possible http://www.beatsbydre.com/support/info/tap-amplify-stereo.html
The easiest way to remove the iPad is by grabbing in opposite ends in the corners and twist like you would twist an ice cube tray, that's the I found to be the easiest one. Ps: don't twist to hard the case and don't hold the iPad and don't twist the iPad or you will might end up cracking up the screen.
No
Works perfectly with my Friendly Swede Stylus. Great screen protector and a great price.
Sorry, this tablet do not include gps inside, best regards,
Hi Maria, I can't apologize enough for missing your question until now. The answer is that FLOTE was designed to be like a floor lamp; you don't really move it around much. If you do want to move it, the FLOTE Base has gliders on the bottom to help it slide easily along hardwood floors or low-pile carpet. Or as some people have done, you can add low-profile casters available online at coolcasters.com. As for the inserting and inserting your tablet, it takes only seconds and is very easy to do. Again my apologies for missing your question.
I can't tell you the actual size, because I used a dremel to enlarge the existing cigerette lighter hole, but I can tell you that at least on a Harley Streetglide, it is bigger than the standard cigerette lighter hole
this is just an extension no electronics involved ,if you can play music plugging your flash drive directly into isimple interface then .yes it will play.
I have used mine in the rain and had no problems, so far they've been fine.
The MK902 does not have an IR port.
Technically compatible, but some function keys maybe diffirent.
yes it does
I ordered this camera several months back and it came with everything you see in the picture. . . . .
Yes. Input line from MP3 player goes to amp. Line out from amp goes to car input jack.
Go here for Mac instructions... http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=27492646&postcount=7071
if you set it up with the utility software it can be set to over write older data. about 8 hours with 32gb
The only way to do this is to use Velcro or similar. Alternatively, buy two RAM mounts.
I use on Apple 5
IPad Mini 2 w A7 chip.
No, this is second generation or commonly known as iPad mini 2
Yes.Magicjack app(magicApp) is available at itunes appstore and gives you unlimited calls/text wherever you have WiFi for $2/month or $15/year($1.25/month).You can call landlines and mobile numbers and text to mobile numbers. Many tablet/ipod touch owners are unaware they can use their device as a WiFi phone.It works like a speaker phone and if you want a private conversation,just plug in earbuds/headphones as the mic will still pick up your voice.No special headset needed. The app is free if you use magicjack home phone service for $3/month.Here is an amazon link for magicjack GO home phone device: http://www.amazon.com/magicJack-Digital-Includes-12-Months-K1103/dp/B00LN0OM14/ref=zg_bs_13431611_1
Yes
Most likely, but this tablet does not have a lot of processing power, nor a lot of RAM to run processes. You'd have a better experience with a more advanced device.
No you have to cut to fit
This will fit any Double Din slot with the proper vehicle adapter. My toyota celica was a direct bolt in with no adapter required .
if you have a double din radio area then yes.
Yeah !!! It doesn't work good at all at night !!! pretty much false advertising !!!
The first time you connect, the CS918S should ask to Allow or Deny the connection - kinda like Bluetooth. Hope that helps.
Yes it is!
Edit: From HooToo Website: - NOT compatible with Windows RT systems, Mac and Linux. ----------------------------- The interface from HooToo to laptop is USB-3. If your Macbook Pro has a USB-3 port, than yes.... possibly**. If not, there may be Thunderbolt (MAC) to USB adapter cable out there. (I should probably learn, since my wife uses Macbook, too.) **In either case, also be sure to check for video driver compatibility. DisplayLink is the provided video driver for using HooToo with Windows. In the end, it may be better to find a similar product that is specifically made for MAC.
It'd dependent on the chipset in your laptop . Have the same problem with my MacBook pro. It will only support one external display at a time. You need one of the new retina mbps for dual external displays.
I can't really help, as my systems are all PC based. The manual tells me this is Mac compatible up to 10.9. Try reviewing the specification on WWW.startech.com. hope this helps.
Yes
Hello, thanks for your email. It's brand new, boxed, unopened, warranty expires after 3 years from the date of purchase. I can send you some photos of the actual box if you are genuinely interested. as promised I have made some photos for you, please advise your email address.
international
As of 12-26-2014, YES, Spotify is now supported... along with iHeart Radio, Deezer and Pandora.
Yes, its a great radio and CD will start with remote. + other great features
It depends. The Bose Wave SoundTouch has an Auxiliary input. So if your CD changer has an Auxiliary output then all you need is an Auxiliary cable to connect the two and it will work. The only draw back from this is that you would need to use two remotes. The Bose remote to turn the speaker on, adjust volume, and switch to Auxiliary input, and then you would use the CD changer remote to play, pause, and switch CD's.
Apple iPads are restricted from scrolling through web pages so that cant be done with the arrows on these keyboards (its a iPad restriction, not a keyboard restriction)
Within XMBC go to Programs, Click on Android Apps, go to the bottom of the page and click on settings, click on XMBC and clear defaults at the bottom. If you then click the home button it gives the option to select a new launcher.
yes. i got both remotes. the G-mouse comes in it's own box
I never tried putting my iPhone on it but I would recommend getting a longer cord so you can have more freedoms with your phone while playing music. But I do love the quality of the music it plays
No.. I don't think so.. as a matter of fact it came with a USB cord and I still can't figure out what its for. But it plays loud and clear definitely worth the money
Absolutely it has a plug in future.
No it doesn't you have to purchase a power supply
Infrared, there is only a slight red glow visible when looking directly at the camera.
NO
100a
There is no ringer on this unit. You control the rings on your existing phones. Regards,
Yes, it will store the last 100 phone numbers that called. While scrolling you can press the BLACKLIST button to add the numbers to the Blocked list.
At least in my experience, no. Both are networks, so enabling one disables the other. It appears that, like a radio, you can only receive one channel at a time. I've checked this with IT people, and it looks like it is only one system at a time.
Mirror only.
yes just load drivers and mining software set up an account to pool mine and go read my review it has details
no
Yes, it does. If it says "BF4 Edition" in the name it should come with a BF4 code. Mine says it expires March 31, 2014, but I already redeemed my code. It only comes with BF4 and no other add-ons or expansions.
Yes
If the charging cord on an iPhone 6 plus has an USB connector on the end away from the phone, as I'm sure it does, then it will.
Works with any electronic that u can charge using a usb...
The cord that comes to charge the charger can also be used to charge the phone. I have tried it on my S5
Almost pretty quiet
It can be ordered in either i5 or i7 configuration, but upgrades of either the processor or memory are not possible due to packaging constraints
No, it is not motorized, removable face for theft protection
The head unit has four 50 watt speaker outputs that each have 14 watts rms. It has two rca output sets for preamp for speakers and another set for subwoofers. (3 total) It does have a color display that can be changed to any color you fancy. It also has a full-dot display that can display several animated backgrounds.
Yes it can
It is a 64 bit. I do not think there are many, if any, 32 bit Win Pros. anymore.
Pretty sure it's not possible.
A7/A7R menu, turn "Remote Ctrl option to "On"" (default is off). It works.
the usb interfaces' specification 2.0
You can't, unless you find a custom rom (or compile it yourself), this android box won't recognize the Logitech unifying receiver, which is the one the K400r uses.
You can connect to an external HDMI monitor but you cannot (as far as I know) use an external touch interface with it.
I read somewhere that these are suppose to last for up to a year. Just make sure you keep them stored somewhere cool.
There is a manual on the disk that comes with it. If you don't have disk call the support line they are extremely helpful. They helped me with some questions I had.
The original Poseidon uses CHERRY MX switches. The "Z" uses the Kaihl.
It feels very weighted and solid; feels approx 3-4 pounds.
Glasses will definitely affect the usability of these glasses.
Depends on which plan you get from T-Mobile, but to answer your question, yes, it can.
There is a case that fits this slate perfectly, but it's on Ebay. Search slate 3400 on Ebay and you'll find it. I've bought one
Sorry no.
Runs it just fine. I use it for some old DOS games everything including sound works just fine.
Well... your question is a bit confusing. It is a UEFI bios that has ample features for any kinda of use. I currently use this board as a file server running NAS4Free. Has enough power for most internet use.
The unit is hardware modified version. It comes with 30 days money back warranty and 1 year warranty for parts and labor.
120V, the cord is permanently mounted not allowing for adapters etc. I believe this unit has been discontinued as well. Check samsungusa.com/support
They can all be compared at http://www.samsung.com/us/video/bluray-players
no, one goes in the camera, the other in the grip. It just extends battery life, I went 2 weeks 1000+ shots before I needed a charge
Yes, mine came with the fabric carrying case/pouch in what looks like unused, new condition. The instruction manual was nicely wrapped and sealed as if in a new item, and the secondary cord (without iPod controls) and headphone adapter were in sealed plastic pouches.
Yes it works for music too. This has been a real good radio so far. Only thing I don't like about it is if you have to change your car battery or take off your battery cables for anything it doesn't hold memory. You have to reset everything like you just installed the radio
Yes it will just make sure to buy the right wiring harness & dash kit
Yeah with the right dash kit
The charger that came with the tablet does not work and the battery arrived in poor condition because it discharge very fast. Such things can not be given.
It is a android TV player.Thanks.
Thanks for your contacting. The MIC doesn't support to work simultaneously with the AV tracks.
Yes , It does. Working with 720p and 1080p TV. It is very good. But It will be hot when turn on, need a USB Fan, run fast
All of them . All the channels that on Nilesat : LBC, MTV,....ets
there are a lot of religious channels. Hard to list them all here.
Cut the plug off and splice them in.
I put these on my motorcycle and doesn't matter which direction you place them.
They all work, but they are a pain to get them lined up, and to stay lined up to work.
I can confirm it works with 220V.
Yes, there are screw slots underneath, I can screw the bracket from my tripod the is intended for my camera on the underside of the assembly.
The height on the mount can be adjusted. So yes you can use your follow focus.
Yes
Yes, white is available/ The ASIN is :@B00GTRFH88. Please have a check. thanks
Karen, The keyboard is detachable. Brenda
Hi Susanna, I haven't had any problems with this keyboard. I easily paired it with my Samsung Galaxy Tab 3, which is a 10.1. I hope this helps.
Haven't had it happen to me yet, but will watch for that.
113/4"H x 21"W (23" Diagonal) viewable area.
Yes
doesn't seem to be any difference, except for the phone adaptor
Very bright and surprisingly loud im very happy with this product it's in my bathroom
No
Yes Bluetooth! Works like a charm
Yes
I will not work, it works for the unibody macbook. Cheers.
A portion of the sides of the mount protrude just enough to pressure fit the ipad into place.
Almost nothing Just mesure and cut the same zise of the inside part of the wall ipad and do some wallfish wiring for the power to charge the ipad Thanks
I am using this adapter for a third monitor in windows 8 on an asus laptop. Since I already have four monitors on my windows7 I tried to add a fifths monitor with this adapter but could not, however, I think it with the hp laptop not the adapter.
Hi, thank you for your inquriy .Please kindly note that this item could work for Window7 &8 monitor.
Yes, as long as it is a 2.5 inch SATA (II, III) drive it will. I haven't tried the new 2 TB 2.5 inch drives though.
I believe it was EC-NFVV as pictured on Amazon.
Yes, there is a youtube app you can download.
Yes, but it will not screw on - you just hold it over the front of the lens.
I'm not sure but whatever battery it was, it was truly terrible. On max volume only 1 hour and 40 min of play time. On low volume 3 hours and 30 min.
It's a bit involved. While not difficult, it's not convenient.
Nope its only for the 2. I have a 3 as well and have not found a case for it yet like this one.
Black top, black inside (screen and keyboard) and silver base. It is exactly as the picture shows.
The ulra book says it is but I havnt tryed it yet have you gone through the manual
Patricia, I don't know anything about ipods or apple products, however the ountz curve that I gave my sister in law was the best present ever she said as she uses it every day with Bluetooth Pandora at her job as pharmacist at a large hospital. Great product and much better sound than others that cost a lot more. Buy it and enjoy.
The laptop does have a touchpad to use as mouse. Use the touchpad along with the touchscreen and you won't miss the mouse.
yes, manufacturer warranty.
It should. It held up my heavy camera with no problem.
Windows 8 operating system; 30 day Internet Security
Dear Sir,please let me inform you that US civil channel is 462-467.You needn't get the licence in these frenquency. Otherwise, If you are going to use the radios in the amateur radio 440MHz band, then you'd need an amateur radio license. If you are going to use the radios in the GMRS service, then you'll need a GMRS license.
the item is same as the website , it is for Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 GT-P5113TS GT-P5113 P5113 P5113TS
Yes, it'll fit
Yes
No
You can fold the case cover under and hold it with the elastic band but the Microsoft keyboard was not designed for that. You would have to detach it and set it aside.
It does not come with an AC adapter in the box. Bit you can find one for under $10 on Amazon.
No it doesn't.
Just saying maybe look into some Sennheiser products, the Sennheiser urbanite XL is basically their equivalent of the top quality beats and razer headphones. their build quality is amazing and I just wish I had the money for their Urbanite XLs. If you're looking for something for gaming as well as music, between beats and razer I'd definitely say razer, just because it's better for gaming. Again, Sennheiser has several gaming headset models, but I won't go on in too much detail since that isn't what you asked for.
I have them and I have tested the pros. The sound quality is better but not dramatically better. These are razers best and are in the elite categor. They are 2.0 stereo. 40mm neodymium magnets that are custom tuned. It has maximum portability with a carrying case. I would definitely recommend this to all people, not just gamers. For the money it was worth it.
Well sort of. It has an in line mic that will only work with mobile devices such as phones or ipods. If you want to use this mic for a PC you would have to go to radioshack and get a adapter for it to work properly. Think of this headset as a direct competitor to dre beats.
I use it for my nikon camera and it works fine. I have the S4 and it is not compatible in my S4.
It should be able to work. The Verizon Samsung Galaxy S Fascinate i500 has a slot that you will be able to see when you remove the battery cover. The slot is for an microSDHC memory card, which is what this product is. The phone supports a microSDHC memory card up to 32GB.
No, this adapter is for 2008 and newer model Honda vehicles. We do offer a compatible product for the 04 Accord found here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CFRZQLE
It was good and it worked. If you need one get it.
Hello Azlynne and thank you for your order, you will need 2 USB cords. 1 USB cord from your device to the main port at the top part of the unit, and another USB from the post to a wall outlet, this should charge the device while on the stand. Please feel free to contact me for further assistance. Thanks again Andrea
Its not noise cancelling the way you think, there is just layers of filters that will filter out background noise. Like the foam piece around most microphones except even better. The mic is the highest quality you can buy on a headset and you wont need to worry about that at all.
Yes it is Thank you
Oh yeah more then enough...
Yes.
Yes, there's plenty of free solitaire and card apps that you can download on the Play Store.
I was unable to use the keyboard with the tablet while in the case. I returned the case as I like to have the keyboard access all the time.
I only bought one, but yes they are all new in the box.
I used it for the Asus Memo Pad ME102 10.1 inch and it works fine.
It hooks up very easily to the AV cables, or to the Audio (head phone jack) on TV, or receiver. My Wife's Aunt loves it, and was concerned that she wouldn't be able to connect it. It's great, and charges, if desired, from the base. The receiver should have a headphone/AV jack to connect to. You won't be disappointed, and can always return it. Just another thought, this item is discontinued by the manufactured, so any fixes are DIY or after market. Good Luck!
I took one picture and it froze. Never worked. I bought a GoPro Hero 4. Works great.
Don't buy this terrible product. Mine stops working after 2 days. No sound. Even when it works, it's hard to use. The buttons are hard to press. Just don't buy it. I threw it in the trash.
You can push the source button on the side.. If it's flashing blue it plays Bluetooth and if it's flashing red it plays the aux
Kinivo website indicates that the company headquarters is Bellevue, WA and that their products are all manufactured overseas. The manual for the M2 states "Made in China". THX certification isn't mentioned. Comparison to Creative system unknown; Creative has numerous 2.1 systems. Online reviews indicate good quality to price ratio.
Yes once you sync it initially. If you sync another device you will have to resync your mac
Simple.TV improved the way the Lifetime Subscription works. Initially, it was only for the product you purchased, but now it is for all Simple.TV boxes you have registered to the account you have the Lifetime subscription tied to. They updated the account interface with an "Add New DVR" selection in the settings - which is where you can add a new Simple.TV tuner to your existing Lifetime subscription. It's a nice policy and a big improvement from their initial positioning.
This is the same as the configuration sold for $199 on Simple.TV's website.
No it doesn't.
Yeah, on the back there are two little plastic sticks that pull out and connect together to prop the frames up.
CAIUL, Friend
No rear camera
Mine turns on all the time. Not sure what's wrong with your tablet. I would return it and get a new one
It does not seem to allow you to do that.
yes, make the purchase on amazon...then register your product on the warranty companies website.
It's a one time charge as far as I know. You fill out the warranty details after getting the electronics item from amazon
I do not know the answer, best bet is to call the company, sorry.
Black
Yes.
Press the + button slowly
build in battery don't know if it can be replace...
sorry we do not have it for Tab 2 7inch tablet. Thanks
I haven't!
No.
There is nothing in the instructions about repeater/extender. THis antenna increases he range of wifis you can receive on the computer. It uses a usb to connect. Maybe you can ask at the official web site: ccrane.com.
No CD/DVD Drive
Yes compatible indeed.
Yes it does.
Not sure off top of my head. Normally I use a voltmeter to check these things. Properly designed circuits will have a blocking diode to prevent polarity reversal issues. Those that don't, may have smoke issues!
not that I am aware of Jim.
Input: 100-240V ~ 1.6A 50-60Hz. You might need a different plug. I got us plug only.
I have not played cds.
Mine is just attached with magnets and just lifts off
No, it uses a wired mouse, but a wireless mouse is cheap at places like Walmart. I prefer a wired mouse because I don't have to keep turning it on and off. I love this laptop it's fast and always works.
It's very thin. Maybe a half inch. I just bought one at Walmart for $89. So, don't buy it here.
Hi Hp 7 1800 tablet work With Wi Fi very well and Wi Fi is Everywhere in the World..
Yes
Doubtful it is a tight pocket.
Very well, the only draw back is they come with no case.
The 845's are designed in Austria. The headphone and packaging are silent on where they are actually assembled(made) Likely made in China but that is a guess.
No
I think you can, but it will be needed an extra accesory for holding cell phone. You can find that also in the store
The OEM (system builder) edition allows for one installation only activated by Microsoft. Installing the OEM on multiple computers will cause the authentication process to fail and you'll have an unlicensed version of windows on 4 of your 5 computers! If you need to install windows 7 pro on more, you need to purchase the retail version of windows, which will allow you to install the same license key onto up to 5 machines.
According to this article, you don't need a copy of Windows to run a VirtualBox copy of Windows (http://pclosmag.com/html/issues/201309/page15.html)...good luck!
Hello, Yes, it's brand new, in a factory sealed box. Best regards, Amuras
Yes
hit F5
Sorry, but there is no way to download or access online the info on the CD. But more over you can purchase a new USB optical drive for your ultrabook. Which can run your CD.
Are you using the CD that came with it? I'm running windows 8.1 pro x64, and when I installed the software on the CD, it worked perfectly. You might have a defective product.
I heard this model uses a displaylink DL-3k series chip and Linux support for only DL-1x5 which is older generation chip is currently available per displaylink website. So even there are some success stories with other usb monitors on linux, that wouldn't apply for this.
Yes
it sees to be.
These headphones have a standard Headphone jack (3.5 mm) so as long as your TV has a standard jack size then you're all set. This is the common side that an iPhone or an old Sony Walkman would use.
Yes it will. Product discription 4th bullet point= "Audio Input Allows simple plug and play integration with any additional music device such as CD, MP3 or Cassette Player via a 3.5mm jack. / Compatible with iPod touch (5th generation),**** iPod nano (7th generation) and iPhone 5****"
As long as the device has blue tooth capability, it should link it without a problem.
As long as the device you are using is compatible. Make sure that 3.5 mm jack on your PS4 controller is compatible with the RaveTouch input jack. This is very important; because the jacks on some PS4 controllers are smaller than the standard size used on most headsets and devices. If it matches, I highly recommend you get this headphone. What a sound! You will not be disappointed !
I'd like it to get tighter, but it's still really nice. it doesn't move when riding.
Yes, it folds flat. Only has one viewing angle, stitching crooked and flimsy. There are better ones out there that have a swivel and grooves for more angles. Only has one viewing angle, stitching crooked and flimsy.
Yes
The r+ legend silver like the one in the picture is what I have and it's over the ear (covers entire ear and rests on head). Really comfortable!
Dear ,the battery life :standby time about 50 days music play time about 28 hrs Hope this help Bluedio team
Nope the bolt is the only thing missing. For the price its a good buy
All you need to do is take a bolt off an existing mount and super glue it into the spot shaped like the bolt. Pretty simple and effective
I use it on my Canon Rebel T3i and it worked fine.
Yeah because the music and the ring tone both use the same speaker on the phone to make sound
ANYTHING that is normally coming out the phone speaker will INSTEAD come out the Boom Box Speaker. When you lift the phone off the Boom Box the phone speaker automatically comes back on. GREAT device for when listen to music or whatever. I have an app for Internet radio and when I shave I listen to the radio through the smartphone.
Yes, it does, or you can put the SD card in a card reader on your PC or laptop...
Its fine - about as good as my old iPad 2
I also had similar experience with the speaker. However, I've noticed that the speaker worked fine when there's no wife interference. Move the iPad and the speaker away from any wifi zone. Also, you might want to check you iPad setting as well. Good luck.
I want to connect my USB auxiliairy to my car it does'nt works.
Yes if you have mirrcast on your phone
Yes,it can, but just support Ezcast and Airplay Mode, no screen mirror function right now. Tronsmart said they are working on it, and in 2014, we can see the screen mirroring on IOS device.
Dear Tracy, thanks for your question. We have got an reply from the supplier and being told that the outer diameter of the ring light is 104.15mm. Hope this is helpful to you. --CamerAcc
Great for full face portrait closeups! With the light mounted to the lens it will prevent shadows from being created.
I feel that vignetting along the edges will be more dependent on the focal length of your lens. I have not had any vignetting issues when using focal lengths over 5omm.
All CD, DVD, and BD drives have been supported by linux since forever and requires no special driver, it should be automatically detected by the kernel. As far as differences, go to pioneerelectronics.com and type in the model #s, the only difference is that the 209 is newer and can burn BDR SL @ 16x vs the 208 @ 15x.
You can connect all your devices, iPhone, PC, Pads to it by wifi.
Yes
I'm not certain. I purchased this for a Nikon D3300, and was disappointed that it seems too large. The lens of the D3300 collapses, while the D3200 does not, so that could account for some of the extra depth. However, the overall fit was loose. I hope that helps you decide if it will fit the D3200 with battery grip.
yes this laptop has a built-in webcam
Yes
The reason I don't think it's ideal for runners is because they do not stay inside ones ear even when in walking motion.
Marcio...the ear pieces are much larger than they appear on the webpage. If you wear the earbuds in bed, I don't think the buds will stay in your ears, unless you use the ear hooks. The ear hooks keep the buds 'on' your ears, but not 'in' your ears. Personally, I would not go with this product for a bedtime ear bud.
No, my husband says it doesn't have Bluetooth . I really love it though. It's a beautiful computer and works very well for all my needs. Good luck in choosing one !
I never did, but I would ask HP or someone like Best Buy or Frys. The AMD Radion Card is quite impressive. I use MS Flt Sim a lot that requires great graphics n a fast processor. I got both with model
Yes
Looking at the case, where it is a top mount design, it should fit just fine.
Absolutely. Your 750 Ti only uses a fraction of the power required by my HD 7850. This PSU is flawless for the money.
It use two 2025 Battery
it was in a mining cluster for about 4 months, run full tilt at normal temps.
Yes, this card will work with your UEFI motherboard.
Sort of. Google offers a free app that seems to be in early stages of refinement, but gets lots of favorable reviews. Check it out at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudon.client&hl=en.
No, it is not Bluetooth compatible. You could buy an adapter but it would be another thing hanging off of it.
there isn't one
&gt;P-04S Upgrade: (compare Laing P-04) 1. Weight-Bearing up to 15kg. 2. Use stronger Carbon Fiber tube. 3. Add 9.5mm(3/8") Camera mounting holes. 4. More small Upgrade...
HDMI capability
From what I am understanding, it does NOT. It has to be set up connected directly to a router through an ethernet cable when you set it up & then works wirelessly on that network. My friend is looking for one that works on a hot spot as well. Lol.
You can right click and you will see zoom out/zoom in
probably not based on the data shown
The color rendition of this ring light is great i had the lesser halo ring light . The color rendition of the halo 100 ring light is great my shots look great in every shot I take especially things like flowers and plants. I have used it with fashion before as well and clothing looks good to great as well.
Samsung cameras have a standard hot shoe, so not sure what you mean by "compatibility issues". You will lose TTL with this manual flash. Thus, you need to have some ideas on how to use your camera on "Manual" and not use "Auto" or try to set your sync speed too high.
It should work. Fits any camera hot shoe exept sony cameras.
Yes it is compatible
Yes!
This is shipped by AMZAON, and we have attended AMAZON international shipping plan. pls kindly contact with the buyer's support to check if it can be shipped to CANADA.
Yes
No
Yes it fits the Galxay 7 inch tablet very well I have several color that all fit snug like a bug in a rug.
I am not sure, I bought a 7 inch samsung galaxy 3 tablet, it fits snug. and the leather is slightly flexible. as long as your dell is the same as the galaxy. you could go to a store with your dell and see if its the same size as the samsung.
Yes. The t217s is a Galaxy 3 7 inch tablet. This case is made for that tablet.
Thank you for contacting us. You should be able to use the item you are inquiring about for your school work. You should be be able operate the games and programs on the item with no issues. Please feel free to contact us if you have any further questions.
Ours came with a charger
Yes it does BUT, mine quit working after one semester of college. The screen just went white and nobody could figure out what was wrong with it. I suggest you spend a little more on a laptop that will last you.
No...you would have to purchase a usb dvd/cd drive if needed.
It can, but the Raspberry Pi itself can not offer a reliable source of power for the monitor. So, you will need to connect the USB to either a self-powered USB hub or just a standard USB charger. I just hooked it up to my Raspberry Pi home theater system to test, so you can see for yourself; http://i.imgur.com/CiC708y.jpg
Yes, this has Google Play and you can download apps, games and more
Yes, hand wash gently without soap
No. You only have to gently pull the iPad from the magnetic hinge to use by itself
The iPad will not fit in the stand or connect to the magnet if there is another case on it. If you want to use the cae you currently have but need a keyboard you may want to consider our stand alone keyboard. Here is a backlit one: http://www.amazon.com/Keyboard-Bluetooth-Ultra-Slim-Illuminated-Backlights/dp/B00E1HIVG8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1391630317&sr=8-1&keywords=sharkk+backlit+keyboard
I have a GT-60 that is very heavily loaded. It works great on the GT-60. I do not know if it will work with the CZ-17 or not but if it only requires 180W I would guess that it will work for you.
It's a very basic function; varifocal lens zoom in and out. Angle is all on placement of the camera. This camera gives a better shot for longer distances.
It fills the entire screen which is great. However, the colors are different or a bit off from the colors of the iPad.
Yes, my Phantom 2 Vision plus fits perfectly. I really like this case!
If you will buy me one and ship to me, I'll test it out!! Sorry, Im not upgrading just yet. Hopefully it will fit though.
It works fine with my android tablet (Asus MemoPad). As long as your tablet has a video output and you can supply power to its usb port you should be okay. I haven't tried with any other tablets -- not sure if an iPad has the correct ports or not.
Yes, I have my D5300 with nikon 18-200mm lens attached and it fits perfectly in this bag.
Yes, YOu will be able to use it.
I use it in ford e350 Perfect fit
Nope it don't work it's a Lie it's false advertisement
if you have a recent iphone...with the appropriate cable you can get waze as well as other apps to work on you deck screen...if you have android...buy the mirror link adapter....and you.ll be on like boil corn....(all set and ready to go...that is.....lol)
Click on 'software' on the top of the instructions page. That will take you to a page containing a download link to msetup, along with other useful software.
To be honest I never used it for this purpose however the space provided for the camera is NOT restricted to the vision camera and I would imagine that there is enough room sideways for the Rotorpixel gimbal and this would fit well
Yes
The P2V+ is only about 1/4 inch taller than the p2V so it should still fit. However I would never store the craft with props installed.
It charges your phone on and off but will not play music through the USB. Need the genuine bmw part to play the music with the USB and for it to be displayed on the nav screen.
It makes a new file everyone 10mins of recording.
It is completely new, sealed in a box and the latest generation, IOS7, which can be upgraded to a new IOS8.
You can add a cellular card from any cellular provider - anywhere in the world.
For diagonal dimention
I could not tell, sorry.
Yes, it says A1475 on the back label.
It is factory unlocked and 64GB Wi-Fi + 4G LTE. Thanks.
You have to check the specs. Mine came with Windows 8.1 Pro
The card -should- be able to fit in any case with a minimum of 11.5" of room inside, it may be a little tight inside a mid case like the challenger.
Short answer: yes.
Yes
It's plenty. That's what I have and I am running 2 of them lol
Yes, I run two of them in SLI and there is tons of space
Yes, my daughter does this all the time
I am getting about 8-10 hours, but not constant use. It is very fast and charges quickly. From none to full in about an hour.
3"
Dear friend is not touch screen,,, i wish a got hp ultrabook touch screen hehe.. this loptop mike me happy,berry thin easy to carry.. Hp good company,outstanding produck The good thing is my hp got protectek by Norton anti virus. Thanks dear friend
No
It streams perfectly from Netflix
Yes but it is a very simple procedure. As far as the "flying away" horror stories go, I have had it happen once. The reason it flew off was entirely my fault (as is the case in most cases). I forgot to flip the GPS switch to "on". If it happens to you then all you have to do is turn your RC controller "off" before it gets to far away, and it will return home. It a great product and a lot of fun. Enjoy!
this will work
This will work.
It does fit Y50
definitely! its perfect for a college student. its portable and pretty efficient. it runs windows 8 OS so you need to consider that in respect of applications you want to run (windows 8 compatible versions may be required)
from http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/TouchSmart-PC/How-do-I-disable-touchpad-on-HP-Envy-TS-15-Notebook/m-p/3328441#M23544. Go to Control Panel, Devices and Printers, Mouse. A window opens showing tabs. Click on the right one "Click Pad Settings" and check the box "Disable internal pointing Device." I tested it on mine and it apparently works. Other HP forum responses say it cannot be done.
No, it comes with a regular hard drive.
No .
Yes.
No, unlike some iPad covers, it does not power the tablet down.
Yes
It's purple.
Warranty from Dell only. Which is 3 Years limited warranty.
Yes, all USB 3.0 devices will work in a USB 2.0 port, they will just run significantly slower due to the limits of USB 2.0 technology.
Yes James, there is a VGA port as well as a HDMI port!
No you cannot. It is very rare to find any laptop that can be upgraded in terms of processor and/or graphics card. Only desktops have that privilege.
No. Smile.
Yes
I don't have a surface pro I have surface rt and yes everything in this kit works perfectly. The mouse has a small USB that I believe would be compatible for any surface. I
You have to take the adapter piece out of the back of the mouse and plug it into your device and it should work automatically or you may have to setup the mouse to your device.
You turn your computer on, let it boot up (all programs are ready), then plug it in. Your computer should detect the new device and prompt you on what is needed to install and use the device. Normally there is a driver that is installed. If not search for The product website then search for the correct driver to download.
I know the YN-E3-RT works with the Canon 600EX-RT flash, as I run two of them from mine . Sorry, but I don't know about the YN568 EX
yes the stock cooler comes with this cpu
Yes, windows 7 and 8 64 bit are going to work perfectly. Just remember to install the latest catalyst drivers, at this moment are 14.10 beta.
No, I don't believe so.
Compatible with 9.5mm or 12.7mm height Internal Slim Slot Loading Optical Drive. (not included)
Yes it is. Depending how you plan on transporting it, you don't really need to use it. Mine is usually on a bookcase when I'm not using it or it's in my purse. It won't flop open easily, it is pretty sturdy.
yes but you will need several and a long time to recoup
Hi Chong. I am not sure what a Coupler is, but if it uses a USB charger you should have not have any problems. Remember if it does not work Amazon offers the A-Z purchase guarantee. You have 30 days to return your purchase for a complete refund.
Hello, sa-903 systems are not compatible with the xbox, sa-922 can be. ASIN: B00RZTK4QY&#12290;
I suppose, but HomeMonitor provides the clouds! Seriously, though, they provide online storage for the video the camera records. 7 days for free, and 30 days for a small monthly fee. You do need a WiFi network. Note also that thisHD camera is an INDOOR camera, so you'll have to point it out a window for clouds, or run your humidity way up inside your home!
It doesn't have CD/DVD drive, however u can plug in external CD/DVD drive.
Radio works great LOve it maybe they had a defect Mine works great wheel controls work fine gps works dvd is awesome and so many other features i dont even use bluetooth also works great put in myself in like 20 min. great for the money
The shipping parameters are dictated by Amazon, so you will need to view the shipping options for this order to see what they allow.
I'm trying to find a manual myself. Seems NO one who sells it has any idea. Go figure
I didn't get that far into the installation, still trying to figure out how to get American miles to show up instead of metric system. If u can answer that I would appreciate it. Thanks
Yes, it fits.
Yes, uses standard mini usb.
we will sent by USPS with the tracking number,it takes need 7-15 days can be arrive
We tried them on our 9 year old and they fit him just fine. Hope this helps!!! :)
Absolutely. I have an IPodTouch, 32Gig, 5th generation - it works great!
It already stopped working. Don't get it.
Yes
this product wont help you with that problem. sorry.
Hi, BearExtender Turbo is a High Speed 802.11ac adapter. If your disconnection problem is due to low signal strength, we recommend purchasing our BearExtender 1200 for Mac which is our Long Range model: http://www.amazon.com/BearExtender-1200-Signal-Booster-Antenna/dp/B00EQADD4K Please do not hesitate to contact us with any further questions at support@bearextender.com or by calling 1-800-348-5146. Regards, Jeff BearExtender jeff@bearextender.com 1-800-348-5146
My experience with them was not good. I purchased the cover only to find out they measured wrong. the cover for a 7" tablet does not take into consideration that the 7"screen has at the most a 1/2" border around it. So their 7" cover wont fit. And they wont take it back. Your stuck with it. My opinion....don't waist your money.
dear friend thank you for interesting our product ,this item is not fit for your tablet ,pls choose another item for replace it, thank you very much! happy new year to you and your family! best regards
Well, I don't have any of those products.. But it charges my GF samsung note 2 fine if that helps.. You just need a USB cable that's all..
It goes like this (The fourth, the fifth//the minor fall, the major lift// ;) ) power button, 1.5v, 2.1v. charging port
I don't know , I've just tryed it on my iPhone and iPad
It comes with a metal ring that fits your lens size then the light will slide right on
Yes, there are apps for that. The key is to recognize that the amount of memory is limited, and installing too many games or other apps will make it perform poorly. For a single purpose tablet, (ie. Kids to play, adults to i Se for remote email, etc) this works great. If speed is a big issue, spend the money and get something more robust. This has worked out well for my middle school aged daughter.
You can but, I don't know if you'll see improved I/O. I'm not sure what the SATA interface is to the drive. If it's an older generation you may not see improved throughput. Chances are you will see improved I/O. Just not sure how much.
This case can not fit Sony A7 with 24-70mm lens. I am sorry and hope you can understand.
This case only fit Sony A7, but we also have Sony A II full case, could you tell me what lens you use for Sony A7 II? We can check if our case can fit your lens.
No probelm, please leave me a message for extra 2 brass screws after you buy this item and we will send you this case together with extra 2 screws.
It looks like how it would on a computer in Windows.
the jacks should be on the front and back of the PC. the Actual program to adjust the settings should just come automatically when you plug the headphones in, at least that's what happened with me. You can also search in your computer for the Realtek HD audio manager if it isn't just popping up immediately.
I am sure you can. Upto 8 GB.
It sure is...
Hi Owen, Of course you can. We don't have anything proprietary on the design of this computer that will prevent it from being compatible it other replacement parts. Please keep in mind though that warranty will not apply to any parts that you replace and depending on what kind of work you do to the unit, may void the warranty completely as well. Standard replacements done properly should be okay. Please contact us at http://avatargamingpc.com/support if you have any further questions. Hope that helps!
Shipping to Nevada typically takes about 5 business days. We ship only once the payment clears.
Not overly aggressive and whites appear clean.
Already installed. Can't be changed easily by user.
Note: The dimensions listed on the Aeon Labs website are incorrect. They list the sensor is 25mm by 70mm This is not correct. the sensor is actually smaller than that. I used a 3/4 inch drill bit which is slightly larger than it needs to be. The documentation that comes with the sensor states the hole should use a 19mm Drill Bit drilled to 65mm deep. Up Dated 01/10/2014
Its the largest case I've seen on the market. But Ram goes on your motherboard. So it all depends on what kind of motherboard you purchase. The case has over 8 slots for Hard Drives.
There is no switch, but I think it autoswitches between 120/60hz (U.S. is 60, not 50) and 240/60hz. Now that I look at the specs at dell dot com, it say the input range is 100-240VAC, 50Hz/60Hz, 8.0A/4.0A so I guess the answer is "yes".
Yes.
NO, there is NOT a USB port on the back of the iPL8BN. There IS one on the back of the iPL8. The reason I know this is my wife bought the -BN model thinking it was identical to the iPL8 that we already had. When the iPL8BN arrived, NO USB port in the back.
It will sync the time to your phone. Just dock the phone and hit the sync time button.
Type.
No it does not.
Yes you can. Most of my apps are on a sd card
Yes
Early 2014
No, it does not.
Yes! It works great, so much better then the one provided by TWC.
Yes, you can.
yes
I have a premiere as well. It works with the premiere. There is a USB fob that plugs in the back, which allows it to work without a line of site to the tivo.
It does have a US keyboard, I do not know if it has an mSATA slot or not.
No it does not.
It does not come with office, you will gave to buy it,
Yes you just buy one and hook it into the usb port. It's the same as any other laptop :)
It has DVD-Rom drive on the table right hand side of the monitor. See tech specs: Optical Storage Device: Slim Tray SuperMulti DVD Burner
Yes
No.
It plugs into a standard 110 wall outlet. It's like any other computer you would buy only with the large touch screen that makes it like an iPad. Had it 8 months now and it's the best computer I've ever owned.
Yup, very responsive and the wireless feature is great!
No
Yes, the TV Ears 5.0 TV Listening speaker comes with everything you need to set it up with any TV. There is a transmitter, speaker, AC adapters as well as digital and analog audio cables to connect to your TV.
The TV Ears speaker does not provide surround sound. It provides stereo sound. I have my TV hooked up to a two-zone surround sound amplifier and speakers, and I hooked my TV Ears up to the second zone of the amplifier (stereo, not surround). That way I can hear the TV through both the surround sound speakers and the TV Ears speaker at the same time.
Hi Samantha, For a T3i, this is the one you need. The C3 version is for a different connector. http://www.amazon.com/Yongnuo-RF-603-II-Wireless-Transceiver/dp/B00HOX8X9G/
No, it doesn't have a backlit keyboard.
It will fit, it has at least an inch of room inside, if not closer to 2". It's a great case, simple but functional
In this case Ethernet is referred to the internet connection, this computer does not have a WiFi card so you have to plug it to get internet access using a Ethernet cable, Google Ethernet cable to see an image you may have one. Normally you will plug it to the modem or router or the wall depending where you have your Ethernet connection. If you want a WiFi connection you will have to buy a WiFi adapter, they are not expensive.
I'm not certion, I shopped so many I cant not recall. I believe this is a 4th generation.This laptop is serving me well and quite fast as I do quite a bit of multitasking and going back and forth between screens.
yes, it is removable
No
Some components (memory, disk, graphics) are easy to upgrade, the motherboard is replaceable, but is a customized version....
4 AA 2500mAh batteries in 5 hours so 4 x2000 in 4 hours or 500 ma per hour. Won't make any difference what your charging source is, it only draws 500 ma
Yes
It sure will, browse to C, and you will have subset channels 1-8. Starting at 5705 channel 1 to 5945 channel 8.
Beautifully, with the channel search feature, you find the Boscam transmitting channel in no time! Perfect combo!
Yes, the LCD has THREE total outputs!! One for each receiver that is built-in to the LCD and one for the Diversity that will switch back to whatever the strongest signal is. That cable is a composite cable (the red, white & yellow) cable that connects to most TV's. The red and White is the audio channels (optional) and the yellow is the Video signal. You can simultaneously have the LCD showing the Live GoPro video and use the Output ports for another Larger Television, video goggles, video recorder, or ALL THREE!!!
I don't know how "Media Monkey" works, but nothing can be "downloaded" into this device without using a personal computer (transfer to device memory via USB cable) or external microSD card. You'll nee to make sure that the FORMAT of any downloaded music files are compatible with the device.
Presets only
Added with a firmware update: http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15598/~/sandisk-clip-sport-firmware-1.17-download-and-installation-instructions
All I have is mp3s.
Don't know about that problem but I don't have any problem with the laptop. Great choice if you want to buy one
Yes, enough so I can use it in the dark if necessary. There's a key to turn it on and off.
I've been playing the PS4 version Dragon Age: Inquisition on it and am very impressed with the graphics. However, if you're asking about FPS lag time, I can't help you. I haven't tried hooking speakers up to it. I have to say, the sound is much better than my other flat screen; it doesn't have the "muffled" quality I'm used to with most flat screens.
It's not silky smooth so it still has a nice grip texture. The bottom is so nice cause the way it's designed it won't slip anywhere. I'm in the car a lot with mine on my lap and since I put this case on it's perfect! I hope this helps, it really is a fantastic case!
Both...but it's not bulky I hardly realize it has a bottom
Hi yes it will fit only the front top cover of the laptop but not the bottom back cover.
No, it's i7-4800MQ. Lenovo does not use desktop processors in its notebooks. It's an error in Amazon's specs.
for $65 you also want a gps? the higher priced models have it built in. not sure why you need a gps position[latitude/longitude] recorded, but it does have an input for an external gps. I bought mine just for video proof if I'm in an accident
A little cardboard box, has each type fuse in a separate little ziploc. No actual organizers if you take them out each bag
Yes, it does have a fingerprint reader
Mine came with 16 gb installed.
Yes.
I have a NVIDIA card so I had to do some research. According to the NVIDIA site, you do need a NVIDIA card. I included the link for the 3D Vision requirements so you can go through and double check. http://www.nvidia.com/object/3d-vision-system-requirements.html
No, it does not have an HDMI output, but it has VGA, USB & DVI outputs. You can get an adapter cord with HDMI at one end & either VGA or DVI at the other end for just a few dollars. Personally, I recommend the DVI adapter cord. I believe it handles more data flow to external hardware.
Hey PrimePete - This PC does not have a fax modem card but is something that could be added pretty easily and with very little additional cost.
no
Yes you can install a new graphics card. You will also need to upgrade the power supply to match the card. It isn't really a big deal though, power supplies are cheap. I totally recommend this computer, it is great. (There are 12 usb ports on this machine. Figure that into your opinion.)
Yes! I called HP and they told me this computer only had one VGI port. But it does not. It has VGA AND VGI. I have two of these computers and have dual monitors on both. They work great. I love this computer!
i have it hooked up to my samsung flat screen but pretty much any LCD monitor will be fine.
This model has an 8GB RAM and the integrated HD 4400 graphics. The one with 16GB RAM and the GT 750M is a higher model, and it goes above $1100 ($1149 on the dell website)
Hi All, my Graphics card Intel Graphics Family Hd Graphics 4400 total Availabil Graphics Memory 1792 MB , Thanks
This unit can charge by a vehicle power cable, a USB cable, and the ac adapter.
It comes loaded with us, Canada, but I know that they sell the other countries maps in the website
No, I'm not having any problems with it
I have found no delay except when my car and the 66LM is in my garage.
Yes to both questions.
Keyboard and mouse, no monitor
No
Yes
It's an optical mouse and they don't work well on a translucent surface like glass. Putting something opague over the glass makes it work ok.
No it doesn't
v1 was essentially discontinued from production so there's less and less available, price goes up usually. v2 is still available so price is market competitive.
Yes you can! This router will have 4 Ethernet ports and you can connect additional devices with a switch, as well as wireless devices to the Wi-Fi connection.
Should work fine with any monitor. Has the 9db output jack for doing exactly this.
Yes, most new Lenovo laptops come with a 1 year warranty on parts and labor for hardware issues. This does not cover software related issues such as malware or viral infections.
A DVD drive, which also accepts CDs.
they are 140 and i also think there is a second set of holes for 120
Hi Izabela, we created a Bronze bundle for you which can be found here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LMFJYFO Thank you, Sandy
One year manufacturers warranty on camera, lens & accessories.
No, it needs to be mounted under a cabinet
It does have a coax connector and it does work with digital cable.
I would assume so, since it will handle both 8 and 4. But I'm not an electrician, so I don't really know. http://www.daytonaudio.com/index.php/dayton-audio-dta-120-class-t-digital-mini-amplifier-60-wpc.html
We have the mount below the camera and you can invert the image on screen and being recorded.
I bought this cable for my MacBook and it works great. http://www.bixnet.com/cabms2.html
Yes...a short one connects to your USB port.
I believe it is close to 8hrs, although it depends on if you use audio as well. You should get at least over 6 hours with audio. The files record in 3:50 segments and should overwrite if you are full. You can delete single files and you can format the card to erase all but there is no delete all button as of the 2.90 firmware.
Yes, it works great. I have an Seagate Backup Plus also, work flawlessly.
Dear Rachel, I am sorry to hear that you met this problem. This is not a problem of the tablet. It is the Google play's problem. You can solve it by clear cache. Here is detail steps: 1.Go to Applications (or Apps) &gt;&gt; All (far right) 2.From all apps select Google Play Store &gt;&gt; Clear Cache and Uninstall updates 3.Again, from All&gt;&gt;Download Manager &gt;&gt; Clear Cache and Data 4.Finally, All &gt;&gt; Google Services Framework &gt;&gt; Clear Cache and Data 5.Switch tablet off and restart Or you can refer to solutions on google play: https://support.google.com/googleplay/troubleshooter/4592924?hl=en&rd=1
No, not to answer the phone. You have to hit answer on the phone but after that it is hands free until you hang up.
Use the Seagate Dashboard 3.0 app. Download it to your computer from the Seagate website.
I just looked it up on Wacom's site. The p/n for gen 3 is ACK20610. I couldn't find it at Amazon.
Yes it does fit . It needs to be 2nd generation Bamboo stylus though.
I think the Time Capsule is a bad idea, because it's a combination router and hard drive - so when one of those things inevitably fail, you have to replace both things. Also I don't think it's particularly well designed in terms of dissipating heat from the hard drive so I think it will fail sooner. I bought an Apple Airport Extreme and plug this hard drive into it for a Time Capsule drive and it works great.
I ordered one over a year ago, and used it with the thunderbolt adapter. It works great.
You can only use very low profile coolers in this case, a 212 and a dh14 would not work. Notcuta makes many low profile coolers, check those out.
The stand easily accommodates full size iPad, and could accommodate something a little thicker and larger. The spread of the feet are great, and will not topple.
I have a Samsung tab 7 and it does there is a right click, but I haven't figured out how to drag and drop
There are three colors of LED backlights on the keyboard. They are manually controlled on the board by hitting FN+f1,f2,f3, or something to that effect. The really cool thing about the LEDs is that you toggle them on and off independently of each other meaning that you can mix colors to get a purple or cyan if you're really into it!
No
No only to record conferences of the bible lessons
I only use the device in the highest quality mode. On this setting, the internal memory will give you ~47 hours of audio. With the 2G SD card, you get an additional 137 hours. That's a lot of interviews. The audio is very good at this setting. I've recorded music and voice and they both are impressive. The tiny speaker in the unit will make the audio sound not as full as if you were to plug in a set of headphones, but that is the typical limitation of the speaker.
Yes it is a great little machine
Yes there is mic jack and an ear jack on this model.
No, it does not. I'm not aware of any voice recorder that comes bundled with Dragon Naturally Speaking. Be aware that this is a standalone voice recorder, not something you add to a computer.
I would say yes because the Nexus 5, which the other reviewer is using, worked on it flawlessly and basically LG G2 and Nexus 5 are both LG phones and very similar and will act the same.
Yes, lots of recording problem. It would keep going through file recovery mode. Had to switch to class 4
Sure. But if your router is not PoE, you'll need to get a power supply to the camera for it to work.
Pretty good and you can adjust it. This camera has a wide-angle lens... i found that the street lights\house lights down the street and can throw it off a bit. I wish I had paid the extra few dollars and bought the 3MP... my other cams are 3MP and the quality difference is impressive. You can see the raindrops hitting the driveway with the 3MP.
I was able to connect mine using the "Ip Cam Viewer Basic" app with the following settings: Name: any name Make: Dahua Model: Dahua Camera RTSP Host/IP: (camera's local IP - can be found on camera interface, Network | TCP/IP | IP Address) RTSP Port: 554 Ch #: 1 Enter camera's User & Pswd Press Test, should get image Make sure your android phone is connected to WiFi and has an IP address on the same subnet as the camera.
No it is not. Are you looking for a small, discreet 3mp camera? That is compatible. I'd be happy to help. Adam_ssoi@live.com
Yes, it will
Only the length of the plug, about 3/4 to 7/8 inch.
Sadly it does not
No it doesn't
Yes...never used it no personal experience
It should fit fine. It is only 9.5mm in height. This is not the older 12.5mm standard. You may be able to swap out the face plates if you have a thicker dvd in place.
Yes.
No charger. The camera uses 4 AA batteries.
I found the Bluetooth to easily work with multiple Bluetooth devices. A truly quality camera that with a little time spent reading the features and functions of the camera, will provide any photographer the capability of capturing and producing professional photos. Great camera for a great price
No
Yes, it is a great computer but you have to install MS Office as well
this comes with 1GB for the Radeon HD 8750M .. note .. this chip is for gaming only, which is something they dont mention explicitly .. so if you are a 'gamer' it will probably be useful .. if you are NOT a 'gamer' you dont need it [i am not a gamer .. i thought it would accelerate general graphics performance, but it doesnt .. the Intel chip it also comes with handles all the general purpose graphics and video .. i wasted my money]
Yes. you can manually adjust DNS settings - primary and secondary One of the best products I carry in my travel bag. WW power adapter #1, this is #2 that I don't leave home without.
It will be for a day. I used it to stream to Google TV. Beware, gone through two already. Firmware continues to need to be reset. Each last about a week on my travels...
No
Yes it does come with a remote.
I use htmi to hook it up to use to view movies from my computer. However if you've got the tv hooked up to Dish or DirectTV you have to use the htmi unless there's a way to double up.
Yes, and a little zip-lock bag of mounting screws.
It has a single SD card reader slot on the upper left of two usb connectors and two 3.5mm audio connectors. To read a micro SD, it takes an adapter/carrier that converts the microSD into an standard SD. It seems pretty fast in operation.
64 bit
Intel HD Graphics 4600. Works great with my HP monitor.
Yes ... But I dont rocomndate there's no HD Channels ... My friend bought NOOR TV and he is happy about it.
You certainly can! Just don't put it on your key chain, lol. The transmitter is exactly the same size as the receivers, so it is easily carried.
Sorry,my yoga is damaged when i baught it, I losed $200.
Yes, you can have both bands active at any given time.
yes
Yes. I am using with d3100.
Yes! I charge my Zune as I use it. So far this has been a great little unit! Also can't beat the price!!
Basically. It functions as your 'output' instead of going to the regular phone speaker or a bluetooth in your ear. Your phone's microphone is still used to catch your voice but your car's audio system is now the equivalent of the earpiece. It is a great little transmitted for the money. Had paid the same for another brand but it was a POS. Set the FM to the right frequency once and you are done.
It works but with static. Tried it on three different vehicles, same result. Bluetooth technology obviously the better choice.
Sorry, Still have problems working mine
The instructions with my Voice/Audio Recorder says:"The USB recorder does not record when charging." Don't know about the ETEKCIY DVR. When I got mine, it had been turned on and I got nothing but Chinese conversation. Was not able to delete or stop the recording. So I "junked" it. Hope this helps.
If your laptop has a separate jack for a mic then yes because this headset has separate cables for the audio and for the mic so yes it would.
I ordered the reference number (59406648) and mine came with 2 GPUs. It also came with the MSATA M.2 slot to put a 128GB dedicated second SSD. No DVD drive.
Yes it does
No, it doesn't have a backlit keyboard.
no pen and I don't think that this laptop is compatible.
It comes with power cord that charges the battery.
The screen is high def. AMD uses a separate graphics chip n has enough to play on low settings.
I think so. Its performance is good. But it is a lit heavy for carrying.
Yes it has a cd/dvd player
EDIT: i purchased this laptop, and it does indeed have the dual SLI 755m configuration. I called Amazon, and they didn't know. I then called lenovo, they have no record of this model number, so couldn't give me specs. EDIT: looks like they updated the description and it does have the 755m (SLI) configuration.
Sorry it took me a few days I had to find time to take mine apart and make sure. It does not have the connector on the motherboard. The pins to solder one on are there if you're handy with a soldering iron, but this should only be attempted if you have done this kind of thing before. A much easier, much safer way to add an SSD is to purchase an "Ultrabay hard drive" dock from e-bay ($20-25) and then you can swap out a hard drive or the extra graphics card when you need each one.
The difference between the two models is the OS. Lenovo manufacturer part number 59406636 includes Windows 8.1 and 59388313 includes Windows 8.
No
that's the speed of the processor it's an intel 7 runs good unless your doing hard gaming I run iTunes an big program like cad all at once
I can't get you the exact measurements but it is really shallow I would say no more than 4 inches.
yes it does, there are three pairs of rca outputs behind the system
I just unscrewed one of the router antennas and screwed the booster wire to the router, easy hook up, but I didn't notice much difference in my wifi signal.
Yes it plays movies
it has a standard SD card reader, but you can always use a converter for a micro card if needed
Yes there is
I did not get the laptop primarily for gaming because i have a more powerful gaming machine but i got it for coding and possibly moding games which requires it to actually have the games on the machine octodad plays beautifully and elder scrolls v skyrim set itself to ultra high quallity after detecting the hardware so it should hold up ive only had mine for a week so i cant speak to its durability
No it doesn't.
The controls work in a similar way as they do with your personal music on your device. Volume Up/Down work like normal. The next track works if the service offers that. I've used it a bunch with I Heart Music and it goes to the next track until the service says you can't forward any more. This is a service level limit, not anything controlle by our device. Pause/Play also work like normal. Let me know if you need any further assistance, Valerie - Wusic Customer Service
Two of my friends have the UV-5R models and I tried their batteries with my unit. They are indeed different and will not fit.
Yes
Anything less than a full tower will not fit this card. It's 305mm. You can Google it's footprint.
There have been several court cases and each case the FAA has lost. Profit means getting paid for a specific action or service. For example, I take a picture of you and you pay me for the service of taking the picture. But if I take a picture of you and charge you for processing the picture and NOT the act of taking the picture, then I have not made a profit for taking the picture. I know that is as clear as mud. But currently, that is as the law is right now.
Fc40 comes with a camera
The FAA has regulations limiting the heights of flights. Hypothetically, the craft can climb until it's battery is exhausted or it loses signal from the transmitter at which time it will go into failsafe mode and return to origin. Anytime you fly higher or farther than visual range, you risk losing a very expensive aircraft.
I received my ultrabook on 4/4/14 and it had Windows 8.1 installed on it.
No
The F19826 is fantastic I'm really pleased with it AS A CAMERA. However, it has developed a fault and Foscam are taking forever to deal with it and I've had very little communication from them. As a baby monitor....the sound quality is awful! So probably not.
fetch cam or ip cam viewer work fine
Tim, I don't know the minimum upload speed, but I have 25 Mbps; I access the camera on my iPhone regularly, and the picture is great!
Yes. I had an SSD drive connected to the back of a server's USB 3 port for weeks without issue with no external power adapter.
Yes
It means you can add memory by yourself and it also support TF card,but the TF card is not included ,you may have to buy it by yourself if you need it.
I haven't used the radio, but the batteries was used aprox 4 month (8 hours/week)
Very unlikely in my opinion.
Mine doesn't feel like that. Sounds defective.
The hub will allow you to do anything you normally would with an external monitor - The monitor shows up in control panel as a secondary monitor. The real concern is if your graphics card supports Display Port 1.2a If it doesn't, the hub won't work at all.
This will work with 1366 but i dont think it will work with 771: Socket Support AMD: AM2, AM3, FM1, FM2, Intel LGA: 1150, 1155, 1156, 1366, 2011, 2011-3
Yes it does. Everything is user friendly.
Yes you can answer your email. There is an on screen keyboard.not a physical one with buttons though.

Hi Thank you for your interest. This monitor doesn't have Mini displayport but Displayport. So you need Mini displayport to Displayport cable. And some cheap cable may not compatible with the monitor. Included cable is only DVI-D(dual link) cable. Thank you.
OPTICAL ZOOM: 18 DIGITAL:4
Pretty terrible. My iphone does better in low light situations. :(
I recently purchased this camera, what I received was a VIXIA HF R52.
No, unfortunately there is no panoramic shooting mode.
I'm going to say no. I have an iPad 1st gen and I tried it out. It took some maneuvering (and it kinda fit), but it was like a big guy in a little coat. This silicone case is definitely for the thinner iPad 2. I hope this helps, have a great day!
Yes, you will have access to orginal button that is seaded with your iPad.
Yes it is the same camera as the Comcast charge on their website for $129. I bought 4 of this and installed myself. On the Comcast website there is a video tutorial on how to self install this camera. You can install up to six camera according to the video tutorial.
Yes, indoor ethernet cables come with each camera.
I'm looking at the back of the screen and it does not have screws to be able to connect with a wall support, If you have a wall mounted connector that do not need screws that may do it.
It's wifi.
Yes, the maps can be updated, and the cost varies.
no
One HDMI port
"Region free" means you may play DVDs from various regions. That is, rather than playing DVDs from just the USA (as most DVD players sold in the USA do), this unit will play DVDs from other countries as well as those from the USA. I use it to play DVDs of British films/TV shows I can't access in the USA. (Please note that it plays DVDs---but not blu-ray---from other countries.)
I have not had an issue with sound with the unit. I guess it depends on what you are trying to achieve for sound. I think the unit is a bit slow for response is my biggest concern. Otherwise I just use it to play L&H classic films. Because it was much cheaper to buy the region 2 library disc set than it was for ntsc by about 200.00.
Dear Mark, Thanks so much for your inquiry. The Bluetooth feature is there for you to be able to stream music from a portable device such as a smartphone or laptop. To play sound from your TV or DVD player you can connect via Digital Optical audio cable or standard RCA audio cables, depending on what features are available on your television. Please let me know if I can answer any additional questions for you! Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo
Hmmm I know they have a good bit of international channels and some are french but I don't know how many or the selection but its def worth the money to find out. Its only ten bucks
No
Just got back from my cruise and wasn't happy with my pictures taken with the Intova sport, all were very grainy. also the video was not very good unless it was under water and I was using the red filter. Now I wish I had used a little extra money for the GoPro, next time I guess...
It comes with the holder...
UPDATE Look here http://forum.dashcamtalk.com/threads/rearview-mirror-mount-for-g1w.4236/
I think it's the red power button if I remember correctly.
Weather antennas are very low power and may be more distant than your AM and FM radio towers. Visit: http://www.nws.noaa.gov/nwr/indexnw.htm for frequencies and power out of the antenna in your area.
These work with my iPad air and my iPhone. I have not tried it om my desktop. But if your computer does not have Bluetooth it will not work on windows unless you by a usb device for 13.99.
I do not know. This machine arrived with a dead battery. When I charged it. it never powered up. I've never been able to use it. I'm sorry to say this , but, you should probably look at something else. I honestly would not buy this tablet again nor can I in good conscience advise you or anyone else to.
Hi, The EVA interior is part of the package and the case cannot be bought without it. You can opt to remove the insert once you bought the case if you prefer it. Hope that helps. Kind Regards, Angie/ECO-FUSED
If both are fully charged and won't pair then your problem is more than likely, the keyboard. Mine paired perfectly so it is either a software issue, which I do not think, or keyboard, which is more than likely.
Yes. The keyboard secures in place with magnets. But I haven't experience any interference with my S Pen (which I use a lot for drawing). The only flaw I saw was that the strap that that secure both flaps together came just right off. It was glued and not stitched as everything else. But for me it wasn't a big deal and I can leave without it. Hope it helps Megahn.
Looks like the speakers in the HT-S6300 package are compatible with this receiver.
Yes. I have the Phantom 2 with H3-3D gimbal and gopro 3+ attached and it fits perfectly.
I used this on my 3+ silver with the housing that came with the camera. Not sure if that qualifies as a dive housing or not. It does not fit the 3+ unless you modify it. The ID of the aluminum frame is too large for the lens cover of the 3+. That being said some aluminum stock and epoxy and it worked like a champ. I quite like this filter.
No it will not. camera and volume controls are hindered.
Yes. The internal plastic casing is covered with rubber to protect it from drops. There is also the built in screen protection to help prevent scratches. While not water proof, the case is water resistant. The leather back handle makes it easier for kids to hold onto the device while moving around. Hope this helps!
I don't think so.
Yes, you can use a telephoto lenses on this camera as long as it is an E-mount type of lens like the SEL70200G. However, if you intended to use an A-mount type like the SAL70400G2 or SAL300F28G2, you are required to use an adapter (A-mount to E-mount). Model of the adapter is LAEA4. Hope this helps. -Ely
Hi Salem, apparently this Sony Camcorder doesn't support or have time lapse feature. -Ely
It's free voltage i.e. you can charge anywhere around the world
No there is no port for it.
Hi AP, Yes. you can view recorded images using the built-in projector. -Anthony
Hi John, Yes, you may turn off Optical Steady Shot/ Image Stabilization on your camcorder. Vincent
This Sony Cybershot DSCW830/B doesn't have a time stamp but it do have a date stamp feature. -Ely
NP-BN lithium-ion battery and USB charger, I also purchased this replacement with the camera: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049VGHOO/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
It is only a IP camera.This camera require a router to work with it. Dlink camera should not have built-in router. You does not have to get a static IP.
I mounted mine inside the windshield using the suction cup that came with the camera. In very hot days, it falls, but generally it stays there.
No. The display requires 12V. The touch screen is however, powered from the USB power.
no, it is on/off button for bluetooth receiver, also have pause/play funtion when playing.
The device support output for listen only, do not support extend mic. You can use the mic build-in this receiver. You can see the pictures in the list shows where the mic it is on this device.
1 year
I know the answer is yes to iphone 4 not sure about iOS
there is a port that you can connect to computer or laptop to transfer your music. i don't know about bluetooth and android phones. i tell you what i don't like about this mp3 is the headphone speakers are not clear enough there are three mode, but still not good enough. the out speakers are really good. hope this help u. bye
No Nav.
Yes it does. I had a camera installed on mine works great and simple to use.
I installed my car i don't needs any radio kit. I installed my 3000gt 1999 it's fits perfectly
no it does not have the back-lit keyboard
I can't answer that because I've always got it plugged in. I haven't really had the opportunity to test it yet.
Hi, It works like Apple USB SuperDrive. Eject the disc by right clicking the new device drive in the OS. Regards Fanny
3
No you can by a led light that's powerd by your usb and clips on your laptop.
I haven't used it yet, but I do see that one of the apps on it is "Sound Recorder" so I would assume so. I just have no use for it so I have not opened it. By they way, this is an AWESOME machine. I just love mine.
Mine came with just a small amount to bounce with the music. ...was urs completely dry? Should have small amount of water in it...
Yes. All new NUC have power cables.
I assume so. I installed mSATA and there is still room for the 2.5".
It works great with my Nikon D5000 and Yongnuo 560 so it should work with the D800 as well. Just make sure the RF603 is properly seated in your camera hotshoe.
yes
Yes. These are made for nikon but canon version also available. Tested it working well still have to test for long distances . good build nice product.
excelente tablet, solo compras una tarjeta sim y se la colocas y ya
yes you can load whatsapp on there, i have it on mine
Hi Barbara, even if the Sony Blu-ray Player has 3D functionality, you need a 3D TV to display videos in 3D. -Vincent
Yes, this TV has digital optical audio output.
Yes, this Sony Blu-ray player will allow you to stream videos on Amazon Prime. Other online services are Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, Vudu, Crackle and many more. -Ely
Yes they will all fit, just not in the little pouch thing that they include. All of the cords do fit though.
Yes it should.
NO
Just the date will appear on the actual picture. The LCD display will show the date AND time due to it being written in the EXIF data of the photo.
Currently Olympus does not have fields for the OMD E-M10 in their exif data to record pitch, roll and heading. However an Olympus Product Engineer is providing us with further info which we can elaborate on if you contact tech support at 800-991-3350 or 631-389-2117.
Yes
Hi, this Sony Bravia KDL70W850B uses an AC adapter which has a power requirement of 110-240 V AC, 50/60 Hz. It means that you may use it on either 110 V or 220 V. Hope this helps. -Ely
Hello, The LCD screen on the back of the camera is not adjustable in the way the diopter for the view finder works. the only adjustment for the LCD is the brightness level. Thank you Mason Roset OC Camera 949-347-1276
It comes with it installed. I would recommend buying the s89 instead. I have had both and for a few extra dollars it's worth it. The s89 has lots of custom roms available and the video card is way better. If you have any questions go to freaktab and look through the forums for Tronsmart aml devices. There's a lot of information there.
No
Make sure it's the same card in dxdiag. Just type dxdiag in the search bar in the start button and hit enter. The model of your card should be under the display tab. It's possible that the only thing that's different is the cooler. Also keep in mind that there are different lengths of the SLI bridges, make sure you have the right one.
Yes, it does.
Yes. That board reportedly has two PCIe 2.0 slots. This card will work on PCIe 2 or 3.
I have not had any bottlenecking which is one of the main reasons I bought this card. I have a AM3+ board with pci express 2 because AMD has not really released any good express 3.0 boards, I heard in some reviews that there was no bottlenecking and they were right.
Yes it has an HDMI port and we have used the camera to project directly to a TV.
See my detailed review, but if you're interested in only pictures to use on internet and social media sites, it is passable. However, overall the results were inconsistent.
no, returning this one, a big disappointment, one of the worst point and shoot i've owned, the flash is the worst among other problems no amount of firmware will ever fix
Yes, this camcorder has an external mic input, Stereo Mini jack, and a headphone jack.
Manual doesn't give max size, but has setup info for up to 300"
I don't specifically know what outputs are available on iPad and iPhone nor do I know what cabling options are available, but the projects has 4 different input formats, Pb/Cb, Pc/Cr,Y RCA Jacks,S-Video, XVGA 15 pin computer monitor jacks (what I use) and HDMI. If you can find a cable to get your from your iPod to one of those 4, it will work.
No
It does not have VR.
I am using a 64GB SD card ( actually it's a micro-SD with an SD adaptor) and I can say its just the best. Take it on a long trip, go crazy on the pitcures without a care, bring it home and download them to your PC. Even at max resolution of 20MBPS, I am yet to use up anything close to 50% even taking videos.
YES it does, the funny thing is when charging the battery the charger light does not turn green to show it's fully charged...
You can download an app on your phone that syncs to your camera over the built in wifi, and then use your phone as the remote. It's very simple and works great.
It comes with one. I advise buying a spare battery in any case
i believe that was available yes, if not on Amazon then try Best Buy.
As Paul said, the flash works best in the five feet to eight feet range, but if you set the ISO at ISO 400, you can get a range of about 15 feet in a well lighted room with Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries. Beyond 15 feet, it would be better to turn the flash OFF and set the ISO at ISO 800. You will need to brace the camera against a table or wall to get the sharpest photos, as working indoors without flash may yield very slow shutter speeds.
call support... they are able to help....
Check the return policy and see if you can send them back for repair or exchange, this is what I would do and it would be the best way.
The lens on this camera is fixed, it cannot be changed.
NO time lapse and it can record up to 29 minutes per clip, but 29 is NOT the total limit for taking videos. Once you're done with the first 29 minutes, you can just start another one. I did 50 minutes of video yesterday without issues.
It can but will reduce the wifi preformance
No, there is no such reseller model that Lenovo makes. The closest that I could find is configuration 20A7003DUS (i5-4300U, 4GB, 180GB SSD). Normally (in reseller models) as soon as you get to i5, the RAM drops to 4GB. There are some custom built reseller models, but nobody carries them. Last option - custom-configure it at Lenovo's website, but you will end paying way more than this model that has i7/8GB/256GB and you will wait close to a month. I would not recommend it.
yes it can play minecraft
You have to follow a few simple instructions. You can see the setup process here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iks0w9Ln9Zs
Yes. Just follow their menu and you can change the password as often as you like.
i think they do the same thing,protect what you put into them
I think you want: Lenovo 03X3703 TS440 3.5" HDD Cage I've been researching this and i think you would then need a " discrete RAID adapter for SATA/SAS" in order to manage the additional drive caddy.
No. Very basic design; it doesn't even shuffle.
No to both.
You can update directly to the newest one.
Yes, fits both model A and model B. My blog shows it with both: http://www.averagemanvsraspberrypi.blogspot.co.uk/2014/04/the-flexpi-wood-case-for-raspberry-pi.html
It's a marine unit, but looks and feels like a car stereo, so my guess is it will fit most car makes and models. I'm not familiar with the 1996 Accura, though, so frankly I just wouldn't know.
I think it's AM, FM but I haven't tried to play AM.
Hello, this Sony Car stereo unit doesn't have the capability of playing any disc. This unit doesn't have an optical drive. -Ely
The other drive (referenced on your link) is more for the hardcore professional. It's best feature is the speed (480MB/s). The average prosumer (and many pros) will do just fine with this one. I do professional video and this drive is perfect for me.
This item includes the following: G-DRIVE with Thunderbolt External Hard Drive Universal AC Power Supply (1) Thunderbolt cable (1) USB Cable (USB 3.0/2.0) Quick Start Guide
I think the dual thunderbolt version is primarily intended for that. I suppose if you used the USB port to connect to the computer and the thunderbolt to daisy chain to another gdrive, it would work. On the product creator's site, there is this forum entry on daisy chaining: http://support.g-technology.com/kbase/users/kb.php?id=76 I admit I have not tried this. Otherwise, if you want to go completely thunderbolt on it, you should choose the version of the g-drive with dual thunderbolt ports on it. http://www.amazon.com/G-Technology-G-RAID-Dual-External-Drive/dp/B002QID2NG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1402279606&sr=8-2&keywords=g+drive+dual+thunderbolt
Dear Marco, Haven't been able to get an answer back from Sony on this one. My guess would be probably no, but unsure at this time. Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo
Yes you can see it in the day light. I'm not sure if you will be able to use the old harness. I had to modify my old one slightly. By I got my old harness to work with slight modifications.
Hi, MIC IN for this Sony Car Stereo are locate at the back of the unit (where you connect audio system). Then you may run the wire in front along with the microphone. -Ely
No it doesn't
No, it is not.
This laptop is equivalent to our computers in the office. We bought two as extras for summer interns. Works perfectly, very easy to set up, add software and use.
Model # is HP ProBook 450 G1. Can't find info on Battery life.
no 1 transmitter per receiver but u can buy 2 and piggyback them thats what the extra jacks are for
Bluetooth is normally 30 yards but this will go up to 50 with as good set of Bluetooth headphones
There is basic one year manufacturer's warranty. However, it is valid in Japan. If you have trouble for it. Round-trip shipping will occur. It will be paid by the customer. In the case of initial failure. After the arrival to the product and is valid within a week. I will ship new products. Or I will give a full refund. After delivery, one year warranty from one week will be the manufacturer's warranty.Japan Shop SAMURAI MIND
Yes, according to Google Support. Details at https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/183093?hl=en It's a regular flash/thumb/USB drive, so there should be no problem with any computer or tablet that has a USB or a micro-USB port.
I've found a few different answers ranging from yes/ no/ and only if you root the device. https://productforums.google.com/forum/m/#!msg/nexus/LJeoF7AK1zU/6ZyI9gQLjIsJ Check out this forum page concerning your question. The Nexus 5 does have the port for OTG Flash drrive compatibility but you may have to do some tinkering with the software of your device. Sorry this is the best info I could find.
Yes. You can.
Both ways. Depends on how good a phone you have whether or not it will be able to play it though. I'm sure mp3s and pics will work just fine though.
Azurewave is a manufacturer of WiFi cards using Broadcom reference chipset. In this case, Azurewave used the BCM4352 chipset. In short, it's the Broadcom BCM4352. Broadcom manufacture's its own chipsets but it allows other manufacturers such as HP, Dell (Dell Wireless 1540 for example), Azurewave etc. to manufacture their own using Broadcom's reference design.
Mine is working fine on HP Folio 9470 Ultrabook with Intel chipset. You will need to go to broadcom website and download the drivers. http://www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth/update.php See if that works for you.
It handled my stuff easily.You can load one picture at a time or the whole album.And Camera roll.It was easy to do.
Yes, i move files back and forth exactly like an ordinary external hard drive.
Yes, the Dell Inspiron 17R (5737) Laptop comes with built in webcam, microphone,wifi and bluetooth.
No
Yes, it does.
Just the basic stuff, nothing much at all. I had to do some updates and driver downloads to get everything running, i.e. bluetooth, but most of the updates happened without my assistance.
dual-core
is a touch screen
yes, it does.
i recived the computer and the electrical cord to recharge the battery. and a scrap of paper basically telling me how to hook it up. i did not receive a rescue disc.
no dvd drive...an external one may b used.
Yes
If you don't want to have your computer physically connected by wire to an internet connection, and you want to go on the Internet, you need wifi. That way you can use your computer and get on internet everywhere there is wifi. Doesn't make sense any more to get a laptop without wifi. Hope this clarifies.
It streams okay but is not the machine for you if you are into extreme gaming.
Input: 100 - 240 V, 50 - 60 Hz Output: 19.5 V @ 3.34 A
yes
yes!
Hi Up to 8 gb
Up to 6.5 hours of battery life.
4th gen
Windows 8.1; even if it was Windows 8, you get free upgrades to the latest Windows 8.x
Yes, it does come with a charger.
Dimensions? I have not measured the case and if I did, the tape measure available to me are in metric. When assembling this computer I removed the top cover so I could mount the fan externally, so I guess this would change the dimensions as well.
They only program for certain types of cards. I bought a new Nvida card and it would not work. But we had an older Nvida card and it worked. Also, there are two video card options. One of them is CUDA and I cannot remember the other. Make sure you try them both. Check their forums for more information. My older Nvida card made rendering much faster.
no
Two cords. Either a cigarette lighter or AC outlet. But both are corded.
Yes!
thanks for your asking,this decal include the front and Wrist rest(like picture part)&#65292;not keyboard and bottom,if you want bottom,we can also do it.
I'm guessing it is vinyl. It is absolutely beautiful!
I'm not sure, but guessing that you'd have to buy a second decal set and use the larger piece for the bottom. However, I personally wouldn't recommend covering the bottom of your laptop with a decal though. I think there needs to be adequate ventilation for the air vents to prevent your computer from overheating. Plus, you wouldn't typically see it since it's on the bottom. Just my opinion, hope this helps.
No
Yes its compatible with ipad mini . This one of the part numbers for mini. 6 pieces tools
750 Watt should be plenty!!! You may have a bad power supply and it may need to be replaced that happened to be before. I have an tx 850 corsair power supply and I run 2 of the r9 290x crossfire, 2 ssd, 3 hard drives, i5 2500k oc 4.7 ghz, sound card and a ton of other stuff. Hope this helps
Yes, but not easily with the tablet i had.
Yes
64 bit
Yes, it comes with both a USB mouse and USB keyboard.
it will support 2 monitors using vga and hdmi ports Thank you
You could fit basically all of the cards in here. You would need a bigger PSU however since most of these come with 350w or 450w PSU.
The one I ordered was listed under new categories by third party. Turned out to have an expired warranty. Real brand new is typically warrantied by Dell for one year. Make sure you register your purchase with Dell.com then you can check warranty status with them using service tag.
Hi, Vicky - Yes it will, via Windows Media Player at least. You can find instructions in books such as Win7 For Seniors for Dummies, p. 249. Good luck, Dfrazier@ieee.org
No I am sorry it doe's not come with A wireless keyboard or mouse
Yes, 18 months that starts when you setup your pc the first time! Great PC btw. I bought it for gaming planning to add a graphic card but its ran every game ive played with no problem. Click the little cart you wont regret it!
It has built in wireless, must be on the motherboard as I didn't see a separate card for it.
The monitor is not a touchscreen but the Windows 8.1 operating system on this computer system supports touchscreens with a modern style interface but also has a XP/Vista/7 like desktop interface. I really don't like the modern color block interface so I stick to the familiar desktop interface. I use the free software "Classic Shell" to get the Windows 7/8/8.1 Start Menu and Windows Explorer to look and/or behave more like XP.
Yes
I just measured my unit and the actual dimensions are (at the widest points): 17-1/4" Front to Back, 7-1/4" Wide, and 16" Tall
no, 13 inches
Yes
Either That or Mid March
Yes. Amazon sent me 2 promo codes: one for Civilization: Beyond Earth and another for the Radeon Gold Reward (Choose 3 games) that sent me to a page entitled "Never Settle: Space Edition." It was at URL amd4u (dot) com (slash) radeonrewards. (I don't know if Amazon strips out URLs in their reviews or answers, hence the weird way of writing it.) Who knows what that rewards page will be entitled in a month or two? Right now, it's currently still reading "Never Settle: Space Edition."
The top can fit 120mm or 140mm. The back can fit 120mm or 140mm. The bottom can fit 120mm. The case info says that the top can fit three 120mm or two 140mm, but there is enough room and mounting holes to fit three 140mm on top. The case comes with three fans: two 140mm in front, and one 140mm in back. I have a total of six 140mm (three on top, one on back, two on front) and one 120mm (on the bottom).
I recommend noctua quiet series fans (the newest ones) in a pull configuration. The have a 140mm fan in the back in a push configuration. Make sure you have an aftermarket CPU cooler
Yes it has 3 places to put your optical disk drive at the top front of the case like most cases. If youre referring to hard disk drives/solid state drives, there are many places inside the case for them. No optical drives or hard disk drives are included with the case.
This the CC-9011074-WW.. Actually no. I guess this model is older so im not sure but the newer model is like $10 less
Yes it has APT-X source coding, but you won't get that better sound if the other device you're streaming from does not support APT-X. You'll just get regular SBC, which is compressed audio much like mp3. This device is good for personal use, it sounds awesome, can't tell the difference between CD quality and range is about 10 ft.
There is room to put 4 hard drives in the machine and yes the power supply can definitely handle it.
I currently use an iphone 5s with a heavy griffin case. The distance your phone will keep connection with the camera is dependent to signal strength and line of site between the transmitters/receivers. The rubber case on my phone cuts my range down to about nil. Spend the extra money, buy the Phantom 2 (I have both the FC40 and the P2.) It has a wifi booster and even with my heavy case I don't lose my camera connection.
Yes
The camera SKU is ZMD-P4-YARUZ4ZN, you can check the specification on below page: http://www.zmodo.com/700tvl-high-resolution-day-night-weatherproof-outdoor-camera-kit.html Thanks!
Mine does.
Yes, you should be able to upgrade to 8.1.1 without any cost.
Yes
hello if you can use it as a phone should be sure to use telephone band up here in Venezuela and movilnet movistar 3g only. digitel only 2g and the internal memory is very short and very tiring because you have very little space for applications and have to be going to the sd card and there are applications that do not you go I have a tablet and is very good but has that great detail that makes it much less should improve.
Yes, it does have an AVG port. And also HDMI. If you have any other questions please let us know.
No it does not
It has Windows 8.1 I know that for sure and it has a ton of other apps already installed. I have only had it a month and still playing with everything.
As long as you have a tripod mount on the bottom of the camera and a place to put a carrying strap I see no reason why it would not work.
I Love it! It's useful!
It's a switch. Only one input is connected to the output at a time.
You can install Windows 7, but you will need a Windows 7 Activation key and drivers for the laptop. That last part gets a little more complicated.
No, the keyboard isn't back lit.
Yes it is 100% wireless
I was told that all update and downloads could be done by connecting the GPS to your computer. The Unit I purchased I've sent back. It is not user friendly and there were many issues with it, such as brightness, Bluetooth pairing, the on/off switch. My opinion is that by trying to save money you get what you pay for. Buy a better know brand you'll be happier.
Yes it does.
I purchased one of these and the interface for configuring it was the normal linksys interface. Mine came in a retail box but had no documentation for setting it up or configuring it so I had to find help online for it. Was pretty easy to find online info. and was easy to setup.
i think they are all surge protected yes and yes there is a resettable circuit breaker
Yes
It appears that it does not offer the Amazon app, There are always updates so in may be available in the future.
As long as you have power this should work anywhere. As far as installation goes, it all depends on where you are putting your cameras and how easy it is to get cables from the DVR to the camera. The actual setting up the system is some what easy and very well covered in the user guides shipped with the package.
As far as I can tell, it works on all the Baofeng models. At least, it works well on all three of mine... much better than stock, that's for sure!
Yes it works in those frequency ranges. It's flexible like a whip antenna.
I'm not sure if I have ever put mine in standby mode and I don't have the camera in front of me. I find the camera to be a good one so far. I would power it down, take out the battery, then replace it back, power up and hopefully it will release the stand by mode for you.... You have to remember it is like a small computer, and someties you need to take the power completelt off when it locks up.
Yes. Wiring is the same And power connections as well!
20-30ft
I have this TV and have it hooked up to Dish Network. Works great.
DT is last insert on back of TV. adaptor for cable antenna ends to make it coax cable to fit into DT insert.
You should be able to use it for any backup program, it is just a USB ddevice. The power supply does support 240V 50-60 Hz. I installed a 3TB Drive in mine and it works great.
I have the same issue. However, I think it may be an issue with the Samsung TV and not the Bluetooth transmitter.
I realized that having some bluetooth headphones are not only designed for cell phones and not for these devices so that other article hall buy the same brand. NEW KLTECH bluetooth stereo audio receiver, adapter for headphones.
Lenovo customer service is atrocious. Don't get this model.
It will but you will need the Turtle Beach PS4 Chat Cable sold separately.
Yeah, they work with Playstation 3
Thanks for the question. Battery comes with accessories as from the beginning this product. In addition, please feel free to contact us If you have any questions.
Mine came with USB cord, but not a charger.
The camera uses a standard Lithium Ion rechargeable battery. The battery is a small flat model that is commonly used by digital point-and-shoot cameras of this type. I take a lot of pictures on a given day and have never run out of power. I did however purchase a spare battery and car charger from Amazon for under $20.
Mine also says "made in china". However, it is a GREAT camera with more features that I will probably never use.
Not sure if you're asking about the size or brand; however, it depends on how much you'll be downloading &/or saving. My son bought a SansDisk Ultra 64GB because he downloads a lot of videos.
The lens on the camera accepts 55mm filters. I have a vivitar 55mm uv-haze filter and a polarizing lens. I'm going to purchase a 1A filter to help protect the cameras lens from damage.
There is no hot shoe for an external flash so im going to say probably not unless there is a way to do it via usb which I doubt because the usb seems to be data only. But the built-in flash is very good
There is hardly any noise. My daughter is pretty sensitive to noises, and she doesn't notice it. Hope this helps!
Get the fastest MicroSD card you can find, that is usually the limitation, I use a Sandisk UltraPlus 32G HC I card without any trouble. It is rated Class 10 and UHS class 1. They are reasonably priced as well.
Yes
The Auto mode attempts to do this automatically (see manual page 44) but you can also control it directly by using Shutter Priority mode with a speed above 1/250. See manual page 49.
Yes, this comes with an Intel Wireless-N 7260BN mini pcie wifi card with Bluetooth 4.0 with integrated antennas already installed.
POE is not built into this Foscam model but Foscam offers a couple of different adapters such as this one...http://foscam.us/accessories/active-poe-splitter.html
Yes it will play Blu rays. The software with it is not a full suite but you can use Windows media player in Win 8.1 for music. I use a third party program for Blu rays as the one included did not allow for movie playback.
I have found them to be quite sturdy. They're mostly plastic, but it's thick and tough. The headband has metal in it, and when you move it up or down a notch you get a satisfying 'thunk' each time. Even after hauling them across the country several times in my backpack (without carrying sack), I've had no issues.
If the headphone cable is properly connected to the headphones, you shouldn't need to rotate the 3.5mm jack. If this only happens with one device, it's probably not the headphones, but if the issue occurs when connected to multiple devices, then switch cables. If the problem persists with different cables, then get the headphones checked. Hope this helps.
Yes
Thank you for your inquiry. The M40x headphones feature an improved headband and earcup (for comfort) over the M50 and are also tuned flat, ideal for studio applications. For a more in-depth comparison, feel free to check out the video below. Please let us know if you have any other questions. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uB-JC2b_pbU
The coiled cable is 1.2 meters long without being stretched. The straight cable is 3 meters long.
m40x
Yes
no it doesn't have surround Regards, Juan
Thank you for your interest in our products. This is not a Lightscribe compatible system.
Thank you for your interest in our products. This will burn and read any CD, DVD, and Bluray disc.
Thank you for your interest in our products. The buffer size will be 4MB.
I've never had mine actually die on me so I'm not sure what it takes to fully charge it. I use it and randomly charge it when I remember and never had any issues with it.
I have one of these and love it. It is a tough little unit that I use on the boat , at home and in the car. But it wlil only link with one system at a time.
yes is work for my speedlight
Yes
The optical cable is not included.
Yes
The camera on the Kindle Fire HDX 7.0 will be slightly off center to the right because Amazon had put another sensor just to the left of it. The opening on the Maximus Case is big enough to accommodate both of these features.
It is worth getting the 64Gb version -- you cannot go back and add more later. As noted in the other post, the 64gb version does not provide a flash drive with the system restore image. I used a 16gb micro sd card in thumb drive and created a system restore drive. I was then able to free the 8gb that was used for the system restore image, and added to the space to the C: drive. I found a youtube video with the detail on the steps.
You will need to supply the hard drive with its own power source since the Micro-USB port on the tablet cannot do it alone. You can find decent enclosure kits online.
Yes the card doesn't drop off the wireless connection. I bought this model last March and so far not a single problem with it
No. It is not.
They are real keys, that light up when depressed...great touch...great laptop.
The palm rejection works very wells. When the stylus is 0.5 inch above the surface, the tablet detects and does palm rejection. So you can place your palm on the surface and draw.
you get the cord that plugs into your computers SB - that charges it, OR... you can buy juat about anywhere a wall plug, that a small cube that this same USB cord plugs into
download the MX player from the android market and play almost all format.
Just use the regular USB end to download files from your PC to this drive, then use the micro-USB end to upload files to your Kindle Fire HD.
The case will only fit the Note 10.1 2014 version
Contact the manufacturer about the warranty status, and request help to identify this problem. The display may be defective and have to be replaced
yes, it can.
Image quality will be great. Keep the shutter speed high enough to avoid shake, or use a tripod. Not all Lumix lenses have IS, including their wonderful 25 1.4.
Hi Christine, There is a ring on the top of the lens, you have to remove it to place the Hood. Best Juan
Dimensions are given in the product details.
Yes
Optically this Olympus is a little better than the Lumix. I have observed that Lumix lenses make a faint fluttering noise when mounted on Olympus bodies. My understanding is that this has to do with the way Olynpus and Panasonic have implemented 'live view.' By the way, I also think that the Olympis looks more retro and is more in alignment with the styling of your E-M10. Hope this helps. Cheers.
the Note Pro comes with the S-pen stylus and S-pen interface as well as S-pen optimized apps. the Tab Pro does not include the S-pen or stylus features.
All tablets at this point are strictly Wi-Fi. If you want to have LTE 4G 3G or whatever, you will be paying an astronomical amount.
too many to list, you're better off googling that answer or reading the reviews here on amazon (and the product description, too). Hancom Office is one of the best apps i have used, check out my review for a more detailed description. it's basically MS Office for android, fully compatible with MS Office word, power point and excel documents. you can use the pen to write and it will convert it to text as well.
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IQWSP1A
Yes, sort of. The work around is installing the "Dolphin" Browser. Then in the settings, you select the "type" as desktop. Amazon Video will then recognize it. I put my default home page to the Amazon Prime video webpage. Works great. I do this for all of my Android devices.
No it doesn't
No, it does not have Bluetooth
Yes
The samsumg galaxy tab pro runs on an android 4.4 kit kat operating system. This is different than your Nook OS. Go to the Next Issue website and scroll to the bottom of the page. Under the Account heading click "FAQ." Then click on the
It uses a micro SD card, I bought this one, "Samsung Electronics 64GB EVO Micro SDXC"
Differences between pro and home are negligible to the home user. Pro is a must for domain connectivity in the business network environment.
16gm is the maximum since it only 2 memory slots Thank you
there is no difference in speed, it's just extra storage memory not more RAM. as far as speed goes the only difference you MIGHT notice is the 4G/LTE model has a slightly faster processor but to most it is unnoticeable.
http://www.gigabyte.com/support-downloads/download-center.aspx
Yes as I wear glasses And have no issues wearing them for hours.
I haven't had any need for a passkey. However, I do have to go to settings on my android phone to connect the headphones via Bluetooth each time that I use them. This may be because I have more than one headphone that I use with Bluetooth.
yes.
The XFX Radeon R9 290 Double Dissipation video card has one 8-pin PCIe and one 6-pin PCIe power connector located along the top edge of the card that are both needed for proper operation. XFX suggests using a 750W or greater power supply for proper single card operation.Note that the backplate and GPU cooler extend well beyond the PCB. Read more at http://www.legitreviews.com/xfx-radeon-r9-290-double-dissipation-video-card-review_138612#cEYIKAJJSzOOGvU7.99-------------
As long as it has a PCI-E slot and you have a powerful enough Power Supply (at the minimum 650 watts) it will work.. and work very well!
The 18mm-55mm is Cannon. The other two lenses are more attachments to your base 18mm-55mm lens as they do not connect to the camera body directly. The brand of these is Vivitar.
yes both the camera and lens are covered with the 1 year Canon warranty
Hi Claire, Thanks for reaching out to us and your interest in our headphones. The software in our headphones is currently Bluetooth 4.0. I hope this helps but if there's anything else with which we can help, please do not hesitate to reach out to us at support@lil-gadgets.com. Have a great day, Jacquie co-founder, LilGadgets
Then just use the include speaker cable until apple updates firmware. Works fine with all my Bluetooth 3&4 devices.
Hello, Thanks for your interest in our headphones! Yes, we are currently backordered but have the last of our inventory of the year being delivered to Amazon tomorrow. We anticipate that we will be available for purchase on Amazon in the next two to three days. If you shoot us an email at support@lil-gadgets.com, I can add you to our mailing list of people to be notified once we're fully back in stock at Amazon of all colors. I hope that helps but please let me know if there is anything else we can do. Jacquie

Roughly 3 in. These are great for toddlers but work well for older children (Tweens) due to the fit but don't look like a child's product.
This model uses the latest intel iris pro graphics card. I use it as a windows 7 media center and record 3 hd show simultaneously without and issue while also serving a plex media server. I've not had any performance issues so far.
It is possible to install on any car but I'd recommend researching the internet to determine what all you need and may need to be done to the car to install it. Some take minor modifications, some major modifications and some no modifications to the dash....You can directly hard wire it or get an adapter plug if they are available....Then there's the options of steering wheel controls, on star, nav, back up camera that all need separate additional parts to work with the new radio.
Good
Register you vehicle make and model from this page on Amazon and it will tell you compatibility.
They reinforced the top braver bar under the handle and overall it looks to be made of better material. I had the older bag as well, and that bar piece failed. The new one is holding up better.
Yes, just traveled with it in March. Fits perfectly, even under an economy seat.
The smartphone app allows you to remotely power OFF the camera but you can not use it to turn it on.
Yes, but your results depend on the airplane. Most airplanes will require the use of an adapter such as this one http://www.amazon.com/Koss-8-Inch-Airline-Adapter-Headphone/dp/B003J9VG2U/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1397658902&sr=8-4&keywords=airplane+headphone+adapters You can usually use the headphones without the adapter, but you will only get sound out of one of the headphones.
I have not tried in an android tablet, unless you consider kindle fire hd a n android, then yes. If they work for android phones, which I've tried, then they'll surely work for tablets. Short answer, yes.
YesC Skype is supported.
basic HP software...comes preloaded with the latest Mcafee antivirus trial version and the trial version of Microsoft office. Nothing fancy. Also, has 3 USB ports
Yes, you sure can.
Yes
Could you please specify hp printer model? And how was the installation process?? Best regards
No it prints rectangular pictures but there are templates on the app that allow you to use square images, it just leaves bars on the top and bottom or you can print text at the bottom
No it does not. It has been a very good tablet, I have been rather impressed with it.
Yes, I'm running a DVI and VGA.
It has a SDIF audio output (coaxial-rca mono connector and optical-toslink) to be connected to your receiver which can have a 5.1(six- channel) or 7.1(eight-channel surround sound). Your receiver or pre-amp determines the type of surround sound output you have. Another audio/video output of the Brix is the HDMI which can go directly to a newer tv (which has an HDMI input) if you do not have a receiver. I hope I did not confuse you. TDRG
Yes
The individual speakers are wireless. The base charging station plugs in to household AC outlet. Hope this helps.
No.
Yes. 3" is 75mm (approx.). This mount supports the following standard mounting hole patterns (in mm): 75x75 100x100 200x200
The GPS Logging function on the P3 and P2 Pro allows the camera to record speed and location data (longitude, latitude, state and road) on the recorded videos, it also allows the camera to display the current speed of the vehicle while the vehicle is being operated. It will not display maps or guide you to the selected Destination. And the MAP which comes with P3 only work in US. PAPAGO!
Yes
This didn't work at all for me, but in theory yes.
Not sure of an exact but I have never charged it and filmed my twins birth etc will it. It is well worth the price. I am very pleased with the purchase. Nothing fancy just gets it done.
It will record continuously until it runs out of battery or memory - which ever comes first. If you plug in the usb power charger, you can eliminate the battery limit. I have recorded as much as two hours without attending to the camera during that time.
No they do not
I have the 3 and it does NOT work at all, no Mic, no volume control.
I love the SOL headphones. .. I accidentally Washed the in my gym shorts and they never missed a beat. I sweat like crazy they don't fall out and the sound is perfect. If the bose are at a better price... maybe go with bose.
Due to their low profile design there isn't much bulk... I've worn them with a beanie on and they are very comfortable.
no difference just the color, I think it's only promotional price of black color
It looks like 720. HD Video 1280 x 720 pixels, 30fps (HD / Motion JPEG) STD Video 640 x 480, 30fps (VGA / Motion JPEG) / 320 x 240, 30fps (QVGA / Motion JPEG)
No, this camera doesn't have an optical viewfinder but it does have a 3" LCD display with 460,000 dots. Full details of the camera's main parts can be found in the below link. ftp://ftp.panasonic.com/camera/dmclz40/dmc-lz40_en_advanced_om.pdf#page=7
The camera includes the battery pack, USB connection, shoulder strap, lens cap, and AC Adapter.
See "INPUTS/OUTPUTS"
No it does not
Dear Vladimir O. Thanks for your question. I am glad to inform you that this item do not have bluetooth function. We will try to contact with the manufacturer to improve this in the future. Thanks.
Yes but data usage has to be activated
I could not make it work on my Windows computer. It is designed to be paired with portable device like phone or MP3 player. I tried to pair it with my Windows machine and was unable. I looked for the drivers but with no success.
No, the buttons on top of the radio are not back lighted.
These are new units that just came in to us.
No batteries to replace .... this camera has internal batteries ... you need to plug camera into USB Drive to charge ....
If you look on the side where you insert the SD card you'll see one of those holes is a reset button. Use a paper clip to push it.
These do include the wall mounting brackets.If for whatever reason yours does not include the brackets you can receive the parts through the warranty department. Their information is included with the unit.
The battery last about 4-5 hours..
No it doesn't, you'll have to buy it in addition.
No
64 bit
No No, this is normal office using laptop. Not for gaming
Thank you very much for your inquiry about one of our product. It does come with HDMI cable. thanks,
I use it with an android device, and this issue hasn't happened to me.
Yes. You can connect to any wired router, and it will act as an access point for that network. The HooToo has its own NAT by default, so you won't be able to connect to other devices on that LAN using the default settings. It easily provides a separate WIFI network for guest use (although the range is not great).
No, there is no CD, or DVD drive in this laptop.
As for the card I cannot advise you on that. If you haven't purchased it yet don't waste your money. We sent it back after just one week of use. Would not connect to the internet again. Speaker was very poor and weak sounding. Very cheaply made. Put a few more dollars into one and buy a name brand you can trust.
It's more than sufficient, nothing spectacular if that's what you're looking for. I would rate as good, 3.5/5. I give the tablet overall a 4.5/5. Hope that helped.
It comes with the round clip that attaches to the back of the unit, but you can use the clip you have already IF it it snaps on to the ball mount stem on your current mount. Hope this helps?
As long as you have the bracket tthat fits the universal ball mount it will fit. The picture shows a bracket already attached to the ball, but you don't need that to use it. Just remove that round bracket & put the ball mount into your existing ball mount bracket & you are good to go.
I've always bought Sony tvs but after comparing the sharp tv to the sony I went with the sharp the color pop off the screen the 3d is amazing, the regular picture is beyond compare. I generally get buyers remorse after a big purchase but not with the sharp tv.
according hdguru the UQ Series have all the SQ Series features and add: - THX certification - Super bright technology - AquoMotion 960 with 240Hz Panel - Active 3D with two Bluetooth 3D glasses supplied - Titanium brushed solid aluminum bezel - 4 HDMI inputs (4K ready) and 2 USB ports - 15W Subwoofer
Yes, This has a web browser. Kinda hard to use since you have to use the on screen keyboard though. It also has the option of viewing netflix (In fact the remote has a "Netflix" button) and Hulu Plus and a couple others. Unfortunately it does not have an app for viewing Amazon instant video. I checked the instant video compatibility on Amazon's website and Sharp seems to be one of the only unsupported TV's
This UQ model has a different polished edge type, THX certification, and AquoMotion 960 which is a brighter panel. Hope that helps!
At the minimum I would suggest a sound bar--strongly suggest connecting tv to a smart receiver with surround sound. Don't get cheap now you already spent the money for a quality picture ---get the sound to match!
Yes, this does include the "soap opera" effect feature but you have the option of turning that feature off.
Ty Cobb.
14 inches deep with the table stand attached. We have the 70 inch. It's no more than 2 inches thick without the stand and mounted on our wall just fine. You shouldn't have any problems at all since you won't be using the included stand.
I do not think so. I connect mine via HDMI for the best picture. I think the TV requires a hard wire connection to the internet but cannot operate wirelessly.
Not much bigger than the TV dimensions, but packaging was substantial. TV arrived in great shape, and was delivered by 2 great service men. They unpacked it, put the stand on it, made sure that the set turned on, and took the packaging with them. Very satisfied with the delivery. We did order it directly from Amazon.
It has a full web browser on it. Attach a usb keyboard and you can surf any website as you would a computer.
First make sure everything is on the SAME channel and GROUP. You have to make that change on both the TX and the N's. Then make sure your flashes are in TTL mode themselves - they always have to be in TTL mode for the communication to work.
if you wanted to, you can hook only one camera. each camera works on a separate cannel. doesn't affect the system. you don't have any problem.
Yes mine came with remote. Might want to submit a comment about it to the seller
Yes, you can use a VGA cable or a RCA adapter plug (check the link below) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005B4O4GG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
I never was asked for a serial number and do not see one on the packaging. Try support 1-909-595-1200, or support@myboise.com
Yes, it works on my samsung sound bar. Use the disc to install software. Worked easily
There is plenty of space inside for Optical Drive and HDD. You may have to remove some screws and a cover for the Optical Drive but there appears to be plenty of space for both. I just added RAM memory so I did have the cover off and and got a good inside view.
It supports up to 16 GB. There are 2 RAM slots. Each slot can take 8Gb. The PC comes with 4Gb. I personally added 4Gb to the other slot for a total of 8Gb and it works fine for what I do.
No. I called HP and they tried to tell me how to copy one from machine. That did not work so i called again and they sent me OS discs.
Not sure about 4004 model, but their website has windows versions listed and they do sell on Amazon. Keep in mind the inateck support was worthless to me. Read the ENTIRE website and amazon's too. They poorly place very pertinent information.
Another power supply is needed for 4 more cameras
Any LCD monitor with a VGA connection will work.
Bluetooth pairing is simple enough as well as connecting your audio devices with an audio cable. I will say adjust the speaker to max volume and just adjust accordingly with the audio device you will be using, initially I maxed out my phone volume thinking that it was as loud as it got*it wasn't*, forgot to max out the speaker and it gets quite bloody loud.
You need to find the perfect fit of buds to avoid getting water in your ears. I use the medium ones and I have no problem with water in my ears
Yes
Yes, but I wouldn't recommend it for lots of video, there are better tripod heads with a pan-handle (haha) that make panning smoother. Once you lock the ball with the two knobs, there is a separate knob that controls rotation, and it tells you the degrees (0-360), so you can take panoramic photos. You loosen the rotation knob and can pan, it does feel smooth, and could be used if you will do occasional videos. If you are taking a lot of videos, I would get something made more for videos.
No, you can put the way u want just tighten it and u will have the most firm piece in the word, i love it and i use it every day and still in good shape....
I don't think it will work. I own a monopod and it doesn't fit in, the tripod head's thread is too big. Monopods usually have a 1/4" screw (that's the size of most cameras at their bottom hole). The product has a 3/8" base, it's larger and won't be good enough to make an extra long selfie stick with your monopod. The tripod head has worked beautifully on other applications though.
The third knob (I assume you mean the smaller one at the base) is to adjust the panning tension. This head will allow you to pan by loosening the third, smaller knob without having to loosen the ball. Hope that helps
The one we received with the camera was a Sony brand, high speed, with full HD recording capabilities and yes, a 10. Good card.
I didn't purchase this through Amazon, but it came in a brown Logitech-branded box. Not the normal "flashy" retail boxes like you see in the stores for their other products.
Honestly, a lot depends on how quiet the participants are. The mic is relatively sensitive, so if there are a lot of side conversations, the other party may have some trouble hearing those on your end. I felt like the speaker was plenty loud, though. Unfortunately there is no way to add additional mics to the unit.
Yes...Haswell architecture. I purchased this mid-July from Amazon, and have had zero issues with it, and no coil whine in my unit. Mine is essentially silent, and has run perfectly since day one. Battery life is excellent, and responsiveness with the SSD is fantastic - this does a cold boot in a few seconds, and wakes from sleep almost instantly. Display is the best I've seen, period. Fantastic machine overall.
Thank you for your question. The device is able to detect ionizing radiation and store the readings up to 3 years for Beta, Gamma and X-Ray Radiation. If there is an Alpha radiation source in the object there will be Beta or Gamma decoys which the device will successfully detect. The radiation coming from the Fukushima is Beta and Gamma.
Yes. The factory is located near Moscow. Has "Made in Russia" mark. Developed and manufactured with the best modern technologies taking into the consideration the experience from Chernobyl and Fukushima events.
No outside temp feature
I believe it has a rear USB input that gets fished around for a cleaner look. Yea you can find a kit anywhere for that. Hardware shouldn't cost more than 50 bucks.
Yes you can go into settings then display scroll down and it's under screen adjust.. This head unit is amazing for the price everything you could ever need other than Bluetooth
Yes, but the camera front and back are pretty Crappy
Do you mean the actual google app or the google App Store (google play)? I would suggest you download the google app through google play. Mine works fine, I downloaded it through google play.
Unfortunately not, but I have a Bluetooth receiver from HP that allows connection of up to five (5) Bluetooth compatible devices. So I have an HP BT mouse, keyboard, and HP mobile printer paired on that one receiver. The previous post state they use a wireless printer no problem. However, "wireless" is not Bluetooth. Wireless requires a "wireless" network. Bluetooth requires a "Pairing".
Yes--a CyberLinkYouCam
Yes it comes with RCA adaptor cables that would be compatible with your Grace Internet Radio.
Headsets are individually powered. I don't see why not. As long as you follow the linking procedures for both.
According to the manual the 32" & 40" TV's have 200mm x 200mm VESA pattern. http://cdgenp01.csd.toshiba.com/content/support/manuals/userguides/su4004879/GMA300032013_L1400U_14Apr01.pdf I would trust the manual over the copy on Amazon page.
best bet is to connect the sound bar to a cable box or Blue ray..you don't want the source/feed from the TV anyway (The TV audio circuitry is usually terrible anyway) Sound bar gives you the option of playing music without having the TV on.
The actual refresh rate is 60Hz but the back light refresh rate can go up to 120. So it is a 60Hz monitor which refreshes the back light 120times this kind of marketing is crap because they claim it will make your images clearer as a higehr refresh rate would but this jsut shows you the same image twice making the actual refresh rate 60. Look out for these terms for fake refresh rates. Toshiba clearscan, LG TruMotion, Sony MotionFlow, Vizio SPS, Panasonic Backlight Scan.
The total weight in its shipping box is about 25 lbs (the TV is only 21 lbs, see product specs) and the box is 29"x38"x8". The TV is packed well & surrounded in its box with styrofoam inserts all around it; normally it gets delivered with no problems of any kind, unless the shipper mistreats it ,by putting heavier packages on it or laying it flat instead of keeping it upright en route.
Dear Customer, Yes, it will work with Intecom ITE 12SD Model
It's not a rechargeable device. It's need to be continuously connected to power supply.
It does work through WiFi but yes this can be used in your Car. it does not require an external WiFi network as it provides its own.
Modems do not require a specific operating system. They are used as a gateway between buried communication lines and your house/office. Short answer = yes, they will work with windows 8
Hello, We would think this tablet stand will not work well with your need. Sorry for the inconvenient
It's actually a USB cable that plugs into a micro usb socket on the dock and the other end (regular USB) plugs into an American socketed power supply. I'm sure a European adapter would work just fine with the power supply if need be. The power supply is about 2in x 2in x 1in std. 2 prong 5v 2.1Amp. rated 100 to 240 volts AC at .2 amps. This thing charges fast too. I also use it to charge my new Samsung Galaxy S5 with the wireless charging back cover.
There are no external speaker outputs. There is an audio input. If you want to send an audio signal to this monitor and another source like external speakers, just split the signal before the input.
Black list capacity is 9999. SENTRY's first line of defense(warning message) is so effective you rarely need to use black list.
From Home screen, press White List to show white listed numbers, use Up/Down to find the number to delete, press DELETE twice to delete. Same to Black list.
Buy a volt converter....
I bought from Klick Online because it does have the digitizer pen. (I needed to buy through Amazon to be able to use AMEX points so couldn't buy through Lenovo.) It is a slightly older version (11/2013) which does have one dead pixel -- a problem I thought was resolved with the computers built in 2014. Other than that, it has been fine and the pen works really well.
Yes.
United states
You can send a "sms" to any phone via email. Google email to sms and find your carriers address
No
The same type you use for a desktop computer.
Absolutely not. Q-See has software for Android and iPhone that can be downloaded from the app-store or GooglePlay so you can view your live footage as well as recording from the application. You can even change settings remotely and save them back to the system. Of course all of this is only possible if your system is connected to your internal network. you will however initially need a monitor to set up the DVR and after that you do not need a keyboard, mouse or monitor.
I have mine plugged into my wireless router via a networking cable...that way I can see my CCTV DVR wirelessly via internet explorer on any computer with wireless capability.
I see no way to install a wireless camera with this system.
Sure it is !
Two batteries come with this. A Nikon and an after market battery.
This will work as a recording device for any TV. However, you will need to use an external hard drive that connects using USB or a USB flash drive.
Yes, I use the audio out with HDMI for headphones. You should be able to connect the audio out to an audio input on an amplifier for external speaker reception.
Dear Matt, The Papago! GoWatch770 could not link with these apps now. But it can connect to Papago GoLife Run cloud service to view the activity data into easy-to-view diagramsand tables for review and analysis. Thanks! Papago!
Hello. It has a wide range of size adjustments. It measures at nearly 12 inches long from end to end with the ability to size it from really small to almost the edge of the band. I hope this makes sense and ask me anything else if you need to.
the packaging was super easy to open without using a blade or knife -- i think it is more like industry-speak describing this packaging instead of that cocoon-sealed-from-china-need-a-chainsaw to get it out packaging...
I have an Audi Q7 with a textured leather dash and it did not stick (not even close). I used gorilla glue, which worked very well. However, I doubt I'll ever be able to get it off the dash without damaging it. The system is working great though! Very pleased. I have a big phone (HTC one m8).
There are two types of electrical outlets in Peru. One accepts two-pronged plugs with flat, parallel blades, while the other takes plugs with two round prongs. Many Peruvian electrical outlets are designed to accept both types. This adapter has both types and should work just fine. http://0.tqn.com/d/goperu/1/W/V/2/-/-/peru-electrical-outlet-plug.jpg
I just used this in London with a Windows phone and tablet and an iPhone and iPad. Nothing else is needed. I am told these days that voltage conversion is handled by the devices.
No it doesn't, and if it does I havent figured it out.
They are protected inside the swivel mount.
Thank you for your interest in our products. You can play Bluray and if its 3D this will still work.
Thank you for your interest in our products. The unit will play Bluray using a special software
Yes, it does. It has what's called "gaming mode", which has its very own key. When you press fn+gaming mode, the windows key goes dormant, and there's even a lighted symbol to tell you it's on, just like with caps or num lock.
One size, that's it. Little big on my wrist but I would say I am close to average, will not work well for thin people.
This is the info from the booklet that came with the tablet: Acer Limited Warranty Agreement Warranty Length/Type: 1 Year:Parts & Labor, Mail or Carry In Hardware Technical Support: 1 Year Software Support: 90 Days Service Website: http://www.acersupport.com Service Phone #866-695-2237 (US) Service Phone #866-7062237 (Canada)
Actually, the adapter does support 110 and 240, just look on the sticker on yours to be sure. It's in very small print. You just need the appropriate wall adapter for India.
Have you done a search on Amazon for your particular model? If you don't find it there, Google it. Hope this helps.
yes it is for few games
Yes. I personally have that exact cpu cooler in my rig. Not much room between the top and the side panel (about a mm or 2). But it fits.
Openings on the sides of the front panel, openings on side of the top panel, and opening at the PSU at the bottom
The ZTC is an adapter to read an mSATA drive through USB. The device you linked is to read an mSATA drive through a standard 2.5 laptop drive input. They two do entirely different things and would not work together. If you're asking whether or not the device you linked to will fit inside the adapter, it will not, but the hard drive that would fit the device you linked would fit in the adapter.
No it does not.
Yes they work great with the ps3
very comfortable according to my son, he play LOL without any problem for hours... is very recommendable this machine
You can use any delay device or smart tv
If you plan on publishing the video, I'd go up a notch in choice of mic. But I haven't given mine any kind of fair test, either. It does work with a 5200, I can say.
Approximately 7 inches, however, there usually is additional wire stuffed in the conduit wire. Mold of the vehicle...I own a 2014 Explorer.Hope this helps.
Yes, the keyboard is attached by two magnets and will stay in place and not interfere with keyboard when closed. If you leave the keyboard attached and close it though, you have to sometimes wiggle the case a bit to get the flap and its magnets to line up and close securely.
I downloaded my I tunes files to my Fiio's sd cards AIFF lossless via usb cable. The player works wih these files. Any further questions can be answered from the Fiio website.
All true... No 3D features... It is not a smart TV so internet port... Only 2 HDMI ports.... I didn't need these features... I have them my other Samsung Plasma TV and never use them... I was after screen size only... Samsung has the greatest picture quality I've seen excluding 4K...
HDMI INPUTS are on side of back panel. component is in center back panel
1200 is awesome great resol ution But mine broke at the third use I was refunded
You would need to connect it via VGA cable
The firmware is available through Pyle.

Hi, thanks for your question and interest in our product. You can connect the M2GFHD to a Mac Mini via HDMI. For connecting more than one M2GFHD monitor to the Mac Mini, you would connect via USB to daisy chain the monitors and down load the appropriate DisplayLink driver. I hope this has answered your question satisfactorily. If you have any other questions please feel free to email us directly at contact@mmt2.com Best, MMT
Thank you for your question and interest in Mobile Monitor Technologies. The type of panel in the Monitor2Go FHD is a TFT-LCD Panel (Full HD, GIP, TN). Please be in touch if we can be of any further assistance. Best, MMT Team
Not at all. You'll need a much better tripod.
FM is allowed on 10 meters in the US ham band from 29.52Mhz to 29.6Mhz
I'm not sure when u select it it shows the cost of warranty
I use this camera in the water and out, it takes great pictures. Great everyday use camera.
It was bought specifically to use on youtube and is acceptable for such.
You are looking at the brightness graph. Press DISP. to cycle through the three different display modes.
You would have to ask a battery. You won't find one on this device.
Yes it will come with digitizer pen
Hi Evan, there are two USB 3.0, no VGA, mini-HDMI socket and 1 headphone/microphone jack. It also has a 4-in-1 SD card reader.
Yes it does.
Yes I listen to old vinyls. Got polk audio speakers.
yes it does. This makes it much more easier to search instead using the remote
It is roughly 37"X 21".
reception is excellent..even for long distances... rotor broke after a few days..
Yes
Don't know what all the different sizes are for. When I ordered mine, only the color was viewable and not the size.
Yes, this will accommodate ATX-sized boards like the Z87-Pro motherboard.
You should be able to plug a three pin into a 4 pin. Alternatively you could just rub them off the power supply with the right connectors.
This card does not, but only because it lacks a DisplayPort port, otherwise the chip would be able to send the signal.
Yes. Google GTX 750 Ti specs and click the first link. It supports all forms of modern 700-series technology, including GPU Boost 2.0.
Yes
A pin hole lens will automatically focus to infinity.
I had them for a couple months but I never really got them wet. They are sweat resistant
I'm very happy with my Tosiba with the split screen were you can do two jobs simultaneous are watch movies while working. It's an excellent choice!
LuvinLife, Yes, a remote control is included in the box. Thanks for your interest in Samsung televisions. --Mr. S
Not any glossier than any computer monitor. I haven't had any problems with it. It's not at all distracting. It's a beautiful television.
kbyrnes, This model actually has the HDMI and USB ports on the side so that wall mounting isn't an issue for either input. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
yes to both it has one hdmi port and a webcam
Yes. Two viewing options to choose. There is a button on top that switches from viewfinder to the three inch monitor
Hi jstevens, no the camera doesn't have the capability for live display to an external monitor. You can only use the a/v out port for playback on a TV. Thanks_Mitch
Yes, in M (Manual) mode, you can set the shutter speed to as slow as 30 seconds.
Absolutely fine.. It pairs with both my NEX-6 and NEX-7 (as well as my A7R & A7, of course ;) ) without a hitch. OSS will works as well as all the other controls. However - keep in mind, with any APS-C Sony E-Mount body, it will become a 105-300mm lens, which you probably knew...
Hi, this Sony lens SEL70200G is an E-mount type of lens whereas the Sony Alpha A7 is an E-mount type camera body. You do not need an adapter for using the lens to the A7 camera. -Ely
Yes
yes, it has an adjustment for red eye. It's a wonderful camera.
No it does not have a GPS on the Sony Cybershot DSC WX350; as for the flash - you can configure this in the configuration and turn it off so that you can turn it when you want it on instead of having it on all the time; and you are correct, some modes, flash is not available such as Panoramic for example. Grandma Rocks! (Vote if this was Helpful! Thanks!)
Yes.
Mine measures 3 3/4" long by 2 1/16" high by 3/4" deep.
hi, it uses NP-BN Rechargeable Lithium-ion Battery
Yes
Thank you for contacting us. Unfortunately we are out of stock of the item you are inquiring about. We are unable to retrieve the price due to we are out of stock.
It does have a built in flash. I believe you can use any flash that can mount to a hot shoe.
It's not a SSHD or SSD. It's just a standard, 2TB HDD (but it works great)! I use it in my PS4. My friend who bought a hybrid 1TB HDD says he wishes he now got this one because mine loads up just a TAD bit slower than his and the gaming load times that he saves time on are barely felt with his SSHD. ;-)
The graphics card processes videos and 3D content. More powerful graphics cards will play smoother video and run more sophisticated games and other 3D applications.
it does but you have to download software to make it work. Its pretty easy. Just use the app that comes with Google Chrome.
I don't believe it do, I had it hooked up to my DVD. I have purchased a different one now because the Subwoofer wouldn't connect so be careful if purchased. My Subwoofer didn't work.
hi jhon when you take your faceplate off theres a little circle to reset the deck use a ink pen tip & push it in... if that doesnt work i would unplug the wire harness and plug that back in... or your sorce button turns the deck on & off by holding it in for a few seconds try that... if this all fails kenwood has a one year warranty send it back the will fix or replace it buddy ..good luck &#9786;
No you can not.
press MODE button and see from that little display window will show REPEAT, RANDOM, SHUFFLE ETC.
It can shoot plain digital images as well as normal HD movies. You just need to select the Photo mode on the screen menu and you are ready to go! The single images are as superb as the movie images! Good luck. Rick B.
I think this case will work with the Vision + as long as the camera doesn't stick out beyond the legs. There seems to be a lot of space for a bigger camera at the bottom of the case.
No
Guess it can be done but you to go thru a lot of trail n error. It the only way I've learned some the functions. The little instruction booklet is very vague at least to me. I'm more of learn it the hard way. Sorry I couldn't be of more help. But one thing it's the best purchase I've made in a long time. ENJOY
I like the Samsungs. We have had Sony Bravia, Sharp, and Samsung, and the Samsungs of recent years including the model 6350 are sharper in picture and we like the apps better, however, when buying a blue ray player we still stick with Sony, they load faster and have a better user friendly menu.
Craig G, It has both a 3.5mm (headphone *size*) audio output which can be sent to either another 3.5mm connection or RCA - and there is also digital optical. You have both on this model. Does that help? --Mr. S
Go for Samsung UN50H6350 50-Inch 1080p... Its a way better than plasma, also you will save on electricity bill. Plasma consume more electricity
Yes, the Samsung H6400 has 3D and it is very good when viewed straight on -side angle viewing is not as good.
I only had one more component to control so I can't decisively answer your question. However, since all you have to do is place it close enough to the component, I would say you can control more than one as long as the components are close to each other....hope this helps....
Yes, it includes Optical Audio Out as well as well as a 25mm jack that can be used for wireless headphones
Yes, you connect the TV wirelessly to your router - so then you can surf the net, watch NetFlix, etc - without having to plug things into the TV itself.
I actually buy the stereo and take it to a mechanic :)
Hello. Yes, this radio will fit your vehicle. You will need a dash kit, a wire harness, and an antenna adapter to complete the installation.
Yes, it does have HDMI port. Best regards, Amuras
The most frames per second this camera allows is 96 and this is only in HD, not in 4k. Most of the other recording modes are limited to 59.97 fps so I would not consider slow motion this camera's strong suit. But yes it does some slowmotion and it might be enough for your needs :) You can check an example of it's slowmo abilities here : https://vimeo.com/91880562
The amp does not go into standby if no audio is sent. You have to manually turn it off. There will be a new version launched in late November the BTAR513 that will go into standby after 15 minutes of no audio. The remote control is infrared.
Hi, it is a standard fixed line output ( the BTAR512 volume control does not change volume of the line out signal).
502 is the older discountinued unit. The 512 is a bit more powerful and newer Bluetooth chip
You can turn it on (and off) with the remote control included with the amplifier
No, the power pack is 25 volt AC at 100 watts.
Your question was referred to me. I would not repair mine as I have not been happy with it at all. Previously, I bought Dell and Hp products for over 10 years and when this Acer laptop goes I will return to a Dell if possible.
Yes
metal
Yes, integrated Super-Multi drive.
Yes it has one HDMI port, and it works excellent for watching Amazon movies on the big TV in the living room. Enjoy!
Wilson is now Weboost. Here is their support website: https://www.weboost.com/us/support/ You can ask them how to get replacement. They will need model number.
This unit is compatible with all carriers using the 700, 850,1900 and 1700/2100 MHz frequencies, which includes most major North American carriers 4G, 3G, and 2G networks (does not cover Clearwire).
it does not have audio output its meant to be used as a projector connected to a external video player and most external players have a audio output and if users want to use this on the go it has a built in speaker our mx 400 has a audio output with much more connection capabilities but it is more expensive
I've not tried playing FLAC or WAV files with it but i know WMA files are incompatible.
yes
Unfortunately, it doesn't come with a remote and I have yet to find one that works with this specific model. The touchscreen controls are very convenient and easy to use, so I wasn't too concerned about finding a remote for it.
Yes, I just ordered this camera and checked Adobe's website first. It lists "LUMIX DMC-ZS40 (DMC-TZ60, DMC-TZ61)" as supported with Camera Raw v.8.4 and Lightroom 5.4. Full list here: http://helpx.adobe.com/creative-suite/kb/camera-raw-plug-supported-cameras.html. Hope that helps!
Yes it has an SD Slot
Yes it does and is very easy to read. It will also show major roads and names as you expand the map
You have to download the Tom Tom go app. them it will try and connect through Bluetooth... You need the app first, then pair through bluetooth then with the app open it should connect...
I did not have to with the one I used

Yes it is. I have a D5200 and it work very good.
Yes
Yes various shades of red are available to be set for the color
The warranty card says one year USA limited warranty. (warranty card printed in China) I am about to find out if it is any good because the battery charger in the camera has stopped charging the battery.
I have purchased a number of cameras, including DSLRs and point and shoots and I do not recall ever getting a memory card with them. So yes, I would say that is normal, in my experience.
This camera comes packaged with the following accessories: EN-EL12 Li-ion Battery Charging AC Adapter Strap USB Micro Cable Cleaning Brush Nikon ViewNX 2 Software
This is a "Compact" camera, you cannot change the lens. That being said, however we have found it to be one of the best - with a 60X Optical lens - we've ever seen. Very good pictures. We're quite happy with it.
No the back screen is not a touch screen all the movement is controlled by the zoom lever and the rotating round dial next to the screen
Regular SD card
I'd shoot in the highest format you can according to how much your card can handle, then crop down to the print size you want or down to 1080 for viewing on your TV. Realistically, though, if you're going to be taking a ton of photos a smaller size will help with hard drive storage in the long run.
Mine didn't, but if you go to the file in explorer and look at the file properties it will show you the ccoordinates.
Not trial, Full Home and Student Ed.
According to the ASUS web site, it does come with Bank & Olufsen audio and external subwoofer. Check the link: https://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/N550JK/
As Raman said, it should work fine. Just FYI, this laptop also comes with software called Killer Network Manager that monitors and (it claims) optimizes your wireless use.
What is grainy? The screen? Then, no. It is a matt screen but very decent to work with.
Yes
CPU virtualization is enabled (without any change on my part) on this computer.
No.
You can plug into any TV that has HDMI input. This device makes any TV Smart. So why would you want to plug it into a smart TV unless you have smart programs that this one does not? The only wires that would show are the power line and the HDMI cable. The unit is wifi so the internet signal goes from your router to the unit by air transmission. Hope this helps. Joe
Yes. Having never used it before I tested it with an old B&W & a more recent release. Worked on both so yes. Go to "settings" click "others" to turn it on.
Yes
The player is locked. DVD-Region 1 and Bluray-Region A.
Sara, they support 30 countries but UAE is not listed see their website bellow: https://traxfamily.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/200316781-Supported-countries
The remote is super easy to use. Hook it up to your computer and add your devices and the function the are to serve. During use if anything is wrong, on screen help button allows you to fix any problems.
Absolutely. That is exactly how I use it. The Menu button replaces the Xfinity button. Note: When watching recorded TV use the Play button for both Play and Pause. Use the Exit button to Stop your recorded TV program as the Stop button will not do it. However, the Stop button works on DVD's, Blu-Ray Disks, and when using things like Netflix.
Yes, but you can also turn it off. There is a switch on the side. I turn mine off. I do not want the phone to answer by itself when I am not around, like a gosh. Lol
I am unsure but I haven't had any problems with this product and use for my home business.
5w
Not at all. Very light because battery is tiny
you only need to use the 3.5mm to RCA cable that comes with the set. the system will convert the signal to 5.1
Hi, thanks for your question. The SCNC3805 has been replaced by the SCNC3905 which has more resolution and is priced the same. Yes, you can purchase many additional cameras. We have customers with 20 cameras at one location and over 50 cameras at multiple locations around the world, monitored over the internet from a central site.
It runs on XP, so it ought to. The SD card is both physically and by software accessible. It acts as a DVD and records the camera's image data.
it comes with camera
It does not. It's nothing more than a pointing device
It is already included.
The bottom will be flat if you don't attach the bottom stand. Nothing will stick out.
You have to go through the camera selections and set it up and you will need a memory card with WiFi ability in order to do that. You can purchase it at a photo store where they probably will also help you to set this up.
the processor speed is 2.0GHz
Yes, it's discontinued, but it still has one-year Warranty!
Yes. See compatibility list: http://www.asus.com/Tablet_Mobile_Accessories/ASUS_Miracast_Dongle/#specifications
Yes it does. I have connected Surface Pro 2 and 3 to in the office. It has a small lag but it seems to be working great for us.
okay so the best way to find out where to place a sub is kinda silly but it works. place the sub where you will be sitting. then go to the corners of the room or locations where you might place the sub. where it is the loudest place it there.
On the iPad it will be default. For the iPhone indont believe it does by default and you have to press the keyboard function key to make it hide.
I think it should as long as the TV has bluetooth.
There is a webcam and the battery life is good. With all laptop batteries, the key to their length of time is being sure to disconnect the electric cord shortly after it is fully charged. Batteries become used to being connected to the power source.
Yes it is
No. It has to be plugged directly into the wall outlet.
Yes, you can use two or more kits and connect as many devices to the network as you wish. It does not matter which one is connected to the router, as long as it stays connected for the others to connect to.
BP220 package and MAC220 package have exactly same batteries. But two packages come with different connector tips. MAC220 comes with 2 connector tips for Macbooks, does not come with connector tips for other computers. BP220 package comes with around 18 connector tips for many computers, but does not come with MagSafe2 Connector for Macbooks. If you already have the MagSafe2 adapter, then you should order BP220 battery instead of MAC220 battery. Best regards BiXNet
Yes, it can run MSI Ghost GS60. It is recommended to fully charge your computer internal battery with your computer AC power adapter before connect this BP220 battery to the computer.
From what I. Have researched, no this case wldnt fit that note you are referring to...
Sorry this one does not fit. But we also have the same keyboard case for your tablet. The ASIN is : B00GXCZPN6 . Thanks!
Amazon Customer, Subtitles are supported for some films. Not all Netflix streaming titles have Subtitles, but if they do, the player will support them. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
The rear speakers are attached to a small wireless device. You need to connect the wires from the rear speakers to the wireless device and not to the Main Receiver.. Hope it helps.
The speakers can be used elsewhere. Two points to consider: 1) the speakers are relatively low impedance and 2) their clip-type wire connectors are better suited for smaller-gauge speaker wire.
Yes
I bought mine used (like new) and it did not show Amazon Prime as an option until I ran a firmware update. After the update it was immediately an easy to set up option.
No.
No, it doesn't have a matte display. I have not found that to be as great a problem as I thought it would be, but I use it on my desk indoors. I wish it had that option.
Zachary, The Certified Servers team appreciates your question. The Poweredge 2950 is able to have Windows 2012 installed on it.
Yes
I haven't timed the duration of the recording, but after an estimated 2 hours ether the battery died or my card was full. I believe I was using a 2, 4 or 8 GB card. I believe it will record continuous if left plugged in.
Yes, it seems all Nikon compatible lenses are interchangeable but depending on the model of the lens or camera body some of the functionality may not be usable. An example would be stability control and auto-focus among other features. Be sure to do your due diligence in researching what will and will not work. I made the same transition in body you are asking about and had no problems with any of my lenses. I have Nikon, Sigma and Tamron lenses.
YES THE SAME CHARGER AS THE 3100
Yes
I don't know.. hmmm.. I've never heard of it. I need to send mine back because it doesn't fit my 7.0 Lite :(
sorry this one does not fit. Please search the other ASIN: B00JD4X6VE on amazon. It fits. thanks
Two
It was a 2014 model
Some Flash content may be available, however not all sites will be supported for streaming video from websites. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Yes. I have been watching both native 4K and 1080p upscaled to 4K and although I can tell the difference, I am still very impressed with the up conversion.
Tv panels are cut from bigger pieces to make several panels, sometimes the uniformity is off, so one tv will have no issues, while others will, so when you buy a TV, it's a toss up if you get a good panel or not, hence the lottery
Yes
Assuming it is a 16x port (the wide one with lots of connectors that you would ever consider plugging a graphics card into), and not a 1X port (the really narrow one you might plug in a card which provides extra USB ports into) then yes, it will work. The lower bandwidth will reduce performance. Depending on what your are doing the performance reduction can range from nothing you could ever notice to a moderate amount. It won't be severe.
Hi, the card runs on a pci-e x16 slot ver. 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0. You biostar G31-M7 TE have pci-express x16 slot ver. 1.0 and the gtx 750 no use external power source. The video card should works without problem
It will work fine as a replacement. I am not sure how much of a performance upgrade it will be however. It supports new features like DirectX 11 and Display Port.
One
Sorry. You cannot use the Sabrent USB 2.0 To DB25 IEEE-1284 Parallel Printer Cable Adapter (CB-DB25) with the 100 MB Iomega Zip drive.
I think you meant the UN40H5500 vs the UN40EH5300. I have the UN40H5500 and I don't think there is a UN40EH5500. The UN40H5500 is the 2014 model, and the UN40Eh5300 is the 2013 model. I think the major difference is that they changed the Smart Hub function, and used a better computer chip in the UN40H5500. Its a quad-core not dual chip. The Smart Hub runs faster and better. If you're going to use Netflix or the other Smart Hub functions, I recommend the UN40H5500 over the UN40EH5300.
I have not noticed any distortion when viewing the TV from the side.
I understand there is a wall mount for this TV. We did not wall mount it but I don't see why it could not be wall mounted.
I don`t know but i bet it was not USA. great tv though. Marion
Has good speakers but we went with a sound bar for low end.
Jesse, Yes, you can simulate 3-D (with the glasses and the 3-D feature ON) with 2D television. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Dear Young Jun Kim, Thank you for your inquiry. The UN55H8000 is only 110/120V. As an U.S. authorized dealer, we are only permitted by the manufacturer to sell product destined for the U.S. market. If you are in a non-U.S. market you may have options to purchase a different version of this television with different voltage capabilities. Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo
just the cable... works best with a blu ray player and have the playback set 24hz.
yes it does to charge and down load
The Stats dictate that it is the Titan Black
If you purchase three in SLI, and sacrifice a goat or small horse to Marcus Persson, you may get 20-30FPS.
what will you be doing? for gaming dual 780s would crush the titan
yes
It needs to connected to a cable and power supply.
well if you just wanna look at yourself strip the wires it will hooip[ up to anything.............
Popper - the 7.4 inches is depth of the stand. Without the stand, the TV/monitor is only 1.64 inches thick. Usually Amazon lists the specs with and w/o the stand, but I found them on another website.
Ernest C. Nolder, Yes, there is a digital HD tuner that you can connect "rabbit ear" antennas to get local over-the-air broadcasts. There is a choice to use the tuner, or to have it scan for cable channels, or both. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Not the version I have. I'm in the U.S. and most of our devices/appliances run on 120v. Unless it's something heavy duty.
very good unit. it is made to boost the sound only. not a surround sound. be careful that your tv has the proper audio ports. my 60 in samsung does not and it does not take a sound bar. i tested the sound bar with vizio support and it works great. very good unit for the price.
Not a traditional wall mount as it has not VESA connections. You have to use something like this: http://www.thehumansolution.com/workrite-non-vesa-mount-bracket.html?gdftrk=gdfV2929_a_7c132_a_7c5187_a_7cWRK170&gclid=CP_ZjrOS2sACFQhbfgodSAkAKw#newdescription
Yes, a modem/router has nothing to do with an operating system and will work for all networkable devices.
not sure, if your tv has bluetooth, it should.
more recent intel Celeron processor
I only see HDMI and RGB In ports.
It is in their list at http://mydeviceinfo.comcast.net/
The product description states 1600 x 900.
5 ms
Yes. But you need to set your TV to antenna, not cable. You may need to go through a couple of steps each time you want to switch.
I asked 1Byone the same question (and about the size of the antenna) and that was their reply: "The 13.3" antenna has a better performance than 8.6" antenna. The amplified antena has a better performace than the passive antenna." The amplified comes with an electrical source that you have to plug and it enhances its performance. You can choose one according to the signal strength in your area.
No, you should be able to get more channels, provided you live in a decent sized city with several stations. I live in the suburbs of a major metro area and I get 15 channels, including PBS.
It covers 5 year international warranty
yes
This one works on both digital and analog tvs and its passive so I believe it will work best if your tv is digital
Yes. It comes with the USB adaptor.
Yes it's possible. I use a Macbook as well. You'll need an Android File Transfer app to do it.
I'm getting just under 130MB/s read and write. It took under 2 hours to copy some files (around a TB) that took seven hours under USB 2.0.
Im on a 2009 Mac Pro and it boots for me. I get about 450MB/s read/write, but that is on PCIe 2.0, of course. Essentially, whatever the max throughput is of your PCIe slot will be the limit of your read/write.
Don't know about the CalDigit SKU but this card has worked well in a couple of different Mac Pros of mine. Other USB-3 cards have not.
The screen I believe is a active touch screen which requires a active acer pen to use or you could of course use your fingers to control the touch screen, for more information you could look here. http://www.eweek.com/small-business/acer-aspire-r7-touchscreen-notebook-gets-intel-chips-active-pen.html
No, I cannot reverse the direction of the fans. The fans only blow up toward the bottom of the laptop.
I have a 15.6" Sony laptop. It fits perfectly on top of the cooling pad.
I bet it doesn't have that much power but I have it hooked up to 2100 Watt emotiva amp
Flat.
It has 3 sets
It will work. Not sure about bios, though. I have a pcie 2.0 x16 motherboard and it works flawlessly. It might be a good idea to update your motherboard's bios.
you google the board, find the maker, get the manual and read it. Or ask nVidia; whatever, I would not recommend taking technical advice from some anonymous poster. REMINDER: it's AMAZON, buddy, buy it, try it, and return it! EOS. Good luck.
Yes, my wife has the Tough Armor case, and I have the Neo Hybrid case from Spigen, and this protector fits perfectly.
Yes. My body glove phone case had a clear plastic screen protector attached to the case. I didn't like that dust and dirt were getting under the cover so I bought the tech armor shield to put on my screen. I removed the clear plastic cover from my body glove phone case after I put the screen protector on and the phone case still fits perfectly. No issues. Hope this helps.

Your pc has to have wireless and WiFi. I use mine with my smartphone and it works just fine.
No
Yes -- I have mine paired with both my phone and my iPad
I haven't submerged it but it has gotten really wet and still works fine. I've had mine for over a month and no problems.
If your phone will play it, it should work with this. I don't use Spotify, but Pandora, Youtube, any video on Chrome have all gone to the speaker.
No
It's glossy
Yes
"LightScribe is an optical disc recording technology, created by the Hewlett-Packard Company, that uses specially coated recordable CD and DVD media to produce laser-etched labels with text or graphics, as opposed to stick-on labels and printable discs." The DVD/CD writer has to be lightscribe capable. I have not tried it with this technology/feature, and I do not think that it's capable of doing it. Normally when the DVS/CD writer has this feature, it would be written on the drive bay.
This is going to depend on your device - the bluetooth connection is initiated by your phone. If your phone is set to always connect to the MPOW when it is available, then yes, it will work as you expect.
Yes
Yes
Yes, I was disappointed to find out that the 3.5mm jack on the unit does not function as a headphone jack and says "Service only" , it is located next to the S/PDIF port .. so much for connecting a 2.1 speaker setup
You can connect to a computer through the HDMI, The picture quality depends on the graphic output of your computers graphic card. Alienware computers tend to have higher end graphic cards so you might even be able to output the maximum resolution of the display. I have connected my iMac to tv's before and although the picture was great for watching movies, reading text was a little more difficult.
yes
According to the link, it is http://www.smartreview.com/lg-electronics-55lb6300-55-inch-1080p-120hz-smart-led-hdtv
definitely has a glare
Most of lg TVs are ips including this one. Matthew
Harmony experience with LG Smart TVs The Harmony Team has confirmed: It is compatible with Harmony IR based remotes It is compatible with Harmony Hub based products It is compatible with Harmony Home products Text entry is possible from Harmony App and Smart Keyboard (Requires Harmony Smart Keyboard unifying receiver) * View the list of validated models. http://support.myharmony.com/en/harmony-experience-with-lg-smart-tv
No. You'll get 15 to 30 feet maximum. It's just a little better than a desktop wireless keyboard and mouse.
Yes. you can take video with this camera. Just push one easy button, you start to take video. It is HD video for 720P, but not for 1080P.
We bought two of these cameras and sent them to our children. They use a battery pack that can be recharged. Our kids said they love their cameras. They both had Fujifilm FinePix cameras before but had lost them.
With this device you download the channel.Please visit the manufacturers site for further information.
Has 1 usb 3.0, 2 usb 2.0, and one 4 pole audio/mic port. I have never seen a sim port on a computer before. By sim, I think you mean SD card, and it does have one slot for those.
I have tried Skype only and it works well for my needs. We use it for an occasionally chat with my wife's family members currently in Europe as well as one of our close friends in Colorado that we don't get to visit often. Can't help with the Hangouts question as I've never looked into using that or set it up. Good luck to you, it is a great product and we're still raving about ours. We showed friends on Easter and it was a big hit.
Hello Jeffrey, the bluetooth works great with my bluetooth hearing aids. So Im sure it will with LE. Kevin
It is wired. I ran the wire underneath my dash and mounted it pretty much in the middle of my dash on my wrangler.
Yes, as long as you have the Bluetooth on and the microphone installed
if its remanufactured it has a 30 day , if its new its a 1 yr. i believe. but not sure. but mine is remanufactured and ive had it 6 mnths. and it works great, im happy its super fast.
No, the Acer C720P has the touch screen.
Newer Tech site does not offer driver download and does not list this model. Amazon affiliate failed to ship me this model, i.e. I do not have this card. I recommend returning this card if it does not work on your PC.
Sorry, this card not bootable from either USB or eSATA.
this box just should the tv staion not cable vision
Yes
No
No it is not. This unit has spring-loaded clamps that attach directly over the factory mirror. Securely without the use of tools.
The computer model HP e15j181nrt, I found it excellent, sound, image, speed in the accomplishment of tasks. The RAM is 8 Giga byte memory and hard drive 1 TERA BYTE. for me it was a great buy for amazon, besides I turned cheaper than buying it in stores HP
Sorry, this HUB does not support PXE booting
Hi P. Farrell, you do not need to install driver for Linux system when using this item.
Yes you can
Same as a car radio but more tolerant of damp conditions
Works real nice in my RZR ATV some of the marine unit do have remote controls not sure about the one check the kenwood site.
No, but should be able to use any Windows compatible external USB GPS.
I have FiOS and this product worked well with it for one day after which this repeater needed to be reset many times daily. I returned this product for a refund and would not recommend it.
No paring needed.
The performance bundle comes with the advanced heart strap. The base model does not include a heart strap.
Standard size. I got mine from my local att store.
I recommend using something better than a 600 -.- keep in mind ur system needs power too, for the best I recommend 875w+
Yes, I believe it is... however, it does not have a weather radio
The WiFi works good
No. It is for the Dell Venue 8. They are a different size.
I bought the Dell Venue 8" tablet a few month back and ordered the Bluetooth case for it, can't say how a Bear Motion Case would fit for the Venue, but I did get the Bear Motion for my first gen Mini ipad and that fit pretty well, only complaint is the magnet on the closure tab keeps sliding out of position.
You can set both of them, the BT volume and the earbuds separately.
I'm not sure as the tv was a gift for someone else.
There are HDMI to HDMI splitters:
When I got this receiver for my son, I knew he would primarily be using it for video games, not music. So, I decided it would be best to find a way to purchase five speakers, so that there would be a full set of directions that sounds could come from. As such, I got him Yamaha NS-SP1800BL 5.1 set of speakers. If I had been more focused on music, and if I was spending more money, I would have looked at the Energy 5.1 Take Classic Home Theater System.
http://faq.yamaha.com/us/en/article/audio-visual/av-receivers-amps/rx/rx-v475_black_u/10655/8144 Mainly, internet radio bookmarks, Spotify, more HDMI inputs, and CINEMA FRONT so I don't need to run wires for rear speakers.
Hi Quentin! This receiver will pass and upscale 4k/60p video via HDMI. Since this receiver won't be the device that is decoding the signal from Netflix (more likely a BD player, Roku, or Smart TV), it will not need to be compatible with this format.
Yes, I use my Harmony remote on mine. Flawless..
Yes, it dose.
It does work that way. Use the usb cable that comes with it and any usb adaptor and it will work. I prefer to use battery power rather than be tied to an electrical outlet.
It comes with a micro USB to standard USB. I was able to connect it to my tablet with the use of a USB on the go cable. It is not very long though. Maybe a foot long. You would need a USB extension to get it from a music stand to the floor.
You could probably adjust and find a way to make it work if you need to do this. I personally never use my left foot in this manner, but I am sure you will be able to work it out. It's a great pedal, you just need to get used to the feel of it, as it doesn't feel like a normal pedal, at first it feels strange that you don't even notice pressing it down, but after a few days it felt great for me! I love this pedal!
If you want to use your factory steering wheel controls with this stereo, in addition to the radio replacement wiring harness you will also need a steering wheel control interface. This will allow you to retain the factory steering wheel controls when replacing the factory radio. Car Amps Online
You can connect - but the speed will be limited to the slowest link in the chain
GT60 is correct this is a 15.6" screen computer, the GT70 are 17.3" which there are currently no 3K screen available.
This model does have 2 open mSATA slots so you can add 2 more to the existing 128GB mSATA drive.
yes - comes with battery and charger of course!
It comes with 2 years MSI Warranty. Best regards, Amuras
It does support 802.11ac, a/b/g, n You can check out the specs detail at Intel page, http://ark.intel.com/products/75442/Intel-Dual-Band-Wireless-AC-3160
No, we don't have 16gb one .
I really don't know. I suggest you talk to someone at Dell/Alienware (find their customer service email) and if they say yes, then go on ahead with your Amazon purchase.
Yes it has both. I don't believe this model has BluRay.
There's no mSATA port in external chassis. Inside the laptop it should have a mSATA bracket to install mSATA SSD. We can verify with MSI next Monday.
The device uses a customer provided thumb drive for storage.
The manual says 100-240V/2.1Amp, 50/60Hz. You can also use a USB charger like one for a samsung phone.
I haven't personally tried it but the description says it does.
In my opinion there are better options out there. Mine the buttons get stuck often and its a slow slow charge
No it does not.
If it has Bluetooth then yes
I gave it as a gift but I'm pretty sure it does. I've not seen any camera that doesn't have a built in or snap on cover. My daughter said it is awesome.
This product is faulty. I ran it through both FAKEFLASHTEST and H2TESTW and 80% of the "supposed" memory were bad sectors leaving only about 8 GB of actual, usable memory. Don't waste your time (or money) and get an actual brand name SD card.
I purchased a Samsung memory card it's seems to be working pretty good .
Yes it will
It does have an AC adaptor
It has a headphone jack according to the operating instructions on Sony's website.
No, this does not have FM Radio. The Samsung blue ray player has numerous apps, can play CDs and blue ray, but no FM radio.
No it did not. You only have one button t h at allows you to pause if you have music playing or pick up/hang up a call.
They have noise isolation there is some difference between isolation and cancellation-see link-http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/44328/htg-explains-how-do-noise-reducing-headphones-work/
No
No, it would not - at least not without some kind of adapter. Your phone has a 2.5mm jack, but these use a 3.5mm connector, so these headphones are too large without a 3.5m to 2.5mm adapter.
Go to this url http://www.ravpower.com/downloads-RP-WD01.html and download the zip file under the software tab and put the file onto your kindle and install.
The actual packaging that the glasses come in lists the FH series as compatible. There's no reason for it not to work as the Samsung sets all use the universal active 3D RF standard (since 2012).
According to the packaging, they'll work with any Samsung TV with the following letter codes in their model numbers: D, E, EH, ES, F, FH and H series Samsung 3D TVs. This means most or all of the Samsung 3D-capable TVs made since 2011. They'll also work with Panasonic active 3D TVs (2012 and up), select Epson projectors (2013 and up) and other manufacturers that adhere to the universal active 3D standard adopted in 2012. Hope that helps.
The battery in my laptop came new and the life is about 8 hours. I hope this helps.
No it doesn't have a keyboard with LED backlight.
You can rename the inputs to anything that you like. You simply type in whatever text you wish to call the inputs. Instead of HDMI 1, HDMI 2, etc., I changed mine to Blu-ray, Cable TV, Computer, Zune. I will likely name my remaining HDMI Roku, as soon as I buy one.
i don't think it is 240V input. It is 120V.
That's weird. My remote works perfectly. Hmm...
Yes it does. CD and DVD all in one.
Not, is Not for note 3 phone
Yes. comes with fan cooler!
yes you do. It's recommended
Yes, you can.
Yes you can one of my best decision I every made when I brought this charger
No
It was and is a piece of crap. It never worked from day one. I returned it and that wonderful Amazon return policy completely refunded my money.
Yes it has several video output ports
9r is closer to a 770
The graphic card is intel HD 4600. Memory 1792 MB
Yes, Here is the link: http://www.amazon.com/MSI-GP70-LEOPARD-010-9S7-175A12-010-17-3-Inch/dp/B00IQ4G8U8/ref=aag_m_pw_dp?ie=UTF8&m=A1U8F3PBP3EB0I
Typically no, this is not usually how the sound is arranged on most TVs. Most of the time if you use one of the connection methods for an external speaker device, the TV will not also activate the TV speakers. That is a feature / function of the TV though, not this or any other external sound device.
It will depend on the game you're playing. Older ones like WoW will be fine, but any new ones you will probably not be able to do that as the GT 840M is a mid level GPU. To play the newer more demanding games on high settings and maintain good FPS as well as record with FRAPS you will want a GTX 870M or 880M, the 860M may cut it but you will probably some log FPS drops.
This listing is for the stock configuration by MSI, it is not customized by us at all. I do see what you are referring to with the 7200RPM listing which is incorrect and we will ask Amazon to change this, it should be 5400RPM as you mentioned you've seen elsewhere including our site. The CPU speed is 2.5GHz-3.1GHz and will adjust its clock speed depending on your use.
I am not 100% sure I know what you mean by slider, but the center is fully adjustable in both the vertical and horizontal positions.
this is not SSD its the usual HDD i.e it spins, there are those with an SSD drive but they cost a lot more close to US$1,000, they are available on amazon
I Don't know. Mine fully charges fine. Could be a bad charger or battery. Contact the seller.
A
I don't remember
i believe it was C that did the trick
The versions are different shapes and I think I got the wrong one
Single, Intel Wireless-N 7260. After a week of travel use (hotels, airports, guest rooms) I find the range more limited than the iPad I also carry but no real problem maintaining a connection with even a moderately weak signal. However like others, I've ordered a 7260 H/T dual band module (about $32) to replace the 7260n. Dis-assembly videos convinced me that the replacement effort should be relatively simple.
yes. power supply was provided
Yes
Yep.
Advertised range is 30ft, but it can go as far as 40-50ft.
I would say resistive but u don't have to press that hard on screen. I really like it!! I barely have to touch it but not like an iPhone per say. Hope that helps!
The warranty is covered by the manufacturer, Micron Crucial, for 3-Years. It will be covered internationally if you have a Crucial branch in your country. If you don't have a branch in your country, then you can always ship it back to them and they will ship you a new unit, but you will pay for the shipping both ways. Thank you. RRI, 03/30/2014
I'm really sure It will work if your pc has sata cables ports and is 64bits pc what I reed before that model. Before installing windows make sure to go to Bios and enable AHCI mode, then your pc will recognize the ssd. Then you can install windows 7 or 8.1 choosing boot from dvd in bios and save all the bios options you selected.
It happen the same to me. Nobody can give me an answer even on Samsung support. It's not an Internet problem.
Go with directly connected to one-connect box and audio back to your receiver via HDMI ARC or SPDIF (Optical) cable. The interface is actually quite nice on the Samsung TV. You could always try to connect it into the receiver and see how it goes. Also if you're using a 4K TV that automatically upconverts the image, I would disable the upconversion on the receiver. I've had better results on my Denon S900W with upconversion disabled interfacing to a UN65HU9000.
Curtis C., Yes you can connect this to the UN65HU8550. Thanks for your interest in Samsung products. --Mr. S
Yup. But tricky to install
This is only for rca models and this is a 7 inch screen not a 10 inch screen
This screen is for the rct6738 you need to order one for the RCT6733W22
No
Yes, easily. I'm not sure you'd get it back on though; it might crack/break on removal. Its just held on by those two round metal ears that protrude thru that little piece of plastic cover; one ear on each side. A pocketknife or screwdriver would easily pry the plastic over the ear; I'm just not sure the plastic would survive, but maybe you don't need it to. I'm really happy with this unit; so handy with both those plugs.
Yes, Soros fine for Hero4. The connection is the same.
I would use double sided carpet tape instead of glue. No drying time, instant results, no mess.
I don't think so. But I don't have a gps in my car.
No. Which is unfortunate. And the radio stations have to reset themselves it seems each time turning on. It did not have an instruction manual. Did you get any instructions?
Line out only
It will work with anything as long as you have a cord to plug in your phone and the other end is for USB part.
No
I've had zero issues making, taking calls or listening to music . I'm really happy with Bose ear phones
Depends Of which country are You TV from, it must match the rea code Of the sek 2500 , You can see with the last 2 letters of both serial Numbers , must be the same , like AG and AG or XG and XG
They work with my 2500 Evolution Kit
No, they don't block out sound as well as some other headphones. Not recommended for mowing the lawn.
No, I don't think so
The sek1000 is the 2013 os while the sek2000 is the 2014 os with a quicker processor
No, it comes with no optical drives.
I have no idea other than to say it likely is. Check the specs on your existing drive, and if they're similar, I'd get it. It's a very good, fast and seemingly reliable drive. Easy to install. Do not buy the WD!
It's a GeForce 860m not a GeForce GT 840m. 2 GB. But I'll tell you straight, I can run almost every game on high settings, but the frame rate does suffer. I don't care that much though. BF4 runs Superb on high settings. It's about a Xbox 360 graphics GPU. It's a good computer. I would recommend it.
Yes. I personally use a Rock Candy Xbox 360 controller for my games.
They have full phone features. Answering, voice control, and the whole nine yards.
You will probably need a dash install kit to make the unit fit properly in you dash that radio can fit in any car
Not out of the box. You have to load a BIOS that has everything Windows needs (see http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/03/review-asus-brings-chrome-os-to-mini-pcs-in-a-low-power-inexpensive-package/) It's none trivial and not entirely stable. And given the specifications, this is a woefully underpowered machine to run Windows. Linux stripped down or Chrome OS? It flies (Mine has 6GB of RAM everything else is stock and I'm a power user. No lag, great performance. I use it as my primary system every day now).
Go to Google and search for contixo replacement glass. It will direct you to a distributor. Warning it has to come from China so it will take about a month.
for plug and play use macminer or asteroid for MAC or use multi miner for super easy on PC. I found that U2 runs best on multi miner! good luck and see you on the moon @bigperrydog
Yes it is compatible with Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon? (2014 model / Generation 2). ADATA ASP900NS38-512GM-C is also my suggestion for X1 ASIN: B00LBEOOP.
The EX2 has the more reliable WD Red NAS hard drives. Worth the extra cost IMHO.
It is a beautiful monitor for general use. The stand is not height adjustable, but I wear progressive bifocals and have absolutely no problem. I would buy it again.
1cm exactly. A little bit bigger on the bottom
You should be maintaining 200-300 FPS easily at 1080p with a GTX 670 in CS:GO. So yes, you will be able to take advantage of 144Hz.
It has gps but no radio.
This one yes!
with android you just can stop and restart the music but wont be able to change the volume
You should not have a problem with these headphones either as they are NOT noise cancelling and as such they have no "white Noise" generator (the technology that interferes with your hearing aid).
Yes, just the controls on the cord will not work with anything except IOS
I find the bass to be excellent. I would say that these headphones have a natural bass, not overwhelming and they are the lightest on my head. The Bose claim is correct. "SoundTrue"
Yes, the generic brand accessories included will work with this camera.
Yes it does. The charge lasts for one hour.
HEllo, Intel GMA HD is included in this Zenbook. Thank You, Krish/DEC Trader
Yeah, it's weatherproof, and still working great after several months outside
No
Corel still offers a perpetual license, they haven't gone to a subscription basis.
Try connecting them via the headphone jack into the auxiliary input.
The cards "Sold by WhiteRock and Fulfilled by Amazon" are COUNTERFEIT. Made in Taiwan and are poor quality, slow cards. I'm in the process of returning two of them.
Yes, it is.
Yes, very fast write speeds for HD video recording
Yes it will
Yes
if your laptop is normal one,should got VGA port,this projector got VGA port also. then you need use an cable which got VGA male to female to connnect both. OR USE HDMI port also can connect laptop to projector.
CCD camera
No it is made in China.
5/16 inch
I returned my split and replaced it with a Kindle Fire, which I love.
yes it does
No
35 1/2" wide, 2 1/4" high, 4 1/2" deep......hope this helps
Dear Maximino, Thank you for your inquiry. Both the HT-CT770 and the HT-CT660 give similar performance. The CT770 is much more compact and can sit on the same shelf as the TV without blocking the image, and it will also be much more flush to a wall if you decide to mount it. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. Regards, Eric Cohen World Wide Stereo
No, only the included subwoofer can be connected wirelessly.
Sound will go out to this TV Sound System when connected to a Sony TV with ARC if you selected on the TV to be on external speakers. However, you may choose the sound to be output on the TV speakers when you select TV speaker instead of external speaker. This may be applied if you have other devices like cable box to be connected on the HDMI IN on this sound system and you just wanted to have it on the TV speaker system. (Pass through) -Ely
Hi K V., Dimensions (Approx.) : 28.375 x 2.875 x 12.25 inches (720 x 72 x 310 mm) Thanks. &gt;joffrey
this is the review for Jabra Revo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXbCFR66yqg This is the review for Sychros 400BT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3dMDSiSWzU Watch these 2 videos and you can compare the two. In terms of sound quality, I would say JBL has the edge on these comparison.
Yes, our stock Work all GSM Network only.no work CDMA
In th3 back
I couldn't say. I use this with an Ipad Air....
Supports one 4K display running at 3840 x 2160 (2160p/60Hz) high resolution when connected to its DisplayPort video output from http://www.shuttle.eu/products/slim/ds81/specification/
If you are asking something akin to performance with a single 8 gig stick versus two 4 gig sticks, it shouldn't really matter. You could do a general Google search on the subject to see if there are any numbers out there at all, but the only way to know if the DS81 differs in any meaningful way from the average machine would be specific testing. I doubt that any has been done.
Each Camera comes with 150 feet of cable and if you don't use all the cameras you can attach the extra cable together for any longer runs but if you need to run further as i did buy extra cable (good system)
This unit is the same as an android Tablet meaning, if there is any indian program that play indian TV then you can download it. Also, there is a program called XBMC which can program to stream indian TV. Search the internet for XBMC and Indian TV and you will learn how to do it. Hope this help.
Yes, we tried it in Germany and xbmc does not block any content. If you run the Netflix app then you would probably need to install a vpn app from the Google Play store. Just download the app and change your vpn country to US.
The US channels are ALL included and free through XBMC. All standard channels like ABC, NBC, TNT, etc. All subscriptions intended channels as well, HBO, STAR, NFL NETWORK, NHL, NBA. Furthermore all entertainment channels Bravo, MTV, National Geographic. Everything for free streaming. Just navigate to the menu US in xbmc and click on the shortcut live streams. You can watch our video on youtube.
Yes a mini hdmi you need mini to reg. hdmi cable you can get for around $3.00 off Amazon
Don't know chinese, but you need to go to setting on Android Jelly Bean OS to change language.
Can be used anywhere.
Did not wrk
Sri, I won't recommend that. They are tight enough but are not meant for active work out.
Yes, the Beats Solo 2.0 work with all Mac products. Enjoy.
No. The lag is still there. There have been no software updates.
This is US plug charger,thanks
The Onyx Studio does not have an Aux port, unfortunately. It's newer/better version, the Onyx, does, along with many other connectivity options.
No, it does not charge over USB. The micro USB is only for service (firmware upgrades). It only recharges via included AC Adaptor.
Harman kardon is the best speaker , greet bass but the battery is little bit no good
I dont have these but someone mentioned that they can be paired to only one reciver at a time so don't know about the multiple locations requirement.
This TRX_HD is using pwoer from normal USB power adapter directly without any battery inside. It is very useful and convenient unit and design.
there's no auto sensing that i can see, you have to explicitly select the hdmi as the active input. Have two here and I switch between computer (DVI) and Xbox (HDMI) with no issues... good luck
Yes, but I have found my iPhone still stitches a panorama together more seamlessly than the TG-3.
Box Contents: TG-3 Digital Camera, Waterproof Instructions, Wrist Strap, LI-92B Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery, USB Cable (CB-USB8), AC Adapter (F-2AC), Quick Start Guide, CD-ROM with Instruction Manual and Olympus Viewer 3 Software, Worldwide Warranty Card
I cannot say with 100% certainty, but the power supply units size is fairly standard. One can assume that the makers of the towers understand this.
10 out of 10 with the included underwater mode.
No
It's plenty. I run an older more power consuming socket, an amd r9 270 and 4 drives. I think you're good.
Sure is. No problems at all.
It should without a problem. Just to be sure though, the bolts are in a 4.5" x2.5", and the entire unit is 6" deep, x 6" wide, and 4" tall.
Yes, this laptop can be expanded to a max of 16GB's of Memory.
Is this a serious question? Do some research. Type in razor blade pro on google... Wanna be spoon fed too?
yes
Windows 7
there already is one installed. Thanks, Computer World
Check the minimum requirements of the software. Most of the time, software manufacturers will also list recommended requirements.
no only large appliances that draw heavy current work on 220 anything else burns out when plugged into a 220
Yes! This will convert hdmi to compnent to component 1080i, 720i n 480i. + audio left n right
PETHRSP provides up/down scaling to adjust the output signal to a resolution compatible with the display. It can convert DVI as well as HDMI input as well.
It should it's the same as the Huion GT-190
Dont know for S6 but it does works on a S5
I needed a wireless Keyboard and mouse so this was not a concern for me, but from what I remember there was no keyboard or mouse with the package, I got mine separate
On the adapter (and in the manual) it states Input: 100-240V~50-60Hz 1.5V / Output:19V==3.42A.
It is a dual core: Intel Core i7-4600U
Yes
Terrible product. I bought it for a light weight travel laptop and it broke w/in 2 weeks of purchase and only used it 2 times. DON'T WAST YOUR MONEY
No, there is not a word processing program but you can always download Open Office and have all the programs you will need for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations and etc. It works fantastic.
Yes it is sold complete
The size of room makes no difference. Settings are super simple: press a button. Quality is good when you consider the size of hidden lens and mike. I photographed a painting and the result was amazingly true.
No
No worry. You do not need to take it out to recharge it.
The tablet has an on screen keyboard
It is not glossy, but it is not matte either. From my experience so far, i would agree with Samsung's labeling of "low reflection."
LOL!! Has anyone talked to Samsung about this??
It's matte. Samsung calls it "Anti-Reflective"
No
Yes. Bluetooth v4.0 is included.
I am so sorry Cynthia,i can't help you because i bought rhis for my son and he has been very disappointed also. He said he has to run it all night to keep it working. He has a newborn and wanted to monitor his daughter as needed but the screen keeps going black. Im embarrassed to have bought it even though my son is pretty tech savvy, i think he's embarrassed also. So sorry again. I will forward your problem to him and see what suggestions he has. Talk soon. Mary
No
I got my money back. Mine stopped working in about a week so it was fairly simply.
To me this sounds like a problem with your motherboard, not your CPU.
16
Yes.
I'm sorry, but I don't know. What I do know is that since my review, I love them even more. They go approximately 30 feet from my Droid Razr Maxx and I have not had to charge them w/in my 2 hour workout. I can't wait to figure out how truly long they last.
They should have a help line. Look on your order on line and there should be somewhere on there with a phone number and they call back really quick
There are a series of hand held mounts for the camera, but the camera doesn't zoom. I've used it as a hand held camera but there are applications that you may find limitations.
I have not weighed
Plastic. I've been trying a lot of things to speed up browsing and had to manually install the first round of updates. Still, it runs like a snail and constantly requires updating.
No it does not
This unit does have a Dvd drive however it is not touch screen.
Yes it comes with the cables.
No. You cannot get cable channels. But you can subscribe to certain nfl, nba, etc channels
Yes, you can. It will follow it.
yes. it will work&#12290;
No this is desktop RAM. You would need SODIMM RAM for a laptop, You would also need to check if it's DDR2 or DDR3.
Yep
According to the specifications at the Samsung site, this has Bluetooth 4.0 LE.
If you have a printer with Internet capabilities. I have an Epson printer that with their app I can print anywhere in the world. Hope that helps.
You will need the USB to lightning cable to connect.
I performed the navigation update the other day. It was free but idk what the update did
Depends whether you have a true double din slot or if it is a 1.5 din
That camera is to heavy this isn't a heavy duty tripod
I use the mini as well,and no issue at all.If there is "this accessories is not supported" ignore it and go the photos menu directly
Yes it does
No you can't see them. It's all black no lights nowhere
Yes
No it will not work with the GoPro Hero basic model.
This tablet will handle sd cards,i personaly dont recomend this tablet for picture viewing because you have to hold it a certain angle or else the screen will be dark
No. It does not.
Yes if left in the day position only. The night camera light will glare off the window and block vision. Also sun glare can affect camera sight. However the camera will work through glass during the day and at night if outside is well lit.
From the carrier
It has both HDMI and DVI port.
It has an external USB minidongle 150Mb/sec, built-in wired NIC, not wireless.
This amp remembers multiple devices. You do not have to re-pair the phone or whatever Bluetooth device you are using. You can reconnect to the amp either manually on your phone or you can power cycle the amp and it will automatically reconnect. If multiple devices have been paired with the amp it will attempt to reconnect to the most recent device and then work its way back.
Yes, though all of the movies won't take advantage of the resolution, as blu rays are limited to 1080p, while this monitor is 1440p.
You can daisy chain two monitors via displayport at maximum supported resolution. If you are willing to go down in resolution you can daisy chain a third.
No it doesn't
Hi Todd! Yes it has an Audio Return Channel (ARC) HDMI out. -Anthony
Hi there! HDMI MHL connection for this Sony Home Receiver is located at the last HDMI port labeled VIDEO IN (MHL).
It is supposed to be able to do so, but I just tried and it did not work. However, I am a beta tester for Acrobat and the Acrobat file was created using a beta version of Acrobat, so I suspect it does work on files created by released versions of pdf programs.
Yes, and I find it is easier to use that Microsoft Word. Select Format, then select Labels, and a long list of Avery labels appears for you to choose from.
Can't remember instructions but I have installed it on three computers
I upgraded from the standard X5 to the standard X7 with no problems.
Yes it has a spreadsheet similar to MS Excel it's called Quattro Pro as well as Presentations similar to PowerPoint.
Im sorry it never work so I return it
Can go to walmart and buy charger. Any brand. I bought an extra for my car at walmart . Any brand as long as same size.
The H3-3D has the USB ribbon cable and works great with the GoPro Hero 4.
Yes
Yes.
Buy the used one from Amazon Warehouse Deals. They are returns, but some or perfect, that is how I got mine, a lot cheaper, Mine is perfect. X5 is the best, has two card slots. It supports 128gb micro sd per slot.
It senses your steps or "cadence" as you run then at the end of your first treadmill run it sakes you if you want to calibrate it , I guess it has you some how enter your pace according to the treadmill , I've only used it on a treadmill a couple times and have never done the calibration but it was pretty close even without doing that.
Yes
No way
I don't think it would work well with the paddle board. It does fine in the rain. It lets water into the compartment but the electronics stay dry enough. If your paddle board get submerged it would not survive.
No and the battery does last long at all. I'd pass if I were you.
Free Shipping!
Yes it is . different is a flymote
No, that is not required. Just as long as you mark your ball where you hit it and where it has landed you will be fine.
Hello, The product doesn't aim at tracking putt distance but more number of putts. It will give you excellent statistics on driving distance irons and woods performance, fairway accuracy greens in regulation, scrambling, sand saves, and number of putts which is what matters more than recording that you sunk a 30-footer. It's a very good recording device and app to review rounds is quite well managed.
The Levin solar powered one has a built in light on the side it is great
The case itself is not heavy but somehow with the iPod is definetly makes the iPod heavier

I know what you mean, but this thing has been incredible when using for Movie and TV programs. I use it a lot in bluetooth mode to listen to streaming music, but the TV and Movie is incredible! In the right setting dialogue is perfect!
That's correct! There's actually no difference between the chips. Mitsubishi service centers are required to use Mitsubishi's given part number for the chip, which is why we list it both ways. Do let me know if you need anything else!
Yes, you can do that all the time, you just have to switch from gps mode to manual with your rc transmitter.
nope there is no hdmi connection however you can buy a graphics cards with a hdmi port which will then allow a hdmi connection
The Ubuntu come perloaded for mine. It can boot both from SD and onboard nand.
NO. It will come with a board only.
That's a good question. I plugged mine in a center supporting wall in the middle of my house and I can get the signal in my neighbor's yard over 200 feet away!
I'm not sure. I keep trying to get mine to work at home. Haven't tried any overseas use. Sorry
No
You have to download the app to your computer, then select the picture, download to your computer. Once it's back on your computer, you can print.
No
it does need access to the internet to work, local network alone won't cut it.
You have to download the app to your computer, then select the picture, download to your computer. Once it's back on your computer, you can print.
Hello Om, it will be free shipping if you buy the item delivery from Eachinedirect or place an order over $35 delivery from Amazon. Do select the free shipping when you place the order.
If you have the usb cord, then yes, it just plugs into the back. Highly recommend.Battery lasts forever.
The power adapter has US plugs only, but states that it can handle input AC:100-240V/0.6A.
The 8 pin seperates into two 4 pin connectors. I know it does not look like it, but it does. Play with it for a couple minutes, you see it.
The 114R soft/firmware was released yesterday (11/21/14) that has the option to record only new episodes of a series.
If you are worried about the distance.... there is no problem at all. I mirror with a laptop having W8 in a long range distance tan six ft. , I have dificulties trying to mirror with my 7-yr old desktop W7. It Works better with W8. Your monitor or TV must have a HDMI input, and better with a USB connector.
and to stay away from SanDisk brand cards. They can cause a lot of DashCams to have issues. Try Samsung or Transcend brand cards.
I don't know that the warranty is ever discussed in the literature
I have a SanDisk Ultra 32gb Class 10 card. Oddly, the camera thinks it's full quite often. I don't worry too much about it -- just format when I get that message.
I don't think they're worth it. Mine stopped working about 6 weeks after I bought them;having only used them 5-6 times. Buttons were tiny and very hard to manipulate. Bought LG earbuds and MUCH happier!
yes it is Sapphire states on it's website that these GPU's need a 750watt or better power supply to run them properly. You read horror stories on every site of people blaming the cards for malfunction blue screens black screens I personally believe their problems have been due to cheap or inadequate power supplies. If you buy one buy a good name brand or just go to Hard OCP web site and they test them, buy one of their recommends you won't go wrong!!
Presumably yes, if all your system components are in perfect working condition, but you must check with the manufacturers of the components to be sure. I make no guarantees on compatibility. If you have a poor PSU, perhaps not. You also need 2 - 8pin connectors to power this card.
Yes
Not that I know of, It's an Airplane adapter w/ 3.5mm audio jacks and input converter jack. here's an image with the 3.5 headset spliter adapter. http://bit.ly/1x2afSq
It Fus-Roh-Does.
yes, it is smart case.
Integrated Graphics
Does not come with a CPU cooler. Nor CPU. Nor memory, case fans, or anything else. Does come with a case shield (for the back I/O panel), an SLI bridge cable (for connecting 2 GPUs), 4 SATA III cables, a manual, and a driver CD (though you're better off downloading current drivers/utilities from Gigabyte's site).
I was using the GTX 780 Ti; I don't think there will be a problem. I'm now using two Titan Xs
The BIOS on this board has tons of features, and I can indeed confirm there are settings for fan speeds in it. I currently have my fans running at max (don't care about noise, etc)
Yes, this cooler fits the CPU that this board accommodates.
About 2 hours is what i get.
The OWC drives are junk, they use outdated SandForce controllers and have serious reliability issues. Take a look at some reviews on macrumors and amazon.
I bought the 480GB and the speeds are pretty awesome read about 6GB (SSD) and the 250 (originally built in) over USB 3.0 about 3GB/S Hope this helps
The cam has an HD setting and with the proper zoom setting I do not see why not
As per Nikon, the dimensions/weight of this camera are: Dimensions (WxHxD): 4.5 x 2.5 x 1.1 in. (114.3 x 63.5 x 27.9mm) Weight: 7.7 oz. (218g) (including battery and memory card)
B-Black. S-Silver. The firmware installed in them are NOT identical. Why?
I have it set about 9 feet away from my apartment door.From that distance,it covers about a 6 foot wide field of view.The video is surprisingly good.
Hi, The dimensions are: Height - 13.4 inches Width - 16.9 inches Depth - 4.5 inches Thank you. Kindest Regards TheSnugg
I would think that you could fit maybe two books that size into it. Even if you couldn't it is still a really nice bag.
The new magnet-free sensor works quite well in my experience. While I used to occasionally get erratic readings with the old magnet-based sensor, that hasn't happened with the new one that I've seen. So I'd say it's just as accurate as the magnet-based sensor if not more so.
I'm only aware of HDMI and no composite or component.
Correct. But check Drobo' website for drives that work best for your Drobo
This will not! One way -&gt; Hdmi to VGA only. I have used IOCrest and HDE VGA to hdmi converters with success. Even micro and mini hdmi converters from them.
The Gps is very good. I'm not sure how to answer your questions other than it seems to work great and kowm how hug it is at all time.
No this is not the latest model. v3.0... The newest model has rechargeable batteries in remote, thumb knob to control the camera on the remote, upgraded motors on copter, training port on the remote, and some other stuff that Im forgetting... BUT it also costs about $140 more. And the newest one is the one I got, but I got it directly from DJI.com. The one I bought off amazon is NOT the newest one...
If you're asking how long it takes to charge this battery, approximately 6-8 hours if you use a 2.1 amp charger
Thank you for your interest. This monitor works with your MBP. But the package includes DVI-D cable and HDMI cable. If you want to connect it with Thunderbolt(MiniDP), you need MiniDP to DP cable. Thank you.
You have three options as I ran into the same problem with my MacBook Air. 1) Hold down the option button when clicking the "scaled" radio button within the display preferences. This may reveal the resolution option. 2) Install ScreenResX and set a custom resolution. While this worked for me, it was a pain and I don't recommend it. http://www.madrau.com/ 3) Buy a mini display port to display port cable. When I bought this for $10 on amazon, plugging it in simply worked right out of the gate. No tricks necessary. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C7RJQPY/
This does not support HBO Go.
It's not clear what you mean. If you mean can you connect it to your computer to transfer files, then yes, that's what the micro USB port is for. If you are asking if there is a full size usb-A port to plug in a printer or flash drive, then no there is not.

Just fired up YouTube, cranked up a video and set it to 720 and it played and looked fine.
Yes Intel ESB2 SATA with Western Digital Drive
At the moment you can only use the Nova Camera app. Updates to the Nova Camera app will be released periodically.
I would say no. I bought this to fit a Lenovo Yoga 2. Per the measurements of my laptop & this sleeve, it should have fit but it was too snug. I would measure my laptop very carefully before purchasing.
My surface pro 3 fits into it no problems.
Not really. My mbair 13 fits very very snugly and it was a struggle to slide it in when I first got it. Now it's going in easier but there's no way I can see it going in with a case.
This unit supports 2 SATA hard drives. Each hard drive can be up to 4TB. Record time depends on quality settings, (resolution, frame rate etc), motion detect or full time etc. So I cannot tell you how much record time you will get. I am not concerned about buying from a non-Hikvision dealer. For what a dealer charges I can afford to replace the unit should it fail. BTW, I never buy extended warranties either. :)
Walnut models are magnetic that they can bind with you iPad but graphite do not have this function
I'm really disappointed with the screen. It's very dark no matter how high I set the brightness level. Not a good movie watching experience. Seriously considering returning it.
Yes, it is.
The one I got was US market with the correct hologram sticker on the box.
Yes. That's the way I mounted them.
It does have an optical input ability. The year is 2014, not sure of the month - June does come to mind. I you need me to verify the month let me know and I can check in a few hours.
I am 67 and have crummy close vision - I can read the numbers when running - no squinting! I chose this watch because it is the smaller version for a smaller person. There are larger Forerunner 15's for men. I love the watch - fun keeping track of my distances and routes. Good luck!
That's about what I get.
I don't know, to tell you the truth it arrived with the wrong cords so I never got it running nor did they send the right cords. Try a name brand!
Yes! I previously answered that it does not have a sleep timer but I just found that it does have one.
Hi If you purchase it from us, we will offer 1 year warranty for free. Thank you.
Yes. It has Vesa mounting options.
13 and a half inches tall by 31 and a half inches wide
Yes it comes with a power cord and HDMI cable
Yes, that's what I like about Nikon
Yes, it does support DSD file format.
That is incorrect. The processor is an Intel i7 4710HQ @2.50 GHz
When you first turn on the computer, Windows asks to set it up and personalize the system. If you have a Microsoft account like hotmail, live or outlook.com email you can enter it at that time. If not, you can choose local account and skip this step. There should be an option after selecting local account to log in without a Microsoft account.
It is RAID 0 which is what MSI calls "Super RAID 2" when they are using 3 SSD's in RAID 0. There is really no such thing as "RAID 2"
it isn't very loud
You will have to go place that work on computer to update computer unless you have the knowledge your self the cost is not that much and if you go to the right shop it will done right.
Works perfectly with all of my families Apple products including the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus
Nicaragua like all Central America lack from home addresses. People in most latinoamerica use landmarks or point of interest. So if you are going someplace look for a land mark then you go 1 block south/north etx. To get there. On the other hand if it's a business most like it it's there. Example holiday inn or budget rent a car are there and you will get directions with no problem!!!
Yes it is.
Verify bluetooth is enabled on your device (tablet/smartphone). This is what the instructions booklet has...Turn on the speaker, it goes into bluetooth mode automatically, the blue indicator flashes quickly (this is hard to see in normal lite room); The blue indicator flashes slowly after connection with one device. My iPhone saw the device but took a minute to connect. Let me know if you would like me to copy the booklet for you, would just need an email address if you want it. Later, AS
Absolutely. It does have WIFI
I pretty sure will fit because is for tab 4.. 8 inches but if you not 100% sure with my answer you can ask at the seller....
Did you follow the instructions on that smsll paper that came with it?
Yes, I have a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, 10.1 and it fits perfectly. I recommend
No it will not. A tight fit just as is.
we put a screen saver over the screen,and so far we have not had any problems with the keyboard scratching the tablet.
Camera support ONIF protocol.
Devices still must be safely removed. It does allow up to four devices to be plugged in and activate the switch when needed.
Yes... Since its not a RAID enclosure, you can copy from one drive to the other from within. You get normal SATA 3G speeds when doing this.
I have this enclosure. IDE will not work with it. There are adapters on the market but they will not fit in this case. SATA drives slide in and when the door closes it presses them in tightly to make a secure connection. No room for adapters at all.
Yes, but it's really sloow!
Biggest difference is there is no netflix on the new box.
Intel. Apple cannot build a system of this caliber and they have been using Intel on all their newer Macs. I haven't seen anything regarding Apple on any specs. This has the 4th Gen Intel Core i7-4710MQ processor. It may have been a fluke or typo.?
Yes it will, ive done it
That will not work with chrome os
64 bit
Yes. The PC came with USB keyboard and mouse.
It shouldnt take that long for a tablet to charge at all a hour at the most..
I believe I found one on ebay when researching this product--http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/281496504354?lpid=82&chn=ps
Keyboard, YES! Sorry, I dont know about the monitor.
It does have a video card, a 256MB DMS-59 Card with dual monitor capability. It should be able to run the program. Best, iCompNY
I just bought this model at Sam's Club and after a software update Amazon Prime is available.
Yes
No
China
All up to 1866 mhz
I had 10 HDDs connected and every time it boots one or two drives were missing, I RMA'd it and tried another one, same exact issue. This board is having serious SATA issues. Got rid of it and went with different board.
Yes mine was in a sealed box and the board was in the plastic. And it was freaking beautiful, amazing board
depends on what features you are looking for , but generally speaking i am biased to asus product (i recommend them). i bought this specifically because it has the new m.2 ssd slot (plugs directly into the bottom of the MOBO...very cool and fast with no extra cables)
Red
Yes
Installed was 5400 RPM HDD - I swapped it for my own Mushkin 120 GB SSD - have to remove the bottom cover with some screws covered by rear rubber feet. Not too easy, but not too bad either - just take care and not break the plastic removing the bottom.
They are the same, I believe.
Could you please explain better. Not sure what you are asking?
Yes, I've purchased one recently and it comes with the McAfee Antivirus software, free for 60 days. I bought it back in May. It's about to expire. Due to cost of today's Antivirus software I will probably search for a free version. Microsoft has Microsoft Essentials which is free and works pretty well.
Hello Armando, HomeMonitor requires a minimum upload and download speed of 0.5Mbps for live view and it's recommended that the camera be no more than 15 meters from your router so the camera has enough signal strength and bandwidth to upload the video. Please let us know if you have any more questions. Network Camera Store
It is not battery operated. It can be powered by the included power adapter or via PoE (Power over Ethernet), if you have a PoE capable switch. I am using mine with PoE since I have it mounted outside the house and Ethernet is more stable, secure and provides a faster connection to the network. Besides, using PoE requires only one cable be run to the outside (no separate power cable required.)
Yes it does. Has push alert to that can email/push photos or video on a triggered camera.
Yes.
Yes it does.
I was glad to find a good choice of laptop with a DVD/CD player.... but this is not a Blu ray player. This computer will only play DVD/CD in its original state.
It seems to be about the same. Definitely not slower, but not significantly faster then the oem cable
Yes. The Anker is about 5 x 9 x 14 mm. The official Lightning is about 4 x 8 x 12 mm.
Approx. 2inches
Yes, but only for exactly 1 microsecond after you open the box....It wasnt meant to be a permanent feature
It's an android 4.2
I Think Its The Maxwell.
That was the root cause of my bought of this product. I have tested and it rocks...
Board accepts socket 1150 CPUs. The i5-3570K is an 1155 Socket CPU, so will not work.
Not really sure what your question meant but motherboards don't come with power supplies. Computer cases come with or without power supplies. So, no, this motherboard does not come with a power supply. I bought a corsair 500w model. Which PS depends on how many things you add to the board ie how many graphics cards, harddrives, dvd burner, blueray burner. The PS will have to power all of the things you put on it. The more stuff, the bigger the PS. 500 watt was plenty for me with just basic stuff.
As I understand it, it is only an adapter. Your equipment must be able to adjust to the voltage at the source. My laptop is dual voltage so it worked fine.
Yes, there is a monthly fee for access to the Web Portal so you can track the location of the Take-Along Tracker 24/7. The first month of service is included with your purchase. Monthly service ranges from $16.34 to $30 per month depending on the plan you select.
Hi James, yes, you can control the camera using your smartphone using the app Smart Remote Embedded. Thanks_Mitch
All cameras will be more limited in a dark environment, but for a small camera, this one does very well in lower light.
I don't know how
It doesn't yet. They are making one that does.
It does not come with a hood. Generally speaking, lenses of this focal length do not benefit much from hoods, but Canon does have a hood for this lens if you want to look cool. By the way, I LOVE this lens. Not only does it address a host of needs for the amateur photographer, but it has one of the elements (UD glass) in it that make the L series so extraordinary. It is also the best lens I have found for doing video with a 7D in close quarters like a room.
Just got mine in the mail and it fits and works awesome.
No
I received 1.1 but it depends on when the order was placed really
That should not be a problem where the hardware is concerned. However, keep in mind your partitioning scheme. You will want to do a GPT partition table (as opposed to MSDOS partition table) with any partitions over 2TB. How you go about that will depend on the OS that you are using.
0 votes Hi Lois. The WRT1900AC is a powerful stand alone router without modem capabilities. Routers with modem capabilities are often called gateways and typically aren't as full featured as a stand-alone router.
Fairly easy. Good support is available from Linksys/Belkin --They have special support for this product.
At its heart the WRT1900AC could be 4x4, the hardware supports it, but the default WRT1900AC firmware self-optimizes and uses the 'best' three antennas at any time for transmitting and receiving packets in order to decrease connectivity issues and boosting signal strength. I do believe the OpenWRT firmware has made it a pure 4x4 router, but good luck finding 4x4 capable adapters outside of the enterprise product realm.
Yes it is GSM phone.
absolutely. its very fast and smooth. however, the biggest downfall is android kitkat on it. read up on the downfalls and workarounds of kitkat. other than that, its a heck of a buy and well woth the investment.
No mounting holes. I wanted to mount it to a wall but there's nothing there. But if u decide to secure it to a table you can with the security cable
WIRED mouse and keyboard, yes. Speakers, no.
use something and poke it it will bounce right out :) or just use your finger nail to push it down
Its garbage always freezes up
What kind of screen are you asking about?
The spacer is used for systems to make the drive a 9.5mm, so the 7mm will fit in the computer more tightly. In most laptops all you would need to do is remove the hard drive and screw the SSD in with the same place the HDD was stored. Please call us directly at 1-800-336-8915 if you have any other questions or concerns, as we do have free tech support.
It works on my Galaxy Nexus, which is an earler version of Samsung Galaxy III, and on my Nexus 7 2013 tablet. I can not answer specifically for the S6.
Yes it should no problem.
Your legs stick out a good distance in front of your flat screen, so I would think it would.
accoriding microSD in Macbook
The video is stored on locally on the Micro SD Card. The camera must be connected to a computer to retrieve the recordings. The camera does NOT connect to the network.
yes you can but you cannot record with the DVR while plugged into a computer. when plugged into a wall outlet you can charge and record at the same time.
Well we have a iPad, iPhone 4, and a iPhone 5s , I think the iPod nano has the same plug as the iPhone 4 and if it does then yes it will work
I'm not sure but I believe it does. the 1 I have charged a android tablet and a iPhone so I'm assuming it wouldn't be a problem for a Nokia phone.
Simply answered, yes. It comes with a 3-in-1 adapter. It is quite an amazing tool.
If purchasing brand new, Bitmain provides 90 day warranty, and I can tell you my personal experience with bitmain on warranty items is pretty straightforward and hassle free!
Upgrade your PSU 1300-1500watts
Works perfectly with my galaxy tab pro 10.1. Definitely suggest this. Don't think it comes with the wall outlet brick though.
If you're going to be reading a lot, I'd go with the 8.4. I found that the 10.5 is just too cumbersome for reading. I read a lot, so I ended up returning the 10.5 and purchased the 8.4. Very happy with it.
In happens with Amazon. Basically, if you receive a damaged package or a completely improperly packaged breakable, fragile item, then take a photo of the problem, do not open any received items and request an exchange. Make their warehouse management do their jobs next time (like training the trainable or firing the non-trainable warehouse staff).
I think the size is just right. The extra screen space is very welcome when watching video or looking through e-magazines. You get used to the new size quickly. I'm very pleased.
Yes. You can install programs like any other computer with a thumb drive, external DVD drive, or by downloading them. I installed Rosetta stone from DVD and Microsoft office pro 2013 by downloading them.
With nothing installed it shows 93 GB free of 113 GB.
We are using QuickBooks Premier 14 with no problems.
Much thinner, bigger screen size, better pen, better trackpad on the type cover, kickstand that is more flexible / more angles.
There is a USB port on the unit itself no need to remove to charge the phone
No.
Yes
No carrying bag, just charger.
The HDMI (and most of the other ports) is on the back.
It works very well with MS products. If one tries to run very large Excel spreadsheets using Open Office 4.1.1 it will not load them, but this might be the case with any computer - no experience beyond the E3-111-C5GL trying to do this. Internet access is fine.
Yes, you may download apps like instagram from Google Play Store
Yes, resolution isn't all that great though
Yes, that is exactly what I use it for. Just have to enable SPDIF passthrough in the settings... very simple.
we ship the order in one-two bussiness days, it will take about 7-15 working days to arrive.
I use mine with the iPhone 6 Plus, the biggest iPhone. It works perfectly!
Yes, you have the option of recording audio and video together.
No, you have to buy an external USB DVD/Rom. The $25 Samsung USB 2.0 drive is a nice choice.
Yes, you should have no problem with this machine.
mine does not initially, but i can change it in custom mode
Yes
15min / GB in HD
It only changes color when you are running out of battery. You can check out some reviews of the speaker: http://www.techwalls.com/logitech-x300-wireless-stereo-speaker-review-beautiful-sound/ http://www.cnet.com/products/logitech-x300-mobile-wireless-stereo-speaker/
I haven't used it for that yet but I'm sire it will work for that. Look up best Bluetooth speakers on Google. IThis speaker is on the best list of pc magazine
Yes it does. But it's only a USB chord, you need to get an adapter for the wall separately.
The charger size is approximately 5" x 2" the connector is about 1/4 size in diameter.
yes, but it depends on the motherboard, the fabricants are making bios updates to support this new processors. here is a list of motherboards that support it at the moment. http://thepcenthusiast.com/list-of-8-series-motherboards-compatible-with-intel-devils-canyon/
If you are doing any type of video editing I would suggest an i7 because of the hyperthreading. But, don't sell the i5-4690k short it's still a very good processor especially for gaming. It will still handle most editing just not as well. If you are more focused on editing I'd wait and go for a 4790k. i5-4690k is amazing for gaming though.
Greetings, Yes, the AC-DC power supply adapter and AC power cord are included. Best regards, MITXPC
I'm a big fan! Does that count? Seriously, though, there's no fan inside the box. It runs cool enough (at least my Celeron box does) that a fan isn't necessary.
A micro USB will prevent it from closing. Your best option is to get a micro SD card with 8-32gb and use it. Assuming I'm on the same page as you by you using your micro USB as a memory storage.
Yes, VGA and HDMI. This PC doesn't have a DVI port but you can get cheap HDMI-DVI adapters.
yes, can run.
Yes unit has cd/dvdrw
Only if you are very very small and can fit inside it. :-)
Not sure how to answer your question here. I know when I mounted the router on the wall I got better results then it sitting on the desk. I pointed the arms in the direction of devices with wi fi and no problems. Does not drop like last router. I have at least 17 devices that run through it. I hope this helps.
It runs adobe reader and i downloaded some normal piano sheet music and it displayed good ,now whether it will work in direct sunlight is going to depend on the angle it is being viewed at, IF sun is a issue, get a anti glare screen protector and that should help
If your TV have HDMI port and you have special micro-HDMI cable, you can connect them and watch on your TV. It is android system. Thus, if you buy a google chromecast, you can watch nextflix and youtube wireless.
Its more "Water Resistant" than water Proof. If your to fully submerge it, there is a very very high chance you will damage it. Either way, when it does get water in it the sound starts muffling out, so I don't think you would want it running under water anyway. Its more splash proof than anything else.
Hold down the power button until the blue light goes off. The buttons are sort of stiff so it takes a marginal amount of effort.
I doubt it's normal. My speaker has nothing moving or rattling inside. It's been dropped more than a couple of times during the last few outings and I just tried shaking it really vigorously and it doesn't cause anything to move.
Almost 7 oz with the strap to carry it.
I really don't know mine works better plugged in
It has a full version of office and a free antivirus that just had to be updated
The way I have mine mounted takes about 14 inches of depth. You could mount it a bit closer to the edge and fit it on a 13 inch desk, but the edge of the drawer will stick out a bit from the edge.
